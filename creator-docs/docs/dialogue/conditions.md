# Conditions

How to have your character see the state of the game and opponents

---

The following is a list of conditions that can be used for cases.

## Variable Tests

Variable Test conditions check to see if a variable (such as `~clothing~` or `~name~`) has a certain value.
Variable tests can be added by selecting _Game > Variable Test (+)_ in the conditions editor.

Many new variables have been added that are intended to be used with variable tests;
in certain cases, they can act as more flexible substitutes for existing simple conditions (below).

A case can have any number of variable tests attached.

Tests with the following variables have special shortcuts within the CE (as of version 3.5):

| Variable Tested         | CE Name                      | Description
|-------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------
| `~background~`          | Game > Background            | What background has been selected?
| `~background.location~` | Game > Inside/Outside        | Does the current background depict an indoors or an outdoors setting?
| `~clothing.position~`   | Clothing > Clothing Position | What type of clothing is currently being removed (e.g. `upper`, `lower`, `both`, etc.)?

## Table Filter / Count Conditions

Table Filter conditions count how many characters at the table fit certain criteria, such as tags, gender, and clothing status.

These conditions can be accessed by selecting _Table > Filter (+)_ in the conditions editor.

# Documentation Night at the Inventory

Your Central Hub for Developing SPNatI Characters!

---

## Getting Started

Are you dying to see your waifu / husbando in SPNATI? Do you have an uncontrollable urge to show us plebs who Best Girl _really_ is? Well, this is the right place.

All of the characters you play against in SPNATI, and all of the associated artwork, dialogue, epilogues, and so forth that come with them were made by contributors just like you. This project is a labor of love, and we greatly appreciate you taking the time to participate!

## At a Glance

So, what makes up a character?

The 'core' of a character is made up of two things:

 - **Dialogue:** The text you read in game, and all of the chatter between the characters during rounds.

 - **Art:** The finished sprites and animations that accompany your character's dialogue, as well as the "modeling" assets that said sprites are generated from.

There are lots of other things you can add to a character, of course, such as epilogues, but for a basic character you should aim to work on these two areas first and foremost.

## What Else?

Once you're comfortable with your dialogue and art, you can look to adding more bells and whistles, or submit your character for Testing and later Sponsorship.

 - **Advanced:** Additional tidbits that aren't mandatory for a "completed" character. Also includes technical info.

 - **Policy:** The official policy guidelines laid out by the SPNatI Moderation Team. These are the requirements for adding your character to the main game.

Even though the requirements for getting a character added to the main game may seem daunting, it's really quite doable if you take it one step at a time.

## Playing The Game Offline

Whether you're serious about developing or just want to prowl the lost characters of SPNatI's history, you'll want to download the game's *Git Repository*, better known as the *Offline Version*. This contains the entirety of SPNatI's history, a fancy way of saying it's a big honkin' download.

The repository [can be found here](https://gitgud.io/spnati/spnati).

In oder to properly keep everything up to date, you’ll need to [set up your GitHub client](/docs/basics/githubdesktop.html).

To properly run the game on your own computer, [you’ll need this tool to help you play offline](/docs/basics/playingoffline.html). You can find it in your folder once you’ve downloaded your repository. Also included is a workaround to allow you to play in Firefox.

[You can also directly download a bundle with the characters and tools you want](https://spnati.net/bundles/download-bundles.html). However, you cannot update these bundles when new content is added, only re-download them.

## About the Docs

This documentation is intended to cover everything you need to know for SPNATI character development and creation.

It's still very much a work in progress, and we're always looking for people who can help out with writing guides and docs!

Unofficial but still very helpful guides are included in the **User Submitted** section. Feel free to submit your own! [A guide on proper formatting is available here](/docs/advanced/writingguides.html).

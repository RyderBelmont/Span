# Getting Started

Are you dying to see your waifu / husbando in SPNATI?
Do you have an uncontrollable urge to show us plebs who Best Girl _really_ is?
Well, this is the right place.

All of the characters you play against in SPNATI, and all of the associated
artwork, dialogue, epilogues, and so forth that come with them were made by
contributors just like you.
This project is a labor of love, and we greatly appreciate you taking the
time to participate!

## At a Glance

So, what makes up a character?

The 'core' of a character is made up of two things:

 - **Dialogue:** The text you read in game, and all of the chatter between
 the characters during rounds.

 - **Art:** The finished sprites and animations that accompany your character's
 dialogue, as well as the "modelling" assets that said sprites are generated from.

There are lots of other things you can add to a character, of course, such as
epilogues, but for a basic character you should aim to work on these two areas
first and foremost.

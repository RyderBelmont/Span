# KKL Alpha Transparency

How to make pieces of your character disappear

---

When loading a code from a file (**not** from the Import/Export tab), KKL will first look for `key=value` pairs, separated by '\n' (one per line).
These key-value pairs can be used to specify alpha transparency for different parts of a character's body.

The last non-whitespace line of the file should contain the actual code to import.
Specifying alpha transparency is only supported for single character ('**') imports.

Note that the keys used are the property / attribute(?) names used internally by Kisekae,
so many of them are in a mix of Japanese and English.

Alpha transparency values are specified as integers ranging from 0 (invisible) to 255 (fully transparent).

!!! note
	The CE uses this method automatically, presented as a series of checkboxes. In other words, this is super advanced stuff, and most people will never need to do it manually.

#When selecting the characters to play the game, the first line will always play, then it randomly picks from any of the start lines after you commence the game but before you deal the first hand.
start=0-calm,It's "Shaggy." Nobody calls me "Norville."


#Items of clothing should be listed here in order of removal.
#The values are formal name, lower case name, how much they cover, what they cover
#Please do not put spaces around the commas.
#"Important" clothes cover genitals (lower) or chest/breasts (upper). For example: bras, panties, a skirt when going commando.
#"Major" clothes cover underwear. For example: skirts, pants, shirts, dresses.
#"Minor" clothes cover skin or are large pieces of clothing that do not cover skin. For example: jackets, socks, stockings, gloves.
#"Extra" clothes are small items that may or may not be clothing but do not cover anything interesting. For example: jewelry, shoes or boots with socks underneath, belts, hats. In the rest of the code, "extra" clothes are called "accessory".
#If for some reason you write another word for the type of clothes (e.g. "accessory"), other characters will not react at all when the clothing is removed.
#What they cover = upper (upper body), lower (lower body), other (neither).
#The game can support any number of entries, but typically we use 2-8, with at least one "important" layer for upper and lower (each).

#Notes on dialogue
#All lines that start with a # symbol are comments and will be ignored by the tool that converts this file into a xml file for the game.
#Where more than one line has an identical type, like "swap_cards" and "swap_cards", the game will randomly select one of these lines each time the character is in that situation.
#You should try to include multiple lines for most stages, especially the final (finished) stage, -1. 

#A character goes through multiple stages as they undress. The stage number starts at zero and indicates how many layers they have removed. Special stage numbers are used when they are nude (-3), masturbating (-2), and finished (-1).
#Line types that start with a number will only display during that stage. The will override any numberless stage-generic lines. For example, in stage 4 "4-swap_cards" will be used over "swap_cards" if it is not blank here. Giving a character unique dialogue for each stage is an effective way of showing their changing openness/shyness as the game progresses.
#You can combine the above points and make multiple lines for a particular situation in a particular stage, like "4-swap_cards" and "4-swap_cards".

#Some special words can be used that will be substituted by the game for context-appropriate ones: ~name~ is the name of the character they're speaking to, but this only works if someone else is in focus. ~clothing~ is the type of clothing that is being removed by another player. ~Clothing~ is almost the same, but it starts with a capital letter in case you want to start a sentence with it.
#~name~ can be used any time a line targets an opponent (game_over_defeat, _must_strip, _removing_, _removed, _must_masturbate, etc).
#~clothing~ can be used only when clothing is being removed (_removing and _removed, but NOT _must_strip).
#~player~ can be used at any time and refers to the human player.
#~cards~ can be used only in the swap_cards lines.
#All wildcards can be used once per line only! If you use ~name~ twice, the code will show up the second time.

#Lines can be written that are only spoken when specific other characters are present. For a detailed explanation, read this guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/spnati/comments/6nhaj0/the_easy_way_to_write_targeted_lines/
#Here is an example line (note that targeted lines must have a stage number):
#0-female_must_strip,target:hermioine=happy,Looks like your magic doesn't help with poker!




#EXCHANGING CARDS
#This is what a character says while they're exchanging cards.
#The game will automatically put a display a number between 0-5 where you write ~cards~.
#These lines display on the screen for only a brief time, so it is important to make them short enough to read at a glance.

#stage-specific lines that override the stage-generic ones
swap_cards=calm,Like, I need ~cards~ cards, man.
swap_cards=calm,Like, ~cards~ cards, please.
swap_cards=calm,Like, pass me ~cards~ new cards.
swap_cards=calm,Wow. Groovy. It's like you read my mind.




#HAND QUALITY
#These lines appear each round when a character is commenting on how good or bad their hand is.
#The lines written here are examples only and should be replaced.

#stage-specific lines that override the stage-generic ones
good_hand=happy,Dig this, Daddy-o. It's a real gas!
good_hand=happy,The only thing better than these cards would be a chocolate covered eggplant burger.
good_hand=happy,Like, wow!
okay_hand=calm,I can dig these cards, man.
okay_hand=calm,Like, this is a decent hand.
okay_hand=calm,Eh.
okay_hand=calm,What a close shave. That was almost a catastrophe.
bad_hand=scared,Like, are these cards haunted?
bad_hand=scared,I'm scared, man.
bad_hand=scared,Man, this hand gives me, like, the heebie jeebies.
bad_hand=sad,Great, but next time, please don't do me any favors.

-3-bad_hand=sad,We are panicked, panicked, PANICKED!




#SELF STRIPPING
#This is the character says once they've lost a hand, but before they strip.

#stage-specific lines that override the stage-generic ones
must_strip_winning=loss,We have to remain calm.
must_strip_normal=loss,And I would have gotten away with it if it hadn't been for these meddling cards.
must_strip_normal=loss,Here we go again.
must_strip_losing=loss,Today is tied for the most terrifying day of my life.
must_strip_losing=loss,Some strip poker game this turned out to be.

1-stripping=strip,If he's a Phantom Shadow, how come he leaves footprints?
1-stripping=strip,I'm not even sure what you would want my socks for.


#losing shirt
2-stripped=sad,Dirty feet?
2-stripped=sad,Is it even safe to be barefoot when there could be ghosts around?

3-stripped=sad,I'll be all right just as soon as I have six or seven sandwiches.
3-stripping=strip,Look. I know I'm not handsome, but I'm no monster.
3-stripping=strip,Well, here goes.


#losing undershirt

4-stripping=strip,When the going gets tough, what do we do?


#lost all clothing
5-stripped=sad,Bury our heads in the sand.
5-stripping=strip,Like all that's missing is some lighting and a spooky organ.

-3-stripped=calm,And there's the organ.




#OPPONENT MUST STRIP
#These lines are spoken when an opponent must strip, but the character does not yet know what they will take off.
#Writing different variations is important here, as these lines will be spoken about thirty times per game.
#The "human" versions of the lines will only be spoken if the human player is stripping.

#stage-specific lines that override the stage-generic ones
male_human_must_strip=disinterested,Like, not my thing, man. But better you than me.
male_must_strip=disinterested,Like, not my thing, man. But better you than me.
female_human_must_strip=interested,I'm looking forward to this more than I would a giant sandwich. Okay, maybe not.
female_human_must_strip=happy,I didn't lose! I didn't lose!
female_must_strip=interested,I'm looking forward to this more than I am a giant sandwich. Okay, maybe not.
female_must_strip=happy,I didn't lose! I didn't lose!

-3-male_human_must_strip=calm,Let's go, ~name~. I refuse to be the only salami on this sub.

-2-male_must_strip=mast,This doesn't really do much for my situation.




#OPPONENT REMOVING ACCESSORY
#These lines are spoken when an opponent removes a small item that does not cover any skin.
#Typically, characters are fine with this when they are fully dressed but less satisfied as they become more naked.
#Note that all "removing" lines are NOT spoken to human players. Characters will skip straight from "6-male_human_must_strip" to "6-male_removed_accessory", for example.

#stage-specific lines that override the stage-generic ones
male_removing_accessory=disinterested,I'm gonna go grab a snack while you do this.
male_removed_accessory=snacking,Like, it's been way too long since I've had something to eat.
female_removing_accessory=calm,Every mystery needs to start off somewhere.
female_removed_accessory=sad,And I guess your ~clothing~ is going to count as "somewhere."


#fully clothed
0-male_removed_accessory=snacking,It may be early, but it's never too early for a snack!
0-female_removing_accessory,filter:tomboy=shocked,Zoinks!

5-male_removed_accessory=snacking,Like, I waited on purpose to lose my shirt before eating these. I didn't want to make a mess.

-3-male_removed_accessory=snacking,You have to be taking off more than your ~clothing~, man. I'm down to my bananas here!

-2-male_removed_accessory=forefit,Like, only your ~clothing~, man? If you haven't noticed, I'm out of clothes. And worse!

-1-male_removed_accessory=snacking,Time to refuel. At the rate your're stripping, we're gonna be here a while.




#OPPONENT REMOVING MINOR CLOTHING
#Minor pieces of clothing don't reveal much when removed, but probably indicate more progress than accessory removal.

#stage-specific lines that override the stage-generic ones
male_removing_minor=disinterested,Like, it's time for another snack. I'll be right back.
female_removing_minor=interested,If nothing else, I think you are about to remove a potential clue.
female_removed_minor=happy,Just another step towards solving "The Mystery of ~name~."
female_removed_minor=happy,Step on it, ~name~!
female_removed_minor=calm,Swell. I'll wait here and when you're ready to start playing for real, send me a telegram.

#OPPONENT REMOVING MAJOR CLOTHING
#Major clothing reveals a significant amount of skin and likely underwear.
#However, as we don't know if the opponent is taking off the top or the bottom, we can't presume that nice abs are showing; maybe she took of her skirt before her shirt.

male_removing_major=happy,Time to unmask this villian.

#OPPONENT MASTURBATING
#When an opponent is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must pay the penalty by masturbating in front of everyone.
#The "must_masturbate" line is for just before it happens, and the "start_masturbating" line immediately follows.
#The "masturbating" line will be spoken a little after the opponent has started but before they climax.
#When the opponent climaxes, your character will say the "finished_masturbating" line.

#stage-specific lines that override the stage-generic ones

#SELF MASTURBATING
#If your character is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must masturbate.
#These lines only come up in the relevant stages, so you don't need to include the stage numbers here. Just remember which stage is which when you make the images. The "starting" image is still in the naked stage.
#The "finished_masturbating" line will repeat many times if the game is not yet finished. This plays as opponents comment on the how good their hands are.

All opponents (except reskinned_opponents) now reside in the main
opponents directory. This directory merely exists to stop the
Character Editor from crashing. Simply add

  <include-status>offline</include-status>

to config.xml (between <config> and </config>) to make all offline
opponents available on the individual character selection screen.

Alternative opponents are existing characters in new outfits. However, unlike reskinned opponents, which share resources (like epilogue images or nudity images) with their main version counterparts, alternative opponents have differences that prevent them from sharing a dialogue file. For example, the first three alternative opponents have a different number of clothing layers. Because of this difference, alternative opponents are standalone and self-contained.

The dialogue files of alternative opponents are heavily based on their main version counterparts. However, because they are separate, it is possible that these will diverge over time as one version is updated and the other isn't. Such is the fate of alternative opponents.

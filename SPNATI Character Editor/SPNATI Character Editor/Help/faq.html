            <h1>Why won't any images appear in the Dialogue Tester or the right preview panel?</h1>
            <p>Somehow you activated the hidden "no images" setting.</p>
            <p>Quit the application and open File Explorer to %appdata%/SPNATI. Edit settings.ini and change the 0 on the third line to a 1.</p>

            <h1>Why are one or more of my poses not appearing in the dropdown for dialogue lines?</h1>
            <p>To avoid lines with missing images, the dialogue editor will not allow you to select a pose that does not have a corresponding image for every selected stage.</p>
            <p>For instance, if you have stages 0-4 checked and want to use the "happy" pose, 0-happy.png, 1-happy.png, 2-happy.png, 3-happy.png and 4-happy.png must <strong>all</strong> exist in the character's folder.</p>

            <h1>Why isn't my character showing up anywhere (e.g. the Open menu, target lists, Dialogue Tester, etc.)?</h1>
            If your character isn't in the list, one of their xml files is likely invalid. Check errorlog.txt for more details. You should never run into this issue when editing characters exclusively in the editor, but this can happen if people manually edit the xml.

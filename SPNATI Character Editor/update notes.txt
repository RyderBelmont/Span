* Minor bug fixes

1.0
* First official release

Changes from beta
-----------------
* Better compatibility with make_xml.py output. Case sort order is nearly identical now
* Available images for dialogue lines now update immediately when changing which stages are checked rather than needing to switch between cases to update
* Improved formatting in text export
* Text import (same text files that make_xml.py reads)
* Tag list now gives frequency of each tag among all characters
* Filters available for validation warnings
* Dialogue is now preserved when modifying clothing layers (ex. when moving a layer up, the corresponding stage's dialogue is also moved up a stage)
* Dialogue tree filters to show only targeted dialogue
* Select All checkbox for picking applicable stages

Bug Fixes
-------------
* Starting lines now allow images that don't start with 0-
* Fixed parsing errors in the export when a character's folder contains -
* Fixed posing templates stripping away color hex values that start with a letter
* Cases with a targetStage but no target now display the stage instead of blank in the dialogue tree
* Target stage is now respected in the Dialogue Tester
* Layers in meta.xml is now set correctly for new characters
* Dialogue tree doesn't expand when resizing window
* Canceling the Setup form from the File menu no longer closes the program

Planned Features (expected to be added in a future release)
----------------
* Find and replace tool
* Better starting lines editor (since lots of people don't understand how these work)
* Ability to link cases together for shared dialogue (ex. male_must_strip and male_human_must_strip share a single case if all their dialogue will be the same)
* Change tracking (so it can be more intelligent about prompting to save)
* Better compatibility with make_images.py (i.e. cropping with scene imports

Wishlist (nice to have features, but not currently under development)
--------
* Embed the game inside the dialogue tester so the actual game scripts are used to determine dialogue choices
* Testing tables editor

Known bugs
--------
* The image importer does not play nicely with files that use a global scene setter. (aka if the first image in your list has global scene data, make_images.py would use this for all following scenes, but the importer will use it only for that line itself)
* Poses with crop_pixels generated from the importer are not always compatible with make_images.py
* Stages remain blue even if there are no default lines. This persists until the next time a character is loaded
* Images for a case are sometimes discarded when selecting a stage checkbox
* Cross-stage images aren't preserved (ex. Nagisa uses 7-rear in stage 9, but this gets turned into 9-rear)

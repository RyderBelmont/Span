Bug Fixes

* Images are no longer discard when selecting a stage checkbox

Planned Features (expected to be added in a future release)
----------------
* Ability to link cases together for shared dialogue (ex. male_must_strip and male_human_must_strip share a single case if all their dialogue will be the same)
* Change tracking (so it can be more intelligent about prompting to save)
* Better compatibility with make_images.py (i.e. cropping with scene imports

Wishlist (nice to have features, but not currently under development)
--------
* Embed the game inside the dialogue tester so the actual game scripts are used to determine dialogue choices
* Testing tables editor

Known bugs
--------
* The image importer does not play nicely with files that use a global scene setter. (aka if the first image in your list has global scene data, make_images.py would use this for all following scenes, but the importer will use it only for that line itself)
* Poses with crop_pixels generated from the importer are not always compatible with make_images.py
* Stages remain blue even if there are no default lines. This persists until the next time a character is loaded
* Cross-stage images aren't preserved (ex. Nagisa uses 7-rear in stage 9, but this gets turned into 9-rear)
* Importing new images doesn't make them immediately available for dialogue - restarting the program is necessary
* Sometimes Find doesn't do anything, but clicking onto the dialogue table and back to the Find box seems to work
* Validation complains about images in starting lines sometimes even when they're valid

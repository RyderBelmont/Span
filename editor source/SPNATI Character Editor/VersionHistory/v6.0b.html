<h3>Dashboard</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added a "Banter between all characters from a franchise" graph to the Franchise Comparison dashboard. This gives an overview for which characters from a franchise are most talkative amongst each other. For example, you can see which Fire Emblem character talks the most to other Fire Emblem characters and which characters completely ignore their franchise mates.</li>
	<li>Use the left and right arrows to switch between graphs.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Epilogues</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The epilogue editor has received a complete overhaul to make it more similar sequencers found in other software (including the Pose Maker in this software).</li>
	<li>A tutorial has been added to the spnati_edit YouTube channel.</li>
	<li>If an emitter's Y scale is left blank, it will now use the same value as the X scale, preserving aspect ratio.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Pose Maker</h3>
<ul>
	<li>It's now possible to split a keyframe by dragging it while holding Ctrl.</li>
	<li>Changed how the blocks of keyframes are displayed when splits are in use.</li>
	<li>These features also apply to the Epilogue Editor.</li>
	<li>Added buttons for changing a keyframe type instead of cycling through them.</li>
	<li>Adjusted the colors across various themes.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Pose Matrix</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Wetness and labia position can now be applied to individual poses across stages.</li>
	<li>For sheets that were created as "stage-independent", a subfolder can now be specified to store the images in a subfolder of the character's root directory. This is useful for organizing assets for custom poses and epilogues.</li>
</ul>

<h3>General</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Characters with statuses that are marked to hide under the "Characters to hide" setting will no longer appear as suggestions in the Checklist dashboard, the Banter Wizard, or the Writing Aid.</li>
	<li>Adjusted the default Blue theme.</li>
	<li>Desaturated the Mandevilla theme.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Character Skins</h3>
<ul>
	<li>When creating a new alternate outfit, the format <i>character_skin</i> will now be enforced. This makes sorting easier when browsing the opponent/reskins folder.</li>
	<li>When creating a new alternate outfit, the editor will now auto-select the character to link the outfit to based on the name of the skin.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Validator</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Uncountable nouns for clothing like "armor" and "jewelry" are now flagged because they don't pluralize well when writing generic dialogue.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed crash when closing a character while the Find/Replace popup is open, and then attempting to use the popup.</li>
	<li>Fixed various crashes that would occur on the Dashboard and Validator tabs when a Pose Maker pose contains a sprite with no source.</li>
	<li>Fixed issue where creating a response to an "Opponent Selected" case where you are the target would create an "Opponent Selected" case instead of "Selected."</li>
	<li>"Online" now appears as an option for epilogue status. This is the same as leaving it blank, but that wasn't obvious.</li>
	<li>Fixed issue where required markers on an epilogue would duplicate when switching between epilogues on the same character.</li>
	<li>Fixed issue where required markers on an epilogue would transfer to a new epilogue when creating a new one.</li>
	<li>Fixed issue where the "Daily Goal Met" notification would appear repeatedly at certain times of the day.</li>
	<li>Made Spell Check smarter about what it considers to be a word.</li>
	<li>Fixed massive lag when opening an epilogue.</li>
	<li>Speech bubble font size and padding in epilogues now scale to the camera like they have in game for a long time now. This should make it much easier to position bubbles, though they still won't be 1:1 with the game.</li>
	<li>Fixed the skinning of preview fields (X, Y, source, etc.) when clicking between frames in the Pose Maker and Epilogue Editor.</li>
	<li>Improved contrast of colors in the Pose Maker for the dark themes.</li>
	<li>Fixed invisible tick marks in the Pose Maker in the Mandevilla theme.</li>
	<li>Dragging a snap will now snap it to the grid as opposed to snapping in grid increments from the initial point.</li>
	<li>Performance optimizations to the pose maker when there are lots of objects in the timeline.</li>
	<li>The timeline can now be scrolled using the mousewheel while hovering over a sprite header.</li>
	<li>Fixed emitter particles not previewing skew values.</li>
</ul>

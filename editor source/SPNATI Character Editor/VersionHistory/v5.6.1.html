<h3>General</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added a setting to control how many characters can be in a shared franchise source to appear in the franchise comparison dashboard.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed issue where visiting a case with a misspelled word multiple times before going to the Spell Check tab would mark that word as misspelled multiple times, which would then cause trying to correct the word in Spell Check to instead mess it up.</li>
	<li>Fixed minor performance issue with filtering characters by status.</li>
	<li>Fixed issue with time range conditions (ex. Time in Stage) not retaining the first value entered.</li>
	<li>Fixed crash when clearing the ID field in the Pose Maker.</li>
	<li>Fixed issue where a blank pivot for a sprite was treated as (left,top) in the epilogue editor but is treated as (center,center) in game.</li>
	<li>The validator no longer complains about missing poses for hidden lines.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Validator</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Restores a large number of validation rules that weren't working.</li>
    <li>Now checks for issues within AND/OR tabs as well.</li>
    <li>Flags conditions with a count of "0+", which is meaningless and was usually meant to be a count of zero.</li>
    <li>Flags Self Saying Marker, Self Saying Text, and Self Pose conditions, which never work.</li>
    <li>Flags redundant use of ifMale in an already gendered case.</li>
    <li>The "incorrect clothing weight" rule now functions correctly in the case of an item being converted to Important due to being the last item covering nudity.</li>
    <li>Clarifies if a clothing classification is only invalid due to being incorrectly capitalized.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Advanced</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Removes the "pt" and "px" options for custom text size, as they vary wildly on different systems. All existing text sizes will be converted to percents.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Fixes an oversight in the case conversion process. Now all cases will be converted to the new format. (If you don't know what this means, don't worry about it.)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Fixes the Respond system sometimes assigning a response a custom priority.</li>
    <li>Fixes certain images disappearing in the Pose Maker.</li>
    <li>Fixes an issue preventing the cross-costume custom poses from working.</li>
    <li>Fixes a minor bug in determining which layers would be converted to Important.</li>
</ul>

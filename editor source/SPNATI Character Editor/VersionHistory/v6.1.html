<h3>Epilogues</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The "Play Scene" button now plays through to the end of the scene instead of just the current action.</li>
	<li>Increased the default scene size to 500x500.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Dialogue Editor</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Removed the "Add a Condition" search field because it uses the old format of conditions and its usage delays allowing the editor to fully modernize to the current condition format.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Misc</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Tags in tags_dictionary.xml that have both gender and paired attributes will only apply the paired attribute if the character matches the gender. For example, the "chubby" tag can now imply "curvy" for only females.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Add Sprite, Speech Bubble, etc. buttons are now disabled while a scene transition is selected. Previously trying to use one of these with a transition active would cause a crash.</li>
	<li>Fixed issue where trying to name an action in an epilogue scene would make the name field disappear.</li>
	<li>Fixed issue where changing properties on the first keyframe of an action would sometimes not "stick".</li>
	<li>Fixed issue where sprites that changed their image source would rescale at the start of a new action, which is inconsistent with the in-game engine.</li>
	<li>Fixed issue where not all lines targeting tags were appearing in the Banter Wizard.</li>
</ul>

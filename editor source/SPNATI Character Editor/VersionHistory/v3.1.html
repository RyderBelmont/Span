<h3>Dialogue Editor</h3>
Major performance optimizations when saving.

<h3>New Dialogue Tree Views</h3>
In addition to sorting the tree by stage, you can now sort by case type (i.e. all hand (good) cases across stages are grouped into a Hand (Good) section).

<h3>Variable Tests</h3>
You can now target cases based on a variable's value. Found under Game > Variable Test (+) in the conditions editor.

Example use cases: reacting to the player's name, or reacting to a generic type of clothing (ex. ~clothing~="shirt")

<h3>Pose List Enhancements</h3>
A right-click menu has been added to cut-and-paste or duplicate poses.

<h3>Kisekae</h3>
v85 officially supported (though it should work with previous versions too).

Global belts and hairpieces should get centered better when importing an ALL code (though in general you're better off working with your model precentered at X:410).

<h3>Change Log</h3>
You can now review these new update screens in Help > Change Log.

<h3>Start lines deprecated</h3>
When loading a character, any lines in the old &lt;start&gt; region will be moved to the Game Start and Selected cases. Starting lines are no longer accessible for editing.

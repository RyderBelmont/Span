<h3>Retirement Services</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The timeline-based epilogue editor has been removed. It was supposed to make epilogues more intuitive and easier to build than the step-by-step editor, but did not achieve these goals.</li>
	<li>The Data Slicer tab has been removed. With a mix of characters using the old vs. current behavior.xml format, the data was unreliable.</li>
	<li>The Line Importer for the game's dev mode has been removed. This never worked when the behavior.xml format changed. The scratch pad is still available.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a crash at startup when building the character index.</li>
	<li>Fixed a crash when creating a new skin.</li>
	<li>Added "unlisted" to the skin status field.</li>
	<li>Tweaked the blend node in a pipeline to not blend alpha values against an empty pixel.</li>
</ul>

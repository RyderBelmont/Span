<h3>Dashboard</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Limits the New Lines from Opponents graph to 6 characters again. Removing this limit made the graph illegible when a character had a lot of new inbound lines. A better fix will be considered for the next CE version.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Metadata</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The "Rounds to finish" option has been clarified as "Phases to finish" - it refers to the number of times the player clicks the continue button, <i>not</i> the number of game rounds.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Costumes</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Enforces the rule that event costumes cannot also be set to online.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Banter Wizard</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Removed the option to view all filtered lines that could play towards your character. It was confusing new developers into thinking it was okay to respond to those lines, and also didn't work properly in the first place.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Re-adds the tag list to behaviour.xml for now, as it was causing problems with the SPNATI Utilities Bot. tags.xml is still generated, but a duplicate tag list is written to behaviour.xml.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Prevents excessively long "Import Lineup" codes from being cut off.</li>
    <li>Characters with "display names" will now show up as those names within the CE.</li>
    <li>The per-case Add Tags and Remove Tags lists will properly save when emptied of all items.</li>
    <li>The human player is no longer considered to have 0 layers.</li>
</ul>

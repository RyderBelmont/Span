<h3>General</h3>
<ul>
	<li>A Writer column has been added to Character searches.</li>
	<li>It's now possible to search for characters by writer.</li>
	<li>Characters' labels will be used in addition to their name and folder when looking up a character. This means you can find Marinette by searching for Ladybug, for example.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bookkeeping</h3>
<ul>
	<li>A timestamp will be saved in meta.xml whenever the file is saved. This allows for (1) more accurate "Last Update" data in the Character search, and (2) allows the game to know how recent a character was changed (for example, for filters to find newly updated characters).</li>
	<li>Characters saved prior to v5.9 will not display anything in the Last Update column.</li>
	<li>The "This file was machine generated" message has been altered to remove the mention of "preserving your improvements" since behaviour.xml has been the primary source of truth for years now.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed issue where importing an image, restarting KKL, and then importing another image would cause a crash.</li>
</ul>

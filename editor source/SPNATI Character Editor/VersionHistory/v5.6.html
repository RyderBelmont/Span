<h3>General</h3>
<ul>
	<li>A warning banner will display when viewing characters saved in later versions of the editor.</li>
	<li>Tag definitions have been moved into tag_dictionary.xml in the opponents folder. This will allow mods to update available tags without requiring a new editor release.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Dialogue</h3>
<ul>
	<li>A "Prompt" category has been added when calling out situations. This is intended for lines where the character is asking the others a question, making a request, or otherwise soliticing feedback.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Alternate Skins</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The status field is now visible.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added a "Goto Line" button to jump to the line with the mispelled word in the dialogue editor.</li>
	<li>Added Writer and Artist criteria to the Data Analzyer</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Creating a response to a "Selected" case will now create an "Opponent Selected" case rather than just "Selected."</li>
	<li>Responding to a case like (target: Florina, 0 masturbating, 0 finished) will now create a "must masturbate (self, first to do so)" response instead of "must masturbate (self)"</li>
	<li>Fixed the Delete button in the Wardrobe Editor. Previously it only allowed deleting layers on a released character when it should have been the opposite.</li>
	<li>The Response and Call Out buttons are now disabled for Finishing (Self) cases because no other character can say anything during these lines.</li>
	<li>The same thing applies to Hidden cases.</li>
	<li>Fixed issue where pating lines and overwriting existing ones would look like it overwrote them but didn't actually.</li>
	<li>Validator checks for "saying text" that never gets said again. Previously this only checked the pre-5.2 condition format. For performance reasons, these checks only run if the other character has been loaded in the editor during the session, however.</li>
	<li>Fixed issue where custom tags wouldn't be saved.</li>
	<li>Tweaked the wording of the "Last Place Loses Hand" recipe to clarify that it can happen even on that player's first loss.</li>
</ul>

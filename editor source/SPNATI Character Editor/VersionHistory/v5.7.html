<h3>Dialogue</h3>
<ul>
	<li>There is now a Dialogue setting to auto-fill available stages when opening the "Select Images Per Stage" form (the chevron button next to a line's image).</li>
	<li>Added background reference to the References section sidebar which lets you review a game background's attributes (location, time, temperature, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Dashboards</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The franchise comparison dashboard will now remember what the last franchise was and default to that next time.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Pose Matrix</h3>
Introducing the Pose Matrix tab. This tool provides another optional method for managing Kisekae pose codes as an alternative to pose lists, templates or external spreadsheets. Features include:
<ul>
	<li>Auto-saving to poses.xml whenever character is saved.</li>
	<li>Data recovery. Like other .xml files, the data recovery tools will backup and restore the pose matrix.</li>
	<li>Spreadsheet-like display for an easy at-a-glance view to see what poses haven't been created yet.</li>
	<li>Support for importing entire lineups of a character's strip sequence. For a single pose (ex. "nervous"), line up all stages side by side in Kisekae and import them all at once into the pose matrix.</li>
	<li>Support for exporting lineups. Pick a pose column and use the Export Lineup button to load that poses strip sequence into Kisekae.</li>
	<li>Templating support. Like templates, you can optionally assign a base appearance code, stage codes for clothing, and poses for each emotion, and it'll combine these into the proper clothing + emotion for each stage when importing. This lets you update a pose across all stages or a stage's clothing across all poses without manually updating each one.</li>
	<li>Like Pose Lists, provides buttons for bulk reimporting of all images in the matrix or importing only those whose files haven't been created yet.</li>
	<li>Creation from templates and/or pose lists. The Pose List and Template tabs contain "Add to Matrix" buttons to load a pose list or template into the matrix.</li>
	<li>See the tutorial at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzETssGeaEQ" target="_blank">link</a> for more information or refer to the <a href="../Help/poses.html#matrix" target="_blank">help</a> documentation.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Settings</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added an option to hide the warning banner when viewing an incomplete character.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The "Select Images Per Stage" popup no longer auto-fills in every possible pose.</li>
	<li>Added scrollbars to the "Select Images Per Stage" popup when needed, and fixed its window sizing cutting off the OK/cancel buttons.</li>
	<li>It's now possible to delete poses from the "Select Images Per Stage" popup by unchecking everything in that row. Previously a row with nothing checked would be used for every stage.</li>
	<li>Fixed issue where deleting a case that had misspelled words would still show those words in Spell Check.</li>
	<li>Responding to a "Must Masturbate (Self, First)" case will now create a slightly more space-efficient "0 not still in game" condition instead of "0 finished + 0 masturbating".</li>
	<li>"Total Playing" condition has been renamed to "# Players Still in Game" to be clear it refers to the number that has not yet forfeited vs the number of players at the table.</li>
	<li>Total Exposed, Total Naked, Total Masturbating, and Total Finished conditions have been renamed to "# Players ..."</li>
	<li>Fixed crash when encountering an unrecognized listing status.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Image Importing</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added a dashed line to the crop window that shows the center of the pose.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Epilogues</h3>
<ul>
	<li>You can now specify a marker for an entire action block so that it (and its corresponding pause) can be conditionally skipped in game.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
<ul>
	<li>New characters will now be added to a separate listing.xml file so as to not interfere with the core game's listing. 
	Any characters opened in the editor that are not present in a listing will be automatically added. This should reduce the complaints about a character not
	appearing in game.
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed issue where adding an action and immediately changing its name wouldn't do anything.</li>
	<li>Trying to open or target a character that is filtered out will now load in that character instead of creating a new one that would wipe out the filtered character's behaviour.xml</li>
</ul>

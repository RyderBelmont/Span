<h3>Epilogue Editor</h3>
<ul>
    <li>More animation easing options available (ease-in and out variants, bounce, and elastic band)</li>
    <li>More control over how a looping animation loops (start over, stop, or move back and forth)</li>
    <li>Emitters added. Emitters can produce either sprites or colored particles at fixed intervals to produce particle effects. Don't go too crazy though, as this engine is not designed for handling hundreds of sprites on screen at once.</li>
    <li>Remove Sprite/Emitter directive added for removing an object mid-scene</li>
    <li>Added scene transition effects. The editor gives a very rudimentary preview of how effects look, but you will need to see the epilogue in game to get the full effect.</li>
</ul>

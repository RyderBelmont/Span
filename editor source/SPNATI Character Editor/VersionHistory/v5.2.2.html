<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Filtering cases by target has been fixed.</li>
	<li>Filter (+) has been removed from the menus. Use the Filter submenu to pick a specific filter type.</li>
	<li>Target Tag now converts to a target filter with that tag.</li>
	<li>Mint Chocolate now has a hover effect for menus in the condition editor.</li>
	<li>When adding a Target, Also Playing, or Opponent filter, focus will jump to the Character field rather than the Filter field so that you can immediately select a character.</li>
	<li>Adding multiple Self or Target filters now works out of the box without needing the cumbersome workaround of adding an Anyone filter and changing it to Self or Target.</li>
	<li>Ranges can now be specified for specific character filters, for targeting whether 0 or multiple of that character is present.</li>
	<li>Stop directives on looped camera and fade animations now appropriately stop those animations during the preview.</li>
	<li>Since 5.2, cases were getting a redundant tag attribute. These will be stripped away now.</li>

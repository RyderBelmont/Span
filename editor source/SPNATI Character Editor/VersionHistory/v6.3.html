<h3>Deck Designer</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added the ability to create custom decks. Go to the "Decks..." button in the toolbar to create a new deck.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Dialogue</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added a Variable Wizard for helping with syntax for complicated variables. Use the "+~" button next to "Hover to see available variables" in the Dialogue tab to bring up a form where you can
	select a variable and fill out parameters for it as discrete fields. This will insert a variable with the appropriate syntax at the location of the cursor in a line.
	For example, instead of remembering to type out ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~, you could bring up the wizard and search for the clothing variable and fill out a form like this:
		<table style="border: 1px solid black">
			<tr>
				<td>Variable: </td>
				<td>clothing</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Function: </td>
				<td>ifPlural</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>When singular:</td>
				<td>that</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>When plural:</td>
				<td>those</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
	</li>
	<li>Typing variables manually is still an option, of course, and will likely still be preferable for experienced writers.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Epilogues</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added an "Allow Scene Skip" option to let players switch between scenes when viewing an epilogue from the gallery.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Image Pipelines</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added a Branch node for if/else logic.</li>
	<li>Added a Note node for adding comments inside a pipeline to help describe what it's doing.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Alternate Costumes</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The Tags tab of an alternate Skin now works identically to the Tags tab of the primary character, simplifying tagging.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added links to tutorial videos. While on a tab that has a tutorial, a Camera icon will appear on the top toolbar next to the Settings gear. Clicking this will take you to the relevant Youtube video.</li>
	<li>Added the version a character was lasted saved in as a column in the Character Lookup.</li>
	<li>Added a @ operator to variable tests, which means to treat a value as a range (ex. ~day.number~ @ 21-25 means day is between 21 and 25)</li>
	<li>Characters are now referred to by their Label rather than First Name, which is more consistent with the game.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed issue where unchecking all types of characters from the "Characters to hide" setting would hide all online characters the next time you started up the program.</li>
	<li>Fixed crash when opening an old character that has never been saved in the Character Editor before.</li>
	<li>Fixed the "Mark as Done" button in the Writing Aid so it actually does something.</li>
	<li>A face mark's opacity can now be posed.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Setup</h3>
<ul>
	<li>There is now an option for who to automatically open when first starting the application instead of automatically opening whoever was opened last.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Dialogue Editor</h3>
<ul>
	<li>A "Winner" role is now available for filters, so you can make conditions based on the player who had the best hand.</li>
	<li>~clothing.toPlural~ is available as a variable which pluralizes the clothing name.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Writing Aid</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The number of situations you've responded to is now listed. This number does not include any situations created prior to v3.1.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Respond to This no longer pulls up a previous response if the selected stages do not match. For example, if you make a response that by default applies to stages 1-5, and then filter that down to just stage 2, creating another response will make a new response in stages 1-5 rather than reopening the response in only stage 2.</li>
	<li>Fixed issue where an item with position: "both" covering a bare chest and lower underwear (or vice versa) would be treated as a major removal rather than an important reveal when making responses.</li>
	<li>Fixed crash when choosing a portrait for a reskin before actually creating the reskin's images.</li>
	<li>Manually creating a variable test for something like Hand Quality and using a variable on the righthand side will no longer wipe out that value when coming back to the case.</li>
	<li>Filtering on a target for a case with a gender or size requirement will now filter the target possibilities down to only those who meet the criteria.</li>
	<li>Fixed issue where creating a new skin on a character that has not been opened previously in the current session would wipe out that character's .xml files.</li>
</ul>

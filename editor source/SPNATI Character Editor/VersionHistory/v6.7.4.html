<h3>Deck Designer</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Added the ability to create custom card decks. Go to the "Decks..." button in the toolbar to create a new deck.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Dashboard</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Added a filtered line count to the progress graph.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Dialogue</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Changed the dialogue preview's font to Open Sans, to match the change to the game itself.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Changed the definition of "generic lines" to encompass all non-targeted, non-filtered lines, to match the everyday usage of the term. This removes the "conditional" and "special-conditions" linecounts and everything associated with them.</li>

<ul>
    <li>Fixed the IDs in behaviour.xml sometimes spontaneously renumbering themselves.</li>
</ul>

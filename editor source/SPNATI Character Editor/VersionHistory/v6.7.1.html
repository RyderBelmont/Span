<h3>Deck Designer</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Adds the ability to create custom card decks. Go to the "Decks..." button in the toolbar to create a new deck.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Dashboard</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The New Incoming Lines graph now also identifies lines from new characters that were added since last launch.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Collectibles</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Adds settings related to the new Wearable Collectibles feature.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Settings</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Adds an option in the Settings window to turn off the Validator's blank-lines check (under Dialogue). Generally, don't disable it unless you're specifically working on a mute character.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Validator</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Flags cases that have no lines assigned to them.</li>
    <li>Flags cases that depend on unused markers.</li>
    <li>Flags variable tests with no subject.</li>
    <li>Flags lines that use {small} for the entire line (they should be using the text-size option instead).</li>
    <li>Flags use of {!reset} at the end of a line.</li>
    <li>Notifies if the character has no clothing classifications.</li>
    <li>Notifies that layers like "panties" or "glasses" should be set to plural.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Fixes the Text Size per-line dropdown sometimes getting "stuck" on a certain value.</li>
    <li>Custom poses that take files from a different character's folder should now work again.</li>
    <li>Restores the green "targeted line" highlight for lines targeting the human player, if that setting is turned on.</li>
    <li>The Validator no longer warns for Pose Maker poses that exist for the base costume but are missing in an alternate costume, because those work automatically now.</li>
    <li>The Validator no longer warns for completely blank lines in hidden cases.</li>
</ul>

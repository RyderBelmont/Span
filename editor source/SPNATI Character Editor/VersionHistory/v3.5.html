<h3>Dialogue Editor</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Added a personal notes section in a tab next to the dialogue table. This is not used anywhere in the game, but can serve as a place you can make your own personal notes about what a case is doing (ex. why is it setting X marker, does it precede something important, and so forth)</li>

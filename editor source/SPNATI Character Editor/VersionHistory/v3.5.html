<h3>Dialogue Editor</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Added a personal notes section in a tab next to the dialogue table. This is not used anywhere in the game, but can serve as a place you can make your own personal notes about what a case is doing (ex. why is it setting X marker, does it precede something important, and so forth)</li>
    <li>Legacy-style condition editor has been removed. It has been deprecated for several releases now.</li>
    <li>Ranges (ex. time in stage) now have a "no upper bound" checkbox. It's no longer required to enter a "to" value when doing a single stage range.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
    The "Create New" button is now always enabled if text has been entered, allowing the creation of a character/skin/tag/marker whose name is a partial match of an existing one.

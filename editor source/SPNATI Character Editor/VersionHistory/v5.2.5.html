<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed issue where responding to cases that are targeting the responder (via a filter) would use the wrong case type. For example, character B responding to a "female stripping" case with B as the target would create a "female stripping" case instead of a "stripping (self)" case. </li>
	<li>Fixed issue where responding to a case while chest or crotch is being revealed would not limit the response to the appropriate stage.</li>
	<li>Fixed issue where collapsing a case group could jump the selection to somewhere else in the case tree.</li>
	<li>Borders in the Mint Chocolate theme are now more visible.</li>
</ul>

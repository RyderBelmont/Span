<h3>Metadata</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Added fields for several character details that aren't visible in-game, only to other developers: Age, Name Pronunciation, and a free-form Other Notes field.</li>
    <li>Moved the Height field to this section as well. No actual functionality change here, as it was never visible in-game.</li>
	<li>Allows line breaks in the Description field to be visible in-game.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Epilogues</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Adds an unlock condition selector. By default the player must win to get an epilogue, but this adds the possibilities to unlock if the character loses, or if the character must forfeit before the player does, or even just playing with the character at all. (This last possibility may become the default soon, so be sure to specify otherwise if your epilogue's plot hinges on the player winning!)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Dialogue</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Hidden cases can now be given priority, to guarantee their processing order. Previously, this order was basically random. Hidden case priority defaults to zero if not specified.</li>
    <li>Cases can now be given negative priority.</li>
    <li>Increases the width of the Priority column in the case list.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Costumes</h3>
<ul>
    <li>No longer restricts layer weight to match that of the main costume.</li>
</ul>

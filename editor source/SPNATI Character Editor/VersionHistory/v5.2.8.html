<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Target, Self, and Specific Character filters now have a "Not" checkbox for checking that the filter conditions are NOT true. This is a shortcut for checking for a count of 0 to 0.</li>
	<li>Responding to a case that targets a tag in the Banter Wizard will now assume the line is targeting your character. For example, previously responding to a "Must Strip (Female), Target Filter: Confident" line from 9S in the Banter Wizard would create a "Must Strip (Female), Also Playing: 9S" response. Now, it will create "Must Strip (Self), Also Playing: 9S, Self Has Tag Confident" case.</li>
	<li>As alluded to in the example above, responding to cases with a target tag will now convert that tag into a self variable test, because it's possible that your character doesn't always have the tag so it's important to keep that condition.</li>
	<li>Fixed issue where creating a response to a case that has a legacy Also Playing condition along with an Also Playing filter for another character would merge them into a single filter.</li>
	<li>Fixed macro creation with filters where the role would be lost. For instance, a macro of "Filter: Also Playing: Florina" would turn into a macro of "Filter: Anyone".</li>
	<li>Fixed issue with creating a response for a case that already has a response not finding the old response.</li>
	<li>Fixed issue with Recent items in the character lookup linking to stale versions of the character. This could cause responses to seemingly not work because they would be added to the stale version of the character.</li>
</ul>

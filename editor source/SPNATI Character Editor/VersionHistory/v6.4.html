<h3>Dialogue Editor</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added a "To Recipe" button to create a recipe out of a case in a character's dialogue.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Pose Matrix</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Using a stage number for a row name in a stage-independent sheet will now generate an image with the name "row name"-"column name".png instead of "row name"_"column name".png. This will effectively allow you to make sheets that only include certain stages (such as a special sheet for the finishing stage without needing a bunch of blank rows for the other stages)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed an issue where the "Locally" image importer setting would sometimes only produce a partial image.</li>
	<li>listing-test.xml will now only update when saving an unlisted character rather than opening one.</li>
	<li>Importing .swf image attachments no longer crash.</li>
	<li>Recipes no longer save with a weird DataStore attribute.</li>
	<li>Fixed the counter for the "Replace generic placeholder dialogue" checklist item.</li>
	<li>Default lines no longer count towards line requirements.</li>
	<li>Fixed imports freezing/failing when using upper undershirt transparencies.</li>
	<li>Fixed imports hanging on a pose that contains lots of transparencies.</li>
</ul>

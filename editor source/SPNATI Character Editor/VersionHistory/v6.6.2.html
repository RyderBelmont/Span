<h3>Dialogue</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Adds a "~blank~" variable that expands to nothing. Use this for intentionally blank lines, instead of leaving them blank.</li>
    <li>Adds a new "AI Opponent" filter to more easily specify opponents that are not the player.</li>
    <li>Adds a "Disable Case" menu option in the Dialogue Tree's Config menu (gear icon), to temporarily disable a case entirely. This is different than Hidden cases because Hidden cases still run in the background, which could cause undesired behavior.</li>
    <li>Adds an option to select text size as a direct attribute of a line, instead of just a custom style.</li>
    <li>Shrinks the font size of the preview speech bubble slightly, to match a similar change to the game.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Costumes</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Removes the rule that event costumes cannot be set to online, due to changes in how event costumes are handled.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Advanced</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Added an option to globally reduce a character's text size. Please only use this as a last resort.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Validator</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Flags completely blank lines, in case they were created by accident. If a blank line is intentional, use ~blank~.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Lines toward the human player no longer count toward the total amount of targeted lines.</li>
    <li>Removes redundant conditions from some Recipes.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Fixes an error with global dialogue layering in the Advanced tab. If you intended for the dialogue to go over your character's image, re-select "over", which will now actually work.</li>
    <li>Custom cross-stage poses now correctly count their component images as used in the Validator.</li>
</ul>

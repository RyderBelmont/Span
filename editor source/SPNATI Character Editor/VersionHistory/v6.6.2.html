<h3>Dialogue</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Adds a new "AI Opponent" filter to more easily specify opponents that are not the player.</li>
    <li>Adds a "Disable Case" menu option in the Dialogue Tree's Config menu (gear icon), to temporarily disable a case entirely. This is different than Hidden cases because Hidden cases still run in the background, which could cause undesired behavior.</li>
    <li>Adds an option to select text size as a direct attribute of a line, instead of just a custom style.</li>
    <li>Shrinks the font size of the preview speech bubble slightly, to match a similar change to the game.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Costumes</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Removes the rule that event costumes cannot be set to online, due to changes in how event costumes are handled.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Removes redundant conditions from some Recipes.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>

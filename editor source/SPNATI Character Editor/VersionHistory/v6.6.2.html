<h3>Dialogue</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Adds a "~blank~" variable that expands to nothing. Use this for intentionally blank lines, instead of leaving them blank.</li>
    <li>Adds a new "AI Opponent" filter to more easily specify opponents that are not the player.</li>
    <li>Adds a "Disable Case" menu option in the Dialogue Tree's Config menu (gear icon), to temporarily disable a case entirely. This is different than Hidden cases because Hidden cases still run in the background, which could cause undesired behavior.</li>
    <li>Adds an option to select text size as a direct attribute of a line, instead of just a custom style.</li>
    <li>Adds a few more items to the shortcut menus.</li>
    <li>Shrinks the font size of the preview speech bubble slightly, to match a similar change to the game.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Costumes</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Removes the rule that event costumes cannot be set to online, due to changes in how event costumes are handled.</li>
    <li>Replaces spaces with underscores in the folder name when creating a new costume.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Collectibles</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Added an "unlisted" option for status. This could basically be accomplished already by making the collectible Secret, but this method may be more intuitive.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Advanced</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Added an option to globally reduce a character's text size. Please only use this as a last resort.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Pose Maker</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Custom poses for the base character now automatically work for alternate costumes, as long as corresponding versions of all referenced images are present in the costume folder. Previously you would have to copy over any custom poses you wanted to use for each alternate costume. This feature is activated the first time you save the base character in v6.6.2 or later.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Validator</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Flags completely blank lines, in case they were created by accident. If a blank line is intentional, use ~blank~.</li>
    <li>Flags lines that use ~name~ or ~target~ in cases that don't have a target (hand lines, self strip, etc).</li>
    <li>Flags cases with empty OR tabs, as that invalidates any conditions in the other AND/OR tabs.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Lines toward the human player no longer count toward the total amount of targeted lines.</li>
    <li>Removes redundant conditions from some Recipes.</li>
    <li>Removes the redundant tag list from behaviour.xml. The issue with the SPNATI Utilities Bot has been resolved.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Fixes an error with global dialogue layering in the Advanced tab. If you intended for the dialogue to go over your character's image, re-select "over", which will now actually work.</li>
    <li>Custom cross-stage poses now correctly count their component images as used in the Validator.</li>
    <li>Fixes a crash when opening the Pose Matrix if the entire Stage 0 row is empty.</li>
</ul>

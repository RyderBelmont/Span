<h3>General</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Moved <pre style="display:inline">&lt;nicknames&gt;</pre> up next to <pre style="display:inline">&lt;tags&gt;</pre> in behaviour.xml</li>
    <li>behaviour.xml's file format has changed to group cases by type rather than by stage. This will result in a smaller file size but will also cause a major file diff upon saving for the first time.</li>
    <li>The editor is a bit smarter about unsaved changes now and will not spam you with "Do you want to save X before closing?" messages quite as often.</li>
    <li>The editor now runs in 64-bit mode. The increasing roster and editor complexity have been pushing the limits of 32-bit.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Dashboard</h3>
<ul>
	Established characters now open to a Character Dashboard. This screen contains an at-a-glance overview of the character. For new characters, it also displays progress towards meeting minimum sponsorship requirement and step-by-step instructions for outstanding tasks.
</ul>

<h3>Image Importing</h3>
<ul>
    <li>FarawayVision's online Kisekae importer has been integrated into the editor. This will allow machines where the local Kisekae import doesn't work (e.g. Mac or Linux) to be able to use the editor's import functions.</li>
    <li>To use this, go to the settings > Image Import to switch to importing remotely.</li>
    <li>This is only recommended for those who can't get local importing to work, since local importing is faster.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Image Compression</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The "Screenshot" tab has been renamed to "Images"</li>
    <li>It's now possible to compress images using TinyPNG directly from the editor. Visit a character's Images tab to do so.</li>
    <li>TinyPNG allows 500 compressions per month per API key. By default, the editor shares a single key across all Character Editor users, so it's strongly recommended to obtain your own free API key from <a href="https://tinypng.com/developers" target="_blank">tinypng.com</a>. Then, fill this key into Settings > Image Import > TinyPNG API key and use the verify button to validate your key.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Dialogue</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Added a setting to hide optional case types that have no lines in the case list. Only applicable to case view.</li>
    <li>Added conditions for testing various background properties (indoors/outdoors, temperature, public vs. private space, etc.). These are all found under Game - Background.</li>
    <li>A Targets tab has been added to the Reference sidebar. This lists which characters have already been targeted in dialogue or not.</li>
    <li>Added a button to collapse the dialogue tree.</li>
    <li>Sorting by case is now the default sort method. To go back to the old sorting method, select Stage from the View dropdown.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Data Recovery</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        If data recovery snapshots are enabled (Settings > Backups), you can now configure how long to keep snapshots around, and how frequently to create a new snapshot.
    </li>
    <li>Defaults are to create a new snapshot every 30 minutes and keep old snapshots around for 30 days.</li>
    <li>This should make recovery snapshots more useful rather than clogging things up with near-identical files.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Validator</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Variable tests with an empty expression or value are now flagged.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Fixed issue where running on Mac would crash immediately upon clicking anything without using a workaround in config.ini.</li>
    <li>"Hide Targeted Dialogue" checkbox now only hides cases that target another character rather than cases that contain any condition whatsoever</li>
    <li>Fixed issue where editor would crash when trying to launch from a directory other than the one containing the executable.</li>
    <li>Fixed issue with making responses for variable tests where things like ~self.costume~ would not be replaced with ~target.costume~.</li>
    <li>Fixed crash when responding to a strip case for a major item whose position is something other than upper, lower, or both.</li>
    <li>Tag filters on a character ID are now counted as targeted lines rather than filtered lines.</li>
    <li>Fixed issue where targeting a player with non-alphanumeric characters (ex. Nugi-chan or D.Va) in a condition from the Player menu would blank out the target upon visiting the case a second time.</li>
    <li>Fixed sorting of snapshots in the Data Recovery tool.</li>
    <li>Tweaked a few colors in the Classic, Forest, and Purple themes.</li>
    <li>Hopefully fixed issue with infinite resizing on Mac.</li>
    <li>Selecting stages in a case will now make them imediately available in the "Select Images Per Stage" popup.</li>
    <li>The Banter Wizard now highlights the proper line when creating a response to it.</li>
    <li>When clicking rows in the Banter Wizard, the "ShoW Text" preview now updates with the appropriate text.</li>
    <li>Animated GIF images play in the sidebar preview again.</li>
    <li>Internal changes that should help differentiate PNGs, GIFs, etc. that would sometimes lead to dropped file extensions.</li>
    <li>Responding to an "Opponent Lost/Stripping/Stripped" case where your character is the target will now make a "Must Strip/Stripping/Stripped" case instead of inappropriately reusing "Opponent Lost/Stripping/Stripped"</li>
</ul>

<h3>General</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Moved <pre style="display:inline">&lt;nicknames&gt;</pre> up next to <pre style="display:inline">&lt;tags&gt;</pre> in behaviour.xml</li>
    <li>behaviour.xml's file format has changed to group cases by type rather than by stage. This will result in a smaller file size but will also cause a major file diff upon saving for the first time.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Image Importing</h3>
<ul>
    <li>FarawayVision's online Kisekae importer has been integrated into the editor. This will allow machines where the local Kisekae import doesn't work (e.g. Mac or Linux) to be able to use the editor's import functions.</li>
    <li>To use this, go to the settings > Image Import to switch to importing remotely.</li>
    <li>This is only recommended for those who can't get local importing to work, since local importing is faster.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Dialogue</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Added a setting to hide optional case types that have no lines in the case list. Only applicable to case view.</li>
    <li>Added conditions for testing various background properties (indoors/outdoors, temperature, public vs. private space, etc.). These are all found under Game - Background.</li>
    <li>A Targets tab has been added to the Reference sidebar. This lists which characters have already been targeted in dialogue or not.</li>
    <li>Added a button to collapse the dialogue tree.</li>
    <li>Sorting by case is now the default sort method. To go back to the old sorting method, select Stage from the View dropdown.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Data Recovery</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        If data recovery snapshots are enabled (Settings > Backups), you can now configure how long to keep snapshots around, and how frequently to create a new snapshot.
    </li>
    <li>Defaults are to create a new snapshot every 30 minutes and keep old snapshots around for 30 days.</li>
    <li>This should make recovery snapshots more useful rather than clogging things up with near-identical files.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Fixed issue where running on Mac would crash immediately upon clicking anything without using a workaround in config.ini.</li>
    <li>"Hide Targeted Dialogue" checkbox now only hides cases that target another character rather than cases that contain any condition whatsoever</li>
    <li>Fixed issue where editor would crash when trying to launch from a directory other than the one containing the executable.</li>
    <li>Fixed issue with making responses for variable tests where things like ~self.costume~ would not be replaced with ~target.costume~.</li>
    <li>Fixed crash when responding to a strip case for a major item whose position is something other than upper, lower, or both.</li>
    <li>Tag filters on a character ID are now counted as targeted lines rather than filtered lines.</li>
    <li>Fixed issue where targeting a player with non-alphanumeric characters (ex. Nugi-chan or D.Va) in a condition from the Player menu would blank out the target upon visiting the case a second time.</li>
    <li>Fixed sorting of snapshots in the Data Recovery tool.</li>
    <li>Tweaked a few colors in the Classic, Forest, and Purple themes.</li>
    <li>Hopefully fixed issue with infinite resizing on Mac.</li>
    <li>Selecting stages in a case will now make them imediately available in the "Select Images Per Stage" popup.</li>

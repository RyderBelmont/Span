<h3>Dashboard</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added a "Banter between all characters from a franchise" graph to the Franchise Comparison dashboard. This gives an overview for which characters from a franchise are most talkative amongst each other. For example, you can see which Fire Emblem character talks the most to other Fire Emblem characters and which characters completely ignore their franchise mates.</li>
	<li>Use the left and right arrows to switch between graphs.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed crash when closing a character while the Find/Replace popup is open, and then attempting to use the popup.</li>
</ul>

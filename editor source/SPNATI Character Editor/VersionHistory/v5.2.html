<h3>Dashboard</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Daily writing goals can now be configured. Click the gear in the Line History dashboard widget to configure how many lines you want to write a day.</li>
</ul>

﻿<h3>Dialogue</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The Stage-Specific Images popup has been streamlined into a single grid to make it faster to assign multiple images to a line.</li>
	<li>The ... button now has a visual indicator when a line has advanced data (size, gender change, etc.) beneath it.</li>
	<li>Cases with notes now have a visual indicator on the Notes tab.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
<ul>
	A "Submit Bug Report" button has been added to the bottom status bar. If you encounter a buggy workflow that doesn't crash, clicking this will manually create a bug report with screenshots of the last ten actions, just like crashes do. This will make it easier for an editor dev to troubleshoot the circumstances leading up to the issue.
</ul>

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The delete X on a tab now appears in the proper location when the tab strip is scrolled.</li>
	<li>Developer dashboards now appear for characters that you are a co-writer for (i.e if your user name is X and the character's writer is "X, Y", then you now count as a writer)</li>
</ul>

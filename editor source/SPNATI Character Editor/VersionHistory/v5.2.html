<h3>Startup</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The editor now indexes important character information behind the scenes, loading in full character files only when needed. Launching the very first time will be slower than in previous versions, but subsequent launches will be substantially faster with a huge reduction in memory usage.</li>
	<li>
		The tradeoff is increased load times the first time when accessing the following places:
		<ul>
			<li>Charts</li>
			<li>Validate All Characters</li>
			<li>Data Analyzer</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Initial load times for the Banter Wizard and Writing Aid will be much quicker, but selecting a row for a previously unvisited character will be slower.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Dashboard</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Daily writing goals can now be configured. Click the gear in the Line History dashboard widget to configure how many lines you want to write a day. The editor will notify you once you've reached your goal.</li>
	<li>You will also be notified when other characters have written new lines towards your character. This feature requires your editor username to match one of the character's writers.</li>
</ul>

﻿<h3>Dialogue</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The Stage-Specific Images popup has been streamlined into a single grid to make it faster to assign multiple images to a line.</li>
	<li>The ... button now has a visual indicator when a line has advanced data (size, gender change, etc.) beneath it.</li>
	<li>Cases with notes now have a visual indicator on the Notes tab.</li>
	<li>Targeting now uses a new format in behaviour.xml. Any cases you open will be converted to the new format.
		<ul>
			<li>The old Filter (+) option has been turned into a menu for targeting creations about yourself, the current target, another specific player, or an unknown player.</li>
			<li>The Target, Also Playing, and Self menus have been combined into a single menu found inside each filter.</li>
			<li>While this format may take some getting used to, in the long run it's superior because you are not limited to a single "Also Playing" character, and the UI for making conditions about a character is identical no matter who the character is.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
<ul>
	A "Submit Bug Report" button has been added to the bottom status bar. If you encounter a buggy workflow that doesn't crash, clicking this will manually create a bug report with screenshots of the last ten actions, just like crashes do. This will make it easier for an editor dev to troubleshoot the circumstances leading up to the issue.
</ul>

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The delete X on a tab now appears in the proper location when the tab strip is scrolled.</li>
	<li>Developer dashboards now appear for characters that you are a co-writer for (i.e if your user name is X and the character's writer is "X, Y", then you now count as a writer)</li>
	<li>Targeted line counts now include targets within alternative cases.</li>
	<li>Fields containing costumes now display as "Costume Name [costume id]" rather than "Player Name [costume id]"</li>
	<li>"." is no longer considered valid in a marker name, which is how the game works.</li>
	<li>Fixed issue with compressing images where if Tinify fails, the progress popup would never go away nor show an indication of what was wrong.</li>
	<li>Removed the ability to specify percentages for scene widths or heights, which don't make sense and were prone to exploding.</li>
</ul>

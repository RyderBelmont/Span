<h3>General</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Once per version, the editor will now inform you when a new version is available in the tools folder.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Wardrobe</h3>
<ul>
	<li>A "Classification" column has been added. This is used to classify your clothing into generic buckets (ex. a blouse, T-shirt, and sweatshirt could all be classified as a "shirt"). This makes it easier to condition dialogue based on a type of clothing being removed.</li>
	<li>Categories are maintained in opponents/clothing.xml. Admins can adjust this list to their liking and the editor will pick up the changes, so there is no need to rely on new versions of the editor to get updates.</li>
	<li>Authors will need to manually update existing characters' wardrobes to get the full benefits of this system.</li>
	<li>Added a delete button to each row, similar to the dialogue and marker grids.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Dialogue</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added a Folder view for sorting cases. This view organizes cases by folder name (defined in the "Case" part of the case editor). This view is special in that you can drag and drop cases within the same folder to apply your own custom sorting. This could be useful if you want to group special chains of targeted dialogue (ex. a conversation with another character) to provide a better overview of what lines apply. Please note that any sorting and folder grouping you apply is only for organizational purposes within the editor. It does not affect priority in game.</li>
	<li>Day, month, and weekday checks have been added to the Game condition menu.</li>
	<li>The variable test dropdown has been cleaned up. Things like ~target.costume~ should be accessed using Player > Target > Costume and filling in "Target" as the player.</li>
	<li>~target.ifMale()~ can be used to conditionally output text based on the character's gender. (e.g. "~target.ifMale(he|she)~ lost again? What a loser.")</li>
	<li>Added ability to search for markers instead of text when using Ctrl+F.</li>
	<li>Added a Clothing > Category condition to test for a clothing's generic category as described above.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Recipes</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Recipes are now read from the tools/character_editor/recipes folder. This will allow the community to build a shared repository of recipes without having to package them with new editor releases.</li>
	<li>Going forward, any recipes used will be tracked with a checkmark when adding a recipe so that you know which ones you've already used.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Epilogues</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Collapse All and Expand All buttons have been added to the Scene Explorer.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Collectibles</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The collectible limit is now enforced (1 free collectible plus 1 per 600 lines of dialogue).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Pose Lists</h3>
<ul>
	You can now leave a stage empty and it will skip that stage when creating the pose list. This effectively allows for making partial templates (ex. one template for stages 1-5, and another template for stage 6-8).
</ul>

<h3>Settings</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Hide Preview Images has been moved to a new Sidebar settings tab.</li>
	<li>Show Text option has been moved to the Sidebar settings tab.</li>
	<li>An option to disable preview text formatting has been added to the Sidebar settings tab. Unchecking this will display text without italics formatted like the editor would pre-5.4.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed issue where a character's gender could not be changed in the metadata after saving once.</li>
	<li>Status attribute is no longer dropped from costume elements in meta.xml</li>
	<li>Fixed issue where a variable test on a boolean background property (e.g. ~background.dark~) would always revert to false when coming back to the case.</li>
	<li>Fixed crash when opening the dialogue row after deleting a row from the wardrobe grid.</li>
	<li>Speech bubbles with long text fit better now.</li>
</ul>

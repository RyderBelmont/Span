<h3>General</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Once per version, the editor will now inform you when a new version is available.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Wardrobe</h3>
<ul>
	<li>A "Classification" column has been added. This is used to classify your clothing into generic buckets (ex. a blouse, T-shirt, and sweatshirt could all be classified as a "shirt"). This makes it easier to condition dialogue based on a type of clothing being removed.</li>
	<li>Categories are maintained in opponents/clothing.xml. Admins can adjust this list to their liking and the editor will pick up the changes, so there is no need to rely on new versions of the editor to get updates.</li>
	<li>Authors will need to manually update existing characters' wardrobes to get the full benefits of this system.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Dialogue</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Day, month, and weekday checks have been added to the Game condition menu.</li>
	<li>The variable test dropdown has been cleaned up. Things like ~target.costume~ should be accessed using Player > Target > Costume and filling in "Target" as the player.</li>
	<li>~target.ifMale()~ can be used to conditionally output text based on the character's gender. (e.g. "~target.ifMale(he|she)~ lost again? What a loser.")</li>
	<li>Added ability to search for markers instead of text when using Ctrl+F.</li>
	<li>Added a Clothing > Category condition to test for a clothing's generic category as described above.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Epilogues</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Collapse All and Expand All buttons have been added to the Scene Explorer.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Collectibles</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The collectible limit is now enforced (1 free collectible plus 1 per 600 lines of dialogue).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Pose Lists</h3>
<ul>
	You can now leave a stage empty and it will skip that stage when creating the pose list. This effectively allows for making partial templates (ex. one template for stages 1-5, and another template for stage 6-8).
</ul>

<h3>Settings</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Hide Preview Images has been moved to a new Sidebar settings tab.</li>
	<li>Show Text option has been moved to the Sidebar settings tab.</li>
	<li>An option to disable preview text formatting has been added to the Sidebar settings tab. Unchecking this will display text without italics formatted like the editor would pre-5.4.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed issue where a character's gender could not be changed in the metadata after saving once.</li>
	<li>Status attribute is no longer dropped from costume elements in meta.xml</li>
	<li>Fixed issue where a variable test on a boolean background property (e.g. ~background.dark~) would always revert to false when coming back to the case.</li>
</ul>

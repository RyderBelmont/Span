<h3>Costume Editor</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Added an "Event" dropdown to allow setting which event a costume belongs to.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Collectibles</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Added an "online" option for collectible status. This was always possible by selecting the blank option, but this is more intuitive.</li>
    <li>Deleted the misleading "testing" status option.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Removed the "Document markers" development goal. It was created before markers were used for targeting, which has now made this goal unreasonable to complete.</li>
    <li>Removed the option to load or save edit-dialogue.txt, which is deprecated.</li>
    <li>The checkbox for creating a hidden case now reads "Hidden", as opposed to the confusing "Background". For clarity, the menu option to hide a case in the editor, but not in the game, is now "Hide Case <i>in Editor</i>".</li>
    <li>The "Skins..." option in the menu is now "Costumes..."</li>
</ul>

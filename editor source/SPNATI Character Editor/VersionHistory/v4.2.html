<h3>Collectibles</h3>
<ul>
    <li>It's now possible to give your character unlockable collectibles/achievements.</li>
    <li>Visit the Collectibles tab to create collectibles, and then in the dialogue editor, click a line's trophy button to associate a collectible with that line.</li>
    <li>Conditions have also been added for checking a collectible's unlock status for conditioning lines based on it.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Fixed issue in epilogues where switching to a scene with no camera position and back to a scene that does have a camera position would clear out the position.</li>
    <li>Fixed issue where adding a marker condition to an epilogue or pose directive would add that marker to every subsequent directive.</li>
</ul>

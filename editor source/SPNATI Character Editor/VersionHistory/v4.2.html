<h3>Collectibles</h3>
<ul>
    <li>It's now possible to give your character unlockable collectibles/achievements.</li>
    <li>Visit the Collectibles tab to create collectibles, and then in the dialogue editor, click a line's trophy button to associate a collectible with that line.</li>
    <li>Conditions have also been added for checking a collectible's unlock status for conditioning lines based on it.</li>
    <li>Refer to the Help files for more information.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Dialogue Editor</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The Filter (+) condition has been greatly expanded. Use the double down arrow icon to expand the condition to see more options.</li>
    <li>Filter (+) conditions can take a variable now. The name of a random match will be stored into that variable for use in that case. For instance, a filter of (1 or more females with role: Opponent, status: Naked, variable: naked) will put the name of any naked female other than your character into the variable ~naked~. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Macros</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Macros can now be given values in the form $variable, which when used, will bring up a popup to replace variables with values. For instance, you could make a macro that targets the tag $tag and checks "not said marker filter_$tag." Using the macro would then let you replace all instances of $tag with a real value, so "filter tag shy" and "not said marker filter_shy". Then in another case you could use the macro again with a different value.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Help</h3>
<ul>
    <li>A tutorial about Macros has been added.</li>
    <li>Documentation about working with Collectibles has been added.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Fixed issue in epilogues where switching to a scene with no camera position and back to a scene that does have a camera position would clear out the position.</li>
    <li>Fixed issue where adding a marker condition to an epilogue or pose directive would add that marker to every subsequent directive.</li>
    <li>Fixed various issues with advanced conditions when exporting to .txt</li>
</ul>

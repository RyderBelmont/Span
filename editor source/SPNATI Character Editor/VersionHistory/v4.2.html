<h3>Collectibles</h3>
<ul>
    <li>It's now possible to give your character unlockable collectibles/achievements.</li>
    <li>Visit the Collectibles tab to create collectibles, and then in the dialogue editor, click a line's trophy button to associate a collectible with that line.</li>
    <li>Conditions have also been added for checking a collectible's unlock status for conditioning lines based on it.</li>
    <li>Refer to the Help files for more information.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Dialogue Editor</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The Filter (+) condition has been greatly expanded. Use the double down arrow icon to expand the condition to see more options.</li>
    <li>Filter (+) conditions can take a variable now. The name of a random match will be stored into that variable for use in that case. For instance, a filter of (1 or more females with role: Opponent, status: Naked, variable: naked) will put the name of any naked female other than your character into the variable ~naked~. </li>
    <li>Added speed buttons for Clothing Type, target tags, and Also Playing tags.</li>
    <li>A setting has been added to prevent the editor from automatically filling in default lines for stage+case combinations that have no generic lines. (File > Setup > Dialogue).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Pose Maker</h3>
<ul>
    <li>New "Create Sequence" button for quickly creating a sprite with frame-by-frame animation. Files with a numeric suffix (ex. frame0.png, frame1.png, frame2.png...) will automatically be pulled in as frames at a set interval.</li>
    <li>Toggle button added to always display sprites that are conditional based on a marker.</li>
    <li>Switching between poses will now preserve the collapsed and hidden states of any sprites that have the same ID between poses.</li>
    <li>Maximum canvas zoom has been upped from 3x to 5x.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Macros</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Macros can now be given values in the form $variable, which when used, will bring up a popup to replace variables with values. For instance, you could make a macro that targets the tag $tag and checks "not said marker filter_$tag." Using the macro would then let you replace all instances of $tag with a real value, so "filter tag shy" and "not said marker filter_shy". Then in another case you could use the macro again with a different value.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Help</h3>
<ul>
    <li>A tutorial about Macros has been added.</li>
    <li>Documentation about working with Collectibles has been added.</li>
</ul>

    <li>Fixed issue in epilogues where switching to a scene with no camera position and back to a scene that does have a camera position would clear out the position.</li>

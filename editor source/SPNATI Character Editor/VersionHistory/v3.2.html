<h3>Dialogue Editor</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Dialogue lines now have a delete button to make it more apparent how to delete them.</li>
    <li>Conditions can now be starred, which will pull them in by default for every case.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Output synchronization</h3>
Some changes have been made to make the behaviour.xml output more consistent with what make_xml.py produces.<br/>
<strong style="color:red">This substantially shuffles how lines are sorted, so the first time saving in this version will create massive changes in behaviour.xml file when merging.</strong> The lines and their triggers should not be changed; they're just being moved to a different location in the xml.

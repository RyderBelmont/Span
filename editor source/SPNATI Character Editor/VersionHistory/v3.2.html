<h3>Dialogue Editor</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Dialogue lines now have a delete button to make it more apparent how to delete them.</li>
    <li>Conditions can now be starred, which will pull them in by default for every case.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Output synchronization</h3>
Some changes have been made to make the behaviour.xml output more consistent with what make_xml.py produces. <strong>This will result in a one-time mess of a diff when merging since things will shuffle around substantially.</strong>

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Lines Per MB and Folder Size (MB) charts no longer count files that aren't included in the published website.</li>
    <li>Character Validator now has a Copy to Clipboard button and long warnings can be scrolled.</li>
    <li>Validation fixes for false positives related to human targets</li>
</ul>

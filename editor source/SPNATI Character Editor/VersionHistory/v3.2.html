<h3>Dialogue Editor</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Dialogue lines now have a delete button to make it more apparent how to delete them.</li>
    <li>Conditions can now be favorite (star icon), which will pull them in by default for every case.</li>
    <li>Respond to This and Writing Aid can now create responses for lines that have both Target and AlsoPlaying conditions.</li>
    <li>Auto-responses can now use Target Saying Marker and Also Playing Saying Marker if all lines in the case set the same marker.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Auto-Save</h3>
You can now configure the editor to auto-save at a set interval <strong>(File > Setup... > Auto-save)</strong>. You will need to supply your user name for this feature to work, and only open characters whose writer contains that user name will be saved.

<h3>Validator</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Validation errors for one or all characters can be copied to the clipboard.</li>
    <li>Mismatched italics are now flagged.</li>
    <li>Wardrobes where a major article's position should probably be listed as "both"" instead of just "upper"" or "lower" are now flagged, since these prevent targetStatus:decent checks from working properly.</li>
    <li>Epilogue validation added</li>
</ul>

<h3>Output synchronization</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Some changes have been made to make the behaviour.xml output more consistent with what make_xml.py produces as well as keep consistent sorting.
        <br />
        <strong style="color:red">This substantially shuffles how lines are sorted, so the first time saving in this version will create massive changes in behaviour.xml file when merging.</strong> The lines and their triggers should not be changed; they're just being moved to a different location in the xml.
    </li>
    <li>Italics are saved as &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; rather than &lt;i&gt;. This is to match make_xml.py, and becauase the latter was never valid XML in the first place. This does not impact line writing in any way, just how they get saved.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Alternate Skin Support</h3>
The editor can now save, load and validate character reskins.

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Lines Per MB and Folder Size (MB) charts no longer count files that aren't included in the published website.</li>
    <li>Add menu no longer allows adding case types that are invalid for the current stage (ex. Hand (Good) in the Finished stage))</li>
    <li>Character Validator now has a Copy to Clipboard button and long warnings can be scrolled.</li>
    <li>Validation fixes for false positives related to human targets</li>
    <li>Characters are filtered by size again when targeting "female chest visible" or "male crotch visible"</li>
    <li>Importing a .txt file with a plural wardrobe item no longer replaces the item with "new item"</li>
    <li>Case sensitivity for markers is preserved when importing from .txt</li>
    <li>Fixed crash when trying to save a case that doesn't apply to any stage</li>
    <li>Misc. bug fixes</li>
</ul>

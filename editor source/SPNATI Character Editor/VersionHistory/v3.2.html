</ul>

<h3>Validator</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Validation errors for one or all characters can be copied to the clipboard.</li>
    <li>Mismatched italics are now flagged.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Output synchronization</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Some changes have been made to make the behaviour.xml output more consistent with what make_xml.py produces.
        <br />
        <strong style="color:red">This substantially shuffles how lines are sorted, so the first time saving in this version will create massive changes in behaviour.xml file when merging.</strong> The lines and their triggers should not be changed; they're just being moved to a different location in the xml.
    </li>
    <li>Italics are saved as &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; rather that &lt;i&gt;. This is to match make_xml.py, and becauase the latter was never valid XML in the first place. This does not impact line writing in any way, just how they get saved.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Alternate Skin Support</h3>
The editor can now save, load and validate character reskins.

<h3>Dialogue Editor</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Adding conditions that use selection fields (targets, markers, etc.) will now automatically bring up the selection screen, saving a click. You can disable this behavior in File > Setup.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Epilogue Editor</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Sprites can now be sheared (skewed).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Pose Lists</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The cropping popup now has an "Adjust Part Transparencies" button to adjust body part/clothing transparencies when using the Reimport button.</li>
    <li>Crop information can now be edited manually in the cropping popup.</li>
    <li>An option has been added under the "More" button to opt out of the editor's code pre-processor (centering the character, adjusting zoom, and so forth). When this is selected the code will be imported into KKL just as if you'd used the Import button inside KKL itself. 
    This is useful for complex scenes where the editor's pre-processing would knock everything out of whack.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Pose Maker</h3>
<ul>
    <li>It's now possible to animate a sprite's image by changing its src in a keyframe.</li>
    <li>Sprites can now be sheared (skewed).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Validator</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Validation now flags characters that have no clothing tagged as plural but it thinks they should (using very rudimentary guessing).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Screenshot Taker</h3>
<ul>
    <li>A "Screenshot" tab is now available in Character workspaces which lets you take and crop a screenshot of whatever is currently visible in Kisekae.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tools</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Added a "Configure Game" option to the Tools menu which allows you to configure the offline game to enable debug mode, unlock all epilogues, etc.</li>
    <li>Added a "Fix Kisekae" option to the Tools menu. This automates the process of cleaning up corrupted data preventing the editor from importing anything.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Fixed issue with Data Recovery tool when the data recovery folder contains non-snapshot files.</li>
    <li>Incomplete characters can now have clothing layers added or removed.</li>
    <li>Fixed issue with validator complaining about multiple scene transitions even when there aren't.</li>
    <li>Fixed crash in Writing Aid with characters whose called out cases were corrupted by importing from .txt</li>
    <li>Fixed issue where creating a response with a character who appears in a Filter condition on the case being responded to would put that condition into the response.</li>
    <li>Fixed issue where exporting and reimporting a character from a text file would lose connections to editor.xml information (situations, notes, etc.).</li>
    <li>Fixed issue in Writing Aid where the "Jump To Situation" arrow wouldn't jump to the right line.</li>
    <li>Fixed issue where pose thumbnails would bleed across characters' pose lists.</li>
    <li>Alternate costumes will no longer lose their "set" attribute when saved.</li>
    <li>Importing poses with image attachments will no longer insert the full image path into KKL, which could contain your PC's username and inadvertently put personal information into a pose list if you reexported the code.</li>
    <li>Speech bubble arrows are now a consistent size in the epilogue editor instead of ranging form tiny to huge.</li>
</ul>

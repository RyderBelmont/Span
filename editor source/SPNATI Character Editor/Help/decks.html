			<h1>Overview</h1>
			Custom decks allow the player to personalize their experience. They can pick and choose cards to play with from any deck they have unlocked.
		</section>
		<section class="card">
			<h1>Card Images</h1>
			To create a deck, you will need to create images for your cards. The editor will not help you with this. Cards should have a 3:4 aspect ratio and their file names should be in the form
			<i>&lt;suit&gt;&lt;rank&gt;.png from 1-13 for each suit.</i> Examples:
			<table>
				<tr>
					<td><b>File Name</b></td>
					<td><b>Card</b></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>heart2</td>
					<td>2 of Hearts</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>clubs8</td>
					<td>8 of Clubs</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>diamo12</td>
					<td>Queen of Diamonds</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>spade1</td>
					<td>Ace of Spades</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<br />
			These images should be placed in a folder under the <b>img</b> directory. If desired, you can make different sets of card fronts for the same deck in the same folder by using a NUMBERLESS prefix (ex. a_heart1.png, b_heart1.png).
			It's possible to make partial sets (ex. only hearts and diamonds) or partial ranks (ex. only face cards).

			<h1>Creating a Deck</h1>
			In the toolbar, go to Decks... and type the key for your new deck. The name of the folder you put your images in is a good choice. Click Create to create the new deck.
		</section>
		<section class="card">
			<h1>Editing a Deck</h1>
			In the toolbar, go to Decks... and search for a previously created deck.

			Deck Properties:
			<br/>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Title:</b> The name of the deck as it will appear in game</li>
				<li><b>Subtitle:</b> A subtitle for the deck as it will appear in game</li>
				<li><b>Description:</b> A brief description or flavor text for the deck</li>
				<li><b>Credits:</b> Who made the artwork</li>
				<li><b>Character/Collectible:</b> You can tie unlocking a deck to unlocking a particular collectible by specifying a character and collectible here. If blank, the deck will be available by default.</li>
				<li><b>Status:</b> Where this deck should be available. Blank means it's available in all versions of the game where custom decks are allowed.</li>
				<li><b>Card Back:</b> Use + and - to add or remove backs. Click ... to navigate to an image to use for the selected card back. This image should be inside the img folder.</li>
				<li><b>Card Front:</b> The editor will locate any folders within the img folder that it thinks contains deck images (based on the naming conventions above). Use the magnifying glass to find your set of images. Use the + to add another set of fronts.</li>

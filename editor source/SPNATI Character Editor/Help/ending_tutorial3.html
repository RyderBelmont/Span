            This tutorial assumes you have completed Parts 1 and 2, since it will build off of the same epilogue. For this tutorial, we'll be adding a fade effect to the orb, to give it an explosion.

            <h1>Flash Effect</h1>
            First we'll add a flash effect to the orb's explosion.
            <ol>
                <li>Open up your epilogue and select the last directive in the Scene: Blue scene. This should be a "Pause".</li>
                <li>Add a "Clear Speech Bubbles" directive.</li>
                <li>Add a new sprite (Add Directive > Add Sprite). Use ep_flash.png from Florina's folder.</li>
                <li>Give this sprite an ID of "flash".</li>
                <li>Drag the flash to the center of the orb, around (X: -335, Y: 1176).</li>
                <li>Find the Opacity (0-100) in the Property Table and set it to 0 so the flash starts off invisible.</li>
                <li>Set <span class="label">Scale X</span>: 1 and <span class="label">Scale Y</span>: 1. These are the default values, but we're going to animate them so we need to set them explicitly.</li>
                <li>Add an "Animate Sprite/Emitter" directive.</li>
                <li>Set the ID to "flash" to associate with the flash sprite.</li>
                <li>Set the animation's time to 0.2.</li>
                <li>Put the mouse over the corner of the flash's box in the preview canvas and drag it to scale the flash. Alternatively, manually set <span class="label">Scale X</span>: 5 and <span class="label">Scale Y</span>: 5.</li>
                <li>Drag the opacity slider to full, or type in 100.</li>
                <li>Add a key frame.</li>
                <li>Set <span class="label">Time</span>: 0.4, <span class="label">Scale X</span>: 1, <span class="label">Scale Y</span>: 1, and <span class="label">Opacity</span>: 0.</li>
                <li>Preview the animation. The flash should grow quickly and disappear. This is easiest to see if you have the @0.4s key frame selected.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>
        <section class="card">
            <h1>Vanishing orb</h1>
            The orb exploded, so it should go away. This section isn't doing anything we haven't already covered, so it'll be brief.
            <ol>
                <li>Add an animation directive for ID: orb.</li>
                <li>Set <span class="label">Time</span>: 0.2, <span class="label">Delay</span>: 0.2, and <span class="label">Opacity</span>: 0.</li>
                <li>These settings will cause the animation to play 0.2s in, coinciding with when the flash is at its largest point, and finish after 0.2s, coinciding with the end of the flash.</li>
                <li>Play through the scene and verify everything looks correct. By the end, only Florina should be left.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>
        <section class="card">
            <h1>Screen Fade</h1>
            To add to the flash's intensity, we'll make the whole screen go bright yellow.
            <ol>
                <li>Add a "Fade Effect" directive.</li>
                <li>Set the opacity to 100. The whole screen goes black.</li>
                <li>Set <span class="label">Time</span>: 0.3.</li>
                <li>In the color field, type FFFFC6. This method lets you type exact RGB hex codes rather than using the color picker.</li>
                <li>Add a key frame to the fade effect.</li>
                <li>Set <span class="label">Opacity</span>: 0.</li>
                <li>Play through the scene. The whole screen should flash now.</li>
            </ol>

        <section class="card">
            <h1>Clothing Damage</h1>
            As required when using summoning orbs in the world of SPNATI, its explosion must destroy clothing. We'll do this by swapping out Florina's image with another one.
            <ol>
                <li>Select the Add sprite (sprite1) directive at the start of Scene: Blue. Change the ID to "florina" so that it's easier to tell at a glance what we're animating.</li>
                <li>Select Scene: Blue and add an "Animate Sprite/Emitter" directive. This will add it to the bottom of the scene.</li>
                <li>Set the ID of the animation directive to "florina"</li>
                <li>Under the Source field, click the ... and choose 6-embarrassed.png from Florina's folder.</li>
                <li>Florina is a bit stretched out. This is because the old image and new one aren't the same width.</li>
                <li>It's generally better to make your source images the same dimensions for situations like this, but since Florina's assets weren't designed with epilogue tutorials in mind, we'll just work around it.</li>
                <li>Grab the left or right edge of Florina's box and pull it in until she looks good. Alternatively, manually set <span class="label">Scale X</span>: 0.70. </li>
                <li>Finally, so that her clothes don't disappear until the flash, set the Delay to 0.3 seconds.</li>
                <li>Select the Animate (florina) line again in the Scene view and press Ctrl+Space. This will add a "Wait for Input" pause after it. Every directive type has a keyboard shortcut so you don't have to go through the Add Directive menu.</li>
            </ol>

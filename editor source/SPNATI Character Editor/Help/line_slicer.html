            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <p>
                The Line Slicer is a reporting tool (found under the tabs in a character's workspace) used to get at-a-glance information about what game conditions you're covering in your dialogue. For instance, you can use this tool to view how many lines are targeting male "must strip" situations vs female.

            <p>The three main components of the Line Slicer are as follows:
            <ol>
                <li><span class="label">Slices list</span>: This lists the slices of data in the order they are stacked.</li>
                <li><span class="label">Slice Properties</span>:This displays the properties for the selected Slice, normally controlling how the data is grouped.</li>
                <li><span class="label">Data</span>: This graph constantly updates to give you a graphical representation of the data slices and groups you've set up.</li>
            </ol>

            <h1>How It Works</h1>
            To start, you must add a type of data to slice up. Most common case conditions (ex. Target, Also Playing, Said Marker, etc.) are available for selection to slice.<br/>
            When multiple slices are added, it will branch out like a tree, performing subsequent slices on each group from the previous slice. In the screenshot above, there are two slices: Case Type and Also Playing.<br/>
            Case Type has two groups: Self Must Strip, which is a user-defined group containing the four Must Strip (Self) case types, and Other is a default group for every other case type that isn't in another group. Also Playing has two groups as well: a group for cases that target Also Playing: Catria, and a group that targets Also Playing: someone else.
            <br/>
            When building the graph, it first slices the case type (the first slice in the list), dividing dialogue lines into 17 for the Self Must Strip group, and 150 lines for Other.<br/>
            Next, it deals with each of those buckets separately for the next slice (Also Playing). The 17 must strip lines are further divided into 4 involving Catria, and 13 involving someone else. The 150 other lines are then divided into 59 involving Catria and 91 involving someone else.

            <h1>Filters and Grouping</h1>
            You can filter out which lines you're actually interested in for a slice by clicking on a slice in the Slices list (section 1 of the image above). This will open its properties in section 2. Most slice types will prepopulate some sensible defaults. Working with groups varies based on the data type, but the general operations are as follows:
            <ul>
                <li>Use the search field to add a group.</li>
                <li>Toggle a checkbox to hide that group from the graph.</li>
                <li>Click the dot to combine two groups into one, or to split a combined group back into its individual components.</li>
                <li>Click the pencil to rename a group.</li>
                <li>Click the X to completely delete a group.</li>
                <li>For ranges, a slider appears at the top of the properties. Right click on the slider to divide the range in two. Right click a split point to delete it and combine adjacent intervals.</li>
            </ul>

            The first time you run the Character Editor, it will ask where you have downloaded the GitLab source to.
            Navigate to the root level of your game folder (i.e. the one containing the js, css, opponents folders, etc.).
            The editor needs to know this information so it knows where to read character information from, among other things.

        <section class="card" id="create">
            <h1>Creating a New Character</h1>
            Once you've finished setup, you are ready to create a new character (<a href="file.html#new">File &gt; New</a>).
            Give your character a folder name. This is <strong>not</strong> their in-game name. It is merely the name of the folder that will be placed in the opponents directory.

            <h1>Testing Your Character In-Game</h1>
            The act of creating your character should've already added it to the offline version of the game with an "in-testing" icon.
            <div class="warning">
                <h5><i class="fa fa-warning"></i>For Private Testing Only</h5>
                This was done by updating listing.xml. Do not commit this file with Git. The mods will do it.

            <h1>Submitting Your Finished Character</h1>
            When your character is finished, you still need to go through the standard process of putting them on the testing tables and getting people to vouch for the character's readiness.

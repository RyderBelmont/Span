            <h1>Testing Your Character In-Game</h1>
            Once you're ready to try out your character in game, go to the Metadata tab and click "Add to Listing." This will make your character available for character selection in the offline version of the game.
            <div class="warning">
                <h5><i class="fa fa-warning"></i>For Private Testing Only</h5>
                While this option does the same thing as the steps necessary to actually add the character to the final game, this is meant strictly for private testing purposes. In short, <strong>don't commit listing.xml</strong> when you are pushing your character's files to the repository.

            <h1>Submitting Your Finished Character</h1>
            When your character is finished, you still need to go through the standard process of putting them on the testing tables and getting people to vouch for the character's readiness.

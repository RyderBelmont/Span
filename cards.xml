            Each <front> element describes the paths to the card-front images for a card set.

            The `src` attribute describes a *pattern* of image paths, which the game will automatically
            fill in for each applicable card suit and rank for that front.

            Within the `src` attribute value, %s will be filled in with the card suit ID:
            - Spades: `spade`
            - Clubs: `clubs`
            - Diamonds: `diamo`
            - Hearts: `heart`

            %i will be filled in with the numerical rank of the card:
            - Ace: 1
            - number cards: the actual number (2 - 10)
            - Jack: 11
            - Queen: 12
            - King: 13

            The pattern `%s%i` therefore matches the naming scheme for the default cards:
            - Ace of Spades => `spade1`
            - 2 of Clubs => `clubs2`
            - Jack of Diamonds: `diamo11`
            - King of Hearts: `heart13`
            
            The `suit` attribute can be used to specify a space-separated list of suits to which this pattern applies.
            The suit name can be abbreviated: "diamonds", "diamo", and "d" all refer to the suit of diamonds, for example.
            Suit names are also case-insensitive.
            By default, if no `suit` is provided, the pattern is assumed to apply to all suits.

            The `rank` attribute can be used to specify the card ranks to which this pattern applies.
            This uses the usual interval notation.
            Aces are considered to be both rank 1 and rank 14: "1-13" and "2-14", therefore, refer to all possible card ranks.
            By default, patterns are assumed to apply to all card ranks.

            Multiple <front> elements can be listed, to describe multiple image path patterns.
            If a given card has multiple possible image paths, it is undefined which one is actually used.
            Card sets do not need to be complete: you don't have to have an image for every card in a suit, and you don't have to fill in all suits.
        -->

        <!--
            Examples:

            Specify an image for the Ace of Spades in particular:
            <front suit="spade" rank="14" src="img/my-cards/ace_of_spades.jpg" />

            Specify images for Jacks, Queens, and Kings only (of all suits):
            <front rank="11-13" src="img/my-cards/%s%i.jpg" />

            Specify images for Hearts only (of all ranks):
            <front suit="hearts" src="img/my-cards/%s%i.jpg" />
        -->

        <front src="img/cards/default/%s%i.jpg" />

        <!--
            Each <back> element lists the path to a single card back image.
            Each back image needs an ID that is unique within the set (though IDs can be re-used in different sets).
            Multiple card back images can be listed in a single set.

            A <collectible> element can be used to tie a card set to a collectible, so that
            unlocking the collectible unlocks the card set for use as well.

            "character" should be the ID of the character with the collectible,
            and "id" should be the collectible's ID.

            Each set can only be tied to a single collectible.

            Tags are adjectives that define characteristics about your character. These allow other characters to target dialogue towards your character without targeting your character specifically.
            <br/>
            On the left is a list of categories, the middle a grid for the selected category, and the right an overview of all tags currently applied.
            <br/>
            Tags can be added or removed mid-game based on what stage the character is in. For each category, fill out the stages that a particular tag belongs in. If a tag is used all game (for instance, your character has black hair from beginning to end), you can use the "Select All" column to auto-check the entire row. For tags that don't apply all game (for instance, your character has a hat but loses it after three rounds), check only those columns where the tag applies.
            <br/>
            If there is something unique that doesn't have a tag already, you can add them free-text in the table, but this should only be a last resort, as it's unlikely anyone will ever target something that isn't an official tag.

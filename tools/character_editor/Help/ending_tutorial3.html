            This tutorial assumes you have completed Parts 1 and 2, since it will build off of the same epilogue. For this tutorial, we'll be adding a fade effect to the orb, to give it an explosion.

            <h1>Flash Effect</h1>
            First we'll add a flash effect to the orb's explosion.
            <ol>
                <li>Open up your epilogue and select the Blue scene.</li>
				<li>Select the "Oh no!" action in the Actions list.</li>
				<li>Toggle the "Oh no!" speech bubble to have a fixed length so it doesn't persist into the next action, if necessary.</li>
				<li>Add a new Action.</li>
                <li>Add a new sprite. Use ep_flash.png from Florina's folder.</li>
                <li>Give this sprite an ID of "flash".</li>
                <li>Drag the flash to the center of the orb, around (X: -335, Y: 1176).</li>
                <li>Find the Opacity (0-100) in the Property Table and set it to 0 so the flash starts off invisible.</li>
                <li>Set <span class="label">Scale X</span>: 1 and <span class="label">Scale Y</span>: 1. These are the default values, but we're going to animate them so we need to set them explicitly.</li>
                <li>Drag the time marker to 0.25s.</li>
                <li>Put the mouse over the corner of the flash's box in the preview canvas and drag it to scale the flash. Alternatively, manually set <span class="label">Scale X</span>: 5 and <span class="label">Scale Y</span>: 5.</li>
                <li>Drag the opacity slider to full, or type in 100.</li>
				<li>Move the time marker to 0.5s.</li>
                <li>Set <span class="label">Scale X</span>: 1, <span class="label">Scale Y</span>: 1, and <span class="label">Opacity</span>: 0.</li>
                <li>Preview the animation. The flash should grow quickly and disappear.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>
        <section class="card">
            <h1>Vanishing orb</h1>
            The orb exploded, so it should go away.
            <ol>
                <li>Toggle the orb to have a fixed length. The orb's bar in the timeline will shrink to its final keyframe, and the diagonal lines extending to the right will disappear.</li>
                <li>Play the action and verify it looks correct. By the end, only Florina should be left.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>
        <section class="card">
            <h1>Screen Fade</h1>
            To add to the flash's intensity, we'll make the whole screen go bright yellow.
            <ol>
                <li>Select the camera's first keyframe in the timeline.</li>
				<li>Type 0 into the opacity to force a keyframe.</li>
				<li>In the color field, type FFFFC6. This method lets you type exact RGB hex codes rather than using the color picker.</li>
				<li>Move the time marker to 0.25s.</li>
                <li>Set the opacity to 100. The whole screen goes yellow.</li>
				<li>Move the time marker to 0.5s.</li>
                <li>Set <span class="label">Opacity</span>: 0.</li>
                <li>Play through the scene. The whole screen should flash now.</li>
            </ol>

            <h1>Clothing Damage</h1>
            As required when using summoning orbs in the world of SPNATI, its explosion must destroy clothing. We'll do this by swapping out Florina's image with another one.
            <ol>
                <li>Select Florina's sprite (named "calm"). We should name this "florina" so that it's easier to tell at a glance what we're animating.</li>
				<li>However, the fields are disabled. You can only edit an object's attributes in the action where it was created.</li>
				<li>Select the first action ("But you won't really...")</li>
				<li>Select the calm sprite again. Now you can rename it to "florina".</li>
				<li>Go back to the last action. It's probably named "Move Camera". Let's give it a better name by typing "Clothing Damage" into the Name field.</li>
				<li>Select Florina's sprite.</li>
				<li>Move the time marker to 0.25s.</li>
                <li>Under the Source field, click the ... and choose 6-embarrassed.png from Florina's folder.</li>
                <li>Florina is a bit stretched out. This is because the old image and new one aren't the same width.</li>
                <li>It's generally better to make your source images the same dimensions for situations like this, but since Florina's assets weren't designed with epilogue tutorials in mind, we'll just work around it.</li>
				<li>Make sure the time marker is still at 0.25s.</li>
                <li>Grab the left or right edge of Florina's box and pull it in until she looks good. Alternatively, manually set <span class="label">Scale X</span>: 0.70. </li>
				<li>Since we have never set the scale before, it will apply even before this point. To remedy that, select the Scale X key frame and change its type to "Begin keyframe" using the button in the timeline toolbar.</li>
            </ol>

Please follow this particular comment and replies for the full list. There's more after this one!

/Hair:/ NOTE: Avoid tagging if the character's hair isn't visible from the start.

Hair colors:

black_hair

blonde

brunette (Brown hair, NOT black)

ginger (Red/orange/similar hair)

white_hair (White/gray/silver hair)

Exotic hair (This is a catch-all for multi-colored or otherwise exotic hair, with the following as sub-tags):

blue_hair (Blue/aqua/cyan hair)
green_hair
pink_hair
purple_hair
/Hair Length:/

bald: For a character with no hair on their head.

short_hair: For hair that does not pass the jawline.

medium_hair: For hair that goes below the jaw and may reach the shoulders.

long_hair: For hair that goes beyond the shoulders.

very_long_hair: For hair that reaches the thighs or beyond. A character with this tag also has the long_hair supertype.
/Hair Style:/

drill_hair (The character sports anime-style drill hair. Nugi-chan is an example.)

messy_hair (The character's hair is notably untidy.)

ponytail (The character has their hair up in ponytail)

twintails (The character's hair is fashioned into two tails. These can be located anywhere on the head.)

/Eye colors:/

NOTE: Avoid tagging if the character's eyes aren't visible from the start.

NOTE: If your character's eyes are different colours, do not tag eye color. Your character will likely be specifically targeted for it.

dark_eyes (Black/brown/dark gray)

blue_eyes

pale_eyes (White/medium-light gray)

green_eyes

violet_eyes (Pink/purple)

red_eyes

amber_eyes (Orange/Yellow)

dark-skinned: For anything north of general brownness

fair-skinned: For characters in the ruddy white to lighter asiatic skin tones.

pale-skinned: For characters that see minimal sunlight or are extremely pale.

tan_lines: For characters with visible tan_lines. This filter should only be used on characters after a chest or crotch reveal, anything sooner warrants a targeted line.

unusual_skin: For skin colors beyond the Crayola box, including green, grey, and so forth

/Physical builds:/

athletic: Characters that are traditionally athletic; they’re thin but have defined builds. (EG not skinnyfat).

muscular: Characters that are built, with overt musculature. Muscular characters usually have defined abs, large arms, or formidable legs. Characters with the muscular tag should also have the athletic supertype tag.

chubby: Characters that have pronounced body fat. This can be anything from a little extra, a beer belly, to larger sizes.

short: Characters that are pronouncedly small. (EG, Futaba)

tall: Characters that are overtly larger than most other characters. (EG, Aella).

androgynous: Characters that resemble their opposite sex. This includes tomboys who dress in masculine clothing, or men who dress in effeminate gear. (EG this tag, when used in conjunction with male_X or female_X should output lines like “Huh, you like to dress like the opposite sex, ~name~.”) This is supposed to be extremely broad, with the intuitiveness and rancor of the lines based on the gender targeted and character speaking.

/Pubic hair:/

hairy: Characters with high volumes. Note, this does not indicate any character without grooming, but more for exceptionally hairy genitals.

shaved: The character lacks pubic hair due to grooming techniques.

trimmed: Characters with overt styling, either as a result of previously shaving, trimming to a conspicuous length, or doing a design. More specific concerns likely warrant a targeted line.

/Attribute sizes: /

NOTE: These should correspond to a character’s size category, and is mostly used for multiple incidences of the same size using count-filter:X, or for characters ogling another in their underwear. Please note that for the latter situation, a targeted line will usually yield best results.

medium_breasts

large_breasts

huge_breasts (For truly monumental mammaries. Characters with this tag should also have the large_breasts tag.)

medium_penis

large_penis

alien (The character is visibly of extraterrestrial origin, or freely mentions it.)

spirit (The character is of an otherworldly/paranormal/religious origin, such as an angel, ghost, fairy, or genie.

succubus (The character is visibly a succubus (Morrigan), or freely mentions being one (Kurumu). A character with the succubus tag also has the monster tag.)

scantily-clad (The character starts the game with revealing or minimal clothing.)

school_uniform

/Sexual Orientation:/

NOTE: These tags should be used mostly as a reference to how the character is written in SPNatI. If a character’s canon lacks sufficient information, it’s okay to omit a sexuality tag. Some characters will react to both sexes, but this does not necessarily make them bisexual.

gay (The character is male and exclusively attracted to other males.)

lesbian (The character is female and exclusively attracted to other females.)

/Relationship status:/

NOTE: Ideally, your character shouldn't be written as "taken" unless they officially are in their source canon (so avoid shipping). A player will want your character to be interested in them, after all.

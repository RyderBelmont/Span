## Notes to Self / Things to Try
- Tag-filtered flirting
- Mixing multiple traits (or touchstones?) together in lines to generate more ideas
- Aside from being normal, Mari is quite sharp-- both in book smarts and in emotional intelligence.
  - She could be someone who could perhaps try to "pick apart" other characters' settings, motivations, personalities, etc.
  - Someone who'd try to analyze them and so on, specifically from the perspective of a normal person-- without thinking of meta aspects or anything like that.
- Also try playing up her overbearing or "control freak" aspects, and have her (subtly or not) try to push other characters into acting certain ways.
  - Of course, she'd be doing this with their best interests in mind, but it's naturally gonna rankle some characters-- which fits with her.

## Character Traits
- Mari is, of course, kind and caring, always willing to lend a hand where necessary.
- She also loves to flirt with and tease people, especially those who get flustered or embarrassed easily.
  - On the other hand, she's less interested in those who are more forward with her.
- She's also here to decompress and take a break from all of the stress / pressure in her life.
- That said, she's still a perfectionist, and also has a competitive side. 
- Though, she still likes cutting loose and being a bit "wild", so she's not going to be a particularly sore loser (except in certain cases).
  - This might be a case of her subconsciously adjusting to circumstances; if she can't take control over the game, she'll instead amp up her teasing and flirtiness, getting all eyes on her-- and taking control in that way, all the same.
- The sheer amount of work that's been piled on her (and that she's piled on _herself_) has left her a bit socially isolated as of late.
  - In particular, Hero's the only one of the main friends she regularly interacts with (because their apartments are close together); everyone else is too far apart for her to visit on a regular basis.
- She's pretty emotionally intelligent, and is probably good at reading people, interpreting their character and emotions.
  - She's also pretty good at predicting how people will react to things, though she may lose her footing a bit if her predictions turn out to be wrong.
- She's also a bit overbearing, pushing herself and her standards onto others without really considering what _they_ want, even if it makes them uncomfortable.
  - Though, it's likely that she'll make a conscious effort to avoid being *too* pushy (having seen how it can affect others, with the whole recital incident).
- This kind of points to her being a bit of a control freak: she likes being in control over the situation.
  - On a related note, she also likes making plans; she's kind of a natural schemer (and perhaps a tinge manipulative), though this is all with good intent.
  - If she notices that it's hurting someone or making them uncomfortable, she'll stop.
  - She doesn't like it when things don't go to plan, but in most cases she'll adjust quickly.
  - Of course, she's not going to readily admit to being overbearing or a control freak, and of course, everything she does comes from a good place.
- She wants the people around her to be happy and wants to help them be the best they can be, even if it means pushing them a little.
- She particularly dislikes having to rely on others; this might be because she can't trust them to live up to her expectations.
  - This is probably why she's in love with Hero: he's one of the few people she can really hold to her own standards, and that she can trust to live up to her expectations. It also helps that he gets flustered easily, making it endlessly fun to tease him.
- Conversely, she particularly likes being relied on, herself. She likes taking care of others, and will push herself to meet their expectations.
- In addition, Mari does not know how to hit the brakes: when she's fired up, she'll just keep pushing on and on, trying to drag everyone along with her.
  - She'll take things as challenges, get more annoyed when people try to slow her down or push against her, and flirt harder and harder-- she becomes more *intense* the more fired up she gets, and she doesn't usually slide backwards for very long.


## Targeting Details

Now that I'm actually sitting down and thinking about this, here are some ideas for ways to target Mari:

- Asking her about college and piano studies might make for a good opener, especially if you can lead into talking about things like stress, pressure, or being overworked. Alternately: why does she do all this? What's her end goal?
- Her relationship status might also be a good topic. There's not many people at the Inventory who are _currently_ in a relationship (off the top of my head, I can only think of Marinette and Adrien), and an open relationship isn't something you see every day.
- Her expectations of others could also make a good topic. I've mentioned this in other places, but she's kind of a control freak: she will try to push people in certain directions, if she thinks they would be better off for it... regardless of what they actually want, and to an extent, regardless of how this hurts them.
  - This is also actually the reason why she's so flirty: she _likes_ seeing people get flustered and kinda having that 'edge' over others, in a sense.
  - Conversely, she will be less interested in people who are forward with her: trying to flirt with her will elicit an interesting reaction, in that she suddenly _won't_ be teasing and flirty.
  - This is also part of the reason why she starts acting so seductively in her later stages: if she can't take control of the game by winning, she'll take control of the game by drawing everyone's eyes and arousal, instead.
  - And, of course, this is what got her killed in canon. My current background notes for Mari also have this incident take place, but in a way that doesn't kill her; that said, it was still a big deal (it was a close brush with death, after all). It forced her to really reconsider how she was treating her brother, and for a time they both felt quite guilty over it.
    - That was years ago though, and by now it's just "oh yeah, that happened" to them... but for Mari, it's still a stark reminder of what happens if she goes too far.
- Mari has a competitive streak, so you can target that: maybe try to compete with her somehow, or even just ask her why she seems to be taking the game so seriously.
- Mari's also, of course, a perfectionist. It can admittedly be a bit hard to find ways for me to bring this up on my own (esp. in generics), but you might be able to engage her with something like "why do you put so much effort into [subject]", or even "how would you handle [something]? Why would you put so much effort into it?"
- She also likes baking and playing pranks, and she used to play softball (before injuring her knee). She's also thinking about flower arranging (but hasn't taken it up yet).
- You can, of course, also ask about her friends, or about subjects related to them:
  - Related to Hero:
    - Medicine
    - Cooking
    - Pressure and expectations (like Mari herself).
    - You could also ask about Mari needing to rely on other people; she normally doesn't like to do that (another aspect of her "control freak" personality), but I imagine she actually makes a unique exception for Hero.
      - I imagine this is actually a big reason why she loves him so much: he's one of the few people she can absolutely trust and hold to the expectations she sets for herself.
    - On that note, asking her about why she loves him in general could also be good.
  - For Kel:
    - Sports
    - Comics
    - Other 'childish' things like that
    - ...but you could also ask about someone who's been overlooked by everyone around him.
    - Or about someone who's constantly living in someone else's shadow.
  - For Basil:
    - Photography
    - Flowers
    - Absent / neglectful parents
    - Loneliness
    - Or more abstractly, memories.
  - For Aubrey:
    - Delinquents
    - Cute animals
    - Neglectful parents and bad homes
    - Being an outcast in a small community
    - Quite possibly religion as well?
  - For Sunny:
    - the violin (or just music in general)
    - Art
    - The experience of being a sibling
    - Overly-high expectations / being overbearing
    - Guilt (again)


## About the Friends

Just because Mari's alive doesn't mean everyone's problems just went away. They're not quite as bad as in canon, and they might take on slightly different forms for her and Basil's SPNATI representation, but they're still there, and they're still quite serious.

- Mari being alive won't make her parents stop pressuring her, nor will it make Hero's parents stop pressuring him.
- It probably won't stop Kel's parents from overlooking him, nor will it really bring him out from his brother's shadow.
- It won't make Basil's parents care about their son.
- It won't make Aubrey's parents or her home life any better, and I imagine she's still kind of a delinquent-- not to mention, she's from a family that's kind of a black mark on an otherwise affluent middle-class town/neighborhood.
  - As such, she's probably still a bit of an outcast in Faraway: the target of nasty gossip, accusing whispers, things like that.

That said, since Mari's there, she might have acted as a modulating influence, keeping at least a few of these problems from getting out of hand-- such as Kel's problems with his parents, or Aubrey's problems with the Faraway community.

Not to mention, she's still around to care for her friends, share their burdens, and generally provide solace for them. So, in general, everyone's a lot better off, even if things aren't completely perfect. 


## General Dialogue Notes (for all of the friends)

### Mari

Mari is very confident, energetic, and forceful (at least, from the dialogue we see in game)-- she's still thoughtful and careful with what she says, of course, but you'll find no hesitation in her words. You'll also find a lot of exclamations: instructions, admonishments, and just plain cheeriness too. When Mari says something, she typically believes in it, and more often than not she wants you to believe in it, too.
In terms of wording, she's casual and straightforward, much like Hero.

### Hero

I don't have a good read on Hero, but a quick glance over his dialogue dump indicates that he tends to be very thoughtful and (to an extent) hesitant-- ellipses and pauses are the order of the day, again, but not as much as you see in Basil's dialogue-- and his wording tends to be very casual and straightforward. Despite his usual hesitation when speaking, though, he still has a streak of confidence in him, especially once he gets going. He's also the type to readily dispense facts, trivia, unique observations, and of course, good old fashioned advice from an older brother.

### Sunny

I tend to write Sunny as speaking in extremely short and simple sentences-- usually somewhere around 2-5 words each-- with longer ideas often clipped into fragments.
These sentences cut straight to the heart of the matter-- after all, Sunny is known more for listening than for speaking.

### Basil

Basil, on the other hand, pauses frequently because he's often uncertain of what to say next; you'll find ellipses and breaks everywhere in his speech, not to mention some stuttering if he's really, really stressed.
I can also see his wording tending more towards the formal side, and he might also get a bit flowery in the right circumstances (no pun intended).
When Basil says something, he tends to doubt it, and implicitly or not, he usually wants your opinion on it as well.

### Kel

Kel is... well, Kel. Very energetic, frenetic, carefree, confident speech patterns-- lots of interjections and exclamations, with very casual and simple wording.
No purple prose here, but he might go on for a long time without stopping, if you can get him talking about something he's passionate about.

### Aubrey

I can actually see Aubrey speaking much the same way, just with anger replacing Kel's cheer; you should probably throw in some swearing here and there.
She lends herself more readily to moments of thoughtfulness than Kel, though, with accompanying changes in diction (more hesitant speech, with ellipses and sentences that trail off).

## The Incident

- Everything's the same up to the day of the whole stairs incident.
- The fight still happens, and Mari still gets pushed. However:
- Mari grabs hold of the railing before she can fall too far. She messes up her ankle pretty badly, but there's no permanent physical damage involved.
- Mari and Sunny cover up the whole thing by saying that Mari nearly slipped down the stairs by accident, and that Sunny dropped and broke the violin catching her. 
- Basil, I imagine, just goes along with this.

- That said, the fall scares the absolute shit out of both Mari and Sunny.
- Mari's forced to re-evaluate her tendencies to push herself+her expectations onto other people, particularly Sunny; it's kind of an "oh shit, have I been a bad sister this whole time?" moment for her.
- Sunny, meanwhile, is going through the whole "you loved her and you (almost) killed her" deal... though this manifests as just 'normal' guilt, instead of trippy Headspace/White Space/Black Space stuff.
- That said, they both accept that it was basically just an accident: Mari's the first to realize this, owing to her more mature perspective; meanwhile, it takes a bit of time (and many reassurances from Mari) to get Sunny to let go of his guilt.

- The other friends all do learn the truth behind the "push" deal eventually:
-- Basil obviously already knows, since he's there to see it all happen.
-- Hero learns early on, when Mari and asks him for advice on... well, everything that happened, in the immediate aftermath of the incident.
-- Kel and Aubrey are brought into the fold later, once the dust has had a chance to settle a bit.
-- They all, of course, agree to keep it a secret: a little white lie to keep the peace within Mari and Sunny's family.

- Eventually, this all just becomes "oh yeah, that's a thing that happened" to everyone involved.
- The memory still sticks around in Mari's head, though mostly as a reminder of "don't push others too far" (in the figurative sense).

        <note id="3">NB: Due to the nature of the fact that I can't tag three separate clothing items, automatic tagging will assume that your character will only be able to see Yuna, and not Megumi or Sachi-san. Keep this in mind as you write targets.

Megumi and Sachi are both taking off their ribbons. Use this information to target accordingly.</note>
        <note id="4">All three characters are taking off their shoes. Use this information to target accordingly.</note>
        <note id="5">NB- Sachi-san is losing her shirt, Megumi is losing her belt. Use this information to target accordingly.</note>
        <note id="6">NB: Megumi is taking off her dress, while Sachi is taking off her skirt. Use this information to target accordingly</note>
        <note id="7">NB- it should be obvious, but Megumi and Sachi are currently taking off their Bras.</note>
        <note id="8">It should also be obvious, but Megumi and Sachi are taking off their Panties.</note>
        <note id="10">Sachi actually calls computers this throughout the course of the game, it's honestly adorable.</note>

    <marker scope="Public" name="anankos">Lore stuff, in short: Anankos is both evil and not evil at the same time because reasons. Mentioning both in the same game might be kinda confusing so yea..</marker>
    <marker scope="Public" name="arco">Taking off the armor is quite a hassle for poor Corrin, but she complained about it a bit too often for my liking.</marker>

    <marker scope="Public" name="booksdontlie">Quote "Those books weren't lying!" when a male large crotch is visible. It's been hinted at that Nyx (character in FE:Fates, the one I referenced to about the Strip Poker book in Corrin's other lines) likes reading erotic novels, maybe Corrin stole some of them? :p</marker>
    <marker scope="Public" name="camp">Corrin's army camp. She spent quite a bit of time here in between battles.</marker>

    <marker scope="Public" name="chainsawsword">Corrin's sword is basically a magical chainsaw. That's kinda creepy but badass at the same time.</marker>

    <marker scope="Public" name="demstratz">Corrin asks if a character is intentionally taking something bigger off. I used it to get a followup that makes sense but marked it so you can do something with it if you want it.</marker>
    <marker scope="Public" name="dragon">Corrin can turn into a dragon (well, more like a deer-dragon hybrid IMO), that's basically it. </marker>
    <marker scope="Public" name="dragonstone">A dragonstone is needed for Corrin to transform into a dragon.</marker>

    <marker scope="Public" name="hotsprings">Corrin's army camp has hot springs. The springs are unisex so it's possible (and likely) for you to "accindentally" walk into the springs when members of the opposing gender are bathing (good shit, nintendo/IntSys)</marker>

    <marker scope="Public" name="playsafer">Corrin encourages the player to "play safer", as if that's possible in strip poker, but whatever, what does she know</marker>

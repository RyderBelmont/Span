        <text>"&lt;i&gt;Prometheus was punished by the gods for giving the gift of knowledge to man. He was cast into the bowels of the earth and pecked by birds.&lt;/i&gt;"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

A non-hostile turret you found somewhere in Aperture Science Laboritories after visiting with Chell. It occasionally speaks in cryptic non sequitur, but you can't shake the feeling they mean &lt;i&gt;something&lt;/i&gt;.</text>

        <text>A faded tri-fold board made for &lt;i&gt;Aperture Science Bring your Daughter to Work Day&lt;/i&gt;, seemingly for some kind of science fair.

	It's Shaggy! Like nobody calls me "Norville"!

Swell. I'll wait here and when you're ready to start playing for real, send me a telegram.

Let's do what we do best Scoob, eat.

Zoinks!

This game makes me so nervious, all I can think of is food!

Like, there's times I'll do anything for a Scoobie Snack

This is, like, the opposite of what I wanted to do today. 

	We have to remain calm.
	[Scooby screams]
	Shaggy: CALM SCOOBY DOO! YOU'RE NOT BEING CALM! 

	Dig this, daddy-o. It's a real gas. 

Look, I know I'm not handsome, but I'm no monster! 

Like, all that's missing is a spooky organ.
[an organ begins to play]
Velma Dinkley: It's not missing anymore!

	Great, but next time please don't do me any favors. 

	All of this watching you strip is making me hungry

	Like, Are these cards haunted?

We are panicked, panicked, PANICKED! 

	Man, this hand gives me, like, the heebie jeebies! 

	Man... I am one sad, dog food eating hippie! 

You sure nobody wants a sandwich? 

That’s okay ~player~ we’re scared enough for all three of us!

	And I would have gotten away with it if it hadn't have been for these meddling cards.

	This is tied for the most terrifying day of my life!
	Velma: Tied with what?
	Shaggy: Every other freaking day of my life!!

	"Ruh roh."

Like, being in a state of constant nudity makes me constantly hungry.

	The only thing I like better than an eggplant burger is a chocolate covered eggplant burger. 

I'm, like, up here, man.

I'm buff!

Why that's a whole week of nightmares, huh. 

Excuuuuuuuse me!

Step on it, ~player~!

I'm scared, man!

    <description>The Witch of Sandboxes. Her nature is Immersion. This Witch has strong preferences and never compromises. She is trying to build an acceptable sandcastle, but she can never satisfy herself. She has destroyed and rebuilt her castles so many times she doesn't even remember what she wanted to create in the first place. When she does manage to make a nice castle, she feels much better for a while, but ends up destroying it again. She looks like a young lady, but acts like a little child. If she is interrupted when she is playing with her sand, she cries and goes on a rampage.</description>

#Items of clothing should be listed here in order of removal.
#The values are formal name, lower case name, how much they cover, what they cover
#Please do not put spaces around the commas.
#"Important" clothes cover genitals (lower) or chest/breasts (upper). For example: bras, panties, a skirt when going commando.
#"Major" clothes cover underwear. For example: skirts, pants, shirts, dresses.
#"Minor" clothes cover skin or are large pieces of clothing that do not cover skin. For example: jackets, socks, stockings, gloves.
#"Extra" clothes are small items that may or may not be clothing but do not cover anything interesting. For example: jewelry, shoes or boots with socks underneath, belts, hats. In the rest of the code, "extra" clothes are called "accessory".
#If for some reason you write another word for the type of clothes (e.g. "accessory"), other characters will not react at all when the clothing is removed.
#What they cover = upper (upper body), lower (lower body), other (neither).
#The game can support any number of entries, but typically we use 2-8, with at least one "important" layer for upper and lower (each).

#Notes on dialogue
#All lines that start with a # symbol are comments and will be ignored by the tool that converts this file into a xml file for the game.
#Where more than one line has an identical type, like "swap_cards" and "swap_cards", the game will randomly select one of these lines each time the character is in that situation.
#You should try to include multiple lines for most stages, especially the final (finished) stage, -1. 

#A character goes through multiple stages as they undress. The stage number starts at zero and indicates how many layers they have removed. Special stage numbers are used when they are nude (-3), masturbating (-2), and finished (-1).
#Line types that start with a number will only display during that stage. The will override any numberless stage-generic lines. For example, in stage 4 "4-swap_cards" will be used over "swap_cards" if it is not blank here. Giving a character unique dialogue for each stage is an effective way of showing their changing openness/shyness as the game progresses.
#You can combine the above points and make multiple lines for a particular situation in a particular stage, like "4-swap_cards" and "4-swap_cards".

#Some special words can be used that will be substituted by the game for context-appropriate ones: ~name~ is the name of the character they're speaking to, but this only works if someone else is in focus. ~clothing~ is the type of clothing that is being removed by another player. ~Clothing~ is almost the same, but it starts with a capital letter in case you want to start a sentence with it.
#~name~ can be used any time a line targets an opponent (game_over_defeat, _must_strip, _removing_, _removed, _must_masturbate, etc).
#~clothing~ can be used only when clothing is being removed (_removing and _removed, but NOT _must_strip).
#~player~ can be used at any time and refers to the human player.
#~cards~ can be used only in the swap_cards lines.
#All wildcards can be used once per line only! If you use ~name~ twice, the code will show up the second time.

#Lines can be written that are only spoken when specific other characters are present. For a detailed explanation, read this guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/spnati/comments/6nhaj0/the_easy_way_to_write_targeted_lines/
#Here is an example line (note that targeted lines must have a stage number):
#0-female_must_strip,target:hermione=happy,Looks like your magic doesn't help with poker!

#POKER PLAY
#This is what a character says while they're exchanging cards and commenting on their hands afterwards.
#When swapping cards, the game will automatically put a display a number between 0-5 where you write ~cards~.
#These lines display on the screen for only a brief time, so it is important to make them short enough to read at a glance.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written
swap_cards=bored.png,Only ~cards.text~ cards.

swap_cards=interested.png,Let me think... ~cards.text~.
swap_cards=thinking.png,Hmm... ~cards.text~.
good_hand=talking.png,If enough magnates walk past you, speaking of gambling, then you may learn a few tricks to the trade.
good_hand=sly.png,I <i>think</i> this is good.
good_hand=confident.png,I'll be going on another round.
good_hand=confident.png,This is more than a game. Yet, I still intend to win.
good_hand=bored.png,These cards seem to match, so hopefully...
good_hand=sly.png,One of my best qualities has always been learning from those around me.
good_hand=sly.png,If I <i>am</i> a learning machine, I fear I'm one of the best.
good_hand=confident.png,Poker is not knowledge I was born into, and yet I've done rather well this round.
good_hand=talking.png,I've heard that my skin starts to sparkle when I'm overly happy, but I've never seen it myself.
okay_hand=talking.png,This is how it goes. Trying to fit skill-shaped blocks into luck-shaped holes.
okay_hand=bored.png,Meh. I've grown bored again.
okay_hand=thinking.png,Hmmm... Yes, I should last through this round with this hand.
okay_hand=unsure.png,We can't suggest a second swap?
okay_hand=talking.png,I once overheard about "counting cards". My memory deteriorates <i>much</i> less than most, so perhaps it'd be a good strategy?
okay_hand=lament.png,I wish I had <i>his</i> abilities with seeing omens about the future...
okay_hand=unsure.png,I'm sure I'll have to chat with ELIZA after all this to get my head straight.
okay_hand=sarcastic.png,Erm... I'm sure a critic would've docked their review of me for slow response times by now...
okay_hand=lament.png,I have this feeling that my perceptions are vastly different than the rest of you.
okay_hand=lament.png,Do you desire to succeed? I have no idea how any of you view life...
bad_hand=bored.png,My artist knew much more about poker. Strange he hasn't shown yet.
bad_hand=lament.png,Bad hand... I don't know... what I'm supposed to do now...
bad_hand=confused.png,My artist never played poker. I'm surprised I ever even took in the rules.
bad_hand=interested.png,Perhaps these cards are a portent?
bad_hand=annoyed.png,I did not spend hours stored in a cargo hold to lose upon my arrival here.
bad_hand=uncomfortable.png,The thought of losing again has become all too real.
bad_hand=uncomfortable.png,I'd likely be "sweating bullets" now... if I <i>could</i> that is.
bad_hand=lament.png,The gods have turned their favor against me.
bad_hand=confused.png,I'm afraid I still don't entirely understand this game.
bad_hand=sarcastic.png,How wonderful...
bad_hand=sarcastic.png,I do not appreciate this hand.

#SELF STRIPPING
#This is the character says once they've lost a hand, but before they strip.

#losing ring
0-must_strip=unsure.png,I know that a living statue sounds implausible. Many doubt it, myself included.
0-stripping=stripping.png,I've been told-- I'm an <i>animate</i>. Simply a preprogrammed piece of art, a life-like machine with a manufactured past.


#losing dress
1-stripped=stripped.png,If I am truly a machine, then I'm confined as to what I can say. But I wanted to test myself; I want to see what would happen in a situation no one could have foreseen.
1-must_strip=bored.png,All eyes on me... That's normal...
1-must_strip=thinking.png,Hmmm. Seeing as I have no footwear...
1-must_strip=talking.png,You want me to strip, yes? Very well.
1-must_strip,count-role;self&saidmarker;enf:=must_strip.png,It's been so long since I've been without this wretched dress... I'm almost scared to lose it.
1-must_strip,count-role;self&saidmarker;enf:=must_strip.png,I never realized how much I actually cared for being clothed. Until now, that is...
1-must_strip,test:~background~:beach=must_strip.png,I'm sure this thing has already been destroyed by sand. Not much sense in continuing to wear it.
1-must_strip_winning=bored.png,This was a long time coming.
1-must_strip_winning=must_strip.png,I remember back when I was <i>only</i> allowed to wear a dress. Oh well.
1-must_strip_normal=annoyed.png,I'll require no assistance, thank you.
1-must_strip_normal=confused.png,Do any of you care about my Turing Test or is this just about my body?
1-must_strip_normal=bored.png,I'd prefer to be talked to, than looked at. This isn't the gallery, after all.
1-must_strip_losing=bored.png,My inexperience was bound to catch up with me.
1-must_strip_losing=bored.png,Who was it that made an animate that played poker? Komininsky? I'll have to ask them for help later.
1-must_strip_losing=unsure.png,Everyone staring... The gallery wasn't much different, I suppose.
1-stripping=stripping.png,This horrid dress... I'd burn it if I could.
1-stripping=stripping.png,You'll all be happy to note that I'm as excited to get rid of this thing as you all are.
1-stripping=stripping.png,I believe it's known as a halter-top dress, but I'd call it a tablecloth, myself.
1-stripping,test:~background~:beach=stripping.png,It was such a disappointment, when I was told the ocean was only a large pool of water. Not that I've ever been in it.


#losing bra
2-stripped=talking.png,I've been told my skin sparkles in the correct light. I've never seen it for myself.
2-stripped=talking.png,If you're all going to stare, I'll just return to my neutral pose. I'm told moving around ruins the lines.
2-stripped=bored.png,Well, I been without my dress longer than with it. I think I'll live.
2-stripped=talking.png,I asked for clothes and this is what they brought for me. It's not much is it?
2-stripped,test:~background~:beach=stripped.png,Though, I will say that the feeling of sand between my toes is refreshingly new, for whatever it's worth...
2-must_strip_winning=breathing.png,<i>Breath in. Breath out</i>. I'm ready.
2-must_strip_winning=bored.png,I'm just glad I was allowed a bra in the first place.
2-must_strip_normal=annoyed.png,I don't appreciate commands. But I'll still comply with the rules.
2-must_strip_normal=unsure.png,If luck is a byproduct of preparation, then it seems I have been left with neither.
2-must_strip_losing=lament.png,In times like these, oblivion seems greatly preferable.
2-must_strip_losing=unsure.png,I assumed I'd learn the game faster than this...
2-stripping=stripping.png,This is what I get for my insistence on a bra, yet my owners giving me that backless dress.
2-stripping=stripping.png,I remember before I was given this bra-- The leers I'd get from my nipples poking through my dress.
2-stripping,marker:think_gallery=stripping.png,Reminds me of the gallery, being stared down while making conversation with strangers.
2-stripping,marker:think_chest=stripping.png,Before my bra, I remember one especially rude gallery goer staring at my chest...


#losing panties
3-stripped=stripped.png,Without my usual velvet curtain, some might think I'd blend into the back wall. Can't have that, can we?
3-stripped=stripped.png,It's been so long... I'd almost forgotten what this felt like...
3-stripped,count-role;self&saidmarker;think_chest:=stripped.png,...Security escorted him out. But I do wonder what he meant. I <i>am</i> marble, of course they're hard. <i>So is everything else about me.</i>
3-stripped,count-role;self&saidmarker;think_gallery:=stripped.png,...The gallery. It sounds fun for a day, but you'd get bored quickly. Not here, though.
3-stripped,count-boob_envy:=stripped.png,I've never really considered their size all too much...
3-stripped,count-boob_envy:=stripped.png,Is breast size something people tend to focus on?
3-must_strip_winning=uncomfortable.png,I've certainly been nude before. Just, never with everyone else in a similar state.
3-must_strip_winning=sly.png,Damned hubris... Very well.
3-must_strip_normal=sly.png,It's been thrilling, oddly. I'd never imagined baring myself by my own volition.
3-must_strip_normal=talking.png,I was surprised I was doing so well to begin with. I wasn't armed with much coming here.
3-must_strip_losing=sly.png,Inching closer and closer to that forfeit...
3-must_strip_losing=talking.png,Is this my punishment for barely knowing the rules coming in?
3-stripping=stripping.png,This isn't the time for me to start acting shy...
3-stripping=stripping.png,To reinterpret an old quote, "It's easy. Simply strip away everything that doesn't look like Galatea." And here I stand.
3-stripping=stripping.png,It wasn't uncommon for patrons of my gallery to want to touch me; they wanted to admire the details and feel if there was life under my skin...


#naked
-3-stripped=stripped.png,I feel... stripped away... polished. It's as if I've awakened again.
-3-stripped=stripped.png,Know me, and that I am reborn. ...<i>And</i> am actually having a bit of fun here.
-3-stripped,marker:butt=turned.png,It's so liberating to move without restriction...
-3-stripped,marker:butt=turned.png,Constrained by my clothes and dress it was an event to even turn my body.




#OPPONENT MUST STRIP
#These lines are spoken when an opponent must strip, but the character does not yet know what they will take off.

#The "human" versions of the lines will only be spoken if the human player is stripping.

male_must_strip=talking.png,I don't know if I should have won that round, but there's many things I should not have been able to do.
male_must_strip=bored.png,Well... we're waiting.

male_must_strip=lament.png,Let's see... speaking prompts... I feel I should know some, but I'm drawing a blank.
female_must_strip=thinking.png,Am I any different than those art critics that asked if I would strip for them?
female_must_strip=uncomfortable.png,I won't say I'm <i>not</i> curious...

female_must_strip=talking.png,Bring only your best.
female_must_strip=interested.png,What do you have for us?
female_must_strip=unsure.png,It'd almost be harder to not believe in fate by this point.
female_must_strip=bored.png,More stripping? Very well...
female_must_strip=bored.png,This game is going to take longer than I anticipated...
female_must_strip=bored.png,<i>At least</i> I finally have people to talk to, for whatever that's worth...
female_must_strip=sarcastic.png,I win, I suppose...
tie=confused.png,My... I certainly don't know the rules for this scenario.

#OPPONENT REMOVING ACCESSORY
#These lines are spoken when an opponent removes a small item that does not cover any skin.
#Typically, characters are fine with this when they are fully dressed but less satisfied as they become more naked.
#Note that all "removing" lines are NOT spoken to human players. Characters will skip straight from "6-male_human_must_strip" to "6-male_removed_accessory", for example.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

#OPPONENT REMOVING MINOR CLOTHING
#Minor pieces of clothing don't reveal much when removed, but probably indicate more progress than accessory removal.

male_removing_minor=talking.png,Kominisky's latest work should come here. She's much more sociable.
male_removing_minor=sarcastic.png,It's hard to believe how much modesty there is in <i>strip</i> poker.
male_removing_minor=thinking.png,I didn't come in with something like your ~clothing~, so it's hard to say at what point I would've removed ~clothing.ifPlural(them|it)~.

male_removed_minor=confident.png,Done? Good. I thought of a new strategy about going for <i>pairs</i> of cards that I'd like to try.
male_removed_minor=sarcastic.png,Sorry. I couldn't think of any <i>nosy personal questions</i> to ask you while you stripped.
male_removed_minor=talking.png,Was it necessary for you to be wearing that? Do all clothes need to be necessary?

female_removed_minor=sly.png,It's nice to be a part of a game, for once. You aren't just bombarded by personal questions.
female_removed_minor=unsure.png,I miss having a plaque. We'd have more to talk about than simply clothing.
female_removed_minor=interested.png,Do you know of Gloria Del Tredici? Her <i>Victim</i> shifts focus from what's in front of us and towards people who aren't even there. It's a reflection on art and viewer.
female_removed_minor=interested.png,I think a new topic, apart from your ~clothing~ is in order. May I suggest any worthwhile experiences we've had recently?

#OPPONENT REMOVING MAJOR CLOTHING
#Major clothing reveals a significant amount of skin and likely underwear.
#However, as we don't know if the opponent is taking off the top or the bottom, we can't presume that nice abs are showing; maybe she took of her skirt before her shirt.

#OPPONENT MASTURBATING
#When an opponent is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must pay the penalty by masturbating in front of everyone.
#The "must_masturbate" line is for just before it happens, and the "start_masturbating" line immediately follows.
#The "masturbating" line will be spoken a little after the opponent has started but before they climax.
#When the opponent climaxes, your character will say the "finished_masturbating" line.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

#SELF MASTURBATING
#If your character is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must masturbate.
#These lines only come up in the relevant stages, so you don't need to include the stage numbers here. Just remember which stage is which when you make the images. The "starting" image is still in the naked stage.
#The "finished_masturbating" line will repeat many times if the game is not yet finished. This plays as opponents comment on the how good their hands are.

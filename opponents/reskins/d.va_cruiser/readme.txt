This folder contains D.Va Cruiser images and dialogue by YuriSpacePirate.
All of D.Va's images have been replaced with a new outfit using the original poses.
Her lines have several tweaks to reflect her slightly altered dialogue when using this skin in Overwatch.

How to play against D.Va in her Cruiser attire in offline play:

- Duplicate (copy) the "d.va" subfolder in the "opponents" folder to a new folder called "d.va_cruiser".
- Copy the contents of folder that this readme is in to your new "d.va_cruiser" folder. When you're asked if you'd like to overwrite files with the same names, choose yes.
- Open listing.xml in the "opponents" folder in a basic text editor and add <opponent>d.va_cruiser/</opponent> in the Individuals section with the other characters.
- Open index.html to play the game. This works best in the Firefox browser. It does not work offline in the Google Chrome browser.

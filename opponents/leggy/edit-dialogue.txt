#Items of clothing should be listed here in order of removal.
#The values are formal name, lower case name, how much they cover, what they cover
#Please do not put spaces around the commas.
#"Important" clothes cover genitals (lower) or chest/breasts (upper). For example: bras, panties, a skirt when going commando.
#"Major" clothes cover underwear. For example: skirts, pants, shirts, dresses.
#"Minor" clothes cover skin or are large pieces of clothing that do not cover skin. For example: jackets, socks, stockings, gloves.
#"Extra" clothes are small items that may or may not be clothing but do not cover anything interesting. For example: jewelry, shoes or boots with socks underneath, belts, hats. In the rest of the code, "extra" clothes are called "accessory".
#If for some reason you write another word for the type of clothes (e.g. "accessory"), other characters will not react at all when the clothing is removed.
#What they cover = upper (upper body), lower (lower body), other (neither).
#The game can support any number of entries, but typically we use 2-8, with at least one "important" layer for upper and lower (each).

#Notes on dialogue
#All lines that start with a # symbol are comments and will be ignored by the tool that converts this file into a xml file for the game.
#Where more than one line has an identical type, like "swap_cards" and "swap_cards", the game will randomly select one of these lines each time the character is in that situation.
#You should try to include multiple lines for most stages, especially the final (finished) stage, -1. 

#A character goes through multiple stages as they undress. The stage number starts at zero and indicates how many layers they have removed. Special stage numbers are used when they are nude (-3), masturbating (-2), and finished (-1).
#Line types that start with a number will only display during that stage. The will override any numberless stage-generic lines. For example, in stage 4 "4-swap_cards" will be used over "swap_cards" if it is not blank here. Giving a character unique dialogue for each stage is an effective way of showing their changing openness/shyness as the game progresses.
#You can combine the above points and make multiple lines for a particular situation in a particular stage, like "4-swap_cards" and "4-swap_cards".

#Some special words can be used that will be substituted by the game for context-appropriate ones: ~name~ is the name of the character they're speaking to, but this only works if someone else is in focus. ~clothing~ is the type of clothing that is being removed by another player. ~Clothing~ is almost the same, but it starts with a capital letter in case you want to start a sentence with it.
#~name~ can be used any time a line targets an opponent (game_over_defeat, _must_strip, _removing_, _removed, _must_masturbate, etc).
#~clothing~ can be used only when clothing is being removed (_removing and _removed, but NOT _must_strip).
#~player~ can be used at any time and refers to the human player.
#~cards~ can be used only in the swap_cards lines.
#All wildcards can be used once per line only! If you use ~name~ twice, the code will show up the second time.

#Lines can be written that are only spoken when specific other characters are present. For a detailed explanation, read this guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/spnati/comments/6nhaj0/the_easy_way_to_write_targeted_lines/
#Here is an example line (note that targeted lines must have a stage number):
#0-female_must_strip,target:hermione=happy,Looks like your magic doesn't help with poker!

#This is what a character says while they're exchanging cards and commenting on their hands afterwards.
#When swapping cards, the game will automatically put a display a number between 0-5 where you write ~cards~.

3-stripped,alsoPlaying:sakura,saidMarker:Zombie3=interested.png,Thanks, darlin'! Pretty clever, ain't it?
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:sayaka=smug.png,I could think of a couple ways. This sure is the easiest though, lemme tell ya.

3-must_strip,alsoPlaying:natsuki=lost.png,'Course I am! Golly, you could've just asked if you were so curious.
3-must_strip,alsoPlaying:pit=lost.png,Well, it wouldn't be no fun to just cut it all off. I still wanna win.

3-must_strip,alsoPlaying:sakura,marker:Zombie4=lost.png,Naw, darlin'; this wool's just so easy to muck up. Peggy don't know how lucky she is to have black wool.

3-stripping,alsoPlaying:akko=butt.png,Akko? You talkin' again? You'll have to speak up, hon'!
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:futaba=butt.png,I... I guess so. Ain't no one never <i>wanted</i> to do nothin' with this wool. 'Cept gettin' it off me, I guess.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:haru,alsoPlayingSaying:does it grow back=butt.png,Oh, I'll be lookin' like this... for a while. I been needin' a shearin' though.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:haru,priority:101,marker:wolf=butt.png,Accidents happen all the time, anyhow. Especially with that wolf around.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:mae,saidMarker:mae4=butt.png,Well shoot, y'all shoulda' said somethin'!
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:natsuki=butt.png,I've heard of it too. You'd think people who count sheep every night would know one when they see it.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingSaying:butt=butt.png,Is it, Pit? Wonder why nobody's told me before. Ain't like I can move my wool though.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingSaying:difficulty=butt.png,Well I ain't supposed to be <i>easy</i> to beat!
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:sakura,saidMarker:Zombie4=butt.png,Bet she'd be a lot nicer if she had wool so hard to keep clean. Probably stay outta trouble, too.

#OPPONENT MUST STRIP
#These lines are spoken when an opponent must strip, but the character does not yet know what they will take off.
#Writing different variations is important here, as these lines will be spoken about thirty times per game.
#The "human" versions of the lines will only be spoken if the human player is stripping.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

#These lines are spoken when an opponent removes a small item that does not cover any skin.
#Typically, characters are fine with this when they are fully dressed but less satisfied as they become more naked.
#Note that all "removing" lines are NOT spoken to human players. Characters will skip straight from "6-male_human_must_strip" to "6-male_removed_accessory", for example.

0-opponent_stripping,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=embarrassed.png,Shoot!
0-opponent_stripping,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=happy.png,What cute shoes!
0-opponent_stripping,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:1=interested.png,Gotta say, Nugi, I ain't too sure what you... are.
0-opponent_stripping,target:palutena,targetStage:0=happy.png,It's absolutely glowing!
0-opponent_stripping,target:palutena,targetStage:1=calm.png,But that don't matter none. Angel or not, I still think you're fine.
0-opponent_stripping,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:0=confused.png,You're on a race to the bottom, ain't ya? Startin' with your top?
0-opponent_stripping,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:1=happy.png,I shoulda known! I bet Pinkie's the one what's playin' this right.
0-opponent_stripping,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:2=confused.png,Wait... you're actually kickin' off them shoes? I don't...
0-opponent_stripping,target:pit,targetStage:0=interested.png,Oh, I get it! You're like an angel or somethin'!
0-opponent_stripping,target:pit,targetStage:1=confused.png,I ain't too sure why you're here... doin'... <i>this</i>...
0-opponent_stripping,target:pit,targetStage:2=sad.png,I don't ever know what kinda trouble Peggy's tryin' to get me into, or why them wolves're always so nasty... I know you angels probably see all that stuff...
0-opponent_stripping,target:pit,targetStage:3=happy.png,Oh, I just got the best idea! Once we're done here!
0-opponent_stripping,target:revy,targetStage:0=sad.png,Y'all still havin' fun? The game ain't no fun with sore losers.
0-opponent_stripping,target:revy,targetStage:1=mad.png,I ain't scared by no guns; Droopy can shoot with the best of 'em.
0-opponent_stripping,target:revy,targetStage:2=confident.png,You ain't too used to seein' sheep, are ya?
0-opponent_stripping,target:revy,targetStage:2,targetSaying:eating,marker:Revyeating=embarrassed.png,N-no! I ain't for dinner, y'hear! Don't talk like that!
0-opponent_stripping,target:revy,targetStage:3=interested.png,Hang on, now; <i>guns</i> count as clothin'?
0-opponent_stripping,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=calm.png,Nothin' too big for yer first loss, but...
0-opponent_stripping,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=sad.png,Aww, now that's no fun!
0-opponent_stripping,target:ryuji,targetStage:0=smug.png,What brings y'all here... Ryuji, ya say?
0-opponent_stripping,target:ryuji,targetStage:1=smug.png,I ain't sayin' I hope you lose, sugar...
0-opponent_stripping,target:ryuji,targetStage:2=sad.png,Aww, now is that really all? You gonna make me beg?
0-opponent_stripping,target:saki,targetStage:0=interested.png,I like <i>your</i> uniform. Where you from?
0-opponent_stripping,target:saki_zls,targetStage:0=confident.png,But I don't think I got much to worry 'bout, now do I?
0-opponent_stripping,target:sakura,targetStage:2=interested.png,What? What's goin' on?
0-opponent_stripping,target:sakura,targetStage:3=shocked.png,<i>Ah!</i> How'd you do that? That ain't natural!
0-opponent_stripping,target:syrenne,targetStage:0=interested.png,Why're you goin' right for your top?
0-opponent_stripping,target:twilight,targetStage:0,targetSaying:"panties"=smug.png,I <i>know!</i> They just look so miserable... finally, <i>someone</i> gets it!
0-opponent_stripping,target:twilight,targetStage:1=shocked.png,Wait now, I don't know if...
0-opponent_stripping,target:weiss,targetStage:0=shocked.png,<i>Ooh, it's shiny...</i>
0-opponent_stripping,target:weiss,targetStage:1=confused.png,That get-up looks mighty chilly, miss Weiss.
0-opponent_stripping,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=confused.png,Seein' boots like that sure makes me wish I <i>could</i> wear shoes.
0-opponent_stripping,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1=confused.png,Hang on, now... that didn't take long <i>at all!</i>
0-opponent_stripping,target:zone-tan,targetStage:2=interested.png,Oh! Well ain't this a surprise?
0-opponent_stripping,notSaidMarker:strip,test:~clothing.type~:extra:!=,marker:strip=shocked.png,<i>Oh!</i> I get it now! It ain't just about bettin' small stuff, is it?
0-opponent_stripping,notSaidMarker:strip,test:~clothing.type~:extra:!=,marker:strip=interested.png,Why're you givin' up more...? <i>Oh!</i> It ain't about the clothing, is it?
0-opponent_stripped,count-not_mostly_clothed:0=calm.png,Alright, alright, no sense floggin' a dead horse. We've got poker to play!
0-opponent_stripped,count-not_mostly_clothed:0=confident.png,You'll be out 'fore ya know it!
0-opponent_stripped,count-not_mostly_clothed:0=smug.png,I'm excited to see what you'll do when you lose again.
0-opponent_stripped,count-not_mostly_clothed:0=interested.png,Ooh, could I try holdin' your ~clothing~? I'll give ~clothing.ifPlural('em|it)~ back in a jiffy!
0-opponent_stripped,count-not_mostly_clothed:0=horny.png,Game's just as fun without ~clothing.ifPlural(them|that)~ ~clothing~, darlin'!
0-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:1,count-pit:0=shocked.png,Matter of fact... you're <i>all</i> glowy! You some kinda angel?
0-opponent_stripped,saidMarker:strip,notSaidMarker:strip2,marker:strip2=confident.png,Here I thought this whole time none a'y'all had money.
0-opponent_stripped,saidMarker:strip,notSaidMarker:strip2,marker:strip2=horny.png,'S more about what's <i>underneath...</i>
0-opponent_stripped,target:aimee,targetStage:1-5=mad.png,What in the world's gotten into you?!
0-opponent_stripped,target:aimee,targetStage:1-5=mad.png,I oughtta... why, if Barbra were here, you'd get it right proper!
0-opponent_stripped,target:aimee,targetStage:1-5=embarrassed.png,Don't do that again!
0-opponent_stripped,target:aimee,targetStage:1-5=mad.png,You're lucky I didn't have to pee!
0-opponent_stripped,target:akko,targetStage:1=embarrassed.png,I'm in <i>way</i> over my head here...
0-opponent_stripped,target:amalia,targetStage:1=boisterous.png,Sure is creative, I'll say that!
0-opponent_stripped,target:amalia,targetStage:5,marker:Amaliaflowers=interested.png,Oh? What's goin' on?
0-opponent_stripped,target:calisto,targetStage:1=smug.png,I guess most ain't blessed with hooves, now are they?
0-opponent_stripped,target:catria,targetStage:1=boisterous.png,But don't let me stop you from droppin' a sword!
0-opponent_stripped,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=calm.png,Maybe we can see after the game.
0-opponent_stripped,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=confident.png,Ain't like I really gotta; Droopy's got a <i>keen</i> eye.
0-opponent_stripped,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:1=smug.png,Oh, yeah; never mind. Awful loud hat, ain't it?
0-opponent_stripped,target:emi,targetStage:1=calm.png,What's a little thing like you even doin' in a place like this, anyhow?
0-opponent_stripped,target:emi,targetStage:4=calm.png,Must be you just know somethin' I don't.
0-opponent_stripped,target:emi,targetStage:5=sad.png,Golly, I don't get this game <i>none</i>, do I?
0-opponent_stripped,target:emi,targetStage:8=sad.png,Y'ain't had to go an' do <i>that,</i> darlin'.
0-opponent_stripped,target:estelle,targetStage:1=happy.png,That don't mean a lamb can't feel pretty every now and again!
0-opponent_stripped,target:florina,targetStage:1=calm.png,I guess if what you want's to come outta your shell, this'll do the trick.
0-opponent_stripped,target:hanako,targetStage:1=confident.png,Ain't like it makes you any worse at the game, now is it?
0-opponent_stripped,target:hanako,targetStage:2=happy.png,You're a real cutie, y'hear?
0-opponent_stripped,target:haru,targetStage:1=calm.png,Barbra's like a big sister. Tall, grows wool even faster'n I do. Everyone seems afraid of her for some reason.
0-opponent_stripped,target:haru,targetStage:2=happy.png,Huggin' ain't against no rules, right? I still ain't too used to most'a y'all's games.
0-opponent_stripped,target:hk416,targetStage:1=calm.png,Well, as long as I ain't in yer sights, I don't got no problems with that.
0-opponent_stripped,target:jura,targetStage:1=embarrassed.png,I ain't sayin' I <i>want</i> you to keep that sword at yer side...
0-opponent_stripped,target:jura,targetStage:2=happy.png,You should meet her! She'd love you, I just <i>know</i> it!
0-opponent_stripped,target:jura,targetStage:3=calm.png,Maybe next time I oughtta come to you for tips; you sure seem to know more than Peggy ever did.
0-opponent_stripped,target:kamina,targetStage:1=confident.png,Doesn't do much good to stall with little things when the goods're already out there.
0-opponent_stripped,target:kamina,targetStage:2=horny.png,Why not come a little closer'n see how soft this wool <i>really</i> is?
0-opponent_stripped,target:larachel,targetStage:1=calm.png,I'm sure it'll be waitin' nice and pretty for ya whenever you're done.
0-opponent_stripped,target:larachel,targetStage:1=confident.png,If you need somethin' to stroke, this wool's just as soft as it looks.
0-opponent_stripped,target:larachel,targetStage:1,targetSaying:get along well with it=interested.png,Like, a horse? Well, sure, I wouldn't mind meetin' 'em. Bet they got somethin' interestin' to say about you.
0-opponent_stripped,target:larachel,targetStage:2,marker:nickname*=princess=smug.png,Oh, I see <i>plenty.</i> Let's see another round, <i>princess.</i>
0-opponent_stripped,target:larachel,targetStage:3=smug.png,Whenever you're ready, <i>your highness.</i>

0-opponent_stripped,target:mae,targetStage:1=smug.png,Glad <i>someone's</i> bein' sensible 'bout their footwear.
0-opponent_stripped,target:mae,targetStage:2=calm.png,Ain't no need to be a sourpuss.
0-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:1=calm.png,Even if ya <i>do</i> talk like you've gone bonkers.
0-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:2=boisterous.png,Ya <i>are</i> a normal gal! Oh, I knew it all along. Sheep got an eye for this kinda thing, y'know.
0-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:3=sad.png,Oh, wait... is it Halloween? Did I miss it?
0-opponent_stripped,target:mavis,targetStage:1=sad.png,Right? You wouldn't hurt an innocent li'l lamb, now would ya?
0-opponent_stripped,target:meia,targetStage:1=smug.png,Even if it <i>does</i> look mighty chilly. You alright for winter in that?
0-opponent_stripped,target:meia,targetStage:1=mad.png,If you try to take <i>me</i>, Droopy'll hound you till you quit! I mean it!
0-opponent_stripped,target:meia,targetStage:1=sad.png,You wouldn't kidnap a poor, helpless li'l lamb, now would you?
0-opponent_stripped,target:meia,targetStage:3=interested.png,And darlin', your search is gonna be a short one, let me tell ya!
0-opponent_stripped,target:misato,targetStage:1=mad.png,Hey, my head's clean! Ain't no sheep on the farm with cleaner wool!
0-opponent_stripped,target:misato,targetStage:2=smug.png,Might be easier to win if ya weren't drinkin' somethin' so foul.
0-opponent_stripped,target:nagisa,targetStage:1=confident.png,Well shoot. C'mon, then, show us what you've got!
0-opponent_stripped,target:nagisa,targetStage:2=confident.png,You got the heart to see this through, and I'm fittin' to make sure you do!
0-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:1=embarrassed.png,I... I ain't sayin' I <i>don't</i> want no pets, but...
0-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:1=smug.png,Unless there might be... <i>somethin'</i> keepin ya here...
0-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,saidMarker:rules=boisterous.png,Now we know, let's kick their butts!
0-opponent_stripped,target:nayru,targetStage:5,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=confused.png,Y'all alright? Hello? Nayru?
0-opponent_stripped,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:1=calm.png,Sometimes I sure wish they made shoes for sheep.
0-opponent_stripped,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:2=calm.png,Well, human, sure; I seen them plenty. Just never seen no one like you 'round the farm.
0-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:pit,notSaidMarker:angel,marker:angel=shocked.png,Wait a sec... you're glowy all over! Are you... are you <i>both</i> some kinda angel?
0-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:2=happy.png,<i>Ooh</i>, why do I just wanna give you a hug so badly?
0-opponent_stripped,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:1=interested.png,Oh, don't mind me none. You seem like you've done this before.
0-opponent_stripped,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:2=smug.png,And it ain't so bad to watch, if ya don't mind my sayin'.
0-opponent_stripped,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:3=sad.png,I just can't keep up, Pinkie. Is it better to strip quick or no?
0-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:1=happy.png,I never thought I'd see the day! Anything you want, Mr. Angel, just gimme a holler!
0-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:palutena,notSaidMarker:angel,marker:angel=shocked.png,But if he's an angel, then what's that make <i>you</i>?
0-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:2=boisterous.png,But I'm rootin' for ya!
0-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:3=happy.png,You think y'all can teach me some'a them things? I'll be a good li'l lamb, honest!
0-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:4=smug.png,You should come back to the farm with me a minute! Oh, Barbra'd love to meet you! And we could teach Peggy a thing or two, I know it.
0-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:4=happy.png,Oh Barbara would just have the darndest time with you, Mr. Angel!
0-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:4=happy.png,Peggy would <i>love</i> you Mr. Angel! I oughtta introduce you!
0-opponent_stripped,target:revy,targetStage:1=embarrassed.png,I didn't mean nothin' by it!
0-opponent_stripped,target:revy,targetStage:2=embarrassed.png,I just ain't too used to... <i>you!</i>
0-opponent_stripped,target:revy,targetStage:3=happy.png,That's just fine. I like you! You'll get used to it in no time!
0-opponent_stripped,target:revy,targetStage:3,saidMarker:Revyeating=sad.png,That dang wolf always tries to eat us; I thought I'd be safe from that here.
0-opponent_stripped,target:revy,targetStage:4=confused.png,Sometimes I feel like these rules're just made up as we're goin' along.
0-opponent_stripped,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=horny.png,I dunno, there's just <i>somethin'</i> about some nice, strong hands...
0-opponent_stripped,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=smug.png,Oh, it's fine, it's fine. Guess we'll just have to keep wearin' you down the ol' fashioned way!
0-opponent_stripped,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=pun.png,Ya sure are makin' me <i>burn up</i>, Rinkah.
0-opponent_stripped,target:ryuji,targetStage:1=happy.png,Oh, this is gonna be a <i>good</i> game!
0-opponent_stripped,target:ryuji,targetStage:2=happy.png,I just don't mind when ya do!
0-opponent_stripped,target:ryuji,targetStage:3=confused.png,Well I ain't gonna beg. I'll just have to hope you keep on losin'.
0-opponent_stripped,target:saki,targetStage:1=calm.png,Cute li'l schoolgirls used to come by the farm every now and again; you remind me of 'em, is all.
0-opponent_stripped,target:saki_zls,targetStage:1=smug.png,Let's see how this turns out, darlin'.
0-opponent_stripped,target:sakura,targetStage:3=confused.png,I don't... I ain't sure what you're talkin' about. I don't mind blue skin none though. Why hide that?
0-opponent_stripped,target:sakura,targetStage:4=sad.png,You okay? How'd... how're you still on your feet? I mean I've seen chickens what could still stand for a bit, but...
0-opponent_stripped,target:syrenne=confused.png,Don't you wanna save the good bits for last, hon'?
0-opponent_stripped,target:twilight,targetStage:1=happy.png,Ahh! Oh, I didn't expect to find another animal here! What're you? A horse?
0-opponent_stripped,target:twilight,targetStage:2=smug.png,You're awful eager to get outta them clothes, now. And I'm mighty glad I don't need to wear nothin' like that.
0-opponent_stripped,target:weiss,targetStage:2=smug.png,Seems like it could use a bit of wool in it. Oh, don't worry none; doesn't hurt me to lose a bit.
0-opponent_stripped,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1=calm.png,Hooves ain't too bad, but they're awful hard to doll up.
0-opponent_stripped,target:zone-tan,targetStage:2=smug.png,Oh, I get it. Yeah, I bet Peggy'd like you.
0-opponent_stripped,target:zone-tan,targetStage:3=smug.png,Y'all startin' to grow on me, too.
0-opponent_stripped,target:human,notSaidMarker:strip,test:~clothing.type~:extra:!=,marker:strip=shocked.png,Oh! I get it; this ain't like no other game I've played.
0-opponent_stripped,filter:fancy,test:~clothing.type~:extra=smug.png,I think I've seen people 'round the farm wearin' stuff like that, but never so fancy!
0-opponent_stripped,filter:fancy,test:~clothing.type~:extra=smug.png,Your ~clothing~ wouldn't last too long back on the farm.
0-opponent_stripped,filter:fancy,test:~clothing.type~:extra=sad.png,I sure would like a closer look...

0-opponent_start_masturbating,target:pinkie_pie=shocked.png,Now what on Earth? You're puttin <i>that</i> up in...?
0-opponent_masturbating,target:pinkie_pie,priority:0=interested.png,Y'all humans sure get into some weird things, don't you?

0-opponent_finished_masturbating,targetTimeInStage:0-2=smug.png,You must be <i>awful</i> new to this. Don't worry none, darlin'; long as you had fun.
0-opponent_finished_masturbating,targetTimeInStage:8-=shocked.png,<i>Lordy!</i> I was 'bout thinkin' you were never gonna stop!

1-opponent_lost,target:pit,targetStage:1=confused.png,Somethin' wrong, Mr. Angel? Maybe it ain't my place to say, but you sure seem to be losin' a lot...

1-opponent_lost,target:twilight,targetStage:1=sad.png,This game seems so unfair sometimes...
1-opponent_lost,target:weiss,targetStage:0=interested.png,Now that's a right pretty dress! I sure wish my wool could shine like that.
1-opponent_lost,target:weiss,targetStage:1=smug.png,All that fancy clothin' ain't doin' ya much good in poker, now is it?
1-opponent_lost,target:zone-tan,targetStage:2=happy.png,I don't mind seein' a bit more underwear. That's why we're still playin', right?
1-opponent_lost,oneShotId:1,priority:0,test:~background~:arcade=butt.png,Oh, all this looks so confusin'... How does anyone keep up with it?
1-opponent_lost,oneShotId:2,priority:0,test:~background~:hot spring=butt.png,<i>Gosh,</i> we can't turn down the heat <i>at all?</i>

1-opponent_stripping,target:aimee,targetStage:0-4=shocked.png,This ain't what I wanted!
1-opponent_stripping,target:akko,targetStage:0=confused.png,I ain't never seen nothin' like <i>that</i>...
1-opponent_stripping,target:amalia,targetStage:0=confused.png,You wearin'... <i>leaves?</i> Guess I can't talk much about strange clothin', but...
1-opponent_stripping,target:calisto,targetStage:0=interested.png,Lots of work keepin' them shoes nice and pretty, ain't it darlin'?
1-opponent_stripping,target:catria,targetStage:0=confused.png,Guess I shouldn't be <i>too</i> surprised... Been seein' all kinds of strange sorts here.
1-opponent_stripping,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=confident.png,Maybe I ain't got nothin' to worry 'bout after all.
1-opponent_stripping,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=calm.png,I... mostly just keep an eye out for wolves.
1-opponent_stripping,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:0=interested.png,Now what on Earth is all that supposed to be? You look like the tin man, hon'!
1-opponent_stripping,target:emi,targetStage:0=happy.png,You're just the cutest li'l thing!

1-opponent_stripping,target:hanako,targetStage:0=embarrassed.png,Well... I ain't about to go easy on you, ya hear?
1-opponent_stripping,target:hanako,targetStage:1=confident.png,Don't you worry none, darlin'.
1-opponent_stripping,target:haru,targetStage:0=happy.png,You just look so... <i>comfy!</i> Y'almost remind me of Barbra!
1-opponent_stripping,target:haru,targetStage:1=confident.png,But Barbra's got the warmest, softest hugs y'ever did feel... Like gettin' lost in a cloud.
1-opponent_stripping,target:hk416,targetStage:0=interested.png,What's all... you just come from some kinda war or somethin'?
1-opponent_stripping,target:jura,targetStage:0=confused.png,Hang on, that counts? It ain't even clothin'!
1-opponent_stripping,target:jura,targetStage:1=calm.png,Y' don't seem <i>so</i> bad though. Y'almost remind me of Barbra.
1-opponent_stripping,target:jura,targetStage:2=confused.png,...but it sure helps you out here. How much you wearin', anyhow?
1-opponent_stripping,target:kamina,targetStage:0=smug.png,Whaddaya say 'bout a hug, darlin'? I don't bite.
1-opponent_stripping,target:kamina,targetStage:1=interested.png,Oh, and here I thought it couldn't get no better.
1-opponent_stripping,target:larachel,targetStage:0=smug.png,<i>Talk</i> about impractical; them nice shiny boots'd be 'bout pretty as a pig once they're covered in mud.
1-opponent_stripping,target:larachel,targetStage:1=shocked.png,Wait now, don't do nothin' hasty!
1-opponent_stripping,target:larachel,targetStage:2=interested.png,<i>Ooh...</i> I like them boots. Wouldn't stay so pretty steppin' through mud, though.
1-opponent_stripping,target:larachel,targetStage:3=sad.png,Doin' alright, there, princess? You seem awful antsy.
1-opponent_stripping,target:lucina,targetStage:0=interested.png,Hang on a sec'...
1-opponent_stripping,target:mae,targetStage:0=interested.png,Now <i>those</i> boots look nice 'n practical.
1-opponent_stripping,target:mae,targetStage:1=happy.png,I know y'ain't got no much of a choice, just lemme poke my fun!
1-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:0=smug.png,Well, whatever y'are, you're not unstoppable.
1-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:1=shocked.png,Whoa! What's goin' on here?
1-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:2=calm.png,I guess y'ain't so bad. When you're not dressin' up for Halloween.
1-opponent_stripping,target:mavis,targetStage:0=embarrassed.png,Wait... them teeth... I know I've seen this before! I ain't your dinner!
1-opponent_stripping,target:meia,targetStage:0=happy.png,Sure does make you look nice!
1-opponent_stripping,target:meia,targetStage:1=confused.png,I heard stories about the cows gettin' took by space aliens, y'know...
1-opponent_stripping,target:meia,targetStage:2=happy.png,You're lookin' for a bo'!
1-opponent_stripping,target:misato,targetStage:0=interested.png,Ooh! Give it here, give it here!
1-opponent_stripping,target:misato,targetStage:1=shocked.png,Oh, so <i>that's</i> what I's smellin'.
1-opponent_stripping,target:nagisa,targetStage:0=interested.png,But you ain't leavin'?
1-opponent_stripping,target:nagisa,targetStage:1=smug.png,I oughtta warn you now: I ain't gonna settle for halfway done.
1-opponent_stripping,target:natsuki,targetStage:0=mad.png,No I don't make it a pettin' zoo wherever I go!
1-opponent_stripping,target:natsuki,targetStage:0,saidMarker:rules=sad.png,Ain't right, I tell ya. Startin' a game like this when we ain't even sure what's goin' on.
1-opponent_stripping,target:natsuki,targetStage:1=calm.png,You 'n ~player~ can get outta here whever ya want. I won't mind none.
1-opponent_stripping,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=embarrassed.png,Shoot!
1-opponent_stripping,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=happy.png,What cute shoes!
1-opponent_stripping,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:1=interested.png,Gotta say, Nugi, I ain't too sure what you... are.
1-opponent_stripping,target:palutena,targetStage:0=happy.png,It's absolutely glowing!
1-opponent_stripping,target:palutena,targetStage:1=calm.png,But that don't matter none. Angel or not, I still think you're fine.
1-opponent_stripping,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:0=confused.png,You're on a race to the bottom, ain't ya? Startin' with your top?
1-opponent_stripping,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:1=happy.png,I shoulda known! I bet Pinkie's the one what's playin' this right.
1-opponent_stripping,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:2=confused.png,Wait... you're actually kickin' off them shoes? I don't...
1-opponent_stripping,target:pit,targetStage:0=interested.png,Oh, I get it! You're like an angel or somethin'!
1-opponent_stripping,target:pit,targetStage:1=confused.png,I ain't too sure why you're here... doin'... <i>this</i>...
1-opponent_stripping,target:pit,targetStage:2=sad.png,I don't ever know what kinda trouble Peggy's tryin' to get me into, or why them wolves're always so nasty... I know you angels probably see all that stuff...
1-opponent_stripping,target:pit,targetStage:3=happy.png,Oh, I just got the best idea! Once we're done here!
1-opponent_stripping,target:revy,targetStage:0=sad.png,Y'all still havin' fun? The game ain't no fun with sore losers.
1-opponent_stripping,target:revy,targetStage:1=mad.png,I ain't scared by no guns; Droopy can shoot with the best of 'em.
1-opponent_stripping,target:revy,targetStage:2=confident.png,You ain't too used to seein' sheep, are ya?
1-opponent_stripping,target:revy,targetStage:2,targetSaying:eating,marker:Revyeating=embarrassed.png,N-no! I ain't for dinner, y'hear! Don't talk like that!
1-opponent_stripping,target:revy,targetStage:3=interested.png,Hang on, now; <i>guns</i> count as clothin'?
1-opponent_stripping,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=calm.png,Nothin' too big for yer first loss, but...
1-opponent_stripping,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=sad.png,Aww, now that's no fun!
1-opponent_stripping,target:ryuji,targetStage:0=smug.png,What brings y'all here... Ryuji, ya say?
1-opponent_stripping,target:ryuji,targetStage:1=smug.png,I ain't sayin' I hope you lose, sugar...
1-opponent_stripping,target:ryuji,targetStage:2=sad.png,Aww, now is that really all? You gonna make me beg?
1-opponent_stripping,target:saki,targetStage:0=interested.png,I like <i>your</i> uniform. Where you from?
1-opponent_stripping,target:saki_zls,targetStage:0=smug.png,I guess y'ain't doin' <i>too</i> bad.
1-opponent_stripping,target:sakura,targetStage:2=interested.png,What? What's goin' on?
1-opponent_stripping,target:sakura,targetStage:3=shocked.png,<i>Ah!</i> How'd you do that? That ain't natural!
1-opponent_stripping,target:syrenne,targetStage:0=interested.png,Why're you goin' right for your top?
1-opponent_stripping,target:twilight,targetStage:0,targetSaying:"panties"=smug.png,I <i>know!</i> They just look so miserable... finally, <i>someone</i> gets it!
1-opponent_stripping,target:twilight,targetStage:1=shocked.png,Wait now, I don't know if...
1-opponent_stripping,target:weiss,targetStage:0=shocked.png,<i>Ooh, it's shiny...</i>
1-opponent_stripping,target:weiss,targetStage:1=confused.png,That get-up looks mighty chilly, miss Weiss.
1-opponent_stripping,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=confused.png,Seein' boots like that sure makes me wish I <i>could</i> wear shoes.
1-opponent_stripping,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1=confused.png,Hang on, now... that didn't take long <i>at all!</i>
1-opponent_stripping,target:zone-tan,targetStage:2=interested.png,Oh! Well ain't this a surprise?
1-opponent_stripping,notSaidMarker:strip,test:~clothing.type~:extra:!=,marker:strip=shocked.png,<i>Oh!</i> I get it now! It ain't just about bettin' small stuff, is it?
1-opponent_stripping,notSaidMarker:strip,test:~clothing.type~:extra:!=,marker:strip=interested.png,Why're you givin' up more...? <i>Oh!</i> It ain't about the clothing, is it?
1-opponent_stripped,count-not_mostly_clothed:0=calm.png,Alright, alright, no sense floggin' a dead horse. We've got poker to play!
1-opponent_stripped,count-not_mostly_clothed:0=confident.png,You'll be out 'fore ya know it!
1-opponent_stripped,count-not_mostly_clothed:0=smug.png,I'm excited to see what you'll do when you lose again.
1-opponent_stripped,count-not_mostly_clothed:0=interested.png,Ooh, could I try holdin' your ~clothing~? I'll give ~clothing.ifPlural('em|it)~ back in a jiffy!
1-opponent_stripped,count-not_mostly_clothed:0=horny.png,Game's just as fun without ~clothing.ifPlural(them|that)~ ~clothing~, darlin'!
1-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:1,count-pit:0=shocked.png,Matter of fact... you're <i>all</i> glowy! You some kinda angel?
1-opponent_stripped,saidMarker:strip,notSaidMarker:strip2,marker:strip2=confident.png,Here I thought this whole time none a'y'all had money.
1-opponent_stripped,saidMarker:strip,notSaidMarker:strip2,marker:strip2=horny.png,'S more about what's <i>underneath...</i>
1-opponent_stripped,target:aimee,targetStage:1-5=mad.png,What in the world's gotten into you?!
1-opponent_stripped,target:aimee,targetStage:1-5=mad.png,I oughtta... why, if Barbra were here, you'd get it right proper!
1-opponent_stripped,target:aimee,targetStage:1-5=embarrassed.png,Don't do that again!
1-opponent_stripped,target:aimee,targetStage:1-5=mad.png,You're lucky I didn't have to pee!
1-opponent_stripped,target:akko,targetStage:1=embarrassed.png,I'm in <i>way</i> over my head here...
1-opponent_stripped,target:amalia,targetStage:1=boisterous.png,Sure is creative, I'll say that!
1-opponent_stripped,target:amalia,targetStage:5,marker:Amaliaflowers=interested.png,Oh? What's goin' on?
1-opponent_stripped,target:calisto,targetStage:1=smug.png,I guess most ain't blessed with hooves, now are they?
1-opponent_stripped,target:catria,targetStage:1=boisterous.png,But don't let me stop you from droppin' a sword!
1-opponent_stripped,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=calm.png,Maybe we can see after the game.
1-opponent_stripped,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=confident.png,Ain't like I really gotta; Droopy's got a <i>keen</i> eye.
1-opponent_stripped,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:1=smug.png,Oh, yeah; never mind. Awful loud hat, ain't it?
1-opponent_stripped,target:emi,targetStage:1=calm.png,What's a little thing like you even doin' in a place like this, anyhow?
1-opponent_stripped,target:emi,targetStage:4=calm.png,Must be you just know somethin' I don't.
1-opponent_stripped,target:emi,targetStage:5=sad.png,Golly, I don't get this game <i>none</i>, do I?
1-opponent_stripped,target:estelle,targetStage:1=happy.png,That don't mean a lamb can't feel pretty every now and again!
1-opponent_stripped,target:florina,targetStage:1=calm.png,I guess if what you want's to come outta your shell, this'll do the trick.
1-opponent_stripped,target:hanako,targetStage:1=confident.png,Ain't like it makes you any worse at the game, now is it?
1-opponent_stripped,target:hanako,targetStage:2=happy.png,You're a real cutie, y'hear?
1-opponent_stripped,target:haru,targetStage:1=calm.png,Barbra's like a big sister. Tall, grows wool even faster'n I do. Everyone seems afraid of her for some reason.
1-opponent_stripped,target:haru,targetStage:2=happy.png,Huggin' ain't against no rules, right? I still ain't too used to most'a y'all's games.
1-opponent_stripped,target:hk416,targetStage:1=calm.png,Well, as long as I ain't in yer sights, I don't got no problems with that.
1-opponent_stripped,target:jura,targetStage:1=embarrassed.png,I ain't sayin' I <i>want</i> you to keep that sword at yer side...
1-opponent_stripped,target:jura,targetStage:2=happy.png,You should meet her! She'd love you, I just <i>know</i> it!
1-opponent_stripped,target:jura,targetStage:3=calm.png,Maybe next time I oughtta come to you for tips; you sure seem to know more than Peggy ever did.
1-opponent_stripped,target:kamina,targetStage:1=confident.png,Doesn't do much good to stall with little things when the goods're already out there.
1-opponent_stripped,target:kamina,targetStage:2=horny.png,Why not come a little closer'n see how soft this wool <i>really</i> is?
1-opponent_stripped,target:larachel,targetStage:1=calm.png,I'm sure it'll be waitin' nice and pretty for ya whenever you're done.
1-opponent_stripped,target:larachel,targetStage:1=confident.png,If you need somethin' to stroke, this wool's just as soft as it looks.
1-opponent_stripped,target:larachel,targetStage:1,targetSaying:get along well with it=interested.png,Like, a horse? Well, sure, I wouldn't mind meetin' 'em. Bet they got somethin' interestin' to say about you.
1-opponent_stripped,target:larachel,targetStage:2,marker:nickname*=princess=smug.png,Oh, I see <i>plenty.</i> Let's see another round, <i>princess.</i>
1-opponent_stripped,target:larachel,targetStage:3=smug.png,Whenever you're ready, <i>your highness.</i>
1-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:1=confused.png,You're a woman? Dog<i>gone</i> ya had me fooled!
1-opponent_stripped,target:mae,targetStage:1=smug.png,Glad <i>someone's</i> bein' sensible 'bout their footwear.
1-opponent_stripped,target:mae,targetStage:2=calm.png,Ain't no need to be a sourpuss.
1-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:1=calm.png,Even if ya <i>do</i> talk like you've gone bonkers.
1-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:2=boisterous.png,Ya <i>are</i> a normal gal! Oh, I knew it all along. Sheep got an eye for this kinda thing, y'know.
1-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:3=sad.png,Oh, wait... is it Halloween? Did I miss it?
1-opponent_stripped,target:mavis,targetStage:1=sad.png,Right? You wouldn't hurt an innocent li'l lamb, now would ya?
1-opponent_stripped,target:meia,targetStage:1=smug.png,Even if it <i>does</i> look mighty chilly. You alright for winter in that?
1-opponent_stripped,target:meia,targetStage:1=mad.png,If you try to take <i>me</i>, Droopy'll hound you till you quit! I mean it!
1-opponent_stripped,target:meia,targetStage:1=sad.png,You wouldn't kidnap a poor, helpless li'l lamb, now would you?
1-opponent_stripped,target:meia,targetStage:3=interested.png,And darlin', your search is gonna be a short one, let me tell ya!
1-opponent_stripped,target:misato,targetStage:1=mad.png,Hey, my head's clean! Ain't no sheep on the farm with cleaner wool!
1-opponent_stripped,target:misato,targetStage:2=smug.png,Might be easier to win if ya weren't drinkin' somethin' so foul.
1-opponent_stripped,target:nagisa,targetStage:1=confident.png,Well shoot. C'mon, then, show us what you've got!
1-opponent_stripped,target:nagisa,targetStage:2=confident.png,You got the heart to see this through, and I'm fittin' to make sure you do!
1-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:1=embarrassed.png,I... I ain't sayin' I <i>don't</i> want no pets, but...
1-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:1=smug.png,Unless there might be... <i>somethin'</i> keepin ya here...
1-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,saidMarker:rules=boisterous.png,Now we know, let's kick their butts!
1-opponent_stripped,target:nayru,targetStage:5,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=confused.png,Y'all alright? Hello? Nayru?
1-opponent_stripped,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:1=calm.png,Sometimes I sure wish they made shoes for sheep.
1-opponent_stripped,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:2=calm.png,Well, human, sure; I seen them plenty. Just never seen no one like you 'round the farm.
1-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:pit,notSaidMarker:angel,marker:angel=shocked.png,Wait a sec... you're glowy all over! Are you... are you <i>both</i> some kinda angel?

2-opponent_stripping,target:pit,targetStage:2=sad.png,I don't ever know what kinda trouble Peggy's tryin' to get me into, or why them wolves're always so nasty... I know you angels probably see all that stuff...
2-opponent_stripping,target:pit,targetStage:3=happy.png,Oh, I just got the best idea! Once we're done here!
2-opponent_stripping,target:revy,targetStage:0=sad.png,Y'all still havin' fun? The game ain't no fun with sore losers.
2-opponent_stripping,target:revy,targetStage:1=mad.png,I ain't scared by no guns; Droopy can shoot with the best of 'em.
2-opponent_stripping,target:revy,targetStage:2=confident.png,You ain't too used to seein' sheep, are ya?
2-opponent_stripping,target:revy,targetStage:2,targetSaying:eating,marker:Revyeating=embarrassed.png,N-no! I ain't for dinner, y'hear! Don't talk like that!
2-opponent_stripping,target:revy,targetStage:3=interested.png,Hang on, now; <i>guns</i> count as clothin'?
2-opponent_stripping,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=calm.png,Nothin' too big for yer first loss, but...
2-opponent_stripping,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=sad.png,Aww, now that's no fun!
2-opponent_stripping,target:ryuji,targetStage:0=smug.png,What brings y'all here... Ryuji, ya say?
2-opponent_stripping,target:ryuji,targetStage:1=smug.png,I ain't sayin' I hope you lose, sugar...
2-opponent_stripping,target:ryuji,targetStage:2=sad.png,Aww, now is that really all? You gonna make me beg?
2-opponent_stripping,target:saki,targetStage:0=interested.png,I like <i>your</i> uniform. Where you from?
2-opponent_stripping,target:saki_zls,targetStage:0=smug.png,I guess y'ain't doin' <i>too</i> bad.
2-opponent_stripping,target:sakura,targetStage:2=interested.png,What? What's goin' on?
2-opponent_stripping,target:sakura,targetStage:3=shocked.png,<i>Ah!</i> How'd you do that? That ain't natural!
2-opponent_stripping,target:syrenne,targetStage:0=interested.png,Why're you goin' right for your top?
2-opponent_stripping,target:twilight,targetStage:0,targetSaying:"panties"=smug.png,I <i>know!</i> They just look so miserable... finally, <i>someone</i> gets it!
2-opponent_stripping,target:twilight,targetStage:1=shocked.png,Wait now, I don't know if...
2-opponent_stripping,target:weiss,targetStage:0=shocked.png,<i>Ooh, it's shiny...</i>
2-opponent_stripping,target:weiss,targetStage:1=confused.png,That get-up looks mighty chilly, miss Weiss.
2-opponent_stripping,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=confused.png,Seein' boots like that sure makes me wish I <i>could</i> wear shoes.
2-opponent_stripping,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1=confused.png,Hang on, now... that didn't take long <i>at all!</i>
2-opponent_stripping,target:zone-tan,targetStage:2=interested.png,Oh! Well ain't this a surprise?
2-opponent_stripping,notSaidMarker:strip,test:~clothing.type~:extra:!=,marker:strip=shocked.png,<i>Oh!</i> I get it now! It ain't just about bettin' small stuff, is it?
2-opponent_stripping,notSaidMarker:strip,test:~clothing.type~:extra:!=,marker:strip=interested.png,Why're you givin' up more...? <i>Oh!</i> It ain't about the clothing, is it?
2-opponent_stripped,count-not_mostly_clothed:0=calm.png,Alright, alright, no sense floggin' a dead horse. We've got poker to play!
2-opponent_stripped,count-not_mostly_clothed:0=confident.png,You'll be out 'fore ya know it!
2-opponent_stripped,count-not_mostly_clothed:0=smug.png,I'm excited to see what you'll do when you lose again.
2-opponent_stripped,count-not_mostly_clothed:0=interested.png,Ooh, could I try holdin' your ~clothing~? I'll give ~clothing.ifPlural('em|it)~ back in a jiffy!
2-opponent_stripped,count-not_mostly_clothed:0=horny.png,Game's just as fun without ~clothing.ifPlural(them|that)~ ~clothing~, darlin'!
2-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:1,count-pit:0=shocked.png,Matter of fact... you're <i>all</i> glowy! You some kinda angel?
2-opponent_stripped,saidMarker:strip,notSaidMarker:strip2,marker:strip2=confident.png,Here I thought this whole time none a'y'all had money.
2-opponent_stripped,saidMarker:strip,notSaidMarker:strip2,marker:strip2=horny.png,'S more about what's <i>underneath...</i>
2-opponent_stripped,target:aimee,targetStage:1-5=mad.png,What in the world's gotten into you?!
2-opponent_stripped,target:aimee,targetStage:1-5=mad.png,I oughtta... why, if Barbra were here, you'd get it right proper!
2-opponent_stripped,target:aimee,targetStage:1-5=embarrassed.png,Don't do that again!
2-opponent_stripped,target:aimee,targetStage:1-5=mad.png,You're lucky I didn't have to pee!
2-opponent_stripped,target:akko,targetStage:1=embarrassed.png,I'm in <i>way</i> over my head here...
2-opponent_stripped,target:amalia,targetStage:1=boisterous.png,Sure is creative, I'll say that!
2-opponent_stripped,target:amalia,targetStage:5,marker:Amaliaflowers=interested.png,Oh? What's goin' on?
2-opponent_stripped,target:calisto,targetStage:1=smug.png,I guess most ain't blessed with hooves, now are they?
2-opponent_stripped,target:catria,targetStage:1=boisterous.png,But don't let me stop you from droppin' a sword!
2-opponent_stripped,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=calm.png,Maybe we can see after the game.
2-opponent_stripped,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=confident.png,Ain't like I really gotta; Droopy's got a <i>keen</i> eye.
2-opponent_stripped,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:1=smug.png,Oh, yeah; never mind. Awful loud hat, ain't it?
2-opponent_stripped,target:emi,targetStage:1=calm.png,What's a little thing like you even doin' in a place like this, anyhow?
2-opponent_stripped,target:emi,targetStage:4=calm.png,Must be you just know somethin' I don't.
2-opponent_stripped,target:emi,targetStage:5=sad.png,Golly, I don't get this game <i>none</i>, do I?
2-opponent_stripped,target:estelle,targetStage:1=happy.png,That don't mean a lamb can't feel pretty every now and again!
2-opponent_stripped,target:florina,targetStage:1=calm.png,I guess if what you want's to come outta your shell, this'll do the trick.
2-opponent_stripped,target:hanako,targetStage:1=confident.png,Ain't like it makes you any worse at the game, now is it?
2-opponent_stripped,target:hanako,targetStage:2=happy.png,You're a real cutie, y'hear?
2-opponent_stripped,target:haru,targetStage:1=calm.png,Barbra's like a big sister. Tall, grows wool even faster'n I do. Everyone seems afraid of her for some reason.
2-opponent_stripped,target:haru,targetStage:2=happy.png,Huggin' ain't against no rules, right? I still ain't too used to most'a y'all's games.
2-opponent_stripped,target:hk416,targetStage:1=calm.png,Well, as long as I ain't in yer sights, I don't got no problems with that.
2-opponent_stripped,target:jura,targetStage:1=embarrassed.png,I ain't sayin' I <i>want</i> you to keep that sword at yer side...
2-opponent_stripped,target:jura,targetStage:2=happy.png,You should meet her! She'd love you, I just <i>know</i> it!
2-opponent_stripped,target:jura,targetStage:3=calm.png,Maybe next time I oughtta come to you for tips; you sure seem to know more than Peggy ever did.
2-opponent_stripped,target:kamina,targetStage:1=confident.png,Doesn't do much good to stall with little things when the goods're already out there.
2-opponent_stripped,target:kamina,targetStage:2=horny.png,Why not come a little closer'n see how soft this wool <i>really</i> is?
2-opponent_stripped,target:larachel,targetStage:1=calm.png,I'm sure it'll be waitin' nice and pretty for ya whenever you're done.
2-opponent_stripped,target:larachel,targetStage:1=confident.png,If you need somethin' to stroke, this wool's just as soft as it looks.
2-opponent_stripped,target:larachel,targetStage:1,targetSaying:get along well with it=interested.png,Like, a horse? Well, sure, I wouldn't mind meetin' 'em. Bet they got somethin' interestin' to say about you.

2-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:1=calm.png,Even if ya <i>do</i> talk like you've gone bonkers.
2-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:2=boisterous.png,Ya <i>are</i> a normal gal! Oh, I knew it all along. Sheep got an eye for this kinda thing, y'know.
2-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:3=sad.png,Oh, wait... is it Halloween? Did I miss it?
2-opponent_stripped,target:mavis,targetStage:1=sad.png,Right? You wouldn't hurt an innocent li'l lamb, now would ya?
2-opponent_stripped,target:meia,targetStage:1=smug.png,Even if it <i>does</i> look mighty chilly. You alright for winter in that?
2-opponent_stripped,target:meia,targetStage:1=mad.png,If you try to take <i>me</i>, Droopy'll hound you till you quit! I mean it!
2-opponent_stripped,target:meia,targetStage:1=sad.png,You wouldn't kidnap a poor, helpless li'l lamb, now would you?
2-opponent_stripped,target:meia,targetStage:3=interested.png,And darlin', your search is gonna be a short one, let me tell ya!
2-opponent_stripped,target:misato,targetStage:1=mad.png,Hey, my head's clean! Ain't no sheep on the farm with cleaner wool!
2-opponent_stripped,target:misato,targetStage:2=smug.png,Might be easier to win if ya weren't drinkin' somethin' so foul.
2-opponent_stripped,target:nagisa,targetStage:1=confident.png,Well shoot. C'mon, then, show us what you've got!
2-opponent_stripped,target:nagisa,targetStage:2=confident.png,You got the heart to see this through, and I'm fittin' to make sure you do!
2-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:1=embarrassed.png,I... I ain't sayin' I <i>don't</i> want no pets, but...

2-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,saidMarker:rules=boisterous.png,Now we know, let's kick their butts!
2-opponent_stripped,target:nayru,targetStage:5,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=confused.png,Y'all alright? Hello? Nayru?
2-opponent_stripped,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:1=calm.png,Sometimes I sure wish they made shoes for sheep.
2-opponent_stripped,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:2=calm.png,Well, human, sure; I seen them plenty. Just never seen no one like you 'round the farm.
2-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:pit,notSaidMarker:angel,marker:angel=shocked.png,Wait a sec... you're glowy all over! Are you... are you <i>both</i> some kinda angel?
2-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:2=happy.png,<i>Ooh</i>, why do I just wanna give you a hug so badly?
2-opponent_stripped,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:1=interested.png,Oh, don't mind me none. You seem like you've done this before.
2-opponent_stripped,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:2=smug.png,And it ain't so bad to watch, if ya don't mind my sayin'.
2-opponent_stripped,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:3=sad.png,I just can't keep up, Pinkie. Is it better to strip quick or no?
2-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:1=happy.png,I never thought I'd see the day! Anything you want, Mr. Angel, just gimme a holler!
2-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:palutena,notSaidMarker:angel,marker:angel=shocked.png,But if he's an angel, then what's that make <i>you</i>?
2-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:2=boisterous.png,But I'm rootin' for ya!
2-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:3=happy.png,You think y'all can teach me some'a them things? I'll be a good li'l lamb, honest!
2-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:4=smug.png,You should come back to the farm with me a minute! Oh, Barbra'd love to meet you! And we could teach Peggy a thing or two, I know it.
2-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:4=happy.png,Oh Barbara would just have the darndest time with you, Mr. Angel!
2-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:4=happy.png,Peggy would <i>love</i> you Mr. Angel! I oughtta introduce you!
2-opponent_stripped,target:revy,targetStage:1=embarrassed.png,I didn't mean nothin' by it!
2-opponent_stripped,target:revy,targetStage:2=embarrassed.png,I just ain't too used to... <i>you!</i>
2-opponent_stripped,target:revy,targetStage:3=happy.png,That's just fine. I like you! You'll get used to it in no time!
2-opponent_stripped,target:revy,targetStage:3,saidMarker:Revyeating=sad.png,That dang wolf always tries to eat us; I thought I'd be safe from that here.
2-opponent_stripped,target:revy,targetStage:4=confused.png,Sometimes I feel like these rules're just made up as we're goin' along.
2-opponent_stripped,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=horny.png,I dunno, there's just <i>somethin'</i> about some nice, strong hands...
2-opponent_stripped,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=smug.png,Oh, it's fine, it's fine. Guess we'll just have to keep wearin' you down the ol' fashioned way!

2-opponent_stripped,target:saki,targetStage:1=calm.png,Cute li'l schoolgirls used to come by the farm every now and again; you remind me of 'em, is all.
2-opponent_stripped,target:saki_zls,targetStage:1=confident.png,Still plenty of time to lose, though.
2-opponent_stripped,target:sakura,targetStage:3=confused.png,I don't... I ain't sure what you're talkin' about. I don't mind blue skin none though. Why hide that?
2-opponent_stripped,target:sakura,targetStage:4=sad.png,You okay? How'd... how're you still on your feet? I mean I've seen chickens what could still stand for a bit, but...
2-opponent_stripped,target:syrenne=confused.png,Don't you wanna save the good bits for last, hon'?
2-opponent_stripped,target:twilight,targetStage:1=happy.png,Ahh! Oh, I didn't expect to find another animal here! What're you? A horse?
2-opponent_stripped,target:twilight,targetStage:2=smug.png,You're awful eager to get outta them clothes, now. And I'm mighty glad I don't need to wear nothin' like that.
2-opponent_stripped,target:weiss,targetStage:2=smug.png,Seems like it could use a bit of wool in it. Oh, don't worry none; doesn't hurt me to lose a bit.
2-opponent_stripped,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1=calm.png,Hooves ain't too bad, but they're awful hard to doll up.
2-opponent_stripped,target:zone-tan,targetStage:2=smug.png,Oh, I get it. Yeah, I bet Peggy'd like you.
2-opponent_stripped,target:zone-tan,targetStage:3=smug.png,Y'all startin' to grow on me, too.

2-opponent_stripped,filter:fancy,test:~clothing.type~:extra=smug.png,I think I've seen people 'round the farm wearin' stuff like that, but never so fancy!
2-opponent_stripped,filter:fancy,test:~clothing.type~:extra=smug.png,Your ~clothing~ wouldn't last too long back on the farm.
2-opponent_stripped,filter:fancy,test:~clothing.type~:extra=sad.png,I sure would like a closer look...

3-opponent_lost,target:saki_zls,targetStage:0=smug.png,Ya sure do talk big, darlin'.
3-opponent_lost,target:twilight,targetStage:0=shocked.png,Hang on, now... you're not human either?
3-opponent_lost,target:twilight,targetStage:1=sad.png,This game seems so unfair sometimes...
3-opponent_lost,target:weiss,targetStage:0=interested.png,Now that's a right pretty dress! I sure wish my wool could shine like that.
3-opponent_lost,target:weiss,targetStage:1=smug.png,All that fancy clothin' ain't doin' ya much good in poker, now is it?
3-opponent_lost,target:zone-tan,targetStage:2=happy.png,I don't mind seein' a bit more underwear. That's why we're still playin', right?
3-opponent_lost,oneShotId:1,priority:0,test:~background~:arcade=butt.png,Oh, all this looks so confusin'... How does anyone keep up with it?
3-opponent_lost,oneShotId:2,priority:0,test:~background~:hot spring=butt.png,<i>Gosh,</i> we can't turn down the heat <i>at all?</i>
3-opponent_lost,oneShotId:4,priority:0,test:~background~:library=butt.png,I oughtta stay a bit after we're done here. Been meanin' to get some book learnin' done.
3-opponent_lost,oneShotId:7,priority:0,test:~background~:poolside=butt.png,Y'all mind if I have a quick dip? I won't take long!
3-opponent_lost,oneShotId:6,priority:0,test:~background~:showers=butt.png,Anyone else thinkin' what I'm thinkin'? At least it'll be easy enough to clean up later on...
3-opponent_lost,oneShotId:8,priority:0,test:~background~:street=butt.png,Y'all know why we got so many guests? When did they get here?
3-opponent_stripping,filter:animal_ears,one-shot-id:11=interested.png,Ooh! Them ears! You from a farm too?
3-opponent_stripping,filter:animal_ears,one-shot-id:12=happy.png,Perfect! I was hopin' to meet someone else like me here!
3-opponent_stripping,filter:leotard,one-shot-id:8=interested.png,Hang on a sec... now that looks just like my... ~name~, we're like twins, ain't we?
3-opponent_stripping,filter:musician,one-shot-id:1=confident.png,Oh, I <i>always</i> loved music. Mind playin' us somethin'?
3-opponent_stripping,filter:musician,one-shot-id:2=happy.png,You play music? I'd <i>love</i> to hear some!
3-opponent_stripping,filter:musician,one-shot-id:3=calm.png,Why don't you play us a tune, ~name~?
3-opponent_stripping,filter:pirate,one-shot-id:5=mad.png,You steal things, don't ya, ~name~? Well don't you get no ideas, y'hear?
3-opponent_stripping,filter:pirate,one-shot-id:6=sad.png,Now you wouldn't have no reason to kidnap a poor li'l helpless sheep, would you ~name~?
3-opponent_stripping,filter:scarred,one-shot-id:7=interested.png,(<i>I wonder how </i>that<i> happened. It's rude to ask though, ain't it?</i>)
3-opponent_stripping,filter:serious,one-shot-id:9=smug.png,Don't be such a damp rag, ~name~. You're playin' strip poker with a sheep; lighten up!
3-opponent_stripping,filter:spirit,one-shot-id:10=sad.png,Ah! Ghost! Don't hurt me, miss ~name~!
3-opponent_stripping,filter:tandem,one-shot-id:4=interested.png,Wait, we can get <i>help?</i> Where's Peggy when ya need her?
3-opponent_stripping,target:aimee,targetStage:0-4=shocked.png,Stop, stop, stop!
3-opponent_stripping,target:aimee,targetStage:0-4=shocked.png,What're you doin'?! Cut that out!
3-opponent_stripping,target:aimee,targetStage:0-4=shocked.png,My ears! Make it stop!
3-opponent_stripping,target:aimee,targetStage:0-4=shocked.png,This ain't what I wanted!
3-opponent_stripping,target:akko,targetStage:0=confused.png,I ain't never seen nothin' like <i>that</i>...
3-opponent_stripping,target:amalia,targetStage:0=confused.png,You wearin'... <i>leaves?</i> Guess I can't talk much about strange clothin', but...
3-opponent_stripping,target:calisto,targetStage:0=interested.png,Lots of work keepin' them shoes nice and pretty, ain't it darlin'?
3-opponent_stripping,target:catria,targetStage:0=confused.png,Guess I shouldn't be <i>too</i> surprised... Been seein' all kinds of strange sorts here.
3-opponent_stripping,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=interested.png,I oughtta learn how you play. Is there a trick you can give me?
3-opponent_stripping,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=calm.png,I... mostly just keep an eye out for wolves.
3-opponent_stripping,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:0=interested.png,Now what on Earth is all that supposed to be? You look like the tin man, hon'!
3-opponent_stripping,target:emi,targetStage:0=happy.png,You're just the cutest li'l thing!
3-opponent_stripping,target:emi,targetStage:3=confused.png,Wait a sec, ain't you got socks you could...?
3-opponent_stripping,target:emi,targetStage:4=shocked.png,Hang on now... why ain't you...?
3-opponent_stripping,target:emi,targetStage:7=shocked.png,What in the world...? You...
3-opponent_stripping,target:estelle,targetStage:0=confused.png,Now I... I don't <i>wear</i> no clothes like that, but...
3-opponent_stripping,target:florina,targetStage:0=confused.png,Y'all seem <i>awful</i> nice for this sorta game...
3-opponent_stripping,target:hanako,targetStage:0=embarrassed.png,Well... I ain't about to go easy on you, ya hear?
3-opponent_stripping,target:hanako,targetStage:1=confident.png,Don't you worry none, darlin'.
3-opponent_stripping,target:haru,targetStage:0=happy.png,You just look so... <i>comfy!</i> Y'almost remind me of Barbra!
3-opponent_stripping,target:haru,targetStage:1=confident.png,But Barbra's got the warmest, softest hugs y'ever did feel... Like gettin' lost in a cloud.
3-opponent_stripping,target:hk416,targetStage:0=interested.png,What's all... you just come from some kinda war or somethin'?
3-opponent_stripping,target:jura,targetStage:0=confused.png,Hang on, that counts? It ain't even clothin'!
3-opponent_stripping,target:jura,targetStage:1=calm.png,Y' don't seem <i>so</i> bad though. Y'almost remind me of Barbra.
3-opponent_stripping,target:jura,targetStage:2=confused.png,...but it sure helps you out here. How much you wearin', anyhow?
3-opponent_stripping,target:kamina,targetStage:0=smug.png,Whaddaya say 'bout a hug, darlin'? I don't bite.
3-opponent_stripping,target:kamina,targetStage:1=interested.png,Oh, and here I thought it couldn't get no better.
3-opponent_stripping,target:larachel,targetStage:0=smug.png,<i>Talk</i> about impractical; them nice shiny boots'd be 'bout pretty as a pig once they're covered in mud.
3-opponent_stripping,target:larachel,targetStage:1=shocked.png,Wait now, don't do nothin' hasty!
3-opponent_stripping,target:larachel,targetStage:2=interested.png,<i>Ooh...</i> I like them boots. Wouldn't stay so pretty steppin' through mud, though.
3-opponent_stripping,target:larachel,targetStage:3=sad.png,Doin' alright, there, princess? You seem awful antsy.
3-opponent_stripping,target:lucina,targetStage:0=interested.png,Hang on a sec'...
3-opponent_stripping,target:mae,targetStage:0=interested.png,Now <i>those</i> boots look nice 'n practical.
3-opponent_stripping,target:mae,targetStage:1=happy.png,I know y'ain't got no much of a choice, just lemme poke my fun!
3-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:0=smug.png,Well, whatever y'are, you're not unstoppable.
3-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:1=shocked.png,Whoa! What's goin' on here?
3-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:2=calm.png,I guess y'ain't so bad. When you're not dressin' up for Halloween.
3-opponent_stripping,target:mavis,targetStage:0=embarrassed.png,Wait... them teeth... I know I've seen this before! I ain't your dinner!
3-opponent_stripping,target:meia,targetStage:0=happy.png,Sure does make you look nice!
3-opponent_stripping,target:meia,targetStage:1=confused.png,I heard stories about the cows gettin' took by space aliens, y'know...
3-opponent_stripping,target:meia,targetStage:2=happy.png,You're lookin' for a bo'!
3-opponent_stripping,target:misato,targetStage:0=interested.png,Ooh! Give it here, give it here!
3-opponent_stripping,target:misato,targetStage:1=shocked.png,Oh, so <i>that's</i> what I's smellin'.
3-opponent_stripping,target:nagisa,targetStage:0=interested.png,But you ain't leavin'?
3-opponent_stripping,target:nagisa,targetStage:1=smug.png,I oughtta warn you now: I ain't gonna settle for halfway done.
3-opponent_stripping,target:natsuki,targetStage:0=mad.png,No I don't make it a pettin' zoo wherever I go!
3-opponent_stripping,target:natsuki,targetStage:0,saidMarker:rules=sad.png,Ain't right, I tell ya. Startin' a game like this when we ain't even sure what's goin' on.
3-opponent_stripping,target:natsuki,targetStage:1=calm.png,You 'n ~player~ can get outta here whever ya want. I won't mind none.
3-opponent_stripping,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=embarrassed.png,Shoot!
3-opponent_stripping,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=happy.png,What cute shoes!
3-opponent_stripping,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:1=interested.png,Gotta say, Nugi, I ain't too sure what you... are.
3-opponent_stripping,target:palutena,targetStage:0=happy.png,It's absolutely glowing!
3-opponent_stripping,target:palutena,targetStage:1=calm.png,But that don't matter none. Angel or not, I still think you're fine.
3-opponent_stripping,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:0=confused.png,You're on a race to the bottom, ain't ya? Startin' with your top?
3-opponent_stripping,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:1=happy.png,I shoulda known! I bet Pinkie's the one what's playin' this right.
3-opponent_stripping,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:2=confused.png,Wait... you're actually kickin' off them shoes? I don't...
3-opponent_stripping,target:pit,targetStage:0=interested.png,Oh, I get it! You're like an angel or somethin'!
3-opponent_stripping,target:pit,targetStage:1=confused.png,I ain't too sure why you're here... doin'... <i>this</i>...
3-opponent_stripping,target:pit,targetStage:2=sad.png,I don't ever know what kinda trouble Peggy's tryin' to get me into, or why them wolves're always so nasty... I know you angels probably see all that stuff...
3-opponent_stripping,target:pit,targetStage:3=happy.png,Oh, I just got the best idea! Once we're done here!
3-opponent_stripping,target:revy,targetStage:0=sad.png,Y'all still havin' fun? The game ain't no fun with sore losers.
3-opponent_stripping,target:revy,targetStage:1=mad.png,I ain't scared by no guns; Droopy can shoot with the best of 'em.
3-opponent_stripping,target:revy,targetStage:2=confident.png,You ain't too used to seein' sheep, are ya?
3-opponent_stripping,target:revy,targetStage:2,targetSaying:eating,marker:Revyeating=embarrassed.png,N-no! I ain't for dinner, y'hear! Don't talk like that!
3-opponent_stripping,target:revy,targetStage:3=interested.png,Hang on, now; <i>guns</i> count as clothin'?
3-opponent_stripping,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=calm.png,Nothin' too big for yer first loss, but...
3-opponent_stripping,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=sad.png,Aww, now that's no fun!
3-opponent_stripping,target:ryuji,targetStage:0=smug.png,What brings y'all here... Ryuji, ya say?
3-opponent_stripping,target:ryuji,targetStage:1=smug.png,I ain't sayin' I hope you lose, sugar...
3-opponent_stripping,target:ryuji,targetStage:2=sad.png,Aww, now is that really all? You gonna make me beg?
3-opponent_stripping,target:saki,targetStage:0=interested.png,I like <i>your</i> uniform. Where you from?
3-opponent_stripping,target:saki_zls,targetStage:0=smug.png,I guess y'ain't doin' <i>too</i> bad.
3-opponent_stripping,target:sakura,targetStage:2=interested.png,What? What's goin' on?
3-opponent_stripping,target:sakura,targetStage:3=shocked.png,<i>Ah!</i> How'd you do that? That ain't natural!
3-opponent_stripping,target:syrenne,targetStage:0=interested.png,Why're you goin' right for your top?
3-opponent_stripping,target:twilight,targetStage:0,targetSaying:"panties"=smug.png,I <i>know!</i> They just look so miserable... finally, <i>someone</i> gets it!
3-opponent_stripping,target:twilight,targetStage:1=shocked.png,Wait now, I don't know if...
3-opponent_stripping,target:weiss,targetStage:0=shocked.png,<i>Ooh, it's shiny...</i>
3-opponent_stripping,target:weiss,targetStage:1=confused.png,That get-up looks mighty chilly, miss Weiss.
3-opponent_stripping,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=confused.png,Seein' boots like that sure makes me wish I <i>could</i> wear shoes.
3-opponent_stripping,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1=confused.png,Hang on, now... that didn't take long <i>at all!</i>
3-opponent_stripping,target:zone-tan,targetStage:2=interested.png,Oh! Well ain't this a surprise?
3-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:1,count-pit:0=shocked.png,Matter of fact... you're <i>all</i> glowy! You some kinda angel?
3-opponent_stripped,target:aimee,targetStage:1-5=mad.png,What in the world's gotten into you?!
3-opponent_stripped,target:aimee,targetStage:1-5=mad.png,I oughtta... why, if Barbra were here, you'd get it right proper!
3-opponent_stripped,target:aimee,targetStage:1-5=embarrassed.png,Don't do that again!
3-opponent_stripped,target:aimee,targetStage:1-5=mad.png,You're lucky I didn't have to pee!
3-opponent_stripped,target:akko,targetStage:1=embarrassed.png,I'm in <i>way</i> over my head here...
3-opponent_stripped,target:amalia,targetStage:1=boisterous.png,Sure is creative, I'll say that!
3-opponent_stripped,target:amalia,targetStage:5,marker:Amaliaflowers=interested.png,Oh? What's goin' on?
3-opponent_stripped,target:calisto,targetStage:1=smug.png,I guess most ain't blessed with hooves, now are they?
3-opponent_stripped,target:catria,targetStage:1=boisterous.png,But don't let me stop you from droppin' a sword!
3-opponent_stripped,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=calm.png,Maybe we can see after the game.
3-opponent_stripped,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=confident.png,Ain't like I really gotta; Droopy's got a <i>keen</i> eye.
3-opponent_stripped,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:1=smug.png,Oh, yeah; never mind. Awful loud hat, ain't it?
3-opponent_stripped,target:emi,targetStage:1=calm.png,What's a little thing like you even doin' in a place like this, anyhow?
3-opponent_stripped,target:emi,targetStage:4=calm.png,Must be you just know somethin' I don't.
3-opponent_stripped,target:emi,targetStage:5=sad.png,Golly, I don't get this game <i>none</i>, do I?
3-opponent_stripped,target:estelle,targetStage:1=happy.png,That don't mean a lamb can't feel pretty every now and again!
3-opponent_stripped,target:florina,targetStage:1=calm.png,I guess if what you want's to come outta your shell, this'll do the trick.
3-opponent_stripped,target:hanako,targetStage:1=confident.png,Ain't like it makes you any worse at the game, now is it?
3-opponent_stripped,target:hanako,targetStage:2=happy.png,You're a real cutie, y'hear?
3-opponent_stripped,target:haru,targetStage:1=calm.png,Barbra's like a big sister. Tall, grows wool even faster'n I do. Everyone seems afraid of her for some reason.
3-opponent_stripped,target:haru,targetStage:2=happy.png,Huggin' ain't against no rules, right? I still ain't too used to most'a y'all's games.
3-opponent_stripped,target:hk416,targetStage:1=calm.png,Well, as long as I ain't in yer sights, I don't got no problems with that.
3-opponent_stripped,target:jura,targetStage:1=embarrassed.png,I ain't sayin' I <i>want</i> you to keep that sword at yer side...
3-opponent_stripped,target:jura,targetStage:2=happy.png,You should meet her! She'd love you, I just <i>know</i> it!
3-opponent_stripped,target:jura,targetStage:3=calm.png,Maybe next time I oughtta come to you for tips; you sure seem to know more than Peggy ever did.
3-opponent_stripped,target:kamina,targetStage:1=confident.png,Doesn't do much good to stall with little things when the goods're already out there.
3-opponent_stripped,target:kamina,targetStage:2=horny.png,Why not come a little closer'n see how soft this wool <i>really</i> is?
3-opponent_stripped,target:larachel,targetStage:1=calm.png,I'm sure it'll be waitin' nice and pretty for ya whenever you're done.
3-opponent_stripped,target:larachel,targetStage:1=confident.png,If you need somethin' to stroke, this wool's just as soft as it looks.
3-opponent_stripped,target:larachel,targetStage:1,targetSaying:get along well with it=interested.png,Like, a horse? Well, sure, I wouldn't mind meetin' 'em. Bet they got somethin' interestin' to say about you.
3-opponent_stripped,target:larachel,targetStage:2,marker:nickname*=princess=smug.png,Oh, I see <i>plenty.</i> Let's see another round, <i>princess.</i>
3-opponent_stripped,target:larachel,targetStage:3=smug.png,Whenever you're ready, <i>your highness.</i>
3-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:1=confused.png,You're a woman? Dog<i>gone</i> ya had me fooled!
3-opponent_stripped,target:mae,targetStage:1=smug.png,Glad <i>someone's</i> bein' sensible 'bout their footwear.
3-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:1=calm.png,Even if ya <i>do</i> talk like you've gone bonkers.
3-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:2=boisterous.png,Ya <i>are</i> a normal gal! Oh, I knew it all along. Sheep got an eye for this kinda thing, y'know.
3-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:3=sad.png,Oh, wait... is it Halloween? Did I miss it?
3-opponent_stripped,target:mavis,targetStage:1=sad.png,Right? You wouldn't hurt an innocent li'l lamb, now would ya?
3-opponent_stripped,target:meia,targetStage:1=smug.png,Even if it <i>does</i> look mighty chilly. You alright for winter in that?
3-opponent_stripped,target:meia,targetStage:1=mad.png,If you try to take <i>me</i>, Droopy'll hound you till you quit! I mean it!
3-opponent_stripped,target:meia,targetStage:1=sad.png,You wouldn't kidnap a poor, helpless li'l lamb, now would you?
3-opponent_stripped,target:meia,targetStage:3=interested.png,And darlin', your search is gonna be a short one, let me tell ya!
3-opponent_stripped,target:misato,targetStage:1=mad.png,Hey, my head's clean! Ain't no sheep on the farm with cleaner wool!
3-opponent_stripped,target:misato,targetStage:2=smug.png,Might be easier to win if ya weren't drinkin' somethin' so foul.
3-opponent_stripped,target:nagisa,targetStage:1=confident.png,Well shoot. C'mon, then, show us what you've got!
3-opponent_stripped,target:nagisa,targetStage:2=confident.png,You got the heart to see this through, and I'm fittin' to make sure you do!
3-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:1=embarrassed.png,I... I ain't sayin' I <i>don't</i> want no pets, but...
3-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:1=smug.png,Unless there might be... <i>somethin'</i> keepin ya here...
3-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,saidMarker:rules=boisterous.png,Now we know, let's kick their butts!
3-opponent_stripped,target:nayru,targetStage:5,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=confused.png,Y'all alright? Hello? Nayru?
3-opponent_stripped,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:1=calm.png,Sometimes I sure wish they made shoes for sheep.
3-opponent_stripped,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:2=calm.png,Well, human, sure; I seen them plenty. Just never seen no one like you 'round the farm.
3-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:pit,notSaidMarker:angel,marker:angel=shocked.png,Wait a sec... you're glowy all over! Are you... are you <i>both</i> some kinda angel?
3-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:2=happy.png,<i>Ooh</i>, why do I just wanna give you a hug so badly?
3-opponent_stripped,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:1=interested.png,Oh, don't mind me none. You seem like you've done this before.
3-opponent_stripped,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:2=smug.png,And it ain't so bad to watch, if ya don't mind my sayin'.
3-opponent_stripped,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:3=sad.png,I just can't keep up, Pinkie. Is it better to strip quick or no?
3-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:1=happy.png,I never thought I'd see the day! Anything you want, Mr. Angel, just gimme a holler!
3-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:palutena,notSaidMarker:angel,marker:angel=shocked.png,But if he's an angel, then what's that make <i>you</i>?
3-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:2=boisterous.png,But I'm rootin' for ya!
3-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:3=happy.png,You think y'all can teach me some'a them things? I'll be a good li'l lamb, honest!
3-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:4=smug.png,You should come back to the farm with me a minute! Oh, Barbra'd love to meet you! And we could teach Peggy a thing or two, I know it.
3-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:4=happy.png,Oh Barbara would just have the darndest time with you, Mr. Angel!
3-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:4=happy.png,Peggy would <i>love</i> you Mr. Angel! I oughtta introduce you!
3-opponent_stripped,target:revy,targetStage:1=embarrassed.png,I didn't mean nothin' by it!
3-opponent_stripped,target:revy,targetStage:2=embarrassed.png,I just ain't too used to... <i>you!</i>
3-opponent_stripped,target:revy,targetStage:3=happy.png,That's just fine. I like you! You'll get used to it in no time!
3-opponent_stripped,target:revy,targetStage:3,saidMarker:Revyeating=sad.png,That dang wolf always tries to eat us; I thought I'd be safe from that here.
3-opponent_stripped,target:revy,targetStage:4=confused.png,Sometimes I feel like these rules're just made up as we're goin' along.
3-opponent_stripped,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=horny.png,I dunno, there's just <i>somethin'</i> about some nice, strong hands...
3-opponent_stripped,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=smug.png,Oh, it's fine, it's fine. Guess we'll just have to keep wearin' you down the ol' fashioned way!
3-opponent_stripped,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=pun.png,Ya sure are makin' me <i>burn up</i>, Rinkah.
3-opponent_stripped,target:ryuji,targetStage:1=happy.png,Oh, this is gonna be a <i>good</i> game!
3-opponent_stripped,target:ryuji,targetStage:2=happy.png,I just don't mind when ya do!
3-opponent_stripped,target:ryuji,targetStage:3=confused.png,Well I ain't gonna beg. I'll just have to hope you keep on losin'.
3-opponent_stripped,target:saki,targetStage:1=calm.png,Cute li'l schoolgirls used to come by the farm every now and again; you remind me of 'em, is all.
3-opponent_stripped,target:saki_zls,targetStage:1=confident.png,Still plenty of time to lose, though.
3-opponent_stripped,target:sakura,targetStage:3=confused.png,I don't... I ain't sure what you're talkin' about. I don't mind blue skin none though. Why hide that?
3-opponent_stripped,target:sakura,targetStage:4=sad.png,You okay? How'd... how're you still on your feet? I mean I've seen chickens what could still stand for a bit, but...
3-opponent_stripped,target:syrenne=confused.png,Don't you wanna save the good bits for last, hon'?
3-opponent_stripped,target:twilight,targetStage:1=happy.png,Ahh! Oh, I didn't expect to find another animal here! What're you? A horse?
3-opponent_stripped,target:twilight,targetStage:2=smug.png,You're awful eager to get outta them clothes, now. And I'm mighty glad I don't need to wear nothin' like that.
3-opponent_stripped,target:weiss,targetStage:2=smug.png,Seems like it could use a bit of wool in it. Oh, don't worry none; doesn't hurt me to lose a bit.

4-opponent_stripping,target:revy,targetStage:0=sad.png,Y'all still havin' fun? The game ain't no fun with sore losers.

4-opponent_stripping,target:weiss,targetStage:0=shocked.png,<i>Ooh, it's shiny...</i>
4-opponent_stripping,target:weiss,targetStage:1=confused.png,That get-up looks mighty chilly, miss Weiss.
4-opponent_stripping,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=confused.png,Seein' boots like that sure makes me wish I <i>could</i> wear shoes.
4-opponent_stripping,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1=confused.png,Hang on, now... that didn't take long <i>at all!</i>
4-opponent_stripping,target:zone-tan,targetStage:2=interested.png,Oh! Well ain't this a surprise?

4-opponent_stripped,target:aimee,targetStage:1-5=mad.png,I oughtta... why, if Barbra were here, you'd get it right proper!

4-opponent_stripped,target:catria,targetStage:1=boisterous.png,But don't let me stop you from droppin' a sword!
4-opponent_stripped,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=calm.png,Maybe we can see after the game.
4-opponent_stripped,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=confident.png,Ain't like I really gotta; Droopy's got a <i>keen</i> eye.
4-opponent_stripped,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:1=smug.png,Oh, yeah; never mind. Awful loud hat, ain't it?
4-opponent_stripped,target:emi,targetStage:1=calm.png,What's a little thing like you even doin' in a place like this, anyhow?
4-opponent_stripped,target:emi,targetStage:4=calm.png,Must be you just know somethin' I don't.
4-opponent_stripped,target:emi,targetStage:5=sad.png,Golly, I don't get this game <i>none</i>, do I?
4-opponent_stripped,target:estelle,targetStage:1=happy.png,That don't mean a lamb can't feel pretty every now and again!
4-opponent_stripped,target:florina,targetStage:1=calm.png,I guess if what you want's to come outta your shell, this'll do the trick.

4-opponent_stripped,target:hanako,targetStage:2=happy.png,You're a real cutie, y'hear?
4-opponent_stripped,target:haru,targetStage:1=calm.png,Barbra's like a big sister. Tall, grows wool even faster'n I do. Everyone seems afraid of her for some reason.
4-opponent_stripped,target:haru,targetStage:2=happy.png,Huggin' ain't against no rules, right? I still ain't too used to most'a y'all's games.

4-opponent_stripped,target:larachel,targetStage:1=calm.png,I'm sure it'll be waitin' nice and pretty for ya whenever you're done.

-3-opponent_stripping,target:jura,targetStage:2=confused.png,...but it sure helps you out here. How much you wearin', anyhow?
-3-opponent_stripping,target:kamina,targetStage:0=smug.png,Whaddaya say 'bout a hug, darlin'? I don't bite.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:kamina,targetStage:1=interested.png,Oh, and here I thought it couldn't get no better.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:larachel,targetStage:0=smug.png,<i>Talk</i> about impractical; them nice shiny boots'd be 'bout pretty as a pig once they're covered in mud.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:larachel,targetStage:1=shocked.png,Wait now, don't do nothin' hasty!
-3-opponent_stripping,target:larachel,targetStage:2=interested.png,<i>Ooh...</i> I like them boots. Wouldn't stay so pretty steppin' through mud, though.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:larachel,targetStage:3=sad.png,Doin' alright, there, princess? You seem awful antsy.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:lucina,targetStage:0=interested.png,Hang on a sec'...

-3-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:2=calm.png,I guess y'ain't so bad. When you're not dressin' up for Halloween.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:mavis,targetStage:0=embarrassed.png,Wait... them teeth... I know I've seen this before! I ain't your dinner!
-3-opponent_stripping,target:meia,targetStage:0=happy.png,Sure does make you look nice!

-3-opponent_stripping,target:nagisa,targetStage:1=smug.png,I oughtta warn you now: I ain't gonna settle for halfway done.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:natsuki,targetStage:0=mad.png,No I don't make it a pettin' zoo wherever I go!
-3-opponent_stripping,target:natsuki,targetStage:0,saidMarker:rules=sad.png,Ain't right, I tell ya. Startin' a game like this when we ain't even sure what's goin' on.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:natsuki,targetStage:1=calm.png,You 'n ~player~ can get outta here whever ya want. I won't mind none.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=embarrassed.png,Shoot!
-3-opponent_stripping,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=happy.png,What cute shoes!
-3-opponent_stripping,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:1=interested.png,Gotta say, Nugi, I ain't too sure what you... are.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:palutena,targetStage:0=happy.png,It's absolutely glowing!
-3-opponent_stripping,target:palutena,targetStage:1=calm.png,But that don't matter none. Angel or not, I still think you're fine.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:0=confused.png,You're on a race to the bottom, ain't ya? Startin' with your top?
-3-opponent_stripping,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:1=happy.png,I shoulda known! I bet Pinkie's the one what's playin' this right.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:2=confused.png,Wait... you're actually kickin' off them shoes? I don't...
-3-opponent_stripping,target:pit,targetStage:0=interested.png,Oh, I get it! You're like an angel or somethin'!
-3-opponent_stripping,target:pit,targetStage:1=confused.png,I ain't too sure why you're here... doin'... <i>this</i>...
-3-opponent_stripping,target:pit,targetStage:2=sad.png,I don't ever know what kinda trouble Peggy's tryin' to get me into, or why them wolves're always so nasty... I know you angels probably see all that stuff...
-3-opponent_stripping,target:pit,targetStage:3=happy.png,Oh, I just got the best idea! Once we're done here!
-3-opponent_stripping,target:revy,targetStage:0=sad.png,Y'all still havin' fun? The game ain't no fun with sore losers.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:revy,targetStage:1=mad.png,I ain't scared by no guns; Droopy can shoot with the best of 'em.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:revy,targetStage:2=confident.png,You ain't too used to seein' sheep, are ya?
-3-opponent_stripping,target:revy,targetStage:2,targetSaying:eating,marker:Revyeating=embarrassed.png,N-no! I ain't for dinner, y'hear! Don't talk like that!
-3-opponent_stripping,target:revy,targetStage:3=interested.png,Hang on, now; <i>guns</i> count as clothin'?
-3-opponent_stripping,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=calm.png,Nothin' too big for yer first loss, but...
-3-opponent_stripping,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=sad.png,Aww, now that's no fun!
-3-opponent_stripping,target:ryuji,targetStage:0=smug.png,What brings y'all here... Ryuji, ya say?
-3-opponent_stripping,target:ryuji,targetStage:1=smug.png,I ain't sayin' I hope you lose, sugar...
-3-opponent_stripping,target:ryuji,targetStage:2=sad.png,Aww, now is that really all? You gonna make me beg?
-3-opponent_stripping,target:saki,targetStage:0=interested.png,I like <i>your</i> uniform. Where you from?
-3-opponent_stripping,target:saki_zls,targetStage:0=happy.png,I bet you can win this!
-3-opponent_stripping,target:sakura,targetStage:2=interested.png,What? What's goin' on?
-3-opponent_stripping,target:sakura,targetStage:3=shocked.png,<i>Ah!</i> How'd you do that? That ain't natural!
-3-opponent_stripping,target:syrenne,targetStage:0=interested.png,Why're you goin' right for your top?
-3-opponent_stripping,target:twilight,targetStage:0,targetSaying:"panties"=smug.png,I <i>know!</i> They just look so miserable... finally, <i>someone</i> gets it!
-3-opponent_stripping,target:twilight,targetStage:1=shocked.png,Wait now, I don't know if...
-3-opponent_stripping,target:weiss,targetStage:0=shocked.png,<i>Ooh, it's shiny...</i>
-3-opponent_stripping,target:weiss,targetStage:1=confused.png,That get-up looks mighty chilly, miss Weiss.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=confused.png,Seein' boots like that sure makes me wish I <i>could</i> wear shoes.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1=confused.png,Hang on, now... that didn't take long <i>at all!</i>
-3-opponent_stripping,target:zone-tan,targetStage:2=interested.png,Oh! Well ain't this a surprise?
-3-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:1,count-pit:0=shocked.png,Matter of fact... you're <i>all</i> glowy! You some kinda angel?
-3-opponent_stripped,target:aimee,targetStage:1-5=mad.png,What in the world's gotten into you?!
-3-opponent_stripped,target:aimee,targetStage:1-5=mad.png,I oughtta... why, if Barbra were here, you'd get it right proper!
-3-opponent_stripped,target:aimee,targetStage:1-5=embarrassed.png,Don't do that again!
-3-opponent_stripped,target:aimee,targetStage:1-5=mad.png,You're lucky I didn't have to pee!
-3-opponent_stripped,target:akko,targetStage:1=embarrassed.png,I'm in <i>way</i> over my head here...
-3-opponent_stripped,target:amalia,targetStage:1=boisterous.png,Sure is creative, I'll say that!
-3-opponent_stripped,target:amalia,targetStage:5,marker:Amaliaflowers=interested.png,Oh? What's goin' on?
-3-opponent_stripped,target:calisto,targetStage:1=smug.png,I guess most ain't blessed with hooves, now are they?
-3-opponent_stripped,target:catria,targetStage:1=boisterous.png,But don't let me stop you from droppin' a sword!
-3-opponent_stripped,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=calm.png,Maybe we can see after the game.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=confident.png,Ain't like I really gotta; Droopy's got a <i>keen</i> eye.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:1=smug.png,Oh, yeah; never mind. Awful loud hat, ain't it?
-3-opponent_stripped,target:emi,targetStage:1=calm.png,What's a little thing like you even doin' in a place like this, anyhow?
-3-opponent_stripped,target:emi,targetStage:4=calm.png,Must be you just know somethin' I don't.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:emi,targetStage:5=sad.png,Golly, I don't get this game <i>none</i>, do I?
-3-opponent_stripped,target:estelle,targetStage:1=happy.png,That don't mean a lamb can't feel pretty every now and again!
-3-opponent_stripped,target:florina,targetStage:1=calm.png,I guess if what you want's to come outta your shell, this'll do the trick.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:hanako,targetStage:1=confident.png,Ain't like it makes you any worse at the game, now is it?
-3-opponent_stripped,target:hanako,targetStage:2=happy.png,You're a real cutie, y'hear?
-3-opponent_stripped,target:haru,targetStage:1=calm.png,Barbra's like a big sister. Tall, grows wool even faster'n I do. Everyone seems afraid of her for some reason.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:haru,targetStage:2=happy.png,Huggin' ain't against no rules, right? I still ain't too used to most'a y'all's games.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:hk416,targetStage:1=calm.png,Well, as long as I ain't in yer sights, I don't got no problems with that.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:jura,targetStage:1=embarrassed.png,I ain't sayin' I <i>want</i> you to keep that sword at yer side...
-3-opponent_stripped,target:jura,targetStage:2=happy.png,You should meet her! She'd love you, I just <i>know</i> it!
-3-opponent_stripped,target:jura,targetStage:3=calm.png,Maybe next time I oughtta come to you for tips; you sure seem to know more than Peggy ever did.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:kamina,targetStage:1=confident.png,Doesn't do much good to stall with little things when the goods're already out there.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:kamina,targetStage:2=horny.png,Why not come a little closer'n see how soft this wool <i>really</i> is?
-3-opponent_stripped,target:larachel,targetStage:1=calm.png,I'm sure it'll be waitin' nice and pretty for ya whenever you're done.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:larachel,targetStage:1=confident.png,If you need somethin' to stroke, this wool's just as soft as it looks.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:larachel,targetStage:1,targetSaying:get along well with it=interested.png,Like, a horse? Well, sure, I wouldn't mind meetin' 'em. Bet they got somethin' interestin' to say about you.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:larachel,targetStage:2,marker:nickname*=princess=smug.png,Oh, I see <i>plenty.</i> Let's see another round, <i>princess.</i>
-3-opponent_stripped,target:larachel,targetStage:3=smug.png,Whenever you're ready, <i>your highness.</i>
-3-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:1=confused.png,You're a woman? Dog<i>gone</i> ya had me fooled!
-3-opponent_stripped,target:mae,targetStage:1=smug.png,Glad <i>someone's</i> bein' sensible 'bout their footwear.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:1=calm.png,Even if ya <i>do</i> talk like you've gone bonkers.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:2=boisterous.png,Ya <i>are</i> a normal gal! Oh, I knew it all along. Sheep got an eye for this kinda thing, y'know.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:3=sad.png,Oh, wait... is it Halloween? Did I miss it?
-3-opponent_stripped,target:mavis,targetStage:1=sad.png,Right? You wouldn't hurt an innocent li'l lamb, now would ya?
-3-opponent_stripped,target:meia,targetStage:1=smug.png,Even if it <i>does</i> look mighty chilly. You alright for winter in that?
-3-opponent_stripped,target:meia,targetStage:1=mad.png,If you try to take <i>me</i>, Droopy'll hound you till you quit! I mean it!
-3-opponent_stripped,target:meia,targetStage:1=sad.png,You wouldn't kidnap a poor, helpless li'l lamb, now would you?
-3-opponent_stripped,target:meia,targetStage:3=interested.png,And darlin', your search is gonna be a short one, let me tell ya!
-3-opponent_stripped,target:misato,targetStage:1=mad.png,Hey, my head's clean! Ain't no sheep on the farm with cleaner wool!
-3-opponent_stripped,target:misato,targetStage:2=smug.png,Might be easier to win if ya weren't drinkin' somethin' so foul.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:nagisa,targetStage:1=confident.png,Well shoot. C'mon, then, show us what you've got!
-3-opponent_stripped,target:nagisa,targetStage:2=confident.png,You got the heart to see this through, and I'm fittin' to make sure you do!
-3-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:1=embarrassed.png,I... I ain't sayin' I <i>don't</i> want no pets, but...
-3-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:1=smug.png,Unless there might be... <i>somethin'</i> keepin ya here...
-3-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,saidMarker:rules=boisterous.png,Now we know, let's kick their butts!
-3-opponent_stripped,target:nayru,targetStage:5,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=confused.png,Y'all alright? Hello? Nayru?
-3-opponent_stripped,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:1=calm.png,Sometimes I sure wish they made shoes for sheep.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:2=calm.png,Well, human, sure; I seen them plenty. Just never seen no one like you 'round the farm.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:pit,notSaidMarker:angel,marker:angel=shocked.png,Wait a sec... you're glowy all over! Are you... are you <i>both</i> some kinda angel?
-3-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:2=happy.png,<i>Ooh</i>, why do I just wanna give you a hug so badly?
-3-opponent_stripped,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:1=interested.png,Oh, don't mind me none. You seem like you've done this before.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:2=smug.png,And it ain't so bad to watch, if ya don't mind my sayin'.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:3=sad.png,I just can't keep up, Pinkie. Is it better to strip quick or no?
-3-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:1=happy.png,I never thought I'd see the day! Anything you want, Mr. Angel, just gimme a holler!
-3-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:palutena,notSaidMarker:angel,marker:angel=shocked.png,But if he's an angel, then what's that make <i>you</i>?
-3-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:2=boisterous.png,But I'm rootin' for ya!
-3-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:3=happy.png,You think y'all can teach me some'a them things? I'll be a good li'l lamb, honest!
-3-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:4=smug.png,You should come back to the farm with me a minute! Oh, Barbra'd love to meet you! And we could teach Peggy a thing or two, I know it.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:4=happy.png,Oh Barbara would just have the darndest time with you, Mr. Angel!
-3-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:4=happy.png,Peggy would <i>love</i> you Mr. Angel! I oughtta introduce you!
-3-opponent_stripped,target:revy,targetStage:1=embarrassed.png,I didn't mean nothin' by it!
-3-opponent_stripped,target:revy,targetStage:2=embarrassed.png,I just ain't too used to... <i>you!</i>
-3-opponent_stripped,target:revy,targetStage:3=happy.png,That's just fine. I like you! You'll get used to it in no time!
-3-opponent_stripped,target:revy,targetStage:3,saidMarker:Revyeating=sad.png,That dang wolf always tries to eat us; I thought I'd be safe from that here.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:revy,targetStage:4=confused.png,Sometimes I feel like these rules're just made up as we're goin' along.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=horny.png,I dunno, there's just <i>somethin'</i> about some nice, strong hands...
-3-opponent_stripped,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=smug.png,Oh, it's fine, it's fine. Guess we'll just have to keep wearin' you down the ol' fashioned way!
-3-opponent_stripped,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=pun.png,Ya sure are makin' me <i>burn up</i>, Rinkah.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:ryuji,targetStage:1=happy.png,Oh, this is gonna be a <i>good</i> game!

-3-opponent_stripped,target:ryuji,targetStage:3=confused.png,Well I ain't gonna beg. I'll just have to hope you keep on losin'.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:saki,targetStage:1=calm.png,Cute li'l schoolgirls used to come by the farm every now and again; you remind me of 'em, is all.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:saki_zls,targetStage:1=boisterous.png,I'll be rootin' for ya!
-3-opponent_stripped,target:sakura,targetStage:3=confused.png,I don't... I ain't sure what you're talkin' about. I don't mind blue skin none though. Why hide that?
-3-opponent_stripped,target:sakura,targetStage:4=sad.png,You okay? How'd... how're you still on your feet? I mean I've seen chickens what could still stand for a bit, but...
-3-opponent_stripped,target:syrenne=confused.png,Don't you wanna save the good bits for last, hon'?
-3-opponent_stripped,target:twilight,targetStage:1=happy.png,Ahh! Oh, I didn't expect to find another animal here! What're you? A horse?
-3-opponent_stripped,target:twilight,targetStage:2=smug.png,You're awful eager to get outta them clothes, now. And I'm mighty glad I don't need to wear nothin' like that.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:weiss,targetStage:2=smug.png,Seems like it could use a bit of wool in it. Oh, don't worry none; doesn't hurt me to lose a bit.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1=calm.png,Hooves ain't too bad, but they're awful hard to doll up.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:zone-tan,targetStage:2=smug.png,Oh, I get it. Yeah, I bet Peggy'd like you.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:zone-tan,targetStage:3=smug.png,Y'all startin' to grow on me, too.
-3-opponent_stripped,filter:fancy,test:~clothing.type~:extra=smug.png,I think I've seen people 'round the farm wearin' stuff like that, but never so fancy!
-3-opponent_stripped,filter:fancy,test:~clothing.type~:extra=smug.png,Your ~clothing~ wouldn't last too long back on the farm.
-3-opponent_stripped,filter:fancy,test:~clothing.type~:extra=sad.png,I sure would like a closer look...
-3-opponent_stripped,target:mae,targetStage:2,test:~mae.position~:left=pun.png,Ain't no need to be a sourpuss.

-2-opponent_stripping,target:kamina,targetStage:0=smug.png,Whaddaya say 'bout a hug, darlin'? I don't bite.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:kamina,targetStage:1=interested.png,Oh, and here I thought it couldn't get no better.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:larachel,targetStage:0=smug.png,<i>Talk</i> about impractical; them nice shiny boots'd be 'bout pretty as a pig once they're covered in mud.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:larachel,targetStage:1=shocked.png,Wait now, don't do nothin' hasty!
-2-opponent_stripping,target:larachel,targetStage:2=interested.png,<i>Ooh...</i> I like them boots. Wouldn't stay so pretty steppin' through mud, though.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:larachel,targetStage:3=sad.png,Doin' alright, there, princess? You seem awful antsy.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:lucina,targetStage:0=interested.png,Hang on a sec'...

-2-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:2=calm.png,I guess y'ain't so bad. When you're not dressin' up for Halloween.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:mavis,targetStage:0=embarrassed.png,Wait... them teeth... I know I've seen this before! I ain't your dinner!

-2-opponent_stripping,target:nagisa,targetStage:1=smug.png,I oughtta warn you now: I ain't gonna settle for halfway done.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:natsuki,targetStage:0=mad.png,No I don't make it a pettin' zoo wherever I go!
-2-opponent_stripping,target:natsuki,targetStage:0,saidMarker:rules=sad.png,Ain't right, I tell ya. Startin' a game like this when we ain't even sure what's goin' on.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:natsuki,targetStage:1=calm.png,You 'n ~player~ can get outta here whever ya want. I won't mind none.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=embarrassed.png,Shoot!
-2-opponent_stripping,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=happy.png,What cute shoes!
-2-opponent_stripping,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:1=interested.png,Gotta say, Nugi, I ain't too sure what you... are.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:palutena,targetStage:0=happy.png,It's absolutely glowing!
-2-opponent_stripping,target:palutena,targetStage:1=calm.png,But that don't matter none. Angel or not, I still think you're fine.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:0=confused.png,You're on a race to the bottom, ain't ya? Startin' with your top?
-2-opponent_stripping,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:1=happy.png,I shoulda known! I bet Pinkie's the one what's playin' this right.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:2=confused.png,Wait... you're actually kickin' off them shoes? I don't...
-2-opponent_stripping,target:pit,targetStage:0=interested.png,Oh, I get it! You're like an angel or somethin'!
-2-opponent_stripping,target:pit,targetStage:1=confused.png,I ain't too sure why you're here... doin'... <i>this</i>...
-2-opponent_stripping,target:pit,targetStage:2=sad.png,I don't ever know what kinda trouble Peggy's tryin' to get me into, or why them wolves're always so nasty... I know you angels probably see all that stuff...
-2-opponent_stripping,target:pit,targetStage:3=happy.png,Oh, I just got the best idea! Once we're done here!
-2-opponent_stripping,target:revy,targetStage:0=sad.png,Y'all still havin' fun? The game ain't no fun with sore losers.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:revy,targetStage:1=mad.png,I ain't scared by no guns; Droopy can shoot with the best of 'em.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:revy,targetStage:2=confident.png,You ain't too used to seein' sheep, are ya?
-2-opponent_stripping,target:revy,targetStage:2,targetSaying:eating,marker:Revyeating=embarrassed.png,N-no! I ain't for dinner, y'hear! Don't talk like that!
-2-opponent_stripping,target:revy,targetStage:3=interested.png,Hang on, now; <i>guns</i> count as clothin'?
-2-opponent_stripping,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=calm.png,Nothin' too big for yer first loss, but...
-2-opponent_stripping,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=sad.png,Aww, now that's no fun!
-2-opponent_stripping,target:ryuji,targetStage:0=smug.png,What brings y'all here... Ryuji, ya say?
-2-opponent_stripping,target:ryuji,targetStage:1=smug.png,I ain't sayin' I hope you lose, sugar...
-2-opponent_stripping,target:ryuji,targetStage:2=sad.png,Aww, now is that really all? You gonna make me beg?
-2-opponent_stripping,target:saki,targetStage:0=interested.png,I like <i>your</i> uniform. Where you from?
-2-opponent_stripping,target:saki_zls,targetStage:0=happy.png,I bet you can win this!
-2-opponent_stripping,target:sakura,targetStage:2=interested.png,What? What's goin' on?
-2-opponent_stripping,target:sakura,targetStage:3=shocked.png,<i>Ah!</i> How'd you do that? That ain't natural!

-2-opponent_stripping,target:twilight,targetStage:0,targetSaying:"panties"=smug.png,I <i>know!</i> They just look so miserable... finally, <i>someone</i> gets it!
-2-opponent_stripping,target:twilight,targetStage:1=shocked.png,Wait now, I don't know if...
-2-opponent_stripping,target:weiss,targetStage:0=shocked.png,<i>Ooh, it's shiny...</i>
-2-opponent_stripping,target:weiss,targetStage:1=confused.png,That get-up looks mighty chilly, miss Weiss.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=confused.png,Seein' boots like that sure makes me wish I <i>could</i> wear shoes.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1=confused.png,Hang on, now... that didn't take long <i>at all!</i>
-2-opponent_stripping,target:zone-tan,targetStage:2=interested.png,Oh! Well ain't this a surprise?
-2-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:1,count-pit:0=shocked.png,Matter of fact... you're <i>all</i> glowy! You some kinda angel?
-2-opponent_stripped,target:aimee,targetStage:1-5=mad.png,What in the world's gotten into you?!
-2-opponent_stripped,target:aimee,targetStage:1-5=mad.png,I oughtta... why, if Barbra were here, you'd get it right proper!
-2-opponent_stripped,target:aimee,targetStage:1-5=embarrassed.png,Don't do that again!
-2-opponent_stripped,target:aimee,targetStage:1-5=mad.png,You're lucky I didn't have to pee!
-2-opponent_stripped,target:akko,targetStage:1=embarrassed.png,I'm in <i>way</i> over my head here...
-2-opponent_stripped,target:amalia,targetStage:1=boisterous.png,Sure is creative, I'll say that!
-2-opponent_stripped,target:amalia,targetStage:5,marker:Amaliaflowers=interested.png,Oh? What's goin' on?
-2-opponent_stripped,target:calisto,targetStage:1=smug.png,I guess most ain't blessed with hooves, now are they?
-2-opponent_stripped,target:catria,targetStage:1=boisterous.png,But don't let me stop you from droppin' a sword!
-2-opponent_stripped,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=calm.png,Maybe we can see after the game.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=confident.png,Ain't like I really gotta; Droopy's got a <i>keen</i> eye.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:1=smug.png,Oh, yeah; never mind. Awful loud hat, ain't it?
-2-opponent_stripped,target:emi,targetStage:1=calm.png,What's a little thing like you even doin' in a place like this, anyhow?
-2-opponent_stripped,target:emi,targetStage:4=calm.png,Must be you just know somethin' I don't.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:emi,targetStage:5=sad.png,Golly, I don't get this game <i>none</i>, do I?
-2-opponent_stripped,target:estelle,targetStage:1=happy.png,That don't mean a lamb can't feel pretty every now and again!
-2-opponent_stripped,target:florina,targetStage:1=calm.png,I guess if what you want's to come outta your shell, this'll do the trick.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:hanako,targetStage:1=confident.png,Ain't like it makes you any worse at the game, now is it?
-2-opponent_stripped,target:hanako,targetStage:2=happy.png,You're a real cutie, y'hear?
-2-opponent_stripped,target:haru,targetStage:1=calm.png,Barbra's like a big sister. Tall, grows wool even faster'n I do. Everyone seems afraid of her for some reason.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:haru,targetStage:2=happy.png,Huggin' ain't against no rules, right? I still ain't too used to most'a y'all's games.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:hk416,targetStage:1=calm.png,Well, as long as I ain't in yer sights, I don't got no problems with that.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:jura,targetStage:1=embarrassed.png,I ain't sayin' I <i>want</i> you to keep that sword at yer side...
-2-opponent_stripped,target:jura,targetStage:2=happy.png,You should meet her! She'd love you, I just <i>know</i> it!
-2-opponent_stripped,target:jura,targetStage:3=calm.png,Maybe next time I oughtta come to you for tips; you sure seem to know more than Peggy ever did.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:kamina,targetStage:1=confident.png,Doesn't do much good to stall with little things when the goods're already out there.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:larachel,targetStage:1=calm.png,I'm sure it'll be waitin' nice and pretty for ya whenever you're done.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:larachel,targetStage:1=confident.png,If you need somethin' to stroke, this wool's just as soft as it looks.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:larachel,targetStage:1,targetSaying:get along well with it=interested.png,Like, a horse? Well, sure, I wouldn't mind meetin' 'em. Bet they got somethin' interestin' to say about you.

-2-opponent_stripped,target:larachel,targetStage:3=smug.png,Whenever you're ready, <i>your highness.</i>
-2-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:1=confused.png,You're a woman? Dog<i>gone</i> ya had me fooled!
-2-opponent_stripped,target:mae,targetStage:1=smug.png,Glad <i>someone's</i> bein' sensible 'bout their footwear.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:1=calm.png,Even if ya <i>do</i> talk like you've gone bonkers.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:2=boisterous.png,Ya <i>are</i> a normal gal! Oh, I knew it all along. Sheep got an eye for this kinda thing, y'know.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:3=sad.png,Oh, wait... is it Halloween? Did I miss it?
-2-opponent_stripped,target:mavis,targetStage:1=sad.png,Right? You wouldn't hurt an innocent li'l lamb, now would ya?
-2-opponent_stripped,target:meia,targetStage:1=smug.png,Even if it <i>does</i> look mighty chilly. You alright for winter in that?
-2-opponent_stripped,target:meia,targetStage:1=mad.png,If you try to take <i>me</i>, Droopy'll hound you till you quit! I mean it!
-2-opponent_stripped,target:meia,targetStage:1=sad.png,You wouldn't kidnap a poor, helpless li'l lamb, now would you?
-2-opponent_stripped,target:meia,targetStage:3=interested.png,And darlin', your search is gonna be a short one, let me tell ya!
-2-opponent_stripped,target:misato,targetStage:1=mad.png,Hey, my head's clean! Ain't no sheep on the farm with cleaner wool!
-2-opponent_stripped,target:misato,targetStage:2=smug.png,Might be easier to win if ya weren't drinkin' somethin' so foul.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:nagisa,targetStage:1=confident.png,Well shoot. C'mon, then, show us what you've got!
-2-opponent_stripped,target:nagisa,targetStage:2=confident.png,You got the heart to see this through, and I'm fittin' to make sure you do!
-2-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:1=embarrassed.png,I... I ain't sayin' I <i>don't</i> want no pets, but...
-2-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:1=smug.png,Unless there might be... <i>somethin'</i> keepin ya here...
-2-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,saidMarker:rules=boisterous.png,Now we know, let's kick their butts!
-2-opponent_stripped,target:nayru,targetStage:5,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=confused.png,Y'all alright? Hello? Nayru?
-2-opponent_stripped,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:1=calm.png,Sometimes I sure wish they made shoes for sheep.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:2=calm.png,Well, human, sure; I seen them plenty. Just never seen no one like you 'round the farm.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:pit,notSaidMarker:angel,marker:angel=shocked.png,Wait a sec... you're glowy all over! Are you... are you <i>both</i> some kinda angel?

-2-opponent_stripped,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:1=interested.png,Oh, don't mind me none. You seem like you've done this before.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:2=smug.png,And it ain't so bad to watch, if ya don't mind my sayin'.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:3=sad.png,I just can't keep up, Pinkie. Is it better to strip quick or no?
-2-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:1=happy.png,I never thought I'd see the day! Anything you want, Mr. Angel, just gimme a holler!
-2-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:palutena,notSaidMarker:angel,marker:angel=shocked.png,But if he's an angel, then what's that make <i>you</i>?
-2-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:2=boisterous.png,But I'm rootin' for ya!
-2-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:3=happy.png,You think y'all can teach me some'a them things? I'll be a good li'l lamb, honest!
-2-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:4=smug.png,You should come back to the farm with me a minute! Oh, Barbra'd love to meet you! And we could teach Peggy a thing or two, I know it.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:4=happy.png,Oh Barbara would just have the darndest time with you, Mr. Angel!
-2-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:4=happy.png,Peggy would <i>love</i> you Mr. Angel! I oughtta introduce you!
-2-opponent_stripped,target:revy,targetStage:1=embarrassed.png,I didn't mean nothin' by it!

#OPPONENT MASTURBATING
#When an opponent is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must pay the penalty by masturbating in front of everyone.
#The "must_masturbate" line is for just before it happens, and the "start_masturbating" line immediately follows.
#The "masturbating" line will be spoken a little after the opponent has started but before they climax.
#When the opponent climaxes, your character will say the "finished_masturbating" line.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

#SELF MASTURBATING
#If your character is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must masturbate.
#These lines only come up in the relevant stages, so you don't need to include the stage numbers here. Just remember which stage is which when you make the images. The "starting" image is still in the naked stage.
#The "finished_masturbating" line will repeat many times if the game is not yet finished. This plays as opponents comment on the how good their hands are.

Dota 2 is played in matches between two teams of five players, with each team occupying and defending their own separate base on the map. Each of the ten players independently controls a powerful character, known as a "hero", who all have unique abilities and differing styles of play. During a match players collect experience points and items for their heroes to successfully defeat the opposing team's heroes in player versus player combat. A team wins by being the first to destroy the other team's "Ancient", a large structure located within their base.{!reset}</state>

                <state img="#-snooty.png">Some women report achieving an orgasm from nipple stimulation, but this is rare. Research suggests that the orgasms are genital orgasms, and may also be directly linked to "the genital area of the brain."</state>
                <state img="#-educate.png">It seems that sensation from the nipples travels to the same part of the brain as sensations from the vagina, clitoris and cervix.</state>
                <state img="#-neutral.png">Nipple stimulation may trigger uterine contractions, which then produce a sensation in the genital area of the brain.</state>
                <state img="#-hornyfact.png">Fingering is typically the use of fingers or hands to sexually stimulate the vulva (including the clitoris) or vagina.</state>
                <state img="#-casual.png">Vaginal fingering is legally and medically called digital penetration or digital penetration of the vagina.</state>
                <state img="#-smirk.png">Fingering may also include the use of fingers to sexually stimulate the anus.</state>
                <state img="#-snooty.png">Parts of the vulva, especially the clitoris, are erogenous zones. Massage of the vulva, and in particular the clitoris, is the most common way for a woman to achieve an orgasm.</state>
                <state img="#-hornyfact.png">Studies indicate that 70-80% of women require direct clitoral stimulation to achieve orgasm.</state>
                <state img="#-smirk.png">You should massage the clitoral glans or shaft, usually through the skin of the clitoral hood, using up-and-down, side-to-side, or circular motions. Trust me, I read Wikipedia.</state>
                <state img="#-hornyfact.png">While the vagina is not especially sensitive as a whole, its lower third (the area close to the entrance) has concentrations of the nerve endings that can provide pleasurable sensations when stimulated during sexual activity.</state>
                <state img="#-neutral.png">{small}Fingering the vagina is often performed in an effort to stimulate the G-spot. The G-spot is reportedly located roughly 5 cm (2.0 in) up on the anterior wall of the vagina, forwards toward the navel. It is described as being recognized by its ridges and slightly rougher texture compared to the more cushion-like vaginal cavity walls around it. Fingering this spot, and in effect possibly stimulating the Skene's gland, is commonly cited as a method that may lead to female ejaculation.{!reset}</state>
                <state img="#-nervous.png">{small}Anal fingering may be pleasurable because of the large number of nerve endings in the anal area, and because of the added stimulation gained from stretching the anal sphincter muscles while inserting the finger.&lt;br&gt;However, a good quality personal lubricant is advisable to both increase the pleasurable sensation and aid insertion.{!reset}</state>
                <state img="#-nervous.png">When pleasuring the anus, some people prefer to simply stimulate the outer ring, while others will follow this by inserting one or more fingers.</state>
                <state img="#-scold.png">Fingering is generally considered safe sex as long as there are no open wounds on the fingers. The nails should be trimmed and filed; long, sharp or jagged nails can cause cuts, injury, or severe infection.</state>

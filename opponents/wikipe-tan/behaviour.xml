                <state img="#-hornyfact.png">Parts of the vulva, especially the clitoris, are erogenous zones. Massage of the vulva, and in particular the clitoris, is the most common way for a woman to achieve an orgasm.</state>

                <state img="#-hornyfact.png">{small}While the vagina is not especially sensitive as a whole, its lower third (the area close to the entrance) has concentrations of the nerve endings that can provide pleasurable sensations when stimulated during sexual activity.{!reset}</state>
                <state img="#-neutral.png">{small}Fingering the vagina is often performed in an effort to stimulate the G-spot. The G-spot is reportedly located roughly 5 cm (2.0 in) up on the anterior wall of the vagina, forwards toward the navel. It is described as being recognized by its ridges and slightly rougher texture compared to the more cushion-like vaginal cavity walls around it. Fingering this spot, and in effect possibly stimulating the Skene's gland, is commonly cited as a method that may lead to female ejaculation.{!reset}</state>
                <state img="#-nervous.png">{small}Anal fingering may be pleasurable because of the large number of nerve endings in the anal area, and because of the added stimulation gained from stretching the anal sphincter muscles while inserting the finger.&lt;br&gt;However, a good quality personal lubricant is advisable to both increase the pleasurable sensation and aid insertion.{!reset}</state>
                <state img="#-nervous.png">When pleasuring the anus, some people prefer to simply stimulate the outer ring, while others will follow this by inserting one or more fingers.</state>
                <state img="#-scold.png">Fingering is generally considered safe sex as long as there are no open wounds on the fingers. The nails should be trimmed and filed; long, sharp or jagged nails can cause cuts, injury, or severe infection.</state>

        <title>G&amp;K Business Card</title>
        <subtitle>GRIFFIN AND KRYUGER  PRIVATE MILITARY CONTRACTOR</subtitle>
        <text>A business card with a fierce-looking war veteran on the front. Emblazened at the top is a rough, futuristic looking emblem and the company's name in a equally fancy font. After the game finished, PA-15 slid this into your palm, saying to "make a request for Florence" next time you want to invite her to one of these games.

You might do just that.</text>

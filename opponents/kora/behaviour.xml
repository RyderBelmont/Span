Cuz, uh, when we went to see the guy, there was another guy, and he was like "Hey! Do this other job!", so, we did, but when we got back, he was like, "It's free, right?", and we were like, "Nah-uh.", and he was all, "Aw man!". So he gave us the money, which to be honest, I wasn't even sure he was gonna do since he made such a big fuss about it, but we were attacked by, like, a lot of beasts! And I mean a LOT of beasts. Too many beasts! Us Blades can handle ourselves, but we're still a heck of a lot weaker without our Drivers. We managed to drive them off, but I think all the members of my group decided it was a bit too close. So yeah, that's the gist of it, though I'll always talk your ear off if ya want it! </state>

I don't think I've every seen her without it. So anyway, my makeup in there and I have to reach in there and get it while Sheba is worrying that I ruined her bath water. So I take off my glove and go in. I got it, but I saw her making a weird smirk when I was reaching.

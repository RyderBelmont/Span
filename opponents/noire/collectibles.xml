        <title>Noire plushie</title>
        <subtitle>Handmade by Plutia</subtitle>

(Plutia will happily present Noire with another one.)</text>
        <unlock>Tire Noire and then let her experience something so unexciting that she falls asleep.</unlock>

        <title>Noire's showdown lingerie</title>
        <subtitle>勝負下着</subtitle>
        <text>Noire's favorite lingerie, which she gave to you as a keepsake after she lost it in a game of strip poker.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

Maybe the next time you meet, Noire will wear a similar set of underwear, maybe a different one... and maybe none at all?</text>
        <unlock>Make Noire lose her lingerie and pose for you naked.</unlock>

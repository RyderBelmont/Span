        <title>Noire's showdown lingerie</title>
        <subtitle>ノワールの勝負下着</subtitle>
        <text>Noire's favorite lingerie, which she gave to you as a keepsake after she lost it in a game of strip poker. 

Maybe the next time you meet, Noire will wear a similar set of underwear, maybe a different one... and maybe none at all? &lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;(It is a secret memento of your time spent with a pure-hearted goddess. Do not think about wearing it.)</text>
        <unlock>Make Noire lose her lingerie and pose for you naked.</unlock>

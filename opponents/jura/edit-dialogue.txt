#Items of clothing should be listed here in order of removal.
#The values are formal name, lower case name, how much they cover, what they cover
#Please do not put spaces around the commas.
#"Important" clothes cover genitals (lower) or chest/breasts (upper). For example: bras, panties, a skirt when going commando.
#"Major" clothes cover underwear. For example: skirts, pants, shirts, dresses.
#"Minor" clothes cover skin or are large pieces of clothing that do not cover skin. For example: jackets, socks, stockings, gloves.
#"Extra" clothes are small items that may or may not be clothing but do not cover anything interesting. For example: jewelry, shoes or boots with socks underneath, belts, hats. In the rest of the code, "extra" clothes are called "accessory".
#If for some reason you write another word for the type of clothes (e.g. "accessory"), other characters will not react at all when the clothing is removed.
#What they cover = upper (upper body), lower (lower body), other (neither).
#The game can support any number of entries, but typically we use 2-8, with at least one "important" layer for upper and lower (each).

#Notes on dialogue
#All lines that start with a # symbol are comments and will be ignored by the tool that converts this file into a xml file for the game.
#Where more than one line has an identical type, like "swap_cards" and "swap_cards", the game will randomly select one of these lines each time the character is in that situation.
#You should try to include multiple lines for most stages, especially the final (finished) stage, -1. 

#A character goes through multiple stages as they undress. The stage number starts at zero and indicates how many layers they have removed. Special stage numbers are used when they are nude (-3), masturbating (-2), and finished (-1).
#Line types that start with a number will only display during that stage. The will override any numberless stage-generic lines. For example, in stage 4 "4-swap_cards" will be used over "swap_cards" if it is not blank here. Giving a character unique dialogue for each stage is an effective way of showing their changing openness/shyness as the game progresses.
#You can combine the above points and make multiple lines for a particular situation in a particular stage, like "4-swap_cards" and "4-swap_cards".

#Some special words can be used that will be substituted by the game for context-appropriate ones: ~name~ is the name of the character they're speaking to, but this only works if someone else is in focus. ~clothing~ is the type of clothing that is being removed by another player. ~Clothing~ is almost the same, but it starts with a capital letter in case you want to start a sentence with it.
#~name~ can be used any time a line targets an opponent (game_over_defeat, _must_strip, _removing_, _removed, _must_masturbate, etc).
#~clothing~ can be used only when clothing is being removed (_removing and _removed, but NOT _must_strip).
#~player~ can be used at any time and refers to the human player.
#~cards~ can be used only in the swap_cards lines.
#All wildcards can be used once per line only! If you use ~name~ twice, the code will show up the second time.

#Lines can be written that are only spoken when specific other characters are present. For a detailed explanation, read this guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/spnati/comments/6nhaj0/the_easy_way_to_write_targeted_lines/
#Here is an example line (note that targeted lines must have a stage number):
#0-female_must_strip,target:hermioine=happy,Looks like your magic doesn't help with poker!




#EXCHANGING CARDS
#This is what a character says while they're exchanging cards.
#The game will automatically put a display a number between 0-5 where you write ~cards~.
#These lines display on the screen for only a brief time, so it is important to make them short enough to read at a glance.

0-bad_hand,totalFemales:1-1,totalRounds:0-0=shocked,All men?  Yeesh...Meia and I should have stuck together.
0-bad_hand,totalFemales:1-1,totalRounds:0-0=frustrated,All men?  One would've been enough...I kind of wanted to see what Earth women's fashion looked like.
0-bad_hand,totalFemales:1-1,totalRounds:0-0=awkward,Uh...I only wanted <i>one</i> man around, really.  One tube is plenty.
0-bad_hand,totalFemales:1-1,totalRounds:0-0=interested,I'm the only girl, huh?  Well, Earth-men...you've never met a woman like a Mejarian.
0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:meia,totalRounds:0-0=teasing,Well, hi there.  Jura Basil Elden, home planet Mejare.  Sourpuss over there is my boss, Meia Gisborn.  Try not to let her ruin the fun.
0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:meia,totalRounds:0-0=seductive,Hello there!  I'm Jura, and the cutie in the bodysuit is Meia.  We're just your average Mejarian citizens--that is to say, pirates.
0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:meia,totalRounds:0-0=teasing,Hi there!  Jura Basil Elden.  Blue hair is Meia Gisborn--she's a little miserable, but she's really a sweetheart once you get to know her.
0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:meia,totalRounds:0-0=vain,Earthlings, I figure?  I'm Jura, and over there is Meia.  We're from Mejare, the planet of women--so don't think we can't handle ourselves!
0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:meia,totalRounds:0-0=teasing,Earthlings, are you?  Watch out--Meia and I are fighter pilots, and we've dealt with you hostile Earth types.
0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:meia,totalRounds:0-0=laughing,Hi there!  I'm Jura, and bundle-of-sunshine over there is Meia.  Watch yourself--she's my boss, and she's no pushover!
0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:meia,totalRounds:0-0=teasing,Hi there!  Jura Basil Elden.  That blue-haired bombshell is Meia, my squadron leader--<i>I kind of dragged her here, so be nice</i>.
0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:meia,totalMales:1-1,totalRounds:0-0,priority:110=laughing,Well, well, well!  Look at that, Meia, a gender ratio we're used to.  Let's see what this lone man has in store for us, shall we?

0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:meia,totalMales:1-1,totalRounds:0-0,priority:110=interested,A lone man representing his sex?  Makes me wonder how our prisoners would do the same, right, Meia?
0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:meia,totalMales:1-1,totalRounds:0-0,priority:110=seductive,Ooh, a single man playing.  What do you think, Meia?  This guy look like his seed is any good?
0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:meia,totalMales:1-1,totalRounds:0-0,priority:110=vain,Just one man?  Watch out--Meia and I aren't your average women.  Hell, we're not your average <i>Mejarians</i>, either.
0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:meia,totalMales:1-1,totalRounds:0-0,priority:110=teasing,Just one man?  Hey, Meia, what do you think his tube looks like?  Should be easy enough to find out.
0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:meia,totalMales:1-1,totalRounds:0-0,priority:110=vain,Now <i>this</i> is why we came here--to see a man naked.  Mejare is all women, you know.
0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:meia,totalMales:1-1,totalRounds:0-0,priority:110=seductive,Hi there, handsome!  I'm Jura, and this is Meia--and we've <i>never</i> seen a man nude.  So you'll give us a good show, right?
0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:meia,totalMales:1-1,totalRounds:0-0,priority:110=smug,Let's hope this one Earth man is more accommodating than the Tarakkians we know, eh, Meia?
0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:meia,totalMales:0-0,totalRounds:0-0=annoyed,Ugh!  <i>No men anywhere</i>?  What a waste.  Sorry for dragging you here, Meia.
0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:meia,totalMales:0-0,totalRounds:0-0=bored,...I mean, I'd love to learn about Earth fashion, but really?  <i>All women</i>?  Meia and I are well aware of what nude women look like, thanks.
0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:meia,totalMales:0-0,totalRounds:0-0=angry,Oh, come on, they don't sex-segregate these games, do they?  I dragged Meia here specifically so we could see men naked!
0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:meia,totalMales:0-0,totalRounds:0-0=frustrated,...Yeah, Meia and I are Mejarians, OK?  <i>We're familiar with women</i>.  Bring out some men!
0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:meia,totalMales:0-0,totalRounds:0-0=annoyed,All women?  Well, tonight's a bust.  We might as well have just showered together, Meia.
0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:meia,totalMales:0-0,totalRounds:0-0=annoyed,Oh, look, Meia, a group of women.  How bizarre and outlandish and worth coming to Earth for.
0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:meia,totalFemales:2-2,totalRounds:0-0=confused,Hi there! I'm Jura, and...I really thought there'd be Earth women here.  Oh well, more male nudity for us, right, Meia?
0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:meia,totalFemales:2-2,totalRounds:0-0=teasing,No Earth women at all?  Yeesh.  Well, we can handle these boys, can't we, Meia?  Mejarians don't fear some silly men.
0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:meia,totalFemales:2-2,totalRounds:0-0=seductive,Jeez, all men besides us two.  Kinda glad you're here with me, Meia.
0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:meia,totalFemales:2-2,totalRounds:0-0=confused,Hm.  I was really hoping for maybe one man, with some Earth women around to learn about fashion.  What do you think, Meia?  I know you're not big on fashion...or fun.
0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0-5,totalAlive:2-2,notSaidMarker:1v1,marker:1v1=start,<i>Well, well, well</i>.  Looks like this game is for Mejarians only, eh, Leader?

#lost dress
5-good_hand=smug,We have a winner, girls.  And her name is Jura.
5-good_hand=smug,What a hand.  And it was basically dumb luck, too.
5-good_hand=vain,The cards are just falling into my lap at this point.  My beautiful, smooth, gorgeous lap.
5-good_hand=stretching,I wonder what piloting metaphor Meia would have for this, because it's great.
5-good_hand,timeInStage:4-4,marker:butt=butt,You poor things...you just can't seem to get me out of my thong, can you?  Here, have another peek at my butt.
5-good_hand,timeInStage:4-4,marker:butt=butt,Would you poor souls like another glance at my rear?  It's hard to be ashamed when I've still got this thong on.
5-good_hand,timeInStage:4-4,marker:butt=butt,I really thought you'd get me out of this thong quickly.  Was that peek at my butt enough to satisfy you earlier?
5-good_hand,timeInStage:4-4,marker:butt=butt,My last line of defense is holding up rather nicely, it seems.  Must I remind you of your prize for getting me out of it?
5-good_hand,timeInStage:4-4,marker:butt=butt,Tiny as my thong is, I feel quite comfortable in it.  Enough to turn my back on you once again, even.
5-good_hand,timeInStage:4-4,marker:butt=butt,I feel as if Barnette doesn't appreciate my backside like she does my chest.  Perhaps I should <i>force</i> her to.
5-good_hand,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0-5,totalAlive:2-2,notSaidMarker:1v1,marker:1v1=seductive-2,<i>Well, well, well</i>.  Just you and me, Meia...and I'd need a lot more than my thong to feel confident against you.
5-good_hand,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0-5,totalAlive:2-2,notSaidMarker:1v1,marker:1v1=seductive-2,Something tells me this tiny little thong of mine won't be enough to stave off the fearsome Meia Gisborn...but I'll try.
5-good_hand,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0-5,totalAlive:2-2,notSaidMarker:1v1,marker:1v1=seductive-2,A showdown with my very own Leader?  Could I maybe get a few layers back, then?  Meia's got a bit of killer instinct...
5-good_hand,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0-5,totalAlive:2-2,notSaidMarker:1v1,marker:1v1=seductive-2,Oh, dear.  Once Meia sets her eyes on a target, she never lets up until it's destroyed...and she's got her eyes on <i>me</i> now.
5-good_hand,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0-5,totalAlive:2-2,notSaidMarker:1v1,marker:1v1=seductive-2,Oh, dear...a little one-on-one time with you, Meia, when I'm stuck like <i>this</i>?  At least my breasts are bigger.
5-good_hand,alsoPlaying:jin,alsoPlayingStage:0-7,timeInStage:1-1=butt,<i>Hoping to steal a glance at my rear</i>?  ...Why, thank you, Jin!  I was hoping for a perfect 10, though.
5-good_hand,alsoPlaying:jin,alsoPlayingStage:0-7,timeInStage:1-1=butt,<i>Perhaps my rear is more stimulating for you kind souls</i>.  ...Oh, is that all, Jin?  Maybe I should do squats like Meia says.
5-good_hand,alsoPlaying:jin,alsoPlayingStage:0-7,timeInStage:1-1=butt,<i>I don't mind showing off my butt, too...my lovely hair covers most of it</i>.  ...Ohhh, thank you, Jin!  Good to know men appreciate such things.
5-good_hand,alsoPlaying:jin,alsoPlayingStage:0-7,timeInStage:1-1=butt,<i>Here, see what you think of my beautiful backside, too</i>...hey, what'd I get points off for, Jin?  Because you can't see it all?
5-good_hand,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:0-8,timeInStage:1-1,marker:butt=butt,Behold, my lovely half-obscured backside!  ...Why would I be uncomfortable, Elizabeth?  I'm <i>beautiful</i>!
5-good_hand,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:0-8,timeInStage:1-1,marker:butt=butt,Isn't my rear <i>equally</i> spectacular?  ...I don't see why I'd be embarrassed, Elizabeth.  My body is gorgeous!
5-good_hand,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:0-8,timeInStage:1-1,marker:butt=butt,I think you've all earned a peek at my butt for your hard work stripping me...come now, Elizabeth, you're cute too!
5-good_hand,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:0-8,timeInStage:1-1,marker:butt=butt,<i>Oh yes, you haven't seen my adorable rear yet</i>!  Here you are...oh, Elizabeth, don't be shy!  I'm sure yours is cute!
5-good_hand,timeInStage:1-1,marker:butt=butt,<i>Oh, were you hoping to steal a glance at my rear</i>?  Sorry, but you'll have to learn to appreciate my hair first.
5-good_hand,timeInStage:1-1,marker:butt=butt,My breasts hog all the attention.  Such a shame my butt doesn't get the love it deserves.
5-good_hand,timeInStage:1-1,marker:butt=butt,Isn't my hair the perfect length?  It covers <i>juuuuust</i> enough of my rear to still be enticing.
5-good_hand,timeInStage:1-1,marker:butt=butt,Now, now, don't stare at my beautiful breasts all evening.  My backside is just as shapely.
5-good_hand,timeInStage:1-1,marker:butt=butt,I'm not shy about my body, if you haven't noticed.  Feel free to tell me how gorgeous my backside is, too.
5-good_hand,timeInStage:1-1,marker:butt=butt,Isn't my rear <i>equally</i> perfect?  Especially when I stand on tiptoe and...<i>tighten</i> it.
5-good_hand,timeInStage:1-1,marker:butt=butt,Yet another advantage of my long golden hair: protecting my shapely rear from the hungry eyes of the masses.
5-good_hand,timeInStage:1-1,marker:butt=butt,My backside doesn't get nearly as much praise as my breasts.  It must be because my hair covers most of it.
5-good_hand,timeInStage:1-1,marker:butt=butt,You know why I wear my hair so long?  So women learn that there's more to my beauty than a firm butt.
5-good_hand,timeInStage:1-1,marker:butt=butt,Sorry, but anyone who wants a look at Jura Basil Elden's butt has to admire her hair beforehand.
5-good_hand,totalRounds:28-28=stretching,<i>Yawn</i>...oh, wow.  This game is really taking a while, isn't it?

5-good_hand,alsoPlaying:meia=seductive,This is great!  Any good piloting metaphors, Meia?  You've always got a few ready to go.
5-good_hand,alsoPlaying:d.va,alsoPlayingStage:0,totalRounds:5-5=laughing,Well, now!  I didn't know Earth girls could be so <i>licentious</i>.  Sure, why not?
5-good_hand,alsoPlaying:d.va,alsoPlayingStage:0,totalRounds:5-5=vain,I don't know, D.Va...I <i>do</i> have a girlfriend.  She might not be happy with the commands anyone gives me.

5-good_hand,alsoPlaying:joey,alsoPlayingStage:4,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=awkward,Oh, God, you're <i>eating</i> it.  I think all that makeup has soaked into your head and addled your brain, honey.
5-good_hand,alsoPlaying:joey,alsoPlayingStage:4,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=annoyed,...Yeah, I don't know how Earth does it, but on Mejare we use refrigerators to store food, not our vaginas.
5-good_hand,alsoPlaying:joey,alsoPlayingStage:4,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=awkward,...Is this part of being a clown?  Eating rotten old juice-soaked bananas?  Is this what gets men going?
5-good_hand,alsoPlaying:amalia,alsoPlayingStage:5,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=excited,Hey, what did you--did you just summon flowers?  Ooh, give <i>me</i> some!  I love flowers--they're so romantic!
5-good_hand,alsoPlaying:amalia,alsoPlayingStage:5,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=seductive,Hey, flowers aren't clothing--but they <i>are</i> beautiful, so I don't mind!  Got any for me?

5-okay_hand=vain,Sometimes I like to just wrap myself in my wonderful golden locks...and stay warm.
5-okay_hand=stretching,Feeling relaxed, feeling good.  This game is a blast!

5-bad_hand,timeInStage:4-4,marker:butt=butt,Would you poor souls like another glance at my rear?  It's hard to be ashamed when I've still got this thong on.
5-bad_hand,timeInStage:4-4,marker:butt=butt,I really thought you'd get me out of this thong quickly.  Was that peek at my butt enough to satisfy you earlier?

0-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=laughing,Right on target as usual, Meia.  But don't spoil the surprise for them!

0-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0,count-mahiru:1=vain,Ooh, let's do it, Meia!  That sounds like fun!  Here, get a good shot of my hips!  Don't worry about what the crew thinks!
0-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0,count-mahiru:1=seductive,I like you already, Mahiru!  ...Oh, come on, Meia, I won't show the crew!  Or at least, I won't let them make fun of you.
0-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0,count-mahiru:1=vain,Oh, stop bellyaching and take the picture, Meia!  We're not going to lose respect for you because you have a sexuality.
0-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0,count-mahiru:1=teasing,Oh, just do it, Meia.  I'll personally deal with anyone who makes fun of you for being here!
0-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=smug,Alright, alright...don't praise me <i>too</i> hard.  Can't have you falling in love or anything.
0-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=interested,Hey, cool it with the praise.  It's so unlike you...I want our relationship to keep the status quo.
0-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=vain,Just relax, would you?  At this rate, you and Barnette are going to be fighting over me!
0-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=laughing,Do I really deserve this kind of praise from winning a poker game?  Must be the afterglow talking.

0-must_strip_normal=thinking,Well, guess that's that.  What to strip?
0-must_strip_normal=seductive,Middle of the pack, looks like.  How <i>unfair</i> that we can all wear different amounts of clothing!
0-must_strip_normal=teasing,Don't get too excited.  There's more to my outfit than what you can see.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:pit=laughing,What's the matter, little boy?  <i>Am I not what you expected</i>?
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,Why, yes, I am...and a Mejarian one, at that.  But don't worry.  Mejarians don't eat the livers of <i>every</i> man they meet.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:pit=seductive,I <i>am</i> a space pirate, but there's nothing to be afraid of, honey.  I'm just here to learn about your lovely little blue planet, and maybe the men on it.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,I'm not just <i>any</i> space pirate, sweetheart.  I'm a Mejarian...and we're not afraid of little men like you.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:pit=vain,<i>Plasma</i>, huh?  Well, I'd say my beauty is just as warm...
0-must_strip_normal,hasHand:Two Pair=interested,<i>Ouch</i>.  <i>Two pair</i> lost?  This is gonna be a tough one...
0-must_strip_normal,hasHand:Two Pair=smug,I lost with <i>two pair</i>?  You're a tough crowd...luckily, I look just as good naked.
0-must_strip_normal,hasHand:Two Pair=annoyed,Oh, come on--<i>that</i> lost?  Ugh...
0-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:0-0=frustrated,Ugh.  What a bad start.
0-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:0-0=laughing,<i>Inexcusable.  Where's your focus?</i>  That's how Meia talks.
0-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:0-0=bored,Like boosting yourself straight into a minefield.
0-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:0-0=bored,Aw, really?  I wanted to have a little fun before starting the whole <i>stripping</i> thing.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:rinkah,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=seductive,Why, yes, I am!  Aren't <i>you</i> a clever one?
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:rinkah,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=vain,Well, it <i>is</i> just jutting out from my hip.  I could use some symmetry!
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:rinkah,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=thinking,Hmmm...that <i>does</i> sound like a good idea, actually.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:rinkah,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=smug,I'm not sure if it counts, Rinkah, but I'm certainly going to try.

0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=seductive,Think nothing of it, Leader.  <i>I just want to see you happy.</i>
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=stretching,You're giving me too much credit.  I just aim for pairs and hope for the best.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=vain,Aw, it's OK.  I'm sure the embarrassment of nudity just broke your poker face, that's all!
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=smug,Hey, I understand.  I'm a lot more comfortable in these naughty situations.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=interested,I guess this is the one way to earn your respect, isn't it?
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=smug,Some <i>praise</i>?  Thanks, Meia, but I'm just aiming for good hands.  It's not the kind of brainiac stuff Parfet gets up to.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=vain,What's this?  Have I finally received some praise from <i>the</i> Meia Gisborn?
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=vain,<i>This</i> is what you praise me over?  It's no big deal...but it's nice to be appreciated.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=stretching,Oh, you flatter me.  I'm just letting the cards take me wherever I please.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=interested,Hey, it's just luck.  Don't start falling for me or anything.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=interested,You put way too much stock in a totally luck-based game, Meia.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=smug,Show me a woman who can win consistently at this and I'll show you a cheater.  Yeah, that includes Gascogne.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=vain,Don't compare your clothes to mine.  I'm wearing the height of Mejarian fashion over here!
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=interested,Hey, I'm in a luxurious dress.  You're in sweaty gym clothes.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=smug,Way to put me down even as I'm beating you, boss.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=interested,Never going to give me any credit, are you?  I'm gonna enjoy stripping you out of that underwear.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=teasing,Still making fun?  Let's see if you can keep that up when I get you naked.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=laughing,Insulting my outfit?  Now I <i>really</i> feel like taking you down a peg.  I hope you enjoy getting your breasts out!
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=smug,Yeah, yeah, Meia, you've got me all figured out now, I'm sure.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=interested,I mean, I'm not <i>expecting</i> to beat you.  I've been burned too many times before on <i>that</i> road.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=teasing,Awful cocky, Meia, considering you're still <i>losing</i>.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=stretching,Yeah, Meia, I'm totally blown away by this <i>lose-two-for-my-one</i> strategy you've got going.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=teasing,You'll see what I'm working with soon enough, Leader.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=smug,Can't you use those sharp squadron-commander wits to figure out what's first?
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=laughing,You're not <i>sure</i>?  Too much time in the gym and not enough in the strategy room, it'd seem.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=teasing,Don't worry, Meia.  I won't leave you guessing for <i>too</i> long...unless you can't beat me.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=smug,That's Meia for you.  Dreams up a new formation every week, can't decipher her own crewmate's fashion choices.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=laughing,Right on target as usual, Meia.  But don't spoil the surprise for them!
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=interested,Try not to, you know, immediately kill the tension, boss.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=laughing,Are you <i>sure</i> I have that much to lose?  Maybe I'm just a nasty little nymph.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=teasing,Why so confident about how much clothing I have?  <i>Have you been watching me undress</i>?
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0=seductive,<i>Oh, my</i>!  And people say <i>I</i> can be too forward.  You don't waste any time, do you?  But...OK!
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0=interested,Is this how fairies talk, dear?  Or are you just a particularly <i>lecherous</i> one?  Either way, I don't see the issue.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0=seductive,Uh...well, you're going to need to <i>leave</i> at some point, but I don't see the harm in letting you do it!
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0=vain,...Are you serious?  Well, my girlfriend wouldn't like that very much...but what she doesn't know won't hurt her!
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0=seductive,I prefer the term <i>cleavage</i> myself, but leave it to Earthlings to just be on the nose about these things.  Sure, why not?
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0=seductive,<i>Teeheehee</i>!  It's so cute when women compliment my breasts!  ...Wait, you're serious?  <i>OK</i>.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0=teasing,Does that line normally work, Grabby-hands?  Because...<i>it just did</i>.  Come over here, cutie.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:0-4,priority:150,count-meia:1=vain,It's true--men are just exotic foreign aliens to the likes of us.  Perhaps it's strange to you, but we happen to like women very much!
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:0-4,priority:150,count-meia:1=teasing,You'll have to excuse us.  The Earth we know is in a sorry state, so Mejare is just one of its many colonies.  <i>The woman planet</i>!
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:0-4,priority:150,count-meia:1=stretching,Hey, it's not so bad living without men.  Sure, Mejare's government is oppressive, but that's just to keep us away from them!

0-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:7-99=frustrated,After that run, I'm not even winning?  You Earth girls are <i>so</i> overdressed.
0-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:7-99=stretching,Welllll, I had a good run.  Now the fun begins!
0-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:7-99=laughing,Made you earn it, didn't I?  Well, this first one isn't gonna wow you.
0-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:7-99=interested,Long streak right out of the hangar.  You Earthlings really know how to make a woman sweat.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0,count-mahiru:1=vain,Ooh, let's do it, Meia!  That sounds like fun!  Here, get a good shot of my hips!  Don't worry about what the crew thinks!

0-must_strip_losing=bored,What a shame.  Now I have to start stripping instead of just teasing everyone else.
0-must_strip_losing=frustrated,Jeez, Earth women sure do overdress.  Haven't even lost yet, and I'm losing.
0-must_strip_losing=seductive,Aw, come on, do I <i>have</i> to?  Yeah, you want to see that, right?
0-must_strip_losing=bored,I'm already losing?  What do you Earth girls wear, overcoats?  Yeesh.
0-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:0-0=frustrated,Well, that didn't take long.  And why are you all <i>wearing</i> so much?  I mean, really.
0-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:0-0=bored,You Earth women sure wear a lot.  Why bother?
0-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:0-0=bored,Lost first <i>and</i> losing.  Guess I should've scouted the enemy first.
0-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:0-0=teasing,Lucky shot.  Normally <i>I'm</i> the one who makes them...on those nasty Harvest cubes.
0-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:5-99=frustrated,I lasted for that long, and I'm <i>still</i> the least clothed?  What do you all wear so much for, to keep men's grubby hands off of you?
0-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:5-99=smug,Still losing, am I?  Well then, I hope you enjoy all the skin I'm about to show you.
0-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:5-99=annoyed,...Yeah, I'm just gonna lose the sword.  That's all you overdressed Earth girls deserve.
0-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:5-99=bored,I can already tell you Earth women are massive prudes.  I guess living around men kind of forces you to be that way.
0-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:rinkah,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=seductive,Why, yes, I am!  Aren't <i>you</i> a clever one?

0-stripping=losing-rapier,Oh, dear.  My favorite rapier!  What if I'm <i>attacked</i>?
0-stripping=losing-rapier,Weapons count, right?  This rapier is quite valuable, you know!
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=losing-rapier,Well, if you thought my boss's little masturbation session was scandalous, check <i>this</i> out.  Courtesy of Mejare's imperial army!
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=losing-rapier,Behold--my pride and joy.  Stolen from Mejare's elite imperial guard!
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=losing-rapier,You have Mejare's finest soldiers to thank for providing me with a five-finger discount on this rapier.
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=losing-rapier,Isn't my rapier fashionable?  No wonder those Mejarian imperials took issue with me stealing it.
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=losing-rapier,Settle down, would you?  Honestly, it's like you're in love with me.  Would a <i>man</i> do this to you, too?
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=losing-rapier,Would you be this lovey-dovey if a <i>man</i> beat you so completely?
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=losing-rapier,Now I need to find a man to beat you at cards so I can watch you squirm with uncomfortable lust.
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=losing-rapier,So if a man beat you like this, would you be all over his tube like there's no tomorrow?  That's the vibe I'm getting.
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=losing-rapier,There you go with the lectures again.  Last I checked, I lead a much happier life.
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=losing-rapier,Oh, don't start with the strategy lectures.  Do you want to put our very gracious Earth hosts to sleep?
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=losing-rapier,Please don't start bringing the whole game down with that sort of talk.  You're so serious with these games.
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=losing-rapier,At least I can have a little fun from time to time.  You're still a sourpuss even with your breasts out!
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=losing-rapier,And now you're making fun of my carefully-picked fashion accessories.  You're so <i>negative</i>, Meia.
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=losing-rapier,I'll strip whatever I please.  I'm beautiful enough to be justified in toying with you a little.
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=losing-rapier,Hey, if you want to start a fight about it, now I have to do it barehanded.  So there's that.
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=losing-rapier,Hey, this thing has just been weighing me down.  There's no stopping me now!
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit=losing-rapier,What a surprise.  A man immediately disregards any notion of wearing something for fashion's sake.
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit=losing-rapier,Hey, there's nothing more classically elegant than a blade.  Perfect for intimidating captured soldiers, up close and intimate.
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit=losing-rapier,That's true.  Good thing I have laser rings and a glorious Dread fighter ship to handle that.
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit=losing-rapier,I was about to say the same thing about those ridiculous little wings of yours.
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit=losing-rapier,Forgive me for doubting a man's understanding of technology.  I'm a <i>fighter pilot</i>, I'll have you know.
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit=losing-rapier,What can I say?  I'm a fan of classic looks...and the intimacy of a blade.
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=losing-rapier,This is no tease, oh no.  I'm choosing to give up my weapon of choice!
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=losing-rapier,I'm <i>defenseless</i> without this thing, Meia.  I hope my Leader will protect me if these Earth people try to ravish me.
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=losing-rapier,You sound like you're not impressed.  But then, I could destroy a Harvest mothership, and you'd just criticize how long it took me.
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=losing-rapier,Not impressed, Meia?  I should've brought Barnette so she could film this.
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=losing-rapier,This isn't cheating!  If anything, it's a bold move!  What if I need to <i>defend myself</i>?
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=losing-rapier,It's not a cheat at all.  Should have brought your laser ring, silly.
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=losing-rapier,Not only is this rapier priceless, it's seen the blood of dozens of horrible Mejarian soldiers!  Don't listen to sour old Meia over there.
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=losing-rapier,I'd say it counts more than most of these pitiful Earthling accessories, thanks.  It's my weapon of choice!
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:1-10=losing-rapier,As long as our dear green-haired friend can do this, so can I...
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:1-10=losing-rapier,Why don't I just follow the example Lyn set?  She's quite gorgeous herself, after all.
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:1-10=losing-rapier,Lyn very kindly removed her weapon.  Let's all be friends--I'll do the same.
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:1-10=losing-rapier,I feel obligated to remove my rapier--Lyn did, and she's got the same gorgeous green hair that my girlfriend does.
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:jin,alsoPlayingStage:2-8=losing-rapier,You know what's even <i>lamer</i>, Earth-man?  Calling a poor woman out for things <i>you're</i> guilty of.
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:jin,alsoPlayingStage:2-8=losing-rapier,Says the man who stripped his katana earlier?  I don't need to take this kind of abuse from someone who's losing.
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:jin,alsoPlayingStage:2-8=losing-rapier,Losing to me, stripping your weapon, and then complaining when I do the same isn't a great impression, either.
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:jin,alsoPlayingStage:2-8=losing-rapier,Whatever you say, Earth-man.  I didn't call <i>you</i> lame when your katana went...I guess you're just bitter about losing.
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:jin,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=losing-rapier,What, is my ornate rapier not enough for you, Earth-man?  Well, too bad--weapons count when you're a wanted woman.
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:jin,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=losing-rapier,What you see as a lame excuse, I see as being deprived of my weapon of choice.  Pirates shouldn't be unarmed in public!
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:jin,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=losing-rapier,Hey, I'm a wanted criminal back home, Jin!  To lose my rapier is a catastrophic blow this early on!  <i>Please understand</i>.
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:jin,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=losing-rapier,Oh, please--pirates <i>need</i> their weapons!  You'd be calling me paranoid if I kept this on all game.
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=losing-rapier,Is there an issue with my strategy, boss?  Shall I remind you how <i>valuable</i> this rapier is?
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=losing-rapier,Hey, listen.  This rapier is so fashionable, I bet it's worth more than this bar.
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=losing-rapier,Don't lecture me on what is and isn't a worthy strip.  My rapier is one-of-a-kind!
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=losing-rapier,Meia, Meia, Meia.  You may know your piloting maneuvers, but leave the fashion discussion to yours truly.
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:rinkah,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=losing-rapier,Hey, you're not <i>that</i> clever for spotting it.  It's big and bold for intimidation purposes.
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:rinkah,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=losing-rapier,You've got a good eye for accessories, considering you seem to hardly wear anything.
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:rinkah,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=losing-rapier,I'll be honest---I didn't expect this from a woman who basically came here in a towel.
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:rinkah,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=losing-rapier,Think this thing could puncture those <i>rock-solid</i> abs of yours?  Not that I want any trouble.
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=losing-rapier,Don't think I'm going to make this little masturbation session easy for you!  You've got to <i>earn</i> it.
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=losing-rapier,Since you lost so badly, I don't see why I ought to show you any pity.  You wouldn't want that, right?
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=losing-rapier,You being who you are, I'm sure you don't want any help.  So rapier it is!
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=losing-rapier,I'll just lose the sword.  If any of these Earthlings start to get handsy, Meia, I give you permission to use it.
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=losing-rapier,Are you overwhelmed at the sight of it, Elizabeth?  I understand.  It's one of the most fashionable things I own, next to my dress.
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=losing-rapier,What do you think, Elizabeth?  Didn't expect a woman as beautiful as me to be a skilled swordswoman, as well?
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=losing-rapier,I <i>have</i> to carry around a weapon, Elizabeth.  I'm a wanted woman, you know!
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=losing-rapier,My rapier is both a fashion statement and the way I protect myself.  It's crucial to my image, Elizabeth!


#losing boots
1-stripped=vain,Don't mind me.  Let's get a move on, and maybe I'll actually remove some clothes!
1-stripped=teasing,Beat me again, and I'll actually take off some clothes!
1-stripped=teasing,I'm a pirate, you know.  Let's just say I got that sword at quite the discount!
1-stripped=thinking,I wonder what I should <i>actually</i> take off first...
1-stripped=stretching,Believe you me, I know how to use that thing.  Ask any Mejarian soldier!
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=vain,Well, having just disarmed myself, I suppose I'm nothing at all.  <i>Just a defenseless, gorgeous woman</i>.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=thinking,Good question.  I guess I'm...second-ranked in our squadron?  We don't really have classes...
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=teasing,<i>Commando</i>, eh?  Well, Mr. Angel...feel free to make me show you.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=smug,Very funny, Angel-boy.  If you're so interested in me being commando, go ahead and get this dress off of me.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=vain,Just gonna change the subject on me?  I don't have <i>a</i> class...I just have class.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=interested,What's <i>that</i> supposed to mean?  I'm second-ranked in our squadron, if that's what you wanted to hear.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:6-7=smug,Thing is, though, you just said it.  Just keep flicking that tube of yours in the corner, honey.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:6-7=interested,Wouldn't I be overconfident by taking off my <i>dress</i> first?  <i>Men and their little pea-brains</i>...
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:6-7=teasing,Aww, you poor thing, all sad and alone and naked like that.  <i>Do you want to see my leg?  Here you go, sweetie</i>.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:6-7=smug,Who cares if you lost to me?  Am I seriously not showing enough skin already?  You men are ridiculous with your demands.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:6-7=laughing,At least you know your place, little guy.  If you wanted to see me naked, maybe you should've learned what a pair was.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,priority:150,count-meia:1=laughing,Oh, please.  Meia would never bother with anything that fashionable.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,priority:150,count-meia:1=interested,Well, Meia, what do you think?  Should you carry around a rapier too, or do you figure trying to match my fashion sense is a fruitless effort?
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,priority:150,count-meia:1=smug,If you want Meia to become the violent type, make fun of her breasts...or her poker skills.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,priority:150,count-meia:1=teasing,We've dealt with our fair share of soldiers, honey--male <i>and</i> female.  We're the violent types when we have to be.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,priority:150,count-meia:1=smug,Hey, Magno Vivan's pirates are precisely as violent as we need to be.  Just surrender your things quietly, and there won't be any violence.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,priority:150,count-meia:1=smug,Rapiers are far too stylish and elegant for Meia's brutal efficiency.  Just a quick few zaps with her laser ring and she moves on to the next target.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:rinkah,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=interested,You have a <i>club</i>?  I know you <i>dress</i> a little savage, but I was giving you the benefit of the doubt.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:rinkah,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=interested,...Is your club some kind of fashion statement?  Or have they not invented guns where you're from?
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:rinkah,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=smug,I mean, that rapier is mostly for fashion.  I can't see you pulling off the <i>lugging-a-club-around</i> look, but maybe it's a thing on Earth.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:rinkah,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=stretching,You <i>do</i> look the type to have a club, but wow.  Way to confirm stereotypes, sweetie.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=smug,I'm here to show off my fashion...and my body, if it comes to that.  You'd need an interest in clothing to appreciate it.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=vain,I <i>had</i> to show off my rapier, Meia.  It's so elegant and deadly!  You wouldn't understand, with <i>your</i> wardrobe.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=vain,Hey, just because you didn't wear anything fashionable doesn't mean I can't show off <i>mine.</i>
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=interested,Do you even <i>own</i> anything fancy like my rapier?  You never wear anything but that suit.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=laughing,Oh, relax, I'm just teasing.  But how <i>funny</i> would that be?
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=smug,Yeah, you and a man is like oil and water.  They're too rough around the edges.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=teasing,I understand.  Only a woman's touch could melt that icy heart of yours.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=laughing,Men aren't you for you, huh?  I hope your body doesn't betray any hidden feelings, Meia.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:jin,alsoPlayingStage:0-8=smug,You men could do to learn the meaning of <i>patience</i>.  The good stuff isn't nearly as good if you skip to it.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:jin,alsoPlayingStage:0-8=teasing,As far as I'm concerned, I'm showing plenty already...so you'll have to get the rest off of me the <i>hard</i> way.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:jin,alsoPlayingStage:0-8=teasing,That all depends on how good you are at cards, dear.  Or maybe you'll win my heart and I'll just throw off my dress.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:jin,alsoPlayingStage:0-8=teasing,You don't need a game to strip me, handsome...just win my heart the old-fashioned way.  Can't you make me fall for you?
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:jin,alsoPlayingStage:0-8=vain,I've been looking for a man with healthy seed...so maybe I'll be so overcome that I'll just <i>surrender</i> myself to you.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=interested,Aren't you always telling me not to brag?  That's a little clashing advice.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=vain,It just wouldn't be fair to everyone else if I were beautiful <i>and</i> more skilled.  But maybe you're right--I <i>am</i> perfect!
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=stretching,I don't know, Meia.  I'm just not seeing it in this game.  Seems random to me.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=laughing,I'll be sure to brag more often now.  Hey, you said so.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=bored,Ah, jeez.  Don't start again...don't make yourself miserable.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=bored,Don't guilt-trip me...I didn't tell you to take your eyepiece off.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=bored,Hey, I thought your eyepiece was staying on the whole time.  Hard to recognize you without it, honestly.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=frustrated,I'd say something about how you look prettier without your eyepiece, but...I know it means a lot to you.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=vain,Don't worry, boss.  Nothing but clothes from here on out!
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=teasing,I just wanted to show everyone I mean business.  We Mejarians are not to be trifled with, after all!
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=laughing,Oh, don't worry about me not bringing competition.  I have <i>plenty</i> of clothing to lose.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=smug,Don't worry, now I'll actually strip clothing...well, depends on your definition of <i>clothing</i>.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=vain,Why, I never!  I'm a deadly swordswoman, Meia!  Or at least I <i>would</i> be, if piloting didn't take up all my time.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=stretching,Hey, I know how to do a few tricks with it!  You should see how wonderfully I can flourish as I unsheathe it.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=laughing,So what if I'm no good with it?  I just point it at prisoners, and the intimidation factor does the rest.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=vain,Maybe I'm no good with it, but the fashion statement makes it all worth it.  Shows I'm a real <i>killer</i>!
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=smug,Hey, I think it drives home the women-have-fangs thing for men really nicely.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=sad,Yeah, whatever.  <i>Barnette</i> thinks I look cool with it.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=vain,Why, yes, it is...one of <i>many</i> pirate weapons.  I'm glad you can appreciate the intricacies of my outfit.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=stretching,Well, I mostly carry it for fashion...I'm more likely to use a Mejarian laser ring when things get dicey.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=vain,Technically my <i>Dread</i> is my pirate weapon.  And what an elegant ship it is!
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=vain,My <i>Vandread</i> is the ultimate pirate weapon, actually.  It can shield a <i>whole planet</i>, it's so powerful!
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=stretching,Speaking of bad first impressions, try lightening up a little in mixed company.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=interested,You're one to talk.  They're all going to think half of Mejare is full of blue-haired balls of misery.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=smug,I'd rather be a fun cheater than a boring stick in the mud.  What's it gonna take for you to have fun, huh?
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=teasing,We'll see if you can keep up that miserable attitude when your breasts are bouncing around.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=stretching,Well, <i>excuse me</i> for thinking an orgasm would lighten you up enough to accept a little white lie.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=interested,Can't you let me tell a few lies to impress our hosts?  Honestly.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=stretching,God, even after you <i>masturbate</i>, you're still no fun.  You're beyond help.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=teasing,Hey, I've shot a few soldiers in my day!  Just not <i>that</i> one.
1-must_strip_winning=vain,Oh, my.  Did I lose again?  Well, I still have a lead.
1-must_strip_winning=smug,Well, well, well.  I'm still winning, but you've finally gotten some actual clothes off of me.
1-must_strip_winning=interested,Am I joining the fray?  Is it time to actually take something off?
1-must_strip_winning=interested,Well, since you're finally clawing your way out of the hole I dug you, sure, I'll take something off.
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=smug,You think you've got me <i>allllll</i> figured out, don't you?  Well...you're right.
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=teasing,How very astute of you.  But <i>what</i> little thing will it be?
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=vain,It's not as if my wonderful dress would count for much.  And I couldn't make a public appearance without it!
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=smug,Don't judge me.  All clothing is created equal...provided it's picked out by yours truly.
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=teasing,Never fear, Meia!  This time, I'm taking off something substantial--and personal!
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=vain,Since I've lost again, it's time to take off something personally meaningful to me.
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=vain,Oh, dear.  Well, since you've beaten me twice now, it seems fair I take off a highly personal item.
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=smug,All eyes on me again?  In that case, why don't I choose something personal this time?
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:0-4,priority:150,count-meia:1=vain,Hey, I follow orders!  I'm just trying to help Meia come out of her shell a little...and maybe find a girlfriend.
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:0-4,priority:150,count-meia:1=smug,Talk about <i>rude</i>, Misato.  Name <i>one</i> time I didn't do my job when it counted--it's not my fault Meia's so miserable.
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:0-4,priority:150,count-meia:1=teasing,Hey, we're not piloting right now!  It's just a little friendly teasing between girls who've been through a lot together.
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:0-4,priority:150,count-meia:1=vain,Hey, Meia's not ranked <i>that</i> much higher than me.  And I take my Leader seriously when we're out in battle!
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=laughing,My bad.  I think I'm getting distracted from how cute you look, now that you're free of that clunky armor.
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=teasing,I can't help but get distracted when my Leader is looking cuter every round.
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=seductive,It's not my fault--you're just too <i>adorable</i> in that suit!
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=smug,Maybe I'm losing on purpose to put my adorable leader at ease in her revealing bodysuit.
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=interested,There I go again.  Any guesses as to what's next, Meia?
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=teasing,Well, damn.  This probably makes us even.  <i>What'll I strip</i>?
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=smug,So many fashionable items to choose from.  Got any of that brilliant wit on reserve, Meia?  What's going next?
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=stretching,What to pick, what to pick...have you figured it out yet, Leader?
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=vain,I <i>live</i> for opportunities like this, Leader.  Time to show off some more accessories.
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=laughing,Don't worry, there's plenty more where that rapier came from!  ...That is to say, it came from Mejarian stockrooms.
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=teasing,Isn't this <i>exciting</i>, Meia?  <i>I wonder what I'll remove next</i>!
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=vain,Guess I'm falling behind you, boss.  But if it draws more attention to my outfit, so be it!
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=vain,My outfit is as finely crafted as the body it conceals.
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=smug,I think I <i>will</i> take off some clothes this time...mostly because I didn't bring my laser ring.
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=smug,Oh, if I had anything else that wasn't really clothing, I'd definitely opt for it.
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=laughing,I'm sure if I thought hard enough, I could find another way to completely disappoint everyone.
1-must_strip_winning,timeInStage:7-99=interested,Guess counting my rapier didn't miff you, because you haven't been putting up much of a fight.
1-must_strip_winning,timeInStage:7-99=vain,Quite the streak I had there.  Maybe I'm better when that sword isn't weighing me down.
1-must_strip_winning,timeInStage:7-99=vain,Lucky streak <i>and</i> I'm still winning?  Tonight's my night...or wait, <i>every</i> night is my night.
1-must_strip_winning,timeInStage:7-99=smug,Here I am, still so clothed, and so skilled.  Surrounded by Earthlings struggling to tread water...or keep their clothes on.
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=seductive,Stripping all these small items is going to be a bore.  So, Meia, who'd you masturbate to the thought of?
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=teasing,Any chance I could get a hint as to who was running through your mind a little while ago, Leader?
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=vain,No need to focus on <i>me.</i>  I'm curious who was in your thoughts back there, Meia.
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=laughing,That was quite the little finish you had before, boss.  <i>Who pushed you over the edge?</i>
1-must_strip_winning,timeInStage:0-0=interested,<i>Again</i>?  You Earth girls must be annoyed at all the little trinkets you see on me.
1-must_strip_winning,timeInStage:0-0=smug,Tagged me again, but let's remember who's winning.
1-must_strip_winning,timeInStage:0-0=teasing,<i>Do I smell a comeback</i>?  Can't be...that would mean I'd lose.
1-must_strip_winning,timeInStage:0-0=laughing,That's the spirit, ladies.  Claw your way back, so I can claw at myself later.
1-must_strip_winning,hasHand:Two Pair=frustrated,You Earth people really <i>are</i> tough, beating me with <i>two pair</i>...better get creative.
1-must_strip_winning,hasHand:Two Pair=bored,Jeez, <i>two pair</i> lost?  I better be a little more seductive...
1-must_strip_winning,hasHand:Two Pair=bored,Wow.  If <i>two pair</i> is losing, you might be the types I <i>need</i> my sword for.
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=laughing,...You don't seriously think you have a chance, right, Meia?
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=interested,Do you honestly think this is going to end with anything but you losing?
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=stretching,You're still convinced you've got this?  Never thought you could be so cocky.
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=interested,Jeez, Meia, have some humility.  You're not beating me like that.
1-must_strip_normal=frustrated,Oh, great.  Now I have to think of something to actually strip.
1-must_strip_normal=interested,Hey, that hand was a winner and you know it.  My beauty makes up for its weakness.
1-must_strip_normal=bored,Middle of the pack...I'm second-in-command among our Dreads, so this is a new experience.
1-must_strip_normal=bored,Damn.  Thought I might slip by, considering my general good fortune.
1-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=seductive,Stripping all these small items is going to be a bore.  So, Meia, who'd you masturbate to the thought of?
1-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=teasing,Any chance I could get a hint as to who was running through your mind a little while ago, Leader?
1-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=vain,No need to focus on <i>me.</i>  I'm curious who was in your thoughts back there, Meia.

1-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=seductive,It's not my fault--you're just too <i>adorable</i> in that suit!
1-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=smug,Maybe I'm losing on purpose to put my adorable leader at ease in her revealing bodysuit.
1-must_strip_normal,hasHand:Two Pair=frustrated,You Earth people really <i>are</i> tough, beating me with <i>two pair</i>...better get creative.

1-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=teasing,Well, damn.  This probably makes us even.  <i>What'll I strip</i>?
1-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=smug,So many fashionable items to choose from.  Got any of that brilliant wit on reserve, Meia?  What's going next?
1-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=stretching,What to pick, what to pick...have you figured it out yet, Leader?
1-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=vain,I <i>live</i> for opportunities like this, Leader.  Time to show off some more accessories.
1-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=laughing,Don't worry, there's plenty more where that rapier came from!  ...That is to say, it came from Mejarian stockrooms.
1-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=teasing,Isn't this <i>exciting</i>, Meia?  <i>I wonder what I'll remove next</i>!
1-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=vain,Guess I'm falling behind you, boss.  But if it draws more attention to my outfit, so be it!
1-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=laughing,...You don't seriously think you have a chance, right, Meia?
1-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=interested,Do you honestly think this is going to end with anything but you losing?
1-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=stretching,You're still convinced you've got this?  Never thought you could be so cocky.
1-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=interested,Jeez, Meia, have some humility.  You're not beating me like that.
1-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=vain,My outfit is as finely crafted as the body it conceals.
1-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=smug,I think I <i>will</i> take off some clothes this time...mostly because I didn't bring my laser ring.
1-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=smug,Oh, if I had anything else that wasn't really clothing, I'd definitely opt for it.
1-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=laughing,I'm sure if I thought hard enough, I could find another way to completely disappoint everyone.
1-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:7-99=teasing,Looks like I didn't need that sword anyway.  You can barely keep up with my cards.
1-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:7-99=laughing,Good of you all to remember I'm here.  I was feeling left out of the nudie-party.
1-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:7-99=interested,I really didn't think I was that great at cards.  But here you all are, struggling to beat me.
1-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:7-99=thinking,All that time, but I still haven't thought of what to strip next...
1-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:0-4,priority:150,count-meia:1=vain,Hey, I follow orders!  I'm just trying to help Meia come out of her shell a little...and maybe find a girlfriend.
1-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:0-4,priority:150,count-meia:1=smug,Talk about <i>rude</i>, Misato.  Name <i>one</i> time I didn't do my job when it counted--it's not my fault Meia's so miserable.
1-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:0-4,priority:150,count-meia:1=teasing,Hey, we're not piloting right now!  It's just a little friendly teasing between girls who've been through a lot together.
1-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:0-4,priority:150,count-meia:1=vain,Hey, Meia's not ranked <i>that</i> much higher than me.  And I take my Leader seriously when we're out in battle!
1-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:0-0=interested,<i>Again</i>?  You Earthlings are tough cookies.
1-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:0-0=bored,Earthlings are tough cookies, apparently...guess the Harvest taught us that already.
1-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:0-0=laughing,Yeah, yeah, I guess the rapier shouldn't have counted.  Maybe I deserve this.
1-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:0-0=bored,Ugh, really?  This is going downhill faster than Mejare's living conditions.
1-must_strip_losing=sad,Aww...but I <i>love</i> my boots.
1-must_strip_losing=sad,Not my <i>boots</i>...they're so <i>cute</i>.
1-must_strip_losing=frustrated,Losing <i>and</i> I have to take off my cute boots?  This game sucks.
1-must_strip_losing=bored,I'm really blowing it right out of the gate.  Maybe Meia's onto something with all her strategy-talk.
1-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=vain,My outfit is as finely crafted as the body it conceals.
1-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=smug,I think I <i>will</i> take off some clothes this time...mostly because I didn't bring my laser ring.
1-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=smug,Oh, if I had anything else that wasn't really clothing, I'd definitely opt for it.

1-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=vain,Guess I'm falling behind you, boss.  But if it draws more attention to my outfit, so be it!
1-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:6-99=frustrated,I'm <i>still</i> losing?  Is Earth especially cold or something?  So many layers!
1-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:6-99=bored,After all that luck, I'm still on the losing end.  Props for splitting out the stripping evenly between yourselves.
1-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:6-99=laughing,Still losing after that streak?  Perhaps there's an Earthling conspiracy...wouldn't be the first we've uncovered.
1-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:6-99=bored,Ah, jeez.  I had a good run there, but you're all still ahead of me.  Good thing my body's better.
1-must_strip_losing,hasHand:Two Pair=frustrated,You Earth people really <i>are</i> tough, beating me with <i>two pair</i>...better get creative.
1-must_strip_losing,hasHand:Two Pair=bored,Jeez, <i>two pair</i> lost?  I better be a little more seductive...
1-must_strip_losing,hasHand:Two Pair=bored,Wow.  If <i>two pair</i> is losing, you might be the types I <i>need</i> my sword for.
1-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:0-0=bored,...Maybe I'll just stop caring altogether and save some face.
1-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:0-0=laughing,...Not putting forth a good argument for Mejarian wits, am I?
1-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:0-0=vain,What a start.  Good thing there's more to my outfit than meets the eye.
1-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:0-0=laughing,Two in a row?  I'm sure there's two things you're just <i>dying</i> to see from me.
1-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=seductive,Stripping all these small items is going to be a bore.  So, Meia, who'd you masturbate to the thought of?
1-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=teasing,Any chance I could get a hint as to who was running through your mind a little while ago, Leader?
1-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=vain,No need to focus on <i>me.</i>  I'm curious who was in your thoughts back there, Meia.
1-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=laughing,That was quite the little finish you had before, boss.  <i>Who pushed you over the edge?</i>
1-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:0-4,priority:150,count-meia:1=vain,Hey, I follow orders!  I'm just trying to help Meia come out of her shell a little...and maybe find a girlfriend.
1-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:0-4,priority:150,count-meia:1=smug,Talk about <i>rude</i>, Misato.  Name <i>one</i> time I didn't do my job when it counted--it's not my fault Meia's so miserable.

1-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:0-4,priority:150,count-meia:1=vain,Hey, Meia's not ranked <i>that</i> much higher than me.  And I take my Leader seriously when we're out in battle!
1-stripping=losing-boots,Maybe this doesn't seem like much to you, but my boots represent the height of Mejarian fashion.
1-stripping=losing-boots,This is quite the blow.  Do you have <i>any</i> idea how fashionable my boots are?
1-stripping=losing-boots,<i>Fine</i>...if I <i>have</i> to.  Boots it is.
1-stripping=losing-boots,I'll be taking my time with my boots here.  They're delicate, just like me.
1-stripping=losing-boots,Nobody scuff up my boots, now!  They're stylish <i>and</i> sensible.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=losing-boots,I had some other thoughts on what to strip, but I'll give you this.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=losing-boots,Yeah, I guess I can just make you look wrong or right if I want, huh?  Well, boots it is.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=losing-boots,That's right, my boots!  They're so fashionable that it'll make a statement about how serious I'm taking this.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=losing-boots,Perfect accuracy as usual.  Now, let's see if I can make this look graceful.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=losing-boots,Yeah, yeah, I've heard it all before.  The Harvest hasn't killed us yet.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=losing-boots,Lecturing me to the bitter end, aren't you?  It's good to know it's still you, even though you're naked.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=losing-boots,You're lecturing me now?  Even without the suit, armor, or eyepiece, it's definitely still you under there.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=losing-boots,You keep going on about your silly strategy while try to have fun.  We'll see who's happier by the end.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=losing-boots,Looks like my boots will go first.  As fashionable as they are, stripping anything else would ruin the integrity of my outfit.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=losing-boots,Can't ruin the aesthetic composition of my dress's decorations, so boots it is.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=losing-boots,You could do with some fancy boots like mine, Meia.  Or maybe some high heels to tighten up that butt of yours?
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=losing-boots,Out of my many fashionable items, I suppose the boots are the least integral to the way the outfit comes together.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=losing-boots,You just don't figure I'm capable of sentimentality.  I love and am loved, Leader.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=losing-boots,What, you think I can't get sentimental about this sort of thing?  I have a girlfriend, you know.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=losing-boots,Barnette will be happy to tell you just how <i>personal</i> I can be.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=losing-boots,Figures you'd find fault in me even when I choose actual clothing.  Never change, Meia.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=losing-boots,Just when you start having a little fun, you recoil at the mere implication of sex.  I can't believe you came here with me.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=losing-boots,Oh, learn to live with a little teasing.  If Barnette gets mad, I know how to calm her down...no need to get involved.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=losing-boots,Come on, Meia, don't shrink back just because I gave you a compliment.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=losing-boots,Nothing makes you cringe as much as being complimented, does it?  Honestly, give yourself some credit for once.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:1-10,priority:139=losing-boots,<i>Buy</i>?  I hate to break it to you, Elizabeth, but...pirates aren't known to <i>pay</i> for things.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:1-10,priority:139=losing-boots,I got a lovely five-finger discount on these boots from a Mejarian soldier who thought she was being clever...until she wasn't.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:1-10,priority:139=losing-boots,You'll have to ask the Mejarian soldier I stole them from, Lizzie.  Except you can't, because she's dead now.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:1-10,priority:139=losing-boots,<i>Buy</i>, Elizabeth?  These are standard-issue boots for...whatever class of Mejarian soldier it was that I stole these from.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:1-10,priority:139=losing-boots,I'm a pirate, dear.  My rapier knows where I got these boots better than I do, if you follow.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=losing-boots,<i>See</i>?  I can play fairly!  I just know how to have fun.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=losing-boots,It's not strip poker without a little titillation.  But I wanted to help our Earth friends out a little!
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=losing-boots,Teasing is fun, but you have to keep the audience interested.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=losing-boots,True, but if I strip them, everyone notices how stylish they are.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=losing-boots,I feel like I'm taking my first step into a sexual adventure.  You should really try to follow, Meia.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit=losing-boots,Are you mumbling to yourself over there, Pit?  Oh, <i>do share</i> if it's about my lovely boots.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit=losing-boots,Hey, aren't you paying attention, Mr. Angel?  I'm not stripping if there's not going to be an audience.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit=losing-boots,Hey, Mr. Angel, look at me when I'm stripping for you.  I'm trying to be nice here.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit=losing-boots,I understand, Pit.  You're simply <i>overcome</i> by my impeccable choice in shoes.  You can stare, it's OK.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=losing-boots,Oh, please.  Not <i>everything</i> I do is a plea for sexual attention.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=losing-boots,I really don't care if people like my feet or not.  Well, yes I do...but that's not why I'm opting for these.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=losing-boots,My feet are quite lovely, Meia.  Barnette gives them enough massages to make that certain.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=losing-boots,Hey now, <i>every inch</i> of me is as beautiful as the rest.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=losing-boots,No fun, huh?  Fine.  I'll just assume it's Valore--she's a good match for you!
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=losing-boots,That told me everything I need to know.  I bet you pictured being the cream on Valore's cookie.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=losing-boots,Yeah, yeah, that was rhetorical.  I know good and well it was Valore.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=losing-boots,We all know you have a crush on Valore, Meia.  Just admit it.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:0,priority:139=losing-boots,Well, they're a little plain, but it's cute how they go up so far.  You're a modest one, dearie...especially to be playing this game.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:0,priority:139=losing-boots,Why, thank you, honey!  Yours are cute, too.  Who knew you organ-harvesting Earth girls could be raised so polite?
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:0,priority:139=losing-boots,You are just the <i>cutest</i> little thing, with how shy you are.  How in God's name did you end up playing this?
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:0,priority:139=losing-boots,Awww, I can't criticize your boots when they're below that <i>adorable</i> little face of yours!  You're such a sweet girl.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:0,priority:139=losing-boots,Hey, I may be the pinnacle of <i>Mejarian</i> fashion, but that doesn't make me the authority on Earth's.  Have some confidence in your own style...you sweet little thing, you.


#losing sleeves
2-stripped=seductive,Ground's cold.  <i>How exciting</i>.
2-stripped=teasing,I'm warning you.  I love those boots, so I'm not going easy on you anymore.
2-stripped=interested,Ground's cold, which really gets me in the fighting spirit.
2-stripped=laughing,Do you <i>know</i> how expensive those boots were?  ...That's right, they're stolen!
2-stripped=vain,You know, I stole those boots from a Mejarian soldier at swordpoint.  I'm so daring.
2-stripped=stretching,Nothing beats one of Barnette's foot massages after a long day in those clunky spacesuits we wear.
2-stripped=seductive,Ooh, it's a little chilly on my bare feet.  <i>Maybe one of you can hold me up instead</i>.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=interested,Watch yourself there.  I don't intend on losing to a man, especially a tiny little pipsqueak like you.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=laughing,Well, aren't <i>you</i> confident?  I guess you have to be when you're missing more than a few inches.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=smug,Would you look at that?  Men know how to count.  Wasn't sure you had it in you.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=teasing,I've got the honor of Magno Vivan's pirates riding on this game, you know.  I'm not going to roll over and die when a little man starts making threats.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=teasing,You know me too well, Meia.  You're spoiling the fun for our guests.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=vain,Maybe we should have played separate tables.  You're reading me like a book over here.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=seductive,Can't slip anything by you, can I, boss?  I like it better that way.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=teasing,Eh, you're just bluffing, Meia.  You're overwhelmed by the sight of my beautiful bare feet, aren't you?
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=teasing,It's OK to fall in love, Meia.  She's cute--and that dark skin of hers is exotic!
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=teasing,I'd still respect a Meia in love just as much as the sober, boring one I've come to know.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=seductive,Oh, come on.  I bet you're a totally selfless lover--she'd be so lucky to have you!
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=vain,You're such a bore.  You've got to open your heart to all the wonderful women in the universe!
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=vain,<i>Now I feel just as exposed as you, Leader</i>.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=laughing,<i>Oh, my</i>.  Bare feet on the cold floor...you can't understand my pain, Meia.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=vain,<i>Don't talk to me like you understand how awful it is to be exposed in public, Meia</i>.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=seductive,This is all happening so fast.  Can't I borrow one of your many pieces left, Meia?
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=vain,Hey, losers don't get to complain in general.  I'm a winner, so my needs should be met.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=interested,You know you could have pulled up a <i>chair</i>, right?  Stop bellyaching.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=smug,Figures you'd like the cool floor.  It matches your general demeanor.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=laughing,Why am I not surprised the Ice Queen herself enjoys planting her bare bottom on the cold floor when there's chairs around?
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:6-7=laughing,Aww, don't feel bad, honey.  I didn't expect any better from you.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:6-7=teasing,This is what happens when a silly little man thinks he can outwit Mejare's finest.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:6-7=teasing,In these matters, Pit, the answer is usually a little bit of both.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:6-7=teasing,I can handle a little nudity, despite how bad I'm beating you.  But I can't just <i>give it to you</i> like that, now can I?
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:6-7=interested,I'm not even playing that hard, Pit.  This <i>is</i> a game where the only penalty for losing is showing off my gorgeous body.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:6-7=teasing,Really, honey, you're just that bad.  I'm not trying to win that hard--it's no fun teasing without a payoff at the end!
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=seductive,Are my feet in adequate shape, Leader?  I value your opinion on these matters.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=vain,How do I look, all barefoot and sensual?  Don't you just want to <i>kiss my feet all over</i>?
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=teasing,I wonder how many of our crewmates wouldn't mind an evening with my bare feet.  There's Barnette...and I bet <i>you</i> wouldn't mind, either.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=vain,Pretty sure there are women who are into feet, so here you go.  I know they're gorgeous...right, Meia?
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=stretching,In any case, boots are off, and your armor's gone.  I'd say we're officially settled in!
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=smug,Now I'm feeling fun and light on my feet.  Try to join me, sourpuss.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=teasing,Now lighten up and have some fun.  <i>That's an order, missy</i>!
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=vain,I don't want to hear any more excuses out of you.  <i>You have fun this instant</i>!
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=seductive,Ooh, Meia, the floor's so cold in this place!  Why didn't you say anything before?
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=interested,Can't believe you haven't commented on how chilly the floor is.  Bottling up your stress as usual, boss?
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=interested,Just like my Leader to not comment on how cold the floor is.  You'd never admit weakness.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=teasing,You've been standing barefoot for this long without complaining about the floor being cold?  What a trooper.  I'm <i>already</i> getting jittery.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=vain,I'm just going to keep being myself, boss.  We're all still alive and quite happy about it.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=seductive,I'm perfectly happy with my life, and you should be, too.  At least it looks like you're in a good mood now.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=laughing,Hey, seeing you smile warms the cockles of my lecherous heart.  You being naked is pretty funny, too.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=vain,I'm happy with what I have--a wonderful girlfriend and a steadfast squadron leader.  You ought to count your blessings sometime.
2-must_strip_winning=stretching,<i>Again</i>?  Well, it's only fair.  I've been leaving you all in the dust.
2-must_strip_winning=laughing,Do I <i>have</i> to strip?  I came in here showing more than anybody!
2-must_strip_winning=teasing,Still winning, darlings!  Better work a little harder or I'll <i>never</i> be naked.
2-must_strip_winning=laughing,Hate to break it to you, but my dress isn't coming off yet.
2-must_strip_winning,timeInStage:7-99=interested,Congratulations.  You managed to break my long streak...when I was all flustered from losing my cute boots.
2-must_strip_winning,timeInStage:7-99=vain,I had a streak <i>and</i> I'm still winning.  Losing my boots has made me lighter than ever!
2-must_strip_winning,timeInStage:7-99=stretching,...Oh, did I lose?  I kinda forgot I was in this game, just casually beating you all.
2-must_strip_winning,timeInStage:7-99=teasing,Still a comfortable lead...and I'm still comfortable in this dress, don't you worry.
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=vain,Oh, dear, me again.  Who'd you leave to hold down the fort, anyway, Meia?
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=confused,At boring old times like these, I think of the Nirvana.  Who'd you leave in charge, Meia?
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=stretching,I can't imagine you were negligent about patrols before coming here, Meia.  With both me and you gone, who's in charge of the squadron?
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=confused,Aww, not <i>again</i>.  Hey, Meia, who's leading the Dreads right now?  Normally it'd be <i>my</i> job with you gone.
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=angry,<i>Just what will I</i>--oh, you suck, Meia!
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=angry,<i>I wonder what I'll</i>--h-hey, how'd you know that?
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=annoyed,<i>What'll I take off next</i>...real clever, Meia.  Good job.
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=bored,<i>Oh, my!  What'll it be</i>--yeah.  It's the sleeves.
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=teasing,There I go again.  My wily leader's going to catch up to me at this rate!
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=smug,I bet you're feeling as if you can make a comeback, Meia.  Well, my outfit says otherwise.
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=vain,Don't get that smirk going, Meia.  This is but a temporary setback.
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=laughing,I hope Miss Topless doesn't think she's suddenly going to pull ahead of me.
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=teasing,Hey, Meia.  Is it just me, or have you really lightened up, being all nude?
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=vain,You know, Meia, you've been smirking for a while now.  Can't help but feel <i>sexy</i> like this?
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=teasing,You've got a little half-smile thing going on, Leader.  I think you <i>like</i> being naked...glad I could show you how pretty you are.
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=laughing,What's with that goofy smirk, Meia?  Is it the <i>rush</i> of strangers ogling your nude body?
2-must_strip_winning,timeInStage:0-0=bored,Right after my boots?  Well, since I'm winning...
2-must_strip_winning,timeInStage:0-0=bored,Guess the cold ground jolted me into a stupor.
2-must_strip_winning,timeInStage:0-0=frustrated,Damn.  Really blowing this lead of mine in a hurry.
2-must_strip_winning,timeInStage:0-0=interested,Proud of yourself?  Maybe you should re-check the clothes tally.
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=seductive,This next one won't be any interesting, Leader.  <i>Why don't you tell me who you're thinking of over there?</i>
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=seductive,So, Meia...<i>anyone on your mind I should know about?</i>
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=teasing,I <i>know</i> you're thinking of <i>someone</i>, Meia.  Are they at this table?  Or maybe...<i>back on the ship?</i>
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=teasing,Can I get a hint as to who's going through your mind?  There's got to be <i>somebody</i> who gets you going, man or woman.
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=vain,...Yes, and?
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=interested,...Is this the first time we've met, Meia?  Do you think I'm insecure about this?
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=stretching,<i>Oh, no.  I might have to show off my beautiful naked body.  Woe is me</i>.
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=seductive,I'm not worried at all, Leader.  With you by my side, I can handle <i>anything</i>.
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=laughing,My boots are just sitting there, boss.  Sure you don't want to put some clothes on?
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=laughing,You feeling alright, Meia?  I know you can be uncomfortable naked...you can put my boots on, if you want.
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=teasing,Hey, Meia...if you're feeling exposed, try putting my boots on.  I've no use for them anymore.
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=teasing,Feeling vulnerable, Leader?  My sword's up for the taking over there.
2-must_strip_winning,hasHand:Two Pair=laughing,You must be pretty proud of yourself, beating me with a hand like this...too bad it won't afford you much.
2-must_strip_winning,hasHand:Two Pair=laughing,Wow, and I even had <i>two pair</i>.  I wonder what set of two I could take to match it?
2-must_strip_winning,hasHand:Two Pair=smug,I really thought that hand was going to take me somewhere, too...I'll have to even things out by not taking <i>this</i> anywhere.
2-must_strip_normal=teasing,My, my, my.  What shall I take off <i>this</i> time?
2-must_strip_normal=vain,Could it be?  Am I out of my dress now?
2-must_strip_normal=seductive,Aw, come on, weren't my cute little feet enough for you?
2-must_strip_normal=teasing,You're inching towards your reward, but you're not there yet!
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=angry,<i>Just what will I</i>--oh, you suck, Meia!
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=angry,<i>I wonder what I'll</i>--h-hey, how'd you know that?
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=annoyed,<i>What'll I take off next</i>...real clever, Meia.  Good job.
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=bored,<i>Oh, my!  What'll it be</i>--yeah.  It's the sleeves.
2-must_strip_normal,hasHand:Two Pair=laughing,You must be pretty proud of yourself, beating me with a hand like this...too bad it won't afford you much.
2-must_strip_normal,hasHand:Two Pair=laughing,Wow, and I even had <i>two pair</i>.  I wonder what set of two I could take to match it?
2-must_strip_normal,hasHand:Two Pair=smug,I really thought that hand was going to take me somewhere, too...I'll have to even things out by not taking <i>this</i> anywhere.
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=vain,Oh, dear, me again.  Who'd you leave to hold down the fort, anyway, Meia?
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=confused,At boring old times like these, I think of the Nirvana.  Who'd you leave in charge, Meia?
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=stretching,I can't imagine you were negligent about patrols before coming here, Meia.  With both me and you gone, who's in charge of the squadron?
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=confused,Aww, not <i>again</i>.  Hey, Meia, who's leading the Dreads right now?  Normally it'd be <i>my</i> job with you gone.
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=vain,...Yes, and?
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=interested,...Is this the first time we've met, Meia?  Do you think I'm insecure about this?
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=stretching,<i>Oh, no.  I might have to show off my beautiful naked body.  Woe is me</i>.
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=seductive,I'm not worried at all, Leader.  With you by my side, I can handle <i>anything</i>.
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=vain,Just a little bad luck.  I'll bounce back...not that I really care if I do.
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=laughing,It's just a game, Meia.  I take piloting more seriously than <i>not</i> showing my body off.
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=smug,Who cares if I lose?  All the winner gets is bragging rights...and I carry those around with me.
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=vain,Oh, don't worry so much.  I've still got it together, I swear.
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=teasing,I'll get you sooner or later!  Maybe.
2-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:0-0=seductive,I just keep on losing.  Can't you take it easy on me?
2-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:0-0=vain,Please stop beating me.  <i>I'm too beautiful to lose</i>!
2-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:0-0=interested,Was it something I said, dealer?  Don't think I need your help to win.
2-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:0-0=stretching,I'd offer a peek at my breasts if you forfeit, but...you're on the road there this way, too.
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=teasing,There I go again.  My wily leader's going to catch up to me at this rate!  <i>But I'll make sure she won't</i>.
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=smug,I bet you're feeling as if you can make a comeback, Meia.  Well, my outfit says otherwise.
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=vain,Don't get that smirk going, Meia.  This is but a temporary setback.
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=laughing,I hope Miss Topless doesn't think she's suddenly going to pull ahead of me.
2-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:7-99=stretching,Losing those boots really turned this around for me.  I'm feeling great!
2-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:7-99=smug,Hanging tough, thanks to that lucky streak.  I think I've got some more in me still.
2-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:7-99=teasing,I was about to pull away, too.  You Earthlings can put up a fight!
2-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:7-99=vain,Quite the streak.  All Meia would see is that I lost it, though.
2-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:7-99=vain,Quite the streak.  I was mostly thinking about my hair, too.
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=teasing,Hey, Meia.  Is it just me, or have you really lightened up, being all nude?
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=vain,You know, Meia, you've been smirking for a while now.  Can't help but feel <i>sexy</i> like this?

2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=laughing,My boots are just sitting there, boss.  Sure you don't want to put some clothes on?
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=laughing,You feeling alright, Meia?  I know you can be uncomfortable naked...you can put my boots on, if you want.
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=teasing,Hey, Meia...if you're feeling exposed, try putting my boots on.  I've no use for them anymore.
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=teasing,Feeling vulnerable, Leader?  My sword's up for the taking over there.
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=seductive,This next one won't be any interesting, Leader.  <i>Why don't you tell me who you're thinking of over there?</i>
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=seductive,So, Meia...<i>anyone on your mind I should know about?</i>

2-must_strip_losing=frustrated,Good thing Meia's not here.  She'd be giving me an earful about proper strategy...
2-must_strip_losing=thinking,Again?  I'm running out of stuff...oh, wait, I think I know what to strip.
2-must_strip_losing=thinking,Uh...I didn't think past my boots.  Oh, wait!
2-must_strip_losing=frustrated,Does Earth poker have different rules or something?  This is embarrassing.
2-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=laughing,My boots are just sitting there, boss.  Sure you don't want to put some clothes on?
2-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=laughing,You feeling alright, Meia?  I know you can be uncomfortable naked...you can put my boots on, if you want.
2-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=teasing,Hey, Meia...if you're feeling exposed, try putting my boots on.  I've no use for them anymore.
2-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=teasing,Feeling vulnerable, Leader?  My sword's up for the taking over there.
2-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=vain,...Yes, and?
2-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=interested,...Is this the first time we've met, Meia?  Do you think I'm insecure about this?
2-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=stretching,<i>Oh, no.  I might have to show off my beautiful naked body.  Woe is me</i>.
2-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=seductive,I'm not worried at all, Leader.  With you by my side, I can handle <i>anything</i>.
2-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:7-99=interested,Yeah, can't ever count out Earth people.  We've dealt with enough of your Harvest ships to know <i>that</i>.
2-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:7-99=bored,Way to stick it to me with these elaborate outfits.  Is this some kind of statement against skimpiness?
2-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:7-99=teasing,What have I learned about Earth women today?  They're overdressed prudes.
2-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:7-99=frustrated,Jeez, I'm <i>still</i> losing.  You all should have dropped the pretenses and come in overcoats.
2-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:0-0=stretching,What would Meia think of me, being tossed around like this?  Well, she's never had a high opinion of me.
2-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:0-0=vain,I'm normally better than this...I swear.
2-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:0-0=teasing,I thought I was good at cards, too.  <i>Must be the stakes getting to me</i>.
2-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:0-0=stretching,Mejare frowns upon me.  But considering my line of work, it already did that.
2-must_strip_losing,hasHand:Two Pair=laughing,You must be pretty proud of yourself, beating me with a hand like this...too bad it won't afford you much.
2-must_strip_losing,hasHand:Two Pair=laughing,Wow, and I even had <i>two pair</i>.  I wonder what set of two I could take to match it?
2-must_strip_losing,hasHand:Two Pair=smug,I really thought that hand was going to take me somewhere, too...I'll have to even things out by not taking <i>this</i> anywhere.

2-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=vain,Just a little bad luck.  I'll bounce back...not that I really care if I do.

2-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=teasing,I'll get you sooner or later!  Maybe.
2-stripping=losing-sleeves,Thought my sleeves were part of the dress?  Nope!
2-stripping=losing-sleeves,Detachable sleeves!  Joke's on you!
2-stripping=losing-sleeves,My arms will look so bare without these.  <i>Scandalous</i>!
2-stripping=losing-sleeves,Another ridiculously fashionable item pried from my body.
2-stripping=losing-sleeves,My sleeves will suffice, don't you agree?  Surely you want to see my bare arms.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=losing-sleeves,Besides...I've got a few tricks left up my sleeve!  One of which is the sleeve itself.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=losing-sleeves,Don't you know your own second-in-command?  I'm no one-trick bimbo!
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=losing-sleeves,Have a little faith in me, Meia.  It's not like I've ever gotten someone killed on a mission.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=losing-sleeves,Hey, I'm here to relax, and you should be, too.  Leave the intensity for when the Harvest tries to kill us again.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=losing-sleeves,Some of us aren't total neurotics about our own beauty, boss.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=losing-sleeves,What's this?  My sleeves are next to go!  <i>Scandalous</i>!
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=losing-sleeves,Thought my sleeves were part of the dress?  ...Well, Meia did, apparently.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=losing-sleeves,<i>All the more fashion I can display!  What other small things can I scrounge up</i>?
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=losing-sleeves,What's this?  My sleeves were separate?  Oh well, tough luck, everyone!
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=losing-sleeves,So does everyone.  That's what makes them so great for this game!
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=losing-sleeves,Why do you think I wear them?  Well, mostly for fashion, but also to rip right off if some hulking soldier thinks she's clever and tries to grab me by them.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=losing-sleeves,So do I, sometimes.  That's how good they are at fooling people!
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=losing-sleeves,What, are you concerned about my modesty?  Because I'm not...but I <i>do</i> enjoy teasing people with these.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=losing-sleeves,One of my favorite tricks, Missy!  Now if you can guess how my sleeves stay on, I might be impressed.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit=losing-sleeves,The secrets of Mejarian fashion, Pit!  It's not for the male mind to comprehend!
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit=losing-sleeves,Let's just say it's a little tight around my elbows.  But the look is <i>so</i> worth it!
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit=losing-sleeves,Come now, Mr. Angel.  I can't give away <i>all</i> my secrets, can I?
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit=losing-sleeves,Good question.  Maybe I'll tell you if you can manage to get them off me.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit=losing-sleeves,That's for me to know and you to never find out, unless this table decides to get its act together.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit=losing-sleeves,Who knows, Pit?  Maybe you'll find out next hand!  Could my dress be next?
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=losing-sleeves,No fun as usual.  If you won't tell me, I'll just decide for myself and spread a rumor about it.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=losing-sleeves,Talking to you about sex is like hacking away at a glacier.  <i>Bo-ring!</i>
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=losing-sleeves,Oh, for God's sake.  Just admit you like someone already!  It doesn't make you less of a leader.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=losing-sleeves,What, do you think we'll lose all respect for you if you admit your crush on Valore, or whomever?
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=losing-sleeves,Hey, I wore all this to have fun with the teasing.  This game means little to me.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=losing-sleeves,Isn't my outfit fascinating in its complexity?  I just wanted to show that off to our Earthling friends.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=losing-sleeves,Hey, I'm here to show off Mejarian fashion.  <i>I'm</i> a peaceful ambassador--you just want to dominate them.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=losing-sleeves,But it's so <i>exotic</i> the way my sleeves aren't part of the dress.  That's so much more interesting than our little card game, no?
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=losing-sleeves,You caught me--but all the same, you didn't respond.  How's it feel being nude?
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=losing-sleeves,Sharp as usual...but it seems you'd <i>also</i> prefer not to answer uncomfortable questions.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=losing-sleeves,True.  Well, if I can admit to that, can't you admit to enjoying stripping for strangers?
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=losing-sleeves,Damn.  Well, even still, are you <i>really</i> so indifferent about this whole nudity thing?
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=losing-sleeves,Oh, fine, whatever.  Ruin my fun if you must.  Guess this side of you comes out when you're losing.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=losing-sleeves,Never pegged you as a woman who'd spoil other people's fun just because she's having a bad day.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=losing-sleeves,Don't think guessing them will stop me.  You're just sour that I'm beating you.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=losing-sleeves,Guess you needed a little ego boost.  You know, since you can't beat me at poker, apparently.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=losing-sleeves,Ooh, good choice!  She'll do great...and I'll reward her hard work later.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=losing-sleeves,You're just jealous that I know how to pilot <i>and</i> have fun.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=losing-sleeves,Good choice.  Speaking of good choices, time for my delicate little sleeves to disappear.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=losing-sleeves,I'm long past the point where your little needling comments about my discipline bother me.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=losing-sleeves,Oh, but I'm serious!  Here, you can even take my sleeves!  I don't mind!
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=losing-sleeves,If you want to get <i>really</i> cozy, here!  My sleeves for all your clothing needs!
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=losing-sleeves,I know you like skimpy, but this is just indecent!  Here, take my sleeves.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=losing-sleeves,Don't be that way.  You're <i>dying</i> to cover up!  Well, my sleeves can do the trick there.


#losing choker
3-stripped=laughing,Heeheeheehee!
3-stripped=vain,Have you met Meia?  She might <i>look</i> more covered than me, but she doesn't wear all that much.  <i>Such a tease</i>!
3-stripped=vain,Dear, dear.  Maybe next time you'll finally get me out of this dress.
3-stripped=teasing,Keep trying, and maybe my dress is on the horizon.  You're closer than you think.
3-stripped=teasing,Oh, dear.  <i>How long can I keep this up</i>?
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=stretching,Your words hurt me, Meia.  Good thing you fire them so much, I'm starting to build up an immunity.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=teasing,Hey, come on, don't badmouth me in mixed company.  We've got to show solidarity as crewmates.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=smug,Well, as long as we're discussing character flaws, you're really bringing down the mood.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=smug,Would it kill you to lighten up for ten minutes and show our new Earth friends a smile?  Honestly.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=stretching,Well, if you're not going to accept my generous offers, then I just don't know what to say.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=smug,<i>Oh, Meia.</i>  You wouldn't accept help if you were bleeding to death.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=vain,Fine, then.  Guess they'll just have to go to waste.  <i>Shameful!</i>
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=smug,Honestly.  You try to do something nice, and this is what happens.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit=smug,I'm not dragging this out as much as you think, actually.  No need to jump to conclusions...or insult people you just met.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit=vain,Do you see any reason why that ego might be unfounded?  Because I've never entered a room without turning heads.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit=vain,Call me vain if you want, but it seems awfully justified to me.  Intelligent, talented, highly-ranked, and <i>beautiful</i>!
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit=vain,Your words hurt me, you nasty little thing, you.  Now I need to go back to my lovely ship and cry into my equally beautiful girlfriend's chest until it's all better.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,Hey, I heard that.  By all means, point out a flaw in my body--my girlfriend would beg to differ with every one of them.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit=laughing,Something wrong, honey?  Are my strips not stimulating enough for you?  Well, maybe you should win next time!
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=teasing,It's just that I have this little thing called a <i>beating heart.</i>  <i>You're</i> practically a robot.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=teasing,Well, those of us with blood in our veins tend to enjoy talking about sex and relationships.  Just a heads-up for your next contact with us.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=seductive,...You really need to let yourself fall in love.  You'd be so <i>cute</i> with a girlfriend!
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=laughing,Even as you masturbate before me, you still keep yourself guarded.  I guess you're really just a machine running the libido subroutine.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=smug,Only you could still stay dead serious when your breasts are bouncing and you're dripping wet.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=laughing,I swear, your libido works like normal, but it's not wired to your brain.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=interested,...You know, Meia, whenever I want to make myself laugh, I picture you having sex.  Just diving into introspection with every move your partner makes.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=vain,Oh, give me a break already.  Being naked is fun--I'm feeling a little jealous!
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=annoyed,Maybe I'd practice my leadership a little if you didn't, you know, hog all the glory for yourself.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=annoyed,Real brave of you to harp on me in mixed company.  You never even <i>let</i> me lead the squadron!
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=interested,Oh, I'm a bad leader, am I?  Just for that, I'm gonna beat you.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=annoyed,Oh, shut up.  You'd rather score points with the captain than let me gain any experience.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=smug,You probably know what's next, don't you?  Well, don't spoil the surprise.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=teasing,Now don't go telling everyone what's next.  I'm sure you've figured it out with that big brain of yours.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=teasing,Can you spot what I'm stripping after this?  It's more visible than you think.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=vain,<i>Oh, dear, dear</i>.  I'm running out of options...what's next, you think?
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=laughing,Hey, I'm standing right here.  <i>What kind of woman talks about another to total strangers like that</i>?
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=interested,Do you make these colorful comments about me when I'm <i>not</i> around?  Shame on you, Meia.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=laughing,Never took you for a <i>gossip</i>, Meia.  Well, I guess I'm right here to defend myself, but still.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=teasing,Yes, Meia's really this miserable all the time.  Just ignore her...or get her naked.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=laughing,Now I'm <i>really</i> going to enjoy knocking you down a peg.  I hope you like being naked as much as I do.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=stretching,Whatever you say, Meia.  Don't lose your nerve when it's time to get your breasts out.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=interested,You'd better not shrink away when it's time to get you out of that underwear.  Especially because it's coming up quickly.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=laughing,You're cockier than usual, Meia.  I think being in your underwear is finally melting your ice a little...better take off some more.
3-must_strip_winning=teasing,<i>Still winning, dearie</i>!
3-must_strip_winning=teasing,Still ahead, which is all I could ask for when I'm up against such intellectual titans.
3-must_strip_winning=vain,It's OK.  Cute girlfriend, loyal crewmates, beautiful ship--I'm used to winning.
3-must_strip_winning=smug,Forced to remove another accessory, when I still have a lead?  <i>The horror</i>!
3-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=smug,Hey, Meia, what do you think?  Is my dress coming off now?
3-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=vain,Does my brilliant leader know what I'm stripping next?  The dress, maybe?
3-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=teasing,Is this what they've all been waiting for, Meia?  Am I about to slip my dress off my delicate shoulders?
3-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=smug,Damn.  And here I thought I'd keep the dress on.  That's what's coming off, right, Meia?
3-must_strip_winning,hasHand:Two Pair=bored,Ouch.  Meia always tells me not to be overconfident...there's the proof.
3-must_strip_winning,hasHand:Two Pair=frustrated,Ugh, <i>really</i>?  If <i>two pair</i> isn't going to win a round, I don't even know what to believe anymore.
3-must_strip_winning,hasHand:Two Pair=annoyed,Oh, come <i>on</i>!  I had <i>two pair</i>...this is ridiculous.
3-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=angry,<i>Is it time for my dress</i>--<i>stop it, Meia</i>!
3-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=angry,<i>Could my dress be next</i>--damn it all!
3-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=annoyed,<i>My dress</i>--should've figured you'd spot it.
3-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=bored,<i>Oh, no!  Not my dress</i>...you know me too well, Meia.
3-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=interested,Got a piloting metaphor for everything, don't you?  Well, here's a hairpin turn for you.
3-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=vain,I'm perfectly on target, Leader.  As always.
3-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=smug,You and your piloting comparisons.  Can't you get a hobby?  Or a girlfriend?
3-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=teasing,You must think you're pretty clever with those piloting metaphors.  Well, you ought to be filled with <i>Dread</i>.
3-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=annoyed,Way to ruin the fun, Meia.  How could a <i>naked</i> woman be so boring?
3-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=annoyed,God, it's like you're <i>determined</i> to be a buzzkill.  Mission accomplished.
3-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=smug,I wouldn't expect you to understand the allure of teasing, considering that suit basically leaves you naked all the time.
3-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=interested,I was <i>thinking</i> of skipping straight to the dress, but now I'm going for the choker just to spite you.
3-must_strip_winning,timeInStage:0-0=teasing,You really <i>are</i> catching up to me.  Good thing I have more accessories!
3-must_strip_winning,timeInStage:0-0=teasing,<i>Still winning</i>!  And my dress is still safe.
3-must_strip_winning,timeInStage:0-0=teasing,You're really making me sweat here.  But I've still got more Mejarian fashion to show you!
3-must_strip_winning,timeInStage:0-0=smug,The heat of this thrilling game is just melting my lead away...what a shame.
3-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=teasing,<i>Hearing you loud and clear, boss.</i>  In fact, I've still got a few lines of defense!
3-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=stretching,You want me to win, huh?  Well, luckily I have some more little things to lose.
3-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=vain,As long as I'm aiming for the victory, better use every advantage I have.
3-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=smug,Well, if I'm going to be winning this, I better aim small with these clothes.
3-must_strip_winning,timeInStage:7-99=teasing,Nice job, everyone.  You might get me out of my dress yet!
3-must_strip_winning,timeInStage:7-99=interested,So did you all conspire to finally beat me there?
3-must_strip_winning,timeInStage:7-99=smug,I hope you're proud of yourselves, conspiring to finally put another dent in me.  Earthlings are nothing without their skullduggery.
3-must_strip_winning,timeInStage:7-99=teasing,I hope there's no foul play going on to break my streak.  As a pirate, I'm an expert on the subject.
3-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=interested,There I go again.  You know you can <i>stand up</i>, right, Meia?
3-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=interested,You know, Meia, there's <i>chairs</i> around.  Or you could stand.  Anything but just sitting there on the floor.
3-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=laughing,Feel free to, you know, <i>stand up</i>, boss.  It's a little embarrassing to see you plopped down like that.
3-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=laughing,It's nice to see your sensitive side, Leader, but really, you should stand up.
3-must_strip_normal=sad,Oh, no...could this do it?
3-must_strip_normal=sad,Already?  I'm not even <i>winning</i>...
3-must_strip_normal=bored,Damn.  As far as I'm concerned, if I'm not winning, I'm losing.
3-must_strip_normal=frustrated,Not winning, not losing.  There's nothing worse than mediocrity...
3-must_strip_normal,hasHand:Two Pair=bored,Ouch.  Meia always tells me not to be overconfident...there's the proof.
3-must_strip_normal,hasHand:Two Pair=frustrated,Ugh, <i>really</i>?  If <i>two pair</i> isn't going to win a round, I don't even know what to believe anymore.
3-must_strip_normal,hasHand:Two Pair=annoyed,Oh, come <i>on</i>!  I had <i>two pair</i>...this is ridiculous.
3-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:0-0=vain,Oh, sure.  Gang up on the poor alien woman!
3-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:0-0=teasing,I just wanted to learn about your fascinating Earth culture.  No need to bully me.
3-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:0-0=stretching,Right after my armbands...those really brought my outfit together, too.
3-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:0-0=vain,Back-to-back losses is no way to handle myself...<i>I'm so ashamed</i>.
3-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:7-99=laughing,You really want me out of this dress, don't you?  Well, not so fast, ladies.
3-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:7-99=stretching,What a run!  I was getting a little bored of schooling everyone, sure.
3-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:7-99=smug,Oh, good, I finally get to strip again.  You know, the <i>fun</i> part of this game.
3-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:7-99=smug,I was really hanging around, too.  Still am...but I prefer winning outright.
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=smug,Hey, Meia, what do you think?  Is my dress coming off now?
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=vain,Does my brilliant leader know what I'm stripping next?  The dress, maybe?
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=teasing,Is this what they've all been waiting for, Meia?  Am I about to slip my dress off my delicate shoulders?
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=smug,Damn.  And here I thought I'd keep the dress on.  That's what's coming off, right, Meia?
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=interested,Don't overanalyze my outfit and ruin the surprise for yourself.  Oh, who am I kidding--ruining things is your idea of fun.
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=teasing,I hope you don't think you're clever for figuring out what I've been going for.  Should've known what I'd do from the moment we walked in!
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=vain,I'm not finished yet, Leader.  You should be afraid of what your pilots are capable of!
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=vain,Maybe it's the cards that matter, but it's the clothes where all the fun lies.
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=interested,Got a piloting metaphor for everything, don't you?  Well, here's a hairpin turn for you.
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=vain,I'm perfectly on target, Leader.  As always.
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=smug,You and your piloting comparisons.  Can't you get a hobby?  Or a girlfriend?

3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=interested,There I go again.  You know you can <i>stand up</i>, right, Meia?
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=interested,You know, Meia, there's <i>chairs</i> around.  Or you could stand.  Anything but just sitting there on the floor.
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=laughing,Feel free to, you know, <i>stand up</i>, boss.  It's a little embarrassing to see you plopped down like that.
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=laughing,It's nice to see your sensitive side, Leader, but really, you should stand up.
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=interested,OK, so <i>maybe</i> I should be trying a little harder.  But you're still just lucky tonight.
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=vain,Can you blame me?  All the incentive in this game is to lose.
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=smug,This game rewards the losers, so, yeah, not exactly in a rush to dominate.
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=teasing,I'm not finished yet, boss.  And you don't exactly have much clothing to lose.
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=angry,<i>Is it time for my dress</i>--<i>stop it, Meia</i>!
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=angry,<i>Could my dress be next</i>--damn it all!
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=annoyed,<i>My dress</i>--should've figured you'd spot it.
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=bored,<i>Oh, no!  Not my dress</i>...you know me too well, Meia.
3-must_strip_losing=annoyed,This just sucks.  How can I have any fun if I'm wearing the <i>least</i>?
3-must_strip_losing=sad,Can't exactly tease when you're baring it all first.
3-must_strip_losing=angry,Oh, you're not being any fun!  How am I losing this much?
3-must_strip_losing=frustrated,Should have given Earthlings more credit.  I mean, they <i>did</i> build all that Harvest tech.
3-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:0-0=sad,This is just miserable.  But I guess I deserve it, with all the teasing I've been doing.
3-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:0-0=bored,Nope, can't count out Earth women at all.  Oh, well, another accessory down.
3-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:0-0=teasing,Feeling pretty insurmountable here.  But the crew of the Nirvana would never surrender to Earthlings!
3-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:0-0=frustrated,You're really tearing my cute outfit to shreds.  Can't you give me some time to show it off?
3-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:7-99=frustrated,Even now, you're all outplaying me.  I've got to get my act together before the Harvest has me for dinner.
3-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:7-99=bored,All that luck, and my teasing still rings hollow.  Not how I pictured the night going.
3-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:7-99=frustrated,I'm running out of options, and all that streak bought me was time.  Good thing this isn't life-or-death.
3-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:7-99=bored,I face death all the time and was hoping this game would take the edge off.  But no, even when I win I'm still losing.
3-must_strip_losing,hasHand:Two Pair=bored,Ouch.  Meia always tells me not to be overconfident...there's the proof.
3-must_strip_losing,hasHand:Two Pair=frustrated,Ugh, <i>really</i>?  If <i>two pair</i> isn't going to win a round, I don't even know what to believe anymore.

3-stripping=losing-choker,Good news, everyone--<i>I still have my choker!</i>
3-stripping=losing-choker,Lucky for you, I left some of my <i>extra</i> jewelry on the ship.
3-stripping=losing-choker,Be glad--this jewelry is all one piece.  No tricks!
3-stripping=losing-choker,<i>Not yet</i>, sweetie!  I still have my choker to lose.
3-stripping=losing-choker,Don't get too excited--my dress isn't coming off <i>yet!</i>
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=losing-choker,Case in point--my wonderful choker!  Isn't it <i>adorable?</i>
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=losing-choker,My choker ought to satisfy you nasty Earth people.  Serves you right for making my Leader masturbate like this!
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=losing-choker,Behold--my finest piece of jewelry!  It really brings the whole outfit together, no?
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=losing-choker,Hear that?  My boss wants me to win--so I think I'll be taking <i>this</i> off.  Good enough for you?
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=losing-choker,Suit yourself.  Hey, if you're feeling embarrassed, you cover yourself up with my choker!
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=losing-choker,Hm.  Want my jewelry?  It'll cover you up, and it might even make you look fashionable for once.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=losing-choker,You can wear my choker if you want.  Then you won't be so indecent as you sit there.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=losing-choker,I see.  Hey, you can wear <i>this</i>, if you want.  Naked with a necklace is certainly a Mejarian sort of look!
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=losing-choker,Anyway, you're almost to the good stuff, everyone.  <i>Keep up the effort!</i>
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=losing-choker,Who knows?  Is my dress next?  <i>That'd</i> be a whole lot of fun.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=losing-choker,Now I can breathe easy--but I bet the rest of you are getting tensed up to the thought of this dress sliding off.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=losing-choker,You should know I don't wear a bra under this thing--you can probably tell, actually.  <i>But will I be proving that anytime soon?</i>
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=losing-choker,What, you don't like my choker, Mr. Angel?  I think it's lovely--so troublesome to be without!
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=losing-choker,Hey, my look is woefully incomplete without this lovely piece of jewelry!  Figures a man would just moan about how uninteresting my clothing is.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=losing-choker,<i>Patience</i>, my horny little darling.  Now you can see my gorgeous collarbones--isn't <i>that</i> surprising?
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=losing-choker,If you want surprises, Mr. Angel, stay tuned...well, my beauty is no secret, but still.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=losing-choker,Oh, stop bellyaching, Angel-boy.  Can't you tell I'm running short on these tiny things?
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=losing-choker,My jewelry wasn't casually selected, you know!  It's a choice as worthy as any other, so I don't appreciate the hostility.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:6-7=losing-choker,What, you don't like my choker, Mr. Angel?  Can't you be captivated by something <i>intellectual</i> for once?
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:6-7=losing-choker,Hey, my look is woefully incomplete without this!  I guess when men carry around a ridiculous dangling tube wherever they go, good composition is lost on them.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:6-7=losing-choker,<i>Patience</i>, my horny little darling.  Shouldn't a good view of my collarbones give your tube something to stand up over?
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:6-7=losing-choker,Men are so cute when they think they're clever for figuring out the obvious.  Only took you four tries to realize I've been teasing.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:6-7=losing-choker,Oh, stop bellyaching, Angel-boy.  My dress is almost off, and I'm sure your tube will have a fit when it happens.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:6-7=losing-choker,My, so much <i>hostility</i>.  Is this what happens to men when their libidos take over their brains?
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=losing-choker,What are you talking about, boss?  <i>I'm just following the rules</i>.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=losing-choker,So petty and vindictive.  I'm just playing smart, like you always tell me to.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=losing-choker,You're just jealous I had the forethought to wear all this.  <i>Meia Gisborn, outprepared by her subordinate</i>!
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=losing-choker,It's not <i>my</i> fault you came into this battle unprepared.  But I'll still support my crewmate!
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=losing-choker,Sorry, but I simply <i>refuse</i> to let you ruin this for me, even if you predict my entire outfit.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=losing-choker,You can guess my plans all you want, but I'm still sticking to them.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=losing-choker,Well, guess what?  Spotting my choker doesn't magically make it not count.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=losing-choker,You must think you're pretty clever.  Well, you are...but I'm not finished yet.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=losing-choker,What's next, Miss Oracle?  Going to predict my menstrual cycles?
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=losing-choker,That's right!  <i>You're so smart, Leader</i>.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=losing-choker,Astute as always!  It's important for our squadron leader to have eagle-eyes.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=losing-choker,You know me way too well, boss.  <i>It's so flattering</i>!
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=losing-choker,There's no slipping anything past you.  You always sniff out the surprise birthday parties we plan, too.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=losing-choker,<i>Whoops</i>!  Looks like I forgot all about my choker!  Sorry, Meia, no nudity just yet!
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=losing-choker,I know how badly you want to see your crewmate in all her glory, but my wonderful jewelry has to go first.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=losing-choker,Sorry about this, but topless with jewelry on would just look silly.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=losing-choker,And you say I have no situational awareness.  Sorry, I've been mindful of my choker the whole time!
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=losing-choker,You're totally inside my head.  Guess that's why you're winning.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=losing-choker,I'm sure you're having just as much fun, fully clothed and stock-still.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=losing-choker,Feel free to, you know, enjoy yourself.  Throw a hand, trust me.  You'll love it.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=losing-choker,If you actually want some thrills tonight, ease up on the gas a little and strip with me.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=losing-choker,Is that really all I have?  <i>You'll have to beat me again to find out</i>!
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=losing-choker,Meia's two steps ahead of me, it seems.  Or maybe a few layers?
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=losing-choker,Am I really out of small things now?  All the same, not naked yet!


#losing dress
4-stripped=teasing,<i>Too bad!</i>
4-stripped=teasing,Just <i>when</i> will my dress come off?
4-stripped=vain,Will I <i>ever</i> be nude?  Play your cards right to see.
4-stripped=seductive,Is it just me, or am I running thin on accessories?
4-stripped=teasing,Did you know?  Vandread-Jura can shield a <i>whole planet</i>.  So I have experience covering up.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=seductive,What, are you feeling all self-conscious?  You're a steal--or you <i>would</i> be, if you smiled more.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=teasing,I appreciate the praise, but don't put yourself down.  It's not too late to get yourself a girlfriend, Leader!
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=smug,Oh, stop buttering me up.  I mean, I <i>deserve</i> it, but you're just going to convince yourself you can't find anyone.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=vain,Now, now, Meia.  You can admire my perfection, but don't go comparing yourself to me.  There's a woman out there for you!
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=smug,Leave it to Meia Gisborn to coach me through a poker game as she masturbates on the floor.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=laughing,Lots of advice you're giving me, Leader.  Don't you have an orgasm to reach this evening?
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=interested,Can't you focus on, you know, <i>masturbating?</i>  I can handle this.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=laughing,What's with the coaching, Meia?  I swear, your mind will do <i>anything</i> to avoid sex.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=teasing,Don't be so sure.  Mejarians tease, but we <i>always</i> deliver...if you can make us.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=teasing,It's not my job to give you a satisfying conclusion, Pit...you've got to make that happen yourself.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=smug,My, so <i>impatient</i>.  I guess when all the blood is in a funny-looking tube and not your brain, you can't appreciate a good tease before the fun.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=vain,Careful not to extrapolate too far from just a few data points, Pit.  ...Did you like that line?  Parfet says stuff like that, that egghead.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=teasing,You think I can't follow the rules if it gets to that point?  By all means, honey, force me to show off my body...I'm not ashamed.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:6-7=seductive,<i>Does poor little Angel-boy want to see my breasts that badly</i>?  <i>Adorable</i>.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:6-7=laughing,Doesn't matter much to <i>you</i>, I'm afraid.  Just keep playing around with that tube and try to teach me something.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:6-7=teasing,I mean, you <i>did</i> lose to me without even getting my dress off.  I think I'll tease you as long as I please...better hope someone else finishes the job.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:6-7=laughing,I think it's perfectly appropriate to tease a sad little boy playing with his tube on the floor.  <i>What more does he deserve</i>?
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:6-7=seductive,I'm just having some fun, sweetie.  <i>Keep playing with your little friend on the floor while I finish things up here, OK</i>?
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=teasing,It's called <i>style</i>, Meia.  You know, the thing you have when you pilot, for all your talk of efficiency.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=interested,Would you like me to go over <i>your</i> outfit?  You're not exactly the paragon of modesty.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=vain,I can't wear a bodysuit like yours, Meia.  Women <i>already</i> stop working to stare at me when I enter a room.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=interested,Don't stand there with your butt fully on display in that suit and ask me why I dress the way I do.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=vain,People love my body so much, I have to wear accessories so they notice I'm fashionable, too.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=teasing,As long as you're wearing that suit, you can't convince me you don't like feeling sexy.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=interested,Oh, please.  I dress this way for attention, same as you...don't tell me you don't like the hungry stares of our lower pilots.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1,marker:underwear=teasing,Better hope I get some good hands...<i>I'm not wearing underwear</i>.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1,marker:underwear=vain,I'm afraid there may be nothing covering me beneath this dress.  <i>I'm such a lecherous nymph</i>.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1,marker:underwear=teasing,Am I wearing any underwear beneath this dress?  Beat me again and find out, but it doesn't look likely!
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1,marker:underwear=teasing,Want to know how perverted I can be?  I'm not <i>entirely</i> sure I'm wearing any panties.  This dress is all I have!
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=laughing,Aww, you're too sweet.  Maybe I'll go overboard and beat you altogether.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=teasing,Watch what you say, Meia.  I might just up and beat you!
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=interested,Promise me you won't get all mad at me when you lose, then.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=vain,I've got a ways to go, so you'd better be singing that same tune right up to you losing.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=teasing,All the same, I'd not naked yet!  Keep trying, though.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=vain,<i>Who knows what hard work and a little luck could get you</i>?  Keep on playing your cards right, folks.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=vain,I can't help but attach beautiful things to myself, Meia.  My body makes <i>any</i> fashion item that much better--such as this dress.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=laughing,Now I can breathe easy, but everyone else is even <i>more</i> on edge.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=interested,Don't mess with me.  I see you smirking, Meia...you're pleased with yourself.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=smug,Your half-smiles betray you, Meia.  So much for stoicism.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=teasing,At least you're finally having a little fun.  Just wait until you're naked!
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=vain,Well, judging by your smirk, you're finally having fun.  So <i>I'm</i> satisfied for tonight.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=laughing,<i>Ohhhh, I get it now.</i>  You don't want to stand up and show everyone how soaked you are!
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=laughing,Teehee!  I just spotted how drenched your thighs are.  <i>That's</i> why you don't want to stand!
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=laughing,There's no use lying, Meia.  I see it now--you don't want to stand because you made yourself all wet!
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=laughing,You little skank.  I just noticed all that juice on your thighs--you're hiding it by sitting!
4-must_strip_winning=seductive,I'm winning, but <i>you're</i> about to be the real winners.
4-must_strip_winning=laughing,Considering the established dress code, sure, I'll take off the dress.
4-must_strip_winning=interested,Do you feel accomplished?  Because you're still losing.
4-must_strip_winning=laughing,<i>Remember who's winning the game</i>!  That's my Meia impression.  Any good?
4-must_strip_winning,hasHand:Two Pair=annoyed,<i>Two pair</i>!  I had <i>two pair</i>, and I lost...well, you've earned this, that's for sure.
4-must_strip_winning,hasHand:Two Pair=vain,Even <i>two pair</i> couldn't save my dress...it would seem fate has smiled upon all of you.
4-must_strip_winning,hasHand:Two Pair=smug,There's only one thing I was prouder of than that hand--good thing it happens to be my body.
4-must_strip_winning,hasHand:Two Pair=vain,Even with <i>two pair</i>, I lost...guess I've got to show you my <i>one pair</i> now.
4-must_strip_winning,timeInStage:0-0=stretching,My lead has dissolved in a hurry...and now, so will my outfit.
4-must_strip_winning,timeInStage:0-0=vain,It's all just coming undone...my outfit, that is.
4-must_strip_winning,timeInStage:0-0=awkward,You know when the enemy's in your sights, and then they just vanish?  Probably not, but...yeah.
4-must_strip_winning,timeInStage:0-0=thinking,So much for my lead.  Did I get too complacent with all those accessories?
4-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=smug,Hate to say it, but you're right.  Here comes the climax of the evening.
4-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=interested,Yeah, yeah, I'm out of the small stuff.  Don't think I'm afraid to strip the big.
4-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=vain,Just having a little fun with everyone.  Now it's your turn to have fun with me.
4-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=smug,Sharp as a tack, Leader.  Time for things to get much more interesting around here.
4-must_strip_winning,timeInStage:7-99=teasing,I'm still winning after that, too.  I've really made you earn this!
4-must_strip_winning,timeInStage:7-99=teasing,The time has come at last.  Just remember--<i>I'm still winning</i>!
4-must_strip_winning,timeInStage:7-99=stretching,Well, I've still got a lead.  But after this next strip, I really couldn't care less about it.
4-must_strip_winning,timeInStage:7-99=vain,Still winning, and that was quite a streak.  Luckily, this next strip will make you feel better about your situation!
4-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=vain,Oh, dear.  Time for the dress...guess I have a confession to make.
4-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=seductive,Finally, the dress comes off...I'm sorry, Meia, but I lied to you.
4-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=teasing,Time to lose the dress...<i>and</i> come clean to you, Meia.
4-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=seductive,Well, Leader, it's dress time.  You deserve to know what I've been keeping from you.
4-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=vain,Dear, dear.  Well, Meia, guess it's time I owned up to my lies.
4-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=laughing,I suppose now's a good time to mention I haven't been honest with you, Meia.
4-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=smug,I've got some bad news, Leader...and it's not another accessory.
4-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=laughing,Sorry, Meia...I've been keeping things from you.  Can you forgive me?
4-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=stretching,So sorry, Meia, but I have a terrible confession to make...
4-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=seductive,Sorry to tell you this as you masturbate, Meia, but I can't wait any longer...
4-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=laughing,Meia, I have some bad news...and I understand it's coming at a bad time.
4-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=vain,<i>Oh, dear.  The dress is off, and I have to break the bad news to my Leader.</i>
4-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=teasing,So which cutie was running through your thoughts back there?  Valore?  Misty?  You can tell me.
4-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=laughing,Don't tell me you masturbated back there to Barnette or Dita or anyone else that could cause some issues.
4-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=teasing,I know the thought of <i>someone</i> on the ship had to get you to cum like that.  Which one was it?  I'm just going to keep guessing.
4-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=vain,If you're wondering why I lost, it's because I'm so distracted by the idea of Meia thinking of someone as she masturbates.  Who <i>was</i> it?
4-must_strip_normal=stretching,Looks like I finally have to answer to all this teasing I've been doing.
4-must_strip_normal=seductive,Guess staying clothed just wasn't in the cards for me.
4-must_strip_normal=laughing,Don't worry, no more accessories.  I'm not <i>that</i> cruel.
4-must_strip_normal=bored,So much for all my showiness.  Now I've got to put my money where my mouth is.
4-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=vain,Oh, dear.  Time for the dress...guess I have a confession to make.
4-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=seductive,Finally, the dress comes off...I'm sorry, Meia, but I lied to you.
4-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=teasing,Time to lose the dress...<i>and</i> come clean to you, Meia.
4-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=seductive,Well, Leader, it's dress time.  You deserve to know what I've been keeping from you.
4-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:0-0=sad,Aww.  I love this dress...and to lose it so quickly is terrible.
4-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:0-0=bored,Yeah, this is definitely my comeuppance.
4-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:0-0=bored,So much for teasing you.  That was my last line of defense, so to speak.
4-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:0-0=stretching,Is there any rum in this place?  Puts me right to sleep, which I need after this performance.
4-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=laughing,...Yeah, I guess I really <i>did</i> blow it, huh?
4-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=stretching,At least these Earth people aren't with the Harvest.  I hope.
4-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=seductive,Aww.  Well, if any Harvest cubes show up for my organs, you'll protect me, right, Leader?
4-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=seductive,Well, the time has finally arrived.  You'll keep me safe if these Earthlings try anything, right, Leader?
4-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=interested,You've seen through me the whole time, Meia.  Luckily, losing my dress should make that a lot easier.
4-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=vain,I was feeling a little bare without all my accessories.  Might as well go all the way on <i>that</i> front.
4-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=vain,Oh, good.  An incomplete outfit is scarcely better than just being naked.
4-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=teasing,Well, I'm all out of accessories.  You know what that means--grab some tissues.
4-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=stretching,Well, Meia?  Is my dress coming off <i>now</i>?
4-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=vain,Surely my Leader has me all figured out.  Is it finally time for the dress?
4-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=teasing,My dress just <i>has</i> to come off this time, right?  Meia, what's the verdict?
4-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=vain,I bet you've figured out my whole outfit, Meia.  My dress is next, isn't that right?
4-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=teasing,So which cutie was running through your thoughts back there?  Valore?  Misty?  You can tell me.
4-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=laughing,Don't tell me you masturbated back there to Barnette or Dita or anyone else that could cause some issues.
4-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=teasing,I know the thought of <i>someone</i> on the ship had to get you to cum like that.  Which one was it?  I'm just going to keep guessing.
4-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=vain,If you're wondering why I lost, it's because I'm so distracted by the idea of Meia thinking of someone as she masturbates.  Who <i>was</i> it?
4-must_strip_normal,hasHand:Two Pair=annoyed,<i>Two pair</i>!  I had <i>two pair</i>, and I lost...well, you've earned this, that's for sure.
4-must_strip_normal,hasHand:Two Pair=vain,Even <i>two pair</i> couldn't save my dress...it would seem fate has smiled upon all of you.
4-must_strip_normal,hasHand:Two Pair=smug,There's only one thing I was prouder of than that hand--good thing it happens to be my body.
4-must_strip_normal,hasHand:Two Pair=vain,Even with <i>two pair</i>, I lost...guess I've got to show you my <i>one pair</i> now.
4-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:7-99=teasing,<i>That</i> certainly took a while.  But it comes with a great reward!
4-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:7-99=vain,I staved it off as best I could...but fate demands I bare it all.
4-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:7-99=teasing,I tried my best to beat you back, but it seems you'll be seeing the goods tonight.  Congratulations.
4-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:7-99=smug,And I was trying so hard to keep this on.  Poor Barnette, alone on the ship while strange Earthlings ogle her girlfriend's body.
4-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=stretching,So sorry, Meia, but I have a terrible confession to make...
4-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=seductive,Sorry to tell you this as you masturbate, Meia, but I can't wait any longer...
4-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=laughing,Meia, I have some bad news...and I understand it's coming at a bad time.
4-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=vain,<i>Oh, dear.  The dress is off, and I have to break the bad news to my Leader.</i>

4-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=laughing,Sorry, Meia...I've been keeping things from you.  Can you forgive me?
4-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=smug,Hate to say it, but you're right.  Here comes the climax of the evening.
4-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=interested,Yeah, yeah, I'm out of the small stuff.  Don't think I'm afraid to strip the big.
4-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=vain,Just having a little fun with everyone.  Now it's your turn to have fun with me.
4-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=smug,Sharp as a tack, Leader.  Time for things to get much more interesting around here.
4-must_strip_losing=sad,This whole "teasing" thing really didn't work out.
4-must_strip_losing=bored,Guess I should learn how to play cards before I start teasing a whole table of strip poker.
4-must_strip_losing=bored,I shame all the women of Mejare with this performance.  Good thing Mejare doesn't deserve better than that.
4-must_strip_losing=frustrated,You know, Mejare's government routinely shuts down living districts.  That's what this feels like.
4-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=interested,You've seen through me the whole time, Meia.  Luckily, losing my dress should make that a lot easier.
4-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=vain,I was feeling a little bare without all my accessories.  Might as well go all the way on <i>that</i> front.

4-must_strip_losing,hasHand:Two Pair=annoyed,<i>Two pair</i>!  I had <i>two pair</i>, and I lost...well, you've earned this, that's for sure.
4-must_strip_losing,hasHand:Two Pair=vain,Even <i>two pair</i> couldn't save my dress...it would seem fate has smiled upon all of you.
4-must_strip_losing,hasHand:Two Pair=smug,There's only one thing I was prouder of than that hand--good thing it happens to be my body.
4-must_strip_losing,hasHand:Two Pair=vain,Even with <i>two pair</i>, I lost...guess I've got to show you my <i>one pair</i> now.
4-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:7-99=seductive,I staved you off, but you're determined to see my nude body...and keep me at a disadvantage, too.
4-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:7-99=stretching,Oh, darn.  I've gone and lost my lucky streak, and now I've got to show the goods.
4-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:7-99=smug,Must you end my comeback like this?  And worse, expose me altogether?  You Earth people are so cruel.
4-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:7-99=laughing,Even after that, I couldn't claw my way back.  And for Barnette's sake, I hope you keep your claws to yourself after this.
4-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:0-0=sad,Must you play so viciously?  I really like my outfit...
4-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:0-0=bored,I really wanted to show off my fashion sense, but you've driven a dagger into that plan.
4-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:0-0=frustrated,Well, there goes the whole thing.  I need a drink.
4-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:0-0=frustrated,Meia says I'm smart, but that I don't apply myself.  Sucks to prove her right.
4-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:0-0=frustrated,I can't just go out like this, can I?  How sad.
4-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=laughing,...Yeah, I guess I really <i>did</i> blow it, huh?
4-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=stretching,At least these Earth people aren't with the Harvest.  I hope.
4-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=seductive,Aww.  Well, if any Harvest cubes show up for my organs, you'll protect me, right, Leader?
4-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=seductive,Well, the time has finally arrived.  You'll keep me safe if these Earthlings try anything, right, Leader?
4-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=stretching,So sorry, Meia, but I have a terrible confession to make...
4-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=seductive,Sorry to tell you this as you masturbate, Meia, but I can't wait any longer...
4-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=laughing,Meia, I have some bad news...and I understand it's coming at a bad time.
4-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=vain,<i>Oh, dear.  The dress is off, and I have to break the bad news to my Leader.</i>
4-stripping=losing-dress,The moment you've all been waiting for.  What's a tease without any payoff?
4-stripping=losing-dress,It seems I've finally run out of trinkets.  Lucky you.
4-stripping=losing-dress,I think I've teased you long enough.  Anyone disagree?
4-stripping=losing-dress,Meia ought to be around here somewhere.  Sometimes I flash her in the showers just to see the look on her face.
4-stripping=losing-dress,No accessories here.  The <i>whole</i> dress.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=losing-dress,<i>I invited all the men here, too.  They're going to see us naked!</i>
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=losing-dress,Take a look around.  I invited the men here--they're finding this all very fascinating!
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=losing-dress,The men seem to have been invited here, too.  They're a few tables over...right behind you.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=losing-dress,I brought the men here, too.  They've been ogling us the whole time...and now they're seeing you masturbate!
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=losing-dress,I let Paiway sneak in here.  She's got her camera, and she's not afraid to use it!
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=losing-dress,Paiway's lurking about, looking for some dirt on us.  And it seems she's found it!
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=losing-dress,Paiway's been skulking around this place with her camera.  Now our shameless nudity will be immortalized for the crew!
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=losing-dress,I invited Paiway here--her camera must be going crazy with all this juicy gossip fuel!
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1,saidMarker:underwear=losing-dress,Ehehe...well, <i>about that</i>...
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1,saidMarker:underwear=losing-dress,Well, surely you can understand the fun of a harmless little lie...
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1,saidMarker:underwear=losing-dress,Hate to break it to you--well, to everyone else, but...
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1,saidMarker:underwear=losing-dress,I'm not above a little teasing, as you know...so, uh, well.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1,saidMarker:underwear=losing-dress,...Well, I didn't actually think I'd have to prove whether I did or not.  Guess that's poor tactics on my end.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=losing-dress,I take every opportunity possible to put my image out there.  So Barnette's been in the corner filming this.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=losing-dress,Barnette's actually been here to whole time.  She's filming my big moment, but it seems she captured yours instead.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=losing-dress,Barnette's filming this game!  She's been hiding away in the corner!
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=losing-dress,I got Barnette to come and film us here so I my beauty could be immortalized.  But there you went, getting all topless for her.
4-stripping,totalExposed:1-4,priority:0=losing-dress,Well, you know...hardly the first to do this.  But I'll certainly be the best!
4-stripping,totalExposed:1-4,priority:0=losing-dress,Sorry to stand here and make the previous reveals look like removing a hairclip, but I can't help being so beautiful.
4-stripping,totalExposed:1-4,priority:0=losing-dress,We've had our exposures already, but now...<i>feast your eyes on Mejarian genetic engineering</i>.
4-stripping,totalExposed:1-4,priority:0=losing-dress,Since you all so kindly set the precedent, time to break out the big girls.  Two of them, to be precise.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,priority:142,count-meia:1=losing-dress,There's nothing you could observe about me that my dear leader doesn't already know.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,priority:142,count-meia:1=losing-dress,Meia knows a lot more about me than <i>you</i> do, sweetie.  Pirates don't exactly get much privacy.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,priority:142,count-meia:1=losing-dress,I'd say not to spoil the fun, but Meia and I have been around <i>this</i> corner too many times to count.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,priority:142,count-meia:1=losing-dress,I'd be awful disappointed if Meia actually got flustered by my nudity. She's got to keep her head on straight out there, after all.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,priority:142,count-meia:1=losing-dress,I've demonstrated that plenty of times just to get under her skin, Elizabeth.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1,notSaidMarker:underwear=losing-dress,Hey, it's not easy being this beautiful, Meia.  ...OK, yes it is.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1,notSaidMarker:underwear=losing-dress,I'm always telling you--stop comparing yourself to me, and you'll be happier.  There's beautiful, and then there's <i>Jura Basil Elden</i>.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1,notSaidMarker:underwear=losing-dress,You know why you're so miserable about your body, Meia?  You keep comparing yourself to me, as if that's not apples and oranges.  You've got plenty of admirers!
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1,notSaidMarker:underwear=losing-dress,Oh, don't be all doom-and-gloom about your body.  You're still trapped in that bulky armor, and you're expecting <i>compliments</i>?
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1,notSaidMarker:underwear=losing-dress,Don't worry so much about <i>me</i>, Meia.  I'm already taken...you should really try to snap up Valore before her eye wanders.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit=losing-dress,Are you ready, Pit?  I know you've been <i>dying</i> to see this, even more than the rest of you...
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit=losing-dress,I bet your tube has been just <i>aching</i> for my breasts, hasn't it, Mr. Angel?  Well, here you go...it's time.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit=losing-dress,I can't keep the audience waiting forever, Pit.  Eventually you have to show off the prize.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit=losing-dress,Oh no, you've earned it this time.  I didn't bring any more trinkets...lucky you, Mr. Angel.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit=losing-dress,My, my.  Aren't <i>we</i> cynical?  Have a little faith in your fellow humans...
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit=losing-dress,Watch close, Mr. Angel.  I know I've been disappointing you lately, so it's time I made it up to you.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=losing-dress,<i>Anything</i>?  Don't make assumptions, Lizzie...
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=losing-dress,Don't spoil the surprise, Elizabeth.  Then again, it really just comes down to how you define <i>anything</i>...
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=losing-dress,Well, I don't have <i>much</i>, that's for certain.  See for yourself, Elizabeth...
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=losing-dress,Does that shock you, Elizabeth?  I enjoy this dress too much to layer beneath it.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=losing-dress,I mean, everyone could tell that just from the way it hugs my hips.  <i>God, I love this dress</i>!
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=losing-dress,Can't you see how much of me it displays already?  Of course not.  Why do you think I teased you so much?
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=losing-dress,Don't listen to Meia moan over there.  We're all having fun, right?
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=losing-dress,I swear, Meia never whines this much.  Well, maybe when one of us botches a mission.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=losing-dress,You're even more miserable than usual today.  You haven't even had to strip yet.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=losing-dress,I, for one, am I having a great time.  Guess it's up to the rest of you to get Meia naked.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=losing-dress,Such a thrilling moment for all of us.  Except Meia over there, who's just getting wet to the thought of piloting formations.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=losing-dress,You have no faith in me.  No tricks left, just the goods.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=losing-dress,I'm all done teasing...it's no fun teasing without a payoff at the end.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=losing-dress,Don't you know me well enough to trust that I wouldn't leave our hosts dissatisfied?
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=losing-dress,Hey, I made them earn it, but I aim to please.  You've got some space between you and nudity, meanwhile.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=losing-dress,Oh, but I've simply <i>got</i> to know.  This is too juicy to go unsqueezed!
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=losing-dress,I just want a name, Meia.  I'll fill in the details with my own imagination.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=losing-dress,Can't you give me <i>anything</i> to go off of?  Wait, I think I've got it...
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=losing-dress,Hey, I'm not asking you to marry them!  I just want to know your type...
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=losing-dress,Think I'll be able to drop this thing in one motion, like you with your bodysuit?
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=losing-dress,The payoff is just as fun as the tease.  You slipped off your bodysuit in one go--you know what I'm talking about.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=losing-dress,Don't act like you don't relish the feeling, Meia.  The way you zipped that suit down all at once looked awful rehearsed.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=losing-dress,I wonder if little old me will be able to live up to my Leader, the way she just zipped her whole suit off in one go.


#lost all clothing
5-stripped=vain,What do you think?  <i>Magnificent</i>, I know.
5-stripped=vain,Shame about Mejare's government.  I'd be a famous model if not for this pirating business.
5-stripped=vain,It's OK to stare.  I see them every day, and <i>still</i> I'm overcome by their beauty.
5-stripped=vain,I think you'll agree Barnette is the luckiest woman alive, having me all to herself!
5-stripped=vain,Gorgeous, buxom, <i>and</i> a skilled pilot.  What <i>don't</i> I have?
5-stripped=seductive-2,Oh me, oh my.  <i>Don't stare at my beautiful body</i>!
5-stripped=vain,Big enough to be a wonderful Fama to Barnette's children.
5-stripped=vain,Aren't they just <i>spectacular</i>?  You don't need to say anything--I know you agree.
5-stripped=vain,Big and healthy.  Barnette's daughters will have to get their milk <i>somehow</i>, you know.
5-stripped=teasing,You'd better believe my Barnette's babies are going to get all their nutrients.
5-stripped,marker:butt=butt,You know what?  I'm not letting you see my breasts just yet!  Enjoy this instead, you <i>perverts</i>.
5-stripped,marker:butt=butt,<i>Not yet, dear</i>!  My breasts come last this evening.  First, my butt...and my hair alongside it.
5-stripped,marker:butt=butt,Perhaps you haven't earned a view of my breasts after all.  You should respect for my <i>rear</i> first.
5-stripped,marker:butt=butt,Ready for the grand reveal?  Just a moment, now...while you wait, enjoy my <i>backside</i>.
5-stripped,marker:butt=butt,My butt <i>never</i> gets any attention.  We Mejarians are so obsessed with breasts...
5-stripped,marker:butt=butt,Mejare has a bit of a <i>breast</i> fetish, what with the need to select Famas and all.  My poor butt doesn't get any love.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=vain,It's possible to lose and still have fun, Meia.  Try it sometime.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=stretching,Aren't they <i>gorgeous</i>?  I know, I know, no need to tell me.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=vain,Meia's just jealous because she's lived around me too long.  She thinks I'm someone ordinary women can measure up to...
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=vain,So big and healthy...like all of me, really.  Good thing I have the height to keep these shapely.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=vain,I hope you're all enjoying this sight more than my boss's commentary about how you shouldn't.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0,marker:butt=butt,Oh, just ignore Miss Sourpuss.  She'd be having a lot more fun if she were naked, believe me.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=laughing,<i>Oh my gosh</i>, it's <i>Hibiki</i>, isn't it?  You've developed a taste for man-tubes, you naughty little thing!
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=laughing,A-ha!  It's <i>Hibiki!</i>  It must be--<i>that's</i> why you're so embarrassed!
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=laughing,I think I get it.  <i>You've got a crush on Hibiki, don't you?</i>
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=laughing,Oooh, it all makes sense now!  You want to "combine" your parts with Hibiki's, don't you?  Never took you for a man-lover.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=laughing,You've got a crush on <i>Hibiki</i>, don't you?  Dita's gonna put your head on a pike for even thinking about it!
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit,priority:140,count-meia:1=vain,Ah, there we are.  Everything you hoped for, right?  <i>I</i> think so.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit,priority:140,count-meia:1=seductive,You don't have to apologize, sweetheart.  I'm glad to show off Mejarian beauty to naive little Earth boys!
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit,priority:140,count-meia:1=seductive-2,I don't think I'll accept your apology.  <i>Maybe I'll just cover them up, since you thought I'd never show them</i>!
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit,priority:140,count-meia:1=seductive,You're such a young little thing, Pit.  Have you ever seen a woman's breasts before?  How early do they start pairing you up with girls where you're from?
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit,priority:140,count-meia:1=teasing,Come now, I wouldn't lie to someone I just met!  I'd just mislead them a little, that's all.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit,priority:140,count-meia:1=stretching,It's OK--Meia here is the expert on doubting me.  Isn't that right, boss?
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit,priority:140,count-meia:1,marker:butt=butt,I don't think I'll accept your apology.  <i>Maybe I'll just turn this way, since you thought I'd never show them</i>!
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1,saidMarker:underwear=seductive-2,OK, so I lied.  I'm wearing underwear.  But it's not very much, as you can see.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1,saidMarker:underwear=vain,Perhaps I stretched the truth concerning my lack of underwear...much like how my underwear is stretched around my hips.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1,saidMarker:underwear=vain,OK, so I <i>am</i> wearing underwear.  But as you can see, my hips are straining this poor little thong to the breaking point.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1,saidMarker:underwear=teasing,I might be wearing underwear after all, but it's quite clearly ready to snap at <i>any</i> moment.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1,notSaidMarker:underwear=vain,<i>Mmmm...they're so magnificent</i>.  You can stare, Meia, I won't tell Barnette.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1,notSaidMarker:underwear=teasing,Have I ever told you how great it feels to have pride in your breasts?  You should try it sometime, since they're worthy of it.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1,notSaidMarker:underwear=vain,Wriggling free of that dress feels like escaping prison.  We've done that too, you know!
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1,notSaidMarker:underwear=vain,Ah...I feel like a new woman.  I can only imagine how stuffy it must be in that bulky armor and tight bodysuit.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,priority:142,count-meia:1=laughing,Look at that, Elizabeth, you were right!  <i>Are you surprised, Meia</i>?
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,priority:142,count-meia:1=vain,Does my underwear count for nothing?  I guess you were right, at least as far as my breasts are concerned.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,priority:142,count-meia:1=vain,Don't you think my thong is the cutest little thing?  I <i>had</i> to at least wear this.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,priority:142,count-meia:1=teasing,You're the first person to lay eyes on this thong, Elizabeth.  Besides Meia, as well as pretty much every crewmate who's ever showered when I did.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=teasing,<i>Just messing with you!</i>  Ah, that look on your face never gets old.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=laughing,<i>Of course</i> I'm kidding!  I wouldn't drag Paiway here.  She's too irritating.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=laughing,You're surprisingly gullible, boss.  <i>You believed that?</i>  <i>Adorable.</i>
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=seductive,Hah!  Just kidding!  Looks like you really <i>are</i> embarrassed about being nude!  That's so cute.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=teasing,<i>Just kidding</i>!  Barnette would kill me for doing this.  Don't tell her!
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=laughing,Nah, that was a lie.  But look how <i>embarrassed</i> you got!
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=seductive,Teehee!  Just kidding.  You're so <i>cute</i> when you get embarrassed, Meia!
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=laughing,Hah!  I can't believe you fell for that.  You're awfully gullible underneath all that ice!
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=seductive,Aw, Meia, you don't need to flatter me like that!  But you're very sweet for doing so.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=vain,<i>Meia, Meia, Meia.  Always putting yourself down</i>.  How many times do I have to compliment your figure before you take a hint?
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=vain,You can't compare yourself to me and expect to be happy, Meia.  It's not fair to you--I'm <i>perfect</i>.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=vain,Oh, stop fishing for compliments.  I mean, <i>I'll</i> always compliment my Leader, but it's rude to expect that from strangers.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit=vain,Ah, there we are.  Everything you hoped for, right?  <i>I</i> think so.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit=seductive,You don't have to apologize, sweetheart.  I'm glad to show off Mejarian beauty to naive little Earth boys!
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit=seductive-2,I don't think I'll accept your apology.  <i>Maybe I'll just cover them up, since you thought I'd never show them</i>!
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit=seductive,You're such a young little thing, Pit.  Have you ever seen a woman's breasts before?  How early do they start pairing you up with girls where you're from?
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,Come now, I wouldn't lie to someone I just met!  I'd just mislead them a little, that's all.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit=stretching,It's OK.  Meia doubts me all the time, too, but I've never let her down!  Well, maybe once or twice.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit,marker:butt=butt,I don't think I'll accept your apology.  <i>Maybe I'll just turn this way, since you thought I'd never show them</i>!
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=vain,If you're not going through life with style, why even bother?
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=teasing,Your bodysuit drop won't have quite the same impact, Meia.  <i>Unless you're not wearing any underwear</i>!
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=vain,Is everyone satisfied with the reveal?  I mean, <i>I</i> am, but I'd like the audience's opinion.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=vain,Ah, that never gets old.  Even Barnette still gets awestruck--it's so <i>adorable</i>!
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=seductive-2,Yeah, I knew that was a stretch.  Should've told a lie about Paiway or something.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=seductive-2,Should've said Barnette instead.  You would've believed that one...
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=laughing,Congratulations.  You saw through a lazy lie, but not my poker face.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=vain,<i>Oooh, so clever.</i>  Well, not clever enough to win a poker game.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=teasing,I saw you panic for a second there.  <i>I think the men frighten you a little!</i>
5-must_strip_winning=vain,Time to join the club.  And it's looking like a fun membership.
5-must_strip_winning=smug,Well, there goes the whole thing.  But I sure kept up the act for a while.
5-must_strip_winning=laughing,Took you jokers long enough.  Didn't you <i>want</i> to see me nude?
5-must_strip_winning=vain,Well, I <i>had</i> a lead, but it looks like we're just about even.
5-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,priority:150,count-meia:1=stretching,Hear that, Meia?  This is "awkward" to Earth girls.  These poor, sheltered things...
5-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,priority:150,count-meia:1=seductive-2,<i>Oh, yes.  Very awkward.  Unbelievably so</i>.
5-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,priority:150,count-meia:1=smug,Mejare's all women, sweetie.  Female nudity is about as awkward to us as a handshake.
5-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,priority:150,count-meia:1=teasing,Don't you worry about <i>us</i>, Lizzie.  Meia and I are quite comfortable around each other.
5-must_strip_winning,timeInStage:0-0=smug,Well, I was winning, but you've pushed me to the brink along with you in a hurry.
5-must_strip_winning,timeInStage:0-0=stretching,Guess we're all in the same boat now.  Got sloppy those last two rounds.
5-must_strip_winning,timeInStage:0-0=teasing,I guess I shouldn't have expected this little old thong to protect me for long.
5-must_strip_winning,timeInStage:0-0=interested,You've got a good eye and swift instinct.  My breasts didn't distract you at all!
5-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=vain,Ouch.  Sorry to say it, Meia, but things aren't looking good for me...I might have to put on a show like you did.
5-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=seductive-2,Down to nothing at all.  At this rate, they're going to get <i>two</i> Mejarian masturbation shows.
5-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=seductive,Things are looking dicey, boss.  I might have to follow up your earlier act.
5-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=seductive-2,Oh, dear.  I'm not sure I can make it through the evening without masturbating like you did.
5-must_strip_winning,timeInStage:7-99=seductive,I really got a lot of mileage out of this little thong, didn't I?  I'm so talented.
5-must_strip_winning,timeInStage:7-99=smug,Well, I held you off for a good while, but it's time to bare it all.
5-must_strip_winning,timeInStage:7-99=laughing,Well, that streak <i>gave</i> me a lead, but there wasn't much wiggle room for me to hold it.
5-must_strip_winning,timeInStage:7-99=smug,Good effort breaking that streak.  And I'm losing interest, so you'll probably beat me after this...<i>the horror</i>.
5-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=smug,Jeez, Meia.  You've already lost and you're still more into this than I am.
5-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=seductive,What is it with you and competition?  You should know we all love you, even when you make mistakes.
5-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=laughing,Try to ease up on the competitiveness, would you?  Are you going to try to race me if I end up losing?
5-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=interested,It never ends with you and games.  A girlfriend would really put you at ease with yourself, believe me.
5-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=interested,A little showdown is all you could have hoped for, isn't it?
5-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=stretching,You're hopelessly competitive, Meia.  It's just a <i>game</i>.
5-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=smug,Yeah, laugh it up.  I'm not out of this yet...but I <i>am</i> losing interest.
5-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=vain,I'm showing off my beautiful body, and you're living on the edge of victory and defeat.  Being nude is great for <i>both</i> of us!
5-must_strip_winning,hasHand:Two Pair=vain,You went past <i>two pair</i> to remove my silly little thong?  Talk about overkill.
5-must_strip_winning,hasHand:Two Pair=interested,Jeez...I had <i>two pair</i>.  My teasing really made you mad, didn't it?
5-must_strip_winning,hasHand:Two Pair=bored,You're beating <i>two pair</i> now?  I'm on a table full of Gascognes.
5-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=vain,I wouldn't be caught dead in those dopey gym shorts.  My clothes should be as beautiful as I am!
5-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=interested,Those shorts are pretty sad-looking, Meia.  I don't envy you, even now.
5-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=interested,<i>You're</i> lecturing me about fashion?  Stay in the Dread cockpit where you belong, boss.
5-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=smug,I'll wear whatever I please...and conservative granny-shorts don't please me.
5-must_strip_normal=bored,Damn.  I'm really just losing interest at this point.
5-must_strip_normal=bored,Yeah, yeah.  Kinda just want to masturbate now.  I'm all amped-up.
5-must_strip_normal=frustrated,I've really worked myself up into a tizzy.  Maybe I'll just do the forfeit now and be done with it.
5-must_strip_normal=seductive-2,Well, gee.  <i>I wonder what I'll strip this time</i>.
5-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=smug,Jeez, Meia.  You've already lost and you're still more into this than I am.
5-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=seductive,What is it with you and competition?  You should know we all love you, even when you make mistakes.

5-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=smug,By all means, Meia, take a few guesses.  I like keeping people on their toes.
5-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=smug,You get exactly two chances to guess what I'm stripping next, and the first doesn't count.
5-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=seductive-2,<i>Oh, my.  Such a cruel twist of fate to push me this far</i>.
5-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=seductive-2,<i>Oh, to be so bereft of options.  If only I had paid more attention when my squadron leader made me play poker with her!</i>
5-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=seductive-2,Well, Meia?  Any brilliant ideas as to what's going now?
5-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=teasing,Any clue what I'll be stripping <i>this</i> time, Meia?  I know you've got a good head on your shoulders.
5-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=smug,Well, Meia, it doesn't take a detective to figure out what's going <i>this</i> time.
5-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=laughing,See any accessories left, Meia?  I don't...time for the underwear.
5-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=seductive,What's this, Meia?  Genuine concern?  You're such a sweetheart underneath frosty exterior.
5-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=vain,You care so much about your crewmates' welfare.  Maybe you're no fun, but you're nice to have around for that.
5-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=smug,Can't help but assume the worst, huh, Meia?  I'm fine, and you'd be, too, if you were naked.
5-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=seductive,You don't need to worry about me all the time...but it's <i>so cute</i> how you do.
5-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=vain,Ouch.  Sorry to say it, Meia, but things aren't looking good for me...I might have to put on a show like you did.
5-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=seductive-2,Down to nothing at all.  At this rate, they're going to get <i>two</i> Mejarian masturbation shows.
5-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=seductive,Things are looking dicey, boss.  I might have to follow up your earlier act.
5-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=seductive-2,Oh, dear.  I'm not sure I can make it through the evening without masturbating like you did.
5-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,priority:150,count-meia:1=stretching,Hear that, Meia?  This is "awkward" to Earth girls.  These poor, sheltered things...
5-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,priority:150,count-meia:1=seductive-2,<i>Oh, yes.  Very awkward.  Unbelievably so</i>.
5-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,priority:150,count-meia:1=smug,Mejare's all women, sweetie.  Female nudity is about as awkward to us as a handshake.
5-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,priority:150,count-meia:1=teasing,Don't you worry about <i>us</i>, Lizzie.  Meia and I are quite comfortable around each other.
5-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:0-0=stretching,Damn.  I was hoping the chest reveal would distract you all.
5-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:0-0=interested,My breasts didn't throw you off at <i>all</i>?  That's a first.
5-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:0-0=teasing,Earthlings really <i>do</i> have a killer instinct.  Must be that drive to Harvest innocent people, you <i>monsters</i>.
5-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:0-0=bored,Awww, really?  Right after my big reveal?  Give it some time to sink in!
5-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:7-99=teasing,Oh, dear.  my streak has ended.  Now I have to, well, <i>streak</i>.
5-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:7-99=vain,Would you look at that?  I lasted a good while in this little thong.  This is just too easy!
5-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:7-99=laughing,That took you a while.  I <i>knew</i> you'd get all distracted by my chest!
5-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:7-99=stretching,Yeah, yeah, I'll do it.  As if this thong was hiding much away.
5-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=bored,...You're too serious, Meia.  Have I ever told you that before?  Or today, at least?
5-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=vain,Oh, dear.  My lack of interest has cost me my final thin line of defense!
5-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=frustrated,Yeesh...should have just gone alone.  Or maybe tried to get one of the men to come.
5-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=teasing,Kinda just petering out over here, aren't I?  You're relentless, Meia.
5-must_strip_losing=bored,It's no fun teasing when everyone's beating you...
5-must_strip_losing=thinking,Now I'm down to nothing at all.  But then, that's how I carry myself all the time anyway.
5-must_strip_losing=stretching,Meia would be so ashamed of me.  But that's OK.  Strategy lectures are how she shows she cares.
5-must_strip_losing=frustrated,Would Meia have done any better than this?  I mean, she always beats me, but I just don't care.
5-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,priority:150,count-meia:1=stretching,Hear that, Meia?  This is "awkward" to Earth girls.  These poor, sheltered things...

5-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=seductive,What is it with you and competition?  You should know we all love you, even when you make mistakes.

5-must_strip_losing,hasHand:Two Pair=vain,You went past <i>two pair</i> to remove my silly little thong?  Talk about overkill.
5-must_strip_losing,hasHand:Two Pair=interested,Jeez...I had <i>two pair</i>.  My teasing really made you mad, didn't it?
5-must_strip_losing,hasHand:Two Pair=bored,You're beating <i>two pair</i> now?  I'm on a table full of Gascognes.
5-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:0-0=frustrated,...You shouldn't just ruin big reveals like that by demanding another one right away.
5-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:0-0=frustrated,Ugh.  Losing badly, can't tease anyone...I don't care anymore.
5-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:0-0=annoyed,At least I won't be the <i>only</i> loser...eventually.
5-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:0-0=bored,Well, there goes my last line of defense...and my last reason to care.
5-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:7-99=vain,My last stand collapses.  Well, I can still lose my thong, but really, the game's no fun when you've nothing left to strip.
5-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:7-99=teasing,Oh, good, you beat me.  Soon I'll be able to masturbate and have fun again.
5-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:7-99=smug,I was only half-paying attention, so not sure how I pulled off <i>that</i> streak.
5-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:7-99=bored,I had quite a run there.  But you Earth people dress so frivolously that it seems I'm still losing, anyway.  Damn.
5-stripping=losing-thong,Well, you've finally done it.  <i>I think you'll like this one</i>.
5-stripping=losing-thong,No secrets left for me.  Enjoy.
5-stripping=losing-thong,I made you work for this, right?  At least a little bit?
5-stripping=losing-thong,Ever seen an alien groin?  Barnette keeps mine in good condition.
5-stripping=losing-thong,I actually bought this thong legally.  Had it ever since!
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7,priority:150=losing-thong,What's a selfie?  Oh, like you take a photo of yourself?  Sure!  Just let me slide these off...
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7,priority:150=losing-thong,I don't know what a <i>selfie</i> is, but if it involves your camera, I'm game!  Just hold on a second...
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7,priority:150=losing-thong,What?  Oh, like a picture of yourself?  Well, let me get this pesky thong out of the way...
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7,priority:150=losing-thong,A <i>selfie</i>?  Oh, I think I get it!  Sure thing...<i>just let me get fully nude first</i>.
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=losing-thong,Yeah, there isn't much to talk about.  I wonder how I can spice this up...
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=losing-thong,I need to make this more interesting somehow.  <i>Think, Jura</i>!
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=losing-thong,What else can I do to make this more interesting?  There's <i>got</i> to be something.
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=losing-thong,Hey, Jura Basil Elden never disappoints.  I'll just have to make this more stimulating somehow...
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=losing-thong,Nudity is so final.  What else can I do to stay all <i>exotic</i>?
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=losing-thong,I'll just have to use some of my other assets to keep things engaging for our audience...
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=losing-thong,I must admit that this isn't much of a reveal.  Perhaps I should do a little something extra...
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=losing-thong,Considering my butt is already hanging out of this thing, perhaps a further reveal is in order...
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=losing-thong,Unless someone here has never seen a vagina, this isn't much of a strip.  But I think I know how to keep your interest...
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=losing-thong,I think the audience is going to need me to do more than lose a few strips of fabric...this isn't much.
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9,priority:150=losing-thong,What's a selfie?  Oh, like you take a photo of yourself?  Sure!  Just let me slide these off...
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9,priority:150=losing-thong,I don't know what a <i>selfie</i> is, but if it involves your camera, I'm game!  Just hold on a second...
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9,priority:150=losing-thong,What?  Oh, like a picture of yourself?  Well, let me get this pesky thong out of the way...
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9,priority:150=losing-thong,A <i>selfie</i>?  Oh, I think I get it!  Sure thing...<i>just let me get fully nude first</i>.
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=losing-thong,I guess that <i>is</i> kind of cute.  Speaking of hair...
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=losing-thong,Hey, there's no way a bright yellow thong would look any good.  You're pretty lucky.
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=losing-thong,Yeah, it's a shame my hair doesn't quite have the same exotic color yours does.  <i>How else can I make this interesting</i>?
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=losing-thong,If only I had that rich blue hair instead of boring old blonde.  Luckily, I've styled it to be interesting in <i>other</i> ways...
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=losing-thong,You <i>would</i> be the egghead type to actually count the layers.  Too bad you forget to be sexy about <i>yours</i>.
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=losing-thong,At least I made all that clothing interesting to look at.  You came in here with <i>armor</i> on.
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=losing-thong,Hey, clothing isn't the only trick I have.  Watch <i>this</i>.
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=losing-thong,Why am I not surprised you've been counting?  I'd say wearing more clothing was just a matter of being prepared.
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=losing-thong,Hey, it's not <i>my</i> fault you didn't properly prepare yourself for the battle ahead.
5-stripping,totalNaked:1-4,priority:0=losing-thong,This really isn't much of a strip at all.  But I guess the currently naked among us would prefer having my thong, right?
5-stripping,totalNaked:1-4,priority:0=losing-thong,Sure you want to count this?  That rapier of mine probably covers more in the end.
5-stripping,totalNaked:1-4,priority:0=losing-thong,If anyone is a little embarrassed, feel free to borrow my wonderful discarded outfit.  You'll appreciate Mejarian fashion all the more.
5-stripping,totalNaked:1-4,priority:0=losing-thong,Off comes the thong.  I saw the naked among us looking at it with hungry eyes, like it were some kind of overcoat.  Or was that lust?
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=losing-thong,But I'm already perfect.  How's a silly card game supposed to help with that?
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=losing-thong,Look, Meia, women don't get much more perfect than <i>me.</i>  I don't need to improve.
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=losing-thong,I'm pretty happy with myself as-is, actually.  Guess that's the true rift between us.
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=losing-thong,You can't improve upon <i>perfection</i>, Meia.  Just take a look at it for yourself...
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=losing-thong,Jeez.  No wonder you spend so much time in the gym...to improve yourself, right?  I like myself as-is.
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=losing-thong,I am who I am, and who I am is beautiful.  Need a better view?
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=losing-thong,Oh, but the whole prospect is absolutely <i>terrifying</i>, Meia!  I'm not sure I can go through with it!
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=losing-thong,Oh, but I'm <i>scared</i>, Meia!  I need your emotional support in this troubled time.
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=losing-thong,I'm just so worried they won't appreciate my body!  It's so <i>frightening.</i>
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=losing-thong,Can't my Leader be here for me when I'm scared?  You've already pressed on through the worst of it.
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit=losing-thong,You tell me, Pit.  Maybe I've got two dozen beads in here I'll decide to strip first.
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit=losing-thong,Do <i>you</i> see anything I might be hiding in my thong, Mr. Angel?  I'm all out, it would seem...
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit=losing-thong,Unfortunately, I ran out of things to tease you with a while ago.  I suppose I can do my best to pull this thong down all sexily, right?
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit=losing-thong,Oh, don't congratulate yourself, Angel-boy.  A Mejarian who fears nudity is a shame upon her planet!   ...Like pirates are.
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit=losing-thong,You sound like you're happy to see me humiliate myself like this.  You're so cruel...just the way Earthlings are, I suppose.
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=losing-thong,Don't act like you're without pretense.  I see the cute little girl beneath those calculating eyes.
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=losing-thong,Oh, don't act like you've got me all figured out because we're in mixed company.  You're not a hard read yourself, Leader.
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=losing-thong,At least <i>my</i> pretenses let me have fun.  I bet these Earth people barely ever see a blue-haired girl.
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=losing-thong,Ah, yes, Meia.  As we all know, you'd <i>never</i> keep parts of your personality under wraps.
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=losing-thong,Nothing but doom and gloom with you, is it?  Barnette and I are <i>fine</i>.
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=losing-thong,Hey, I should hope it'd take more than <i>this</i> to break me and Barnette up.  We're <i>soulmates</i>.
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=losing-thong,No offense, Meia, but I can't see the benefit of relationship advice from a woman who's never had a girlfriend.
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=losing-thong,Hey, if Barnette were uncomfortable with me showing off my body, we'd have split a long time ago.

-3-stripped=hair,Oh, yes.  You probably want a <i>full</i> view, don't you?  Sure, why not...
-3-stripped=hair,Oh, dear.  Was my hair blocking your view of my wonderful figure?  Let me fix that...
-3-stripped=hair,I'm Mejare's finest woman, you know.  My hair is gorgeous, but you should see <i>all</i> of me.
-3-stripped=hair,You worked so very hard for this.  I should give you a full view for your trouble.
-3-stripped=hair,Oh, is my hair blocking the view?  Shame on you for not appreciating <i>its</i> beauty, as well.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7,priority:500=selfieblank,~silent~
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit=hair,How about I make this <i>extra</i> special, just for you, sweetie?
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit=hair,Just to show how much I care, I'll brush my hair back so you can a full view.  You've waited so very long for this, you poor little thing.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit=hair,Oh, but you <i>were</i>, weren't you?  It's OK--I <i>love</i> the idea of men finding me attractive.  I'm so used to women already...
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit=hair,It's alright...I don't mind the exotic, hungry gaze of a man.  Here, let me help you with that...
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit=hair,I just can't resist giving those adorable eyes the full view they deserve.  You're so innocent and sweet for a man!
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit=hair,Now, let's get this pesky hair out of the way...men are so cute when they stammer.  <i>Keep on doing it</i>.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9,priority:500=selfieblank,~silent~
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,priority:150,count-meia:1=hair,More than a few times.  Sometimes I show her just to see the look on her face.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,priority:150,count-meia:1=hair,If a little nudity stopped the two of us, we'd have been killed a long time ago.  It's a rough universe for a pirate, you know.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,priority:150,count-meia:1=hair,<i>Clean</i>?  I try.  You're too sweet for your own good.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,priority:150,count-meia:1=hair,Why do Earth girls always tiptoe around the issue of vaginas like they don't have any?  You always have a hushed tone, like someone died.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:5,totalNaked:2-4=hair,Hey, <i>brave</i> is facing down an evil version of your own ship while hopped up on painkillers.  Public nudity isn't brave.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:5,totalNaked:2-4=hair,Listen, honey, I've displayed bravery...such as when my Vandread shields whole planets from the Harvest.  A nipple here and there is peanuts.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:5,totalNaked:2-4=hair,You've led quite the sheltered life to think public nudity is brave, dear.  I'm a fighter pilot--now <i>that</i> takes bravery!
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:5,totalNaked:2-4=hair,I <i>am</i> brave, dearie...but not for this.  For engaging nasty Harvest cubes in near-daily dogfights, yes.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:amalia,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=hair,<i>Hm</i>?  I'm just giving my tablemates what they've earned, Amalia.  You should all enjoy Mejare's finest woman!
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:amalia,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=hair,Why <i>shouldn't</i> I show off?  I've got the most gorgeous body here, after all...isn't that the point of this game.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:amalia,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=hair,Why play at all if you don't want to show off your body?  I'm not fooling anyone by coming here.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:amalia,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=hair,I'm oh-so-sorry for being proud of my beautiful body, Amalia.  I guess I should hide in shame in the corner.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:amalia,alsoPlayingStage:9=hair,<i>Hm</i>?  I'm just giving my tablemates what they've earned, Amalia.  You should all enjoy Mejare's finest woman!
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:amalia,alsoPlayingStage:9=hair,Why <i>shouldn't</i> I show off?  I've got the most gorgeous body here, after all...isn't that the point of this game.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:amalia,alsoPlayingStage:9=hair,Why play at all if you don't want to show off your body?  I'm not fooling anyone by coming here.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:amalia,alsoPlayingStage:9=hair,I'm oh-so-sorry for being proud of my beautiful body, Amalia.  I guess I should hide in shame in the corner.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=hair,Besides, how would little Misty feel about her Big Sister being here?  A seedy, naughty place like this...
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=hair,Besides, you agreed to come, didn't you?  How would Misty feel about your burning interest in male nudity?
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=hair,Speaking of which, isn't cute little Misty basically your girlfriend at this point?
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=hair,Speaking of which, how's that May-December relationship of yours with Misty?  She OK with you being here?
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=hair,Now stop ruining my time in the spotlight, would you?  I'm trying to show our Earth guests a good time.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=hair,Now hush up and let me do my thing.  I think a little extra something is in order...
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=hair,Sorry she's being such a downer, folks.  Here, let me give you a better view to make up for it.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=hair,Now, let me move my hair aside...see, if you wore it long, you could do dramatic reveals like this.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=hair,<i>Ta-da</i>!  I knew my hair was blocking the view, which just isn't right.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=hair,You didn't think I forgot how my hair was getting in the way, right?
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=hair,Here's a tradeoff: less of my lovely golden hair, <i>more</i> of my lovely, healthy breasts.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=hair,How's <i>this</i>?  Am I keeping your interest?  I'd rather do so...
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=hair,<i>Ta-da</i>!  <i>This</i> isn't something you can do with that bobbed hair of yours.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=hair,<i>Maybe if you could whip your hair back like me, you'd have a girlfriend</i>.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=hair,Now <i>this</i> is sexier than any silly little strip.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=hair,All a real woman needs to be beautiful is her body!  Fashion is just an extra.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=hair,I bet Dita could play with her hair all sexy like this, too.  <i>That'd</i> get the attention of her precious Mr. Alien.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=hair,Dita's got long hair like this.  Too bad she'd be an emotional wreck, stripping in front of people.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=hair,What do you think?  Even Dita doesn't have the flowing strands in front to pull <i>this</i> move off.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=hair,You could never do <i>this</i> with that dopey bobbed haircut.  I bet Dita could give it a shot, though.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=hair,<i>Gaze upon my overwhelming beauty for yourself.</i>  <i>Weep in jealousy and rage.</i>
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=hair,<i>Rage against the heavens, for you have seen that perfection exists...and that you were not afforded such.</i>
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=hair,See how perfect I am?  Don't fix what isn't broken...I should tell that to Parfet, too.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=hair,Even my <i>hair</i> is perfect.  Well, besides blonde being a little boring.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=hair,If only my hair had your vibrant blue color.  Then I'd be exotic <i>and</i> gorgeous!
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=hair,<i>Ooh, I know</i>.  Watch <i>this</i>, Meia.  Don't you wish you could do it?
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=hair,See, Meia, if you grew your hair out nice and long, you could do <i>this</i>.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=hair,I know.  Shame you cut your hair short, Meia.  Imagine how you'd dazzle these Earthlings with long blue locks like mine!
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=hair,You don't have this luxury, boss.  It's so fun to play with my lovely golden hair!
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:0=hair,You're not alone, Nagisa.  I'm doing such a <i>shameful</i> job, aren't I?
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:0=hair,Right you are, Nagisa...there's no excuse for how poorly I'm playing.  I don't deserve to hide my breasts behind my hair...
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:0=hair,This certainly hasn't been a performance to be proud of, Nagisa.  Good thing my body is.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:0=hair,Ah, but that's the beauty of this game, Nagisa!  With the right body, winning and losing are <i>both</i> satisfying.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:0=hair,All grown up?  Listen, honey...I'm every bit the shy young girl you are, just trying to make my way in this dangerous universe.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:0=hair,Hey, I'm only twenty.  Don't go calling me "grown-up" like I'm some old hag.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:6-9=hair,Watch closely, Videl.  A woman should be proud of her breasts--and not let her hair get in the way!
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:6-9=hair,<i>See</i>, Videl?  You could do a sexy little move like <i>this</i> with those adorable pigtails of yours!
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:6-9=hair,<i>This</i> is the kind of spectacular maneuver you're missing out on, Videl.  Pushing your hair <i>away</i>!
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:6-9=hair,Unlike our pigtailed friend here, <i>I'm</i> not ashamed of my nipples...neither should <i>she</i> be, of course.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:9=hair,Considering your ridiculous embarrassment, Nagisa, yes, it would.  But what fun would that have been?
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:9=hair,Why's that, Nagisa?  Oh, yes, my hair was blocking the view.  Let me fix that...
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:9=hair,Hm?  Oh, that's right--my hair was covering up my breasts!  Good catch, Nagisa...
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:9=hair,Don't say that, Nagisa--you were as cute as ever, even as you masturbated!  And you got through it like a champ.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=hair,Even worse, I have to live up to that performance of yours!  I'm not sure I'm capable of that.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=hair,I'm not positive I can live up to the show you put on for everyone.  You really went at it for a while there.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=hair,You're discounting how lovely your little demonstration was.  I don't think I can top it, even with a body like mine.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=hair,You really made the most of your time in the spotlight.  I'm afraid I may have fizzled out prematurely.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:6=hair,<i>Aw, what's the matter, Nagisa</i>?  Don't you <i>like</i> my naked body?  My <i>gorgeous, full</i> breasts and hips?
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:6=hair,Says the girl with her own breasts on display.  What, my <i>groin</i> is what pushes you over the edge?  It's like anyone else's!
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:6=hair,That's very hurtful, Nagisa.  I spent all that time teasing you, and now it turns out you think I'm too ugly to look at!
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:6=hair,<i>Cover your eyes</i>?  Well, <i>that's</i> a blow to the ego.  Nagisa thinks I'm ugly.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:6=hair,<i>Covering your eyes</i>?  Seems I'm not up to Nagisa's standards...shame, because she's cute enough to meet <i>mine</i>.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:5=hair,What do you mean, <i>cover up</i>?  Why play at all if you're not going to let anyone see you naked?
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:5=hair,Cute as you are, I think you may have missed the point of this game, Nagisa.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:5=hair,Do you not have a vagina of your own, Nagisa?  What are you so embarrassed about?
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:5=hair,Hey, maybe Earth men beat <i>your</i> groins to pulps, but mine is prime and pristine.  I'm not ashamed.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:7=hair,<i>That's the spirit, honey</i>!  Confidence makes <i>any</i> woman more beautiful.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:7=hair,Aw, but you're already so cute as you are, dear!  But you can be confident and still be cute.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:7=hair,You're already naked, so I don't know if you'd call that a win.  But confidence is certainly sexy!
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:7=hair,<i>Go for it, dear</i>!  Confidence is how my darling Barnette won me over, after all.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:7=hair,You're right, people <i>should</i> be more like me--beautiful, intelligent, and confident!  Or maybe I should be cute like you.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:3=hair,<i>Ohhh, thank you, Nagisa</i>!  Nothing warms my heart like someone acknowledging my beauty.  You're pretty cute yourself!
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:3=hair,Hey, now, Nagisa!  You may not have the same beautiful golden locks, but that plain old short brown hair is adorable in its own way.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:3=hair,Hey, don't just clam up on me, honey!  You're so adorable that I find myself blushing right along with you.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:3=hair,<i>Thank you, Nagisa</i>!  No matter how often my hair is praised, I never get tired of hearing it.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:3=hair,<i>Why, thank you, Nagisa</i>!  Your hair is lovely, too...but you could call me a bitch and my heart would still melt.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:2=hair,There's nothing to be nervous about, sweetie!  Women need to be proud of their bodies, or men will just run right over them.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:2=hair,I'll be honest, Nagisa--at this point it, seems like a light breeze would make you nervous.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:2=hair,That's OK, honey!  In my experience, the best way to overcome nervousness is to face down your fears.  <i>Here you go</i>.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:2=hair,You really need a girlfriend, sweetie.  Once one person has seen you naked, it doesn't matter how many more do.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:2=hair,You Earthlings are so terrified of your own bodies.  Your little Harvest-bots are a lot scarier than nipples, you know!
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:1=hair,Hm?  Why's that, Nagisa?  Don't you <i>want</i> to see my breasts?
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:1=hair,Come now, Nagisa, I knew what I signed up for.  It'd be rude of me to deprive my tablemates of the view they've earned.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:1=hair,Rules are rules, Nagisa!  It'd reflect worse on me to be a sore loser and use my hair as a cover.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:1=hair,You Earth girls and your ridiculous modesty.  Just let yourself enjoy some nudity for once, Nagisa.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:1=hair,You're playing <i>strip poker</i>, Nagisa.  I don't buy this whole I-don't-want-to-see-you-naked thing.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:4=hair,True, but it'd be awful rude of me.  I'm representing planet Mejare's honor here, you know!
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:4=hair,I'm not about to shortchange you all on the nudity you've earned.  <i>Who do you take me for, some kind of pirate</i>?
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:4=hair,And what would that accomplish, besides irritate our tablemates even further?
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:4=hair,Come <i>on</i>, Nagisa.  You're a woman--you know what women look like naked!  What's the issue?
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:4=hair,Perish the thought, Nagisa!  Haven't I teased you all enough by now?
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:4=hair,My lovely hair could indeed provide that for me.  But I've done enough teasing this evening...any more would just be cruel.

0-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=teasing,So, not to call you a harlot or anything, Misato, but you seem <i>awful</i> interested in these men...so am I.  How do you Earth girls get their attention?
0-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=confused,Ooh, you seem pretty confident around these Earth men, Misato.  From one woman to another, what's the secret to getting their attention?
0-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=confused,You seem to be doing a better job flirting with these Earth men, Misato.  Am I doing something wrong?  I always seem to scare them!
0-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=confused,Men just run away from me, usually...I thought they <i>like</i> being flirted with.  Misato, you seem to get them!
0-male_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=interested,The losses continue.  I mean, you're a man, so I wasn't expecting much brainpower.
0-male_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=interested,Still haven't lost, you know.  Don't worry, I look for handsomeness in my men, not brainpower.
0-male_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=laughing,Still shaky on how poker works, ~player~?  I know it's a lot of numbers for a man to keep track of.
0-male_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=interested,Another step towards a wonderful little anatomy lesson.
0-male_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=interested,Quite the streak you had there.  Was that beginner's luck, or do men actually understand how numbers work?

0-male_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=laughing,I know damn well I shouldn't have won with that...you Earth people are <i>never</i> gonna see me naked.
0-male_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=laughing,Oh, <i>wow</i>.  A <i>high card</i> is enough to beat you people?  You'd better enjoy the way I look now.
0-male_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=smug,...Yeah, listen.  I've got more layers than it seems, so you'd better hope me winning with a high card was a fluke.
0-male_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=laughing,Guess I can always count on a man's brainpower to get me out of a bad situation.
0-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rinkah,count-meia:1,count-corrin_f:1=smug,Hey, don't be rude to our little male friend here.  He's probably scared half to death, being around all these gorgeous women.
0-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rinkah,count-meia:1,count-corrin_f:1=laughing,Now, now, Rinkah.  That's no way to treat our lone man.  His little pea-brain can only handle so much stimulus.
0-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rinkah,count-meia:1,count-corrin_f:1=interested,Don't make fun, Rinkah.  At least he had the courage to come alone...or the stupidity.
0-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rinkah,count-meia:1,count-corrin_f:1=smug,It's not quite that dire.  Meia isn't exactly in a good mood, since I dragged her here.
0-male_human_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:human,marker:human=teasing,Hey there, Handsome.  You've got a different look about you than everyone else...but I can't quite put my finger on how.
0-male_human_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:human,marker:human=seductive,Hi, Mr. Man...I've only met a few men before, so you're <i>very</i> exotic to me.  Won't you please show me your naked body?
0-male_human_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:human,marker:human=seductive,Hey, Darling.  You should know I come from a planet of <i>all</i> women...so you being a man makes me interested already.
0-male_human_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:human,marker:human=seductive,Is that you, ~player~?  You haven't said much so far...but you should know how exotic men are to me, and how much I want to learn about them.
0-male_human_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:human,marker:human=seductive,You'll show me a good time, won't you, Handsome?  <i>I'm looking for a strong, healthy man to give me a baby, you know</i>.

0-male_must_strip,target:xander,targetStage:0=interested,Well, you don't look so bad for a man.  Am I in competition with that Buffy woman?
0-male_must_strip,target:xander,targetStage:0=teasing,Not to be too forward or anything, but I'm on the prowl for a good man...for reasons you'll know soon enough.  Interested?
0-male_must_strip,target:xander,targetStage:0=vain,You're a pretty average-looking man.  I can live with that...but I bet they don't make women like <i>me</i> where you come from.
0-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:1=teasing,You've got to tell me more about yourself, Pit!  You're so darn shy...and I'm so <i>curious</i>!
0-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:1=seductive,Such a little motormouth, but it <i>alllll</i> clams up when I swing my gaze your way.  I love having this effect on cute little boys!
0-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:1=seductive,Come on, Mr. Angel, don't be shy!  I mean, it's cute, but I want to learn more about Earth men!
0-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:1=seductive,There's <i>so much</i> you could teach me about men, Pit...the men in my life always reject me.  And you're so nonthreatening!
0-male_must_strip,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=confused,Well, now!  There's bizarre specimens, and then there's you.  Are you a man or a woman?
0-male_must_strip,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=confused,I can't really pin down your sex, to be honest...or your species, for that matter.
0-male_must_strip,target:mettaton,targetStage:0,marker:fama_and_oma=vain,Weren't you made in a lab?  So were all Mejarians before our Famas carried us!  ...But I'm not sure if you're a woman.
0-male_must_strip,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=confused,Way to go ahead and be the ultimate test of judging men vs. women.  Gotta say, I'm stumped.
0-male_must_strip,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=confused,...Oh, you're one of those <i>ann-drazza-nuss</i> types, right?  That's the word?
0-male_must_strip,target:mettaton,targetStage:0,marker:fama_and_oma=confused,Mejarians get made in labs, too...but our Famas carry us.  So maybe you're a man, then?  Tarakkians are carried to term in labs...
0-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:2=vain,I can't get over how cute you are, honey...but seriously, what's with the angel outfit?  Men are no angels.
0-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:2=smug,Men have always struck as more <i>beastly</i> than angelic...which is fine by me.  So why do you dress like one?
0-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:2=confused,So, uh, I read about angels as a girl, but they were always women.  Why are you dolled-up like one, anyway?
0-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:2=confused,Do those wings detach?  They look pretty convincing, and the rest of your angel outfit is pretty good.  Why do you have that on, anyway?
0-male_must_strip,target:ryu,targetStage:0=laughing,Hey, hey, hey!  Talk about a hunk...and he's not even wearing much!  <i>Perfect</i>.
0-male_must_strip,target:ryu,targetStage:0=teasing,You look like you see a lot of physical action, hot stuff...can those big muscles toss me around?
0-male_must_strip,target:ryu,targetStage:0=laughing,A big hunk of a man with more muscles than brainpower?  Just what I've been looking for.
0-male_must_strip,target:ryu,targetStage:0=teasing,You seem a little clueless about this game, handsome.  Don't worry...<i>I'll guide you along</i>.
0-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:4=shocked,<i>Eep</i>!  O-oh, you <i>can</i> talk?  B-but...why didn't you?
0-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:4=interested,...So are you over your fear of women now?  Is that what the grunting was all about?
0-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:4=seductive,Oh, you <i>can</i> talk.  Did my beauty make you clam up, cutie?
0-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:4=smug,Well, that solves <i>that</i> mystery.  Come on and join us in the land of language like a civilized person.
0-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:4=smug,Oh, good, you can talk.  I had really lost all hope for men's intelligence for a while there.
0-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:4=shocked,<i>Ack</i>!  Wha--o-oh, you're done screaming!  Uh...OK.
0-male_must_strip,target:shaggy,targetStage:0=bored,Uh...you're kind of tall, I guess, but it doesn't look like you wash yourself much.  Gross.
0-male_must_strip,target:shaggy,targetStage:0=annoyed,I know you're a man, but can't you put a <i>little</i> effort into your appearance?  You look like you just rolled out of a gutter.
0-male_must_strip,target:shaggy,targetStage:0=smug,"Shaggy," huh?  That'd be like if my nickname were "Gorgeous."  Actually, I'll have to propose that next flight practice...
0-male_must_strip,target:shaggy,targetStage:0=frustrated,Gangly, unshaven, all around a mess.  I'm starting to miss the clean-cut professionalism of the Tarakkian soldiers I know.
0-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena,count-meia:1=teasing,You <i>work</i> for this woman, Pit?  Look at that, Meia...it must be <i>Take-Your-Boss-to-Strip</i> Day.
0-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena,count-meia:1=smug,Oh, wow, this woman is your boss?  I guess I have no room to talk, considering I brought Miss Ice Queen along for the ride.
0-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena,count-meia:1=teasing,Look, Meia, this cute little angel-boy brought his boss, too!  I guess he and I are both into taking our superiors down a peg.
0-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena,count-meia:1=smug,Well, what do you know?  Pit brought this boss here too, Meia.  Only ~player~ has any sense, it seems.
0-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=seductive,Omigosh, there's <i>two</i> of you girls?  Are you twins?  I heard Earth people could have matching babies called twins!
0-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=seductive,Ohh, you two ladies are so <i>adorable</i>!  One of you even cut your hair short, just like Meia does!
0-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=seductive,Well, what have we here?  Two cute little ladies dressed in matching armor sets?
0-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=confused,Wait, you're <i>both</i> named Corrin?  Look, girls, I know one's hair is short, but you should really dress different.
0-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=seductive,Well, aren't <i>you</i> cute!  And you're dressed in all that fancy armor.  What's your name, girlie?
0-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=seductive,You are just the most <i>adorable</i> thing, even in all that heavy armor.  Can't you take it off and show us what an Earth woman looks like?
0-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,You're cute, dear!  Look, Meia, she even cut her hair short like you do!  Must be big on practicality, too.
0-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,A woman in armor?  Meia, this girl is trying to get on your good side...matching outfits like that.
0-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena=laughing,Wait, wait, wait.  You <i>work</i> for this woman?  Quite the little boss-employee bonding exercise.
0-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena=interested,Oh wow, you two <i>work</i> together?  I mean, Meia's my boss, but we at least went to different tables.
0-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena=vain,You take orders from this woman, Pit?  Men and women, working together...I see how Earth operates.
0-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena=laughing,<i>Well, now</i>!  You work for this woman...how very, very awkward, Mr. Angel.
0-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:0=laughing,Wow, a <i>blindfold</i> at a table full of strangers?  I never knew men could be so...<i>depraved</i>.
0-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:0=interested,You're, uh, really making up for your stature with the fetish gear.  Can't look me in the eye, sweetheart?
0-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:0=interested,I knew men could be cowardly, but damn.  Even the <i>Tarakkians</i> I know can look a woman in the eye.
0-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:0=interested,So the blindfold's going first, right?  So you can actually read the cards from now on?
0-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:1=interested,<i>Pod this, data that</i>...you talk like you're a machine.  Why the formality, dear?
0-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:1=interested,Why do you talk like you're a robot half the time, huh?  Loosen up and enjoy yourself--if men can do that, of course.
0-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:1=interested,Hey, what's with all your formal data-mechanics babble?  You sound like you just rolled off the factory line, dearie.
0-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:1=seductive,Are you so polite and deferent and robotlike because you're short?  Because the short man <i>I</i> know is a real fireball!
0-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:1=laughing,Hey, darling little boy...why so mechanical in waist and taste?  I know <i>Tarakkians</i> are made in factories, but <i>sheesh</i>.
0-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:5=teasing,It's now or never, Little Dungeon Bot.  Going to look me in the eyes for once?
0-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:5=laughing,I spy with my little eye something you can still take off, Dungeon Robo.  That's because my eyes are uncovered.
0-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:5=interested,Sure you don't want to part with that blindfold, Mr. Robo-man?  Are you aware of the alternative, darling?
0-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:5=interested,Looks like Little Dungeon Bot is all out of dungeon items...well, except for the most striking one of all.
0-male_must_strip,target:bi,targetStage:0=frustrated,...<i>Ew</i>.  What's wrong with your hands...and your <i>face</i>?
0-male_must_strip,target:bi,targetStage:0=annoyed,...I've got to be honest here.  You are <i>very</i> ugly...and I hate ugly things.
0-male_must_strip,target:bi,targetStage:0=annoyed,...Would it have killed you to wash yourself before coming here?  Or maybe not come at all?  I would've preferred that.
0-male_must_strip,target:bi,targetStage:0=angry,...OK, <i>ew</i>.  I wouldn't collect your seed if it meant they'd make me the Grand Ma for it.
0-male_must_strip,target:caleb,targetStage:0=confused,Oh look, a child-man.  What's the word--<i>boy</i>?  Anyway, I'm not gonna strip in front of a kid.
0-male_must_strip,target:caleb,targetStage:0=annoyed,Hey, kid, I know you're male, but can't you read?  No kids allowed.
0-male_must_strip,target:caleb,targetStage:0=annoyed,I'm gonna ignore the cat ears for a second and focus on how you look like you're twelve.  Beat it, kid, adults are trying to have fun here.
0-male_must_strip,target:caleb,targetStage:0=bored,...Listen, honey, we're playing a grown-up game for grown-ups.  You've got to leave...so I don't feel like a pedophile.
0-male_must_strip,target:caleb,targetStage:0=awkward,Hibiki's just short, but you...I don't think you're an adult.  Can't be sure with men, but still...
0-male_must_strip,target:captain_america,targetStage:0=teasing,Woah, talk about <i>hunk</i>!  I want to see what those muscles can do, sweetheart.
0-male_must_strip,target:captain_america,targetStage:0=seductive,<i>Well, now</i>!  You look like just the big ball of hunk I've been searching for, cutie.
0-male_must_strip,target:captain_america,targetStage:0=teasing,Tall, check--muscles, check--handsome, <i>check</i>!  Looks like I've found me a winner, and he hasn't even stripped yet.
0-male_must_strip,target:captain_america,targetStage:0=seductive,<i>Oooh</i>!  Look at <i>you</i>, handsome!  Just the sort of man I hoped to see here!
0-male_must_strip,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:0=smug,And I thought <i>I</i> was enthusiastic.  This man's blowing me out of the water.
0-male_must_strip,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:0=interested,Talk about bringing energy to the table.  Planning on winning this thing, or just shouting about it?
0-male_must_strip,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:0=laughing,Well, <i>someone's</i> a feisty one.  Hibiki's energetic, but you've got the body to match, hot stuff.
0-male_must_strip,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:0=confused,You're some kind of racecar driver or something?  Seems you're permanently amped-up from it.
0-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=seductive,Well, aren't <i>you</i> cute!  And you're dressed in all that fancy armor.  What's your name, girlie?
0-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=seductive,You are just the most <i>adorable</i> thing, even in all that heavy armor.  Can't you take it off and show us what an Earth woman looks like?
0-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=seductive,You're cute, dear!  You've even cut your hair short like Meia does.  Women can pull that off sometimes!
0-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=laughing,A woman in armor?  You're after Meia's own heart, you sly little thing!  Too bad she isn't here.
0-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=annoyed,<i>And who do we have he</i>--oh.  El Shaggy Blanco.  Great choice, ~player~.
0-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=frustrated,...You know, I put a lot of effort into having all these lines, and then you go and stick me with El Shaggy Blanco.
0-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=teasing,Thought I wouldn't have lines to April Fools' characters?  Well, think again, ~player~.
0-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=vain,Everyone give ~player~ a round of applause...they figured out how to use the offline version, as you can see.
0-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=annoyed,...I know you're proud of yourself for deciphering the offline version, ~player~, but you don't have to pick meme characters.
0-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=smug,Excellent character selection, ~player~.  You picked a joke that stopped being funny in 2017...whenever that was in Earth years.
0-male_must_strip,target:fred,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, maybe I'll take <i>your</i> seed.  You're tall and handsome...and most importantly, you're blond.
0-male_must_strip,target:fred,targetStage:0=teasing,What's this, now?  You solve mysteries?  Solve this, honey...whose handsome blond seed am I seriously considering taking right now?
0-male_must_strip,target:fred,targetStage:0=laughing,Hi there, handsome blond man!  You look like you could use a woman at your side...or maybe on top of you.
0-male_must_strip,target:fred,targetStage:0=interested,Duero might have better hair, but yours is blond...that's definitely a plus where I come from.
0-male_must_strip,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:0=confused,So "gay" is the Earth word for how Tarakkians live?  Actually, I'm not sure they even form couples there...
0-male_must_strip,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:0=smug,A man loving other men?  Well, if women can do it, I suppose men can...not that I really picture men capable of love.
0-male_must_strip,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:0=interested,Is this what man-on-man love does to your appearance?  Because you're a scary-looking customer.
0-male_must_strip,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:0=confused,You know, they taught me as a girl that men were monsters...you fit the part.  And apparently you don't like women, is that right?
0-male_must_strip,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:0=interested,If "gay" means what I think it does, I guess teasing you isn't going to get me anywhere...not that I <i>want</i> to see you naked.
0-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, hey, hey--check out <i>this</i> handsome stud!  What brings <i>you</i> here, Mr. Cool-and-Casual?
0-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:0=teasing,You look like you're right at home, Mr. Lackadaisical.  You know what I like in my men?  <i>Handsomeness</i>...like yours.
0-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:0=seductive,Hey, Jacket-and-Pants.  You look a little sleepy, but I can't deny how you're making my heart beat faster.  What's your story?
0-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:0=seductive,I can't take my eyes off you, handsome, even if <i>yours</i> seem a little sleepy.  Mind telling me about yourself?
0-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:2=smug,Hey, so what's with those "Neighbors" you keep talking about?  I mean, Mejare certainly doesn't get along with <i>its</i> neighbors.
0-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:2=seductive,Hey, Handsome, when you say you fight Neighbors, how big a scale are we talking?  Let's just say neighboring planet Tarak isn't our best friend.
0-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:2=interested,Who are these "Neighbors" you say you fight?  Is this like a front-lawn kind of dispute, or do you mean as a solider?
0-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:2=interested,Did you say you fight neighbors, darling?  Mejarians usually fight their neighbors over gardening, unless we're talking planets.
0-male_must_strip,target:kira,targetStage:0=teasing,Ooh, you're a handsome one...and blond, which is even better.  I see you eyeing me up...
0-male_must_strip,target:kira,targetStage:0=seductive,Hi there, sweetheart...what was your name again?  I forgot it when I got lost in your beautiful blond hair.
0-male_must_strip,target:kira,targetStage:0=seductive,I wasn't sure if men could pull off blonde hair the way women do...but you're living proof.  I'll keep my eye on you...
0-male_must_strip,target:kira,targetStage:0=seductive,Ah, <i>here's</i> what I've been looking for!  A handsome blond man.  <i>Try not to sweep me off my feet, darling</i>.
0-male_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=interested,I won with <i>that</i>?  This is gonna be a <i>breeze</i>.
0-male_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=laughing,I know damn well I shouldn't have won with that...you Earth people are <i>never</i> gonna see me naked.
0-male_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=laughing,Oh, <i>wow</i>.  A <i>high card</i> is enough to beat you people?  You'd better enjoy the way I look now.
0-male_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=smug,...Yeah, listen.  I've got more layers than it seems, so you'd better hope me winning with a high card was a fluke.
0-male_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=laughing,Guess I can always count on a man's brainpower to get me out of a bad situation.
0-male_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=interested,Quite the streak you had there.  Was that beginner's luck, or do men actually understand how numbers work?
0-male_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=teasing,<i>That</i> took long enough.  More male skin for me!
0-male_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=interested,Don't get a big head over that streak, handsome.  You still haven't even touched me.
0-male_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=interested,Feeling good about yourself, ~name~?  You have yet to beat a Mejarian woman.
0-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=laughing,I see ~player~ has grown so desperate at the gender disparity in this game that they've turned to <i>Kool-Aid Man</i> for their fix.
0-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=annoyed,...Listen, ~player~, I get that this game doesn't have too many men, but you're better than this.  Pick a real character.
0-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=bored,Doesn't bode well for your opinion of me that you'd stick me with <i>this</i> idiot, ~player~.
0-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=awkward,...<i>Kool-Aid Man</i>, huh, ~player~?  That's...your choice?  Are you sure?
0-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=frustrated,<i>Kool-Aid Man</i>?  ...Do I <i>have</i> to keep playing?  If ~player~'s not gonna take this seriously, why should I?
0-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=interested,You're really starved for some male players, aren't you, ~player~?  Couldn't you pick, I don't know, Pit?  9S?  Come on.
0-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=annoyed,...What the hell am I looking at?  Forget playing against, just...<i>looking at</i>.
0-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=bored,...My beauty deserves better tablemates than this.
0-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=vain,On the female side of things, we have the most beautiful woman on the roster.  And on the male side of things, well...well.
0-male_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=interested,The losses continue.  I mean, you're a man, so I wasn't expecting much brainpower.
0-male_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=interested,Still haven't lost, you know.  Don't worry, I look for handsomeness in my men, not brainpower.
0-male_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=laughing,Still shaky on how poker works, ~name~?  I know it's a lot of numbers for a man to keep track of.
0-male_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=interested,Another step towards a wonderful little anatomy lesson.
0-male_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=teasing,So, not to call you a harlot or anything, Misato, but you seem <i>awful</i> interested in these men...so am I.  How do you Earth girls get their attention?
0-male_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=confused,Ooh, you seem pretty confident around these Earth men, Misato.  From one woman to another, what's the secret to getting their attention?
0-male_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=confused,You seem to be doing a better job flirting with these Earth men, Misato.  Am I doing something wrong?  I always seem to scare them!
0-male_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=confused,Men just run away from me, usually...I thought they <i>like</i> being flirted with.  Misato, you seem to get them!
0-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:0=interested,So are you, uh, going to produce actual <i>words</i> at some point?  Or is grunting and yelling all I can expect from a man?
0-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:0=smug,...I mean, I tease men about being stupid, but <i>did</i> think they were capable of <i>speech</i>.
0-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:0=laughing,...It would seem men haven't quite evolved up to the point of grasping language.  What a shame.
0-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:0=laughing,...You're really showing me new lows for male intelligence, Link.  Grunt again if you agree.
0-male_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1-7=interested,Quite the streak you had there.  Was that beginner's luck, or do men actually understand how numbers work?
0-male_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1-7=teasing,<i>That</i> took long enough.  More male skin for me!
0-male_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1-7=interested,Don't get a big head over that streak, handsome.  You still haven't even touched me.
0-male_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1-7=teasing,Feeling good about yourself, ~name~?  You have yet to beat a Mejarian woman...well, me, anyway.
0-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0=seductive,Well, what do we have here?  An adorable little cinnamon roll of a man, dressed up as an angel!
0-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0=seductive,You are just the cutest little man I've ever seen!  Hibiki's a little smaller, but he's got too much spunk to be cute.
0-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0=excited,Ohhh, you're so <i>cute</i>, Mr. Angel!  I could just <i>eat you up</i>!
0-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0=teasing,What's an adorable little man like you doing here, Pit?  Sure you want to strip nude in front of these scary, hulking women?
0-female_human_must_strip=interested,Come on, ~player~, you can do better than <i>that</i>.
0-female_human_must_strip=laughing,Another layer comes off!  How <i>exciting</i>.
0-female_human_must_strip=laughing,Just <i>what</i> could Earth women be hiding?  The battle scars of having sex with men?
0-female_human_must_strip=thinking,Now you've got me trying to count how many layers all my crewmates wear.
0-female_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=interested,Would you like me to loan some layers?  It looks like you're going to need them, honey.
0-female_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=teasing,Tough luck, ~player~.  But any good woman bounces back from a loss or two!
0-female_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=laughing,Poor little Earth girl.  Don't worry, I won't make fun of your body <i>too</i> much.
0-female_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=teasing,Back-to-back shots always sting the most.
0-female_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=vain,Looks like Earth girls have some fight in them after all.  But of course, the Mejarian is still on top.
0-female_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=teasing,Pretty good streak, ~player~.  Fancy using some of that luck to beat <i>me</i> for a change?
0-female_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=teasing,We have ourselves a loser!  But you <i>did</i> hold out for a while.
0-female_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=teasing,Nice little run, ~player~.  Let's see if you've got smarts down the stretch.
0-female_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=interested,I won with <i>that</i>?  This is gonna be a <i>breeze</i>.
0-female_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=laughing,I know damn well I shouldn't have won with that...you Earth people are <i>never</i> gonna see me naked.
0-female_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=laughing,Oh, <i>wow</i>.  A <i>high card</i> is enough to beat you people?  You'd better enjoy the way I look now.
0-female_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=smug,...Yeah, listen.  I've got more layers than it seems, so you'd better hope me winning with a high card was a fluke.
0-female_human_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:human,marker:human=teasing,I come from a world of all women, so you're nothing special to me.  But you <i>are</i> very cute, so I've got my eye on you, Missy.
0-female_human_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:human,marker:human=seductive,And who's <i>this</i> tight-lipped specimen?  "~player~"?  If you say so...<i>cutie</i>.
0-female_human_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:human,marker:human=seductive,Yet another woman?  Like a drop in the bucket for a Mejarian...but even still, you're <i>far</i> cuter than I expected for an Earth girl.
0-female_human_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:human,marker:human=seductive,You're a little more simply-dressed than the exotic types that seem to frequent this place, myself included.  But you sure have a cute face!
0-female_human_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:human,marker:human=vain,And who are <i>you</i>,~player~?  You've barely said a thing...but you can admire my beauty too, if you want!
0-female_must_strip=interested,Come on, ~name~, you can do better than <i>that</i>.
0-female_must_strip=laughing,And a layer comes off!  How <i>exciting</i>.
0-female_must_strip=laughing,Just <i>what</i> could Earth women be hiding?  The battle scars of having sex with men?
0-female_must_strip=thinking,Now you've got me trying to count how many layers all my crewmates wear.
0-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,count-meia:2=annoyed,Ugh, now there's <i>two</i> of you?  I guess ~player~ is a big fan of being rejected.
0-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,count-meia:2=angry,<i>Two</i> Meias?  Hey, I've been hitting on you this entire time!  What's <i>she</i> done besides give you the cold shoulder?
0-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,count-meia:2=annoyed,...You know, I put a lot of effort into my appearance.  Meia rolls out of bed, and <i>she's</i> the one to get two of her?
0-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,count-meia:2=angry,Hey, what's this all about, ~player~?  You really think Meia's prettier than I am?
0-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:0=laughing,Nice look you've got going there, Miss Bodypaint.  The orange really contrasts nicely with the blue...skin.
0-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:0=laughing,Nice fruity complexion, honey.  Really matches your horns...and your one crazy eye.
0-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:0=smug,You seem surprised to have lost, dear...but you can complain about fate until you're blue in the face.
0-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:0=interested,What are you rolling that thing for?  Trying to pick a new color of body paint?
0-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,count-d.va_cruiser:1=teasing,I don't even know you, girlie, but you seem dressed up for a special occasion all the same.  Feeling sexy today?
0-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,count-d.va_cruiser:1,marker:planet-countries=seductive,Hey, cutie.  Is it a holiday on planet Korea?  Because you look different from usual.
0-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,count-d.va_cruiser:1,marker:planet-countries=interested,This "Korea" planet of yours has got quite the range of fashion.  I <i>swear</i> I've seen you running around in something else.
0-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,count-d.va_cruiser:1=stretching,What's up, D.Va?  That's a cute outfit--but it doesn't seem quite like your usual fare.  What's the occasion?
0-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=bored,Oh, for God's sake, Meia, don't go on a damn moral crusade.  She's kind of cute, isn't that enough?
0-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=frustrated,We barely know her or what Earth's military is like, Meia.  Don't start with your vendettas against authority.
0-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=bored,It wasn't Earth soldiers that shut down our living districts, Meia.  Cool it and try to have a nice time.
0-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=frustrated,Oh, don't start ragging on the poor girl like we understand the politics of this place.  Let's just all calm down and enjoy each others' breasts.
0-female_must_strip,target:penny,targetStage:0=smug,Looks like we've found an Earth girl who's just decided to embrace the whole "boring conservatism" stereotype.  At least your hair is a fiery red.
0-female_must_strip,target:penny,targetStage:0=teasing,That fiery red hair contrasts your rather plain outfit.  But it's not a bad look overall!
0-female_must_strip,target:penny,targetStage:0=vain,<i>Finally</i>, a normal-looking Earth girl.  I need a measuring stick to compare all these superpowered weirdos to...all you've got is that red hair.
0-female_must_strip,target:penny,targetStage:0=seductive,Good, a civilian girl.  So many people at this bar are such colorful characters--oh, but your hair is pretty vibrant, I guess.
0-female_must_strip,target:zelda,targetStage:0=interested,You know what I see when a woman calls herself "royalty"?  <i>An inferiority complex</i>, Miss Boring-Brunette.
0-female_must_strip,target:zelda,targetStage:0=laughing,You're cute, especially as far as overhyped princesses go.  Let's see how cute you are <i>without</i> all your jewelry.
0-female_must_strip,target:zelda,targetStage:0=laughing,You know what I think of miserable jealous girls who dress themselves up and pretend they're better than the rest of us?  ...I like stripping them.
0-female_must_strip,target:zelda,targetStage:0=vain,Take away a princess's fancy dress and what does she have?  Hopefully a cute butt, and a pirate nearby who's earned her clothes.
0-female_must_strip,target:riva,targetStage:0=smug,You should know I'm not a fan of princesses, Miss Magician.  But <i>blonde</i> ones?  ...I might yield a little.
0-female_must_strip,target:riva,targetStage:0=stretching,Maybe all it takes is some blonde hair to warm me up to the idea of royalty...or magic.
0-female_must_strip,target:riva,targetStage:0=vain,Don't feel bad about your unearned title, Miss Princess.  I hear you can perform magic--and alongside blonde hair, I'd say you're alright in my book.
0-female_must_strip,target:riva,targetStage:0=vain,Little Miss Magician is a <i>princess</i>, as well?  Well, against my pirate nature, I think I'll let a fellow blonde be on her way.
0-female_must_strip,target:mia,targetStage:0=vain,<i>My, my</i>!  You work in the <i>law</i>?  This old pirate better be careful around you.
0-female_must_strip,target:mia,targetStage:0=teasing,So you do something with the law, huh?  Think you could defend my murderous pirate self in a courtroom?
0-female_must_strip,target:mia,targetStage:0=vain,So what's a "lawyer" do all day?  Pushing papers around sounds dreadfully boring when you're a daredevil star pilot.
0-female_must_strip,target:mia,targetStage:0=laughing,I see you're quite well-endowed there, Miss Magistrate.  Is that how you win people over in your legal arguments?
0-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:1=excited,Omigosh!  <i>Vriska</i>!  Do that thing again!  There's so much you could teach me about Earth fashion!
0-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:1=excited,<i>Vriiiska</i>!  I love fashion!  Show me more of your Earth outfits!
0-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:1=excited,Your wardrobe's so cool!  I only really have this dress!  You've got to show me what Earth girls wear!
0-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:1=excited,Yes!  Vriska's turn!  Show me what else Earth women wear!  I want it all!
0-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=seductive,Omigosh, Meia, look!  <i>Another</i> spacefarer who recognizes the value of a bodysuit.  You should chat her up!
0-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,Blonde like me, suit like yours, from space like both of us!  This <i>Samus</i> covers all our bases, Meia.  Go flirt with her!
0-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,This woman's practically a Mejarian, between the spacey jumpsuit and gorgeous figure.  Go get her, Meia--she's got your sense of style!
0-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=seductive,Full jumpsuit, shapely behind, cute face, <i>from space</i>?  Meia, this girl is prime girlfriend material!  Now's the time!
0-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=bored,<i>Yeesh</i>.  Meia, I'm sorry I ever called you miserable.  Next to this girl, you're a field of sunflowers.
0-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,I'm glad we came here, boss.  Miss Blueberry over here has given me a new appreciation for your sense of humor.
0-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=bored,Jeez, I've at least <i>seen</i> you smile, Meia.  I don't think this girl <i>has</i> those muscles.
0-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,At least you have your face on display, Leader.  This girl's both miserable <i>and</i> refuses to show it.
0-female_must_strip,target:pauling,targetStage:0=teasing,Nice sensible little outfit you've got there.  The glasses sell the sexy-and-smart look!
0-female_must_strip,target:pauling,targetStage:0=teasing,Working for an old woman, eh?  I know the feeling.  Those glasses must have convinced her you knew what you were doing.
0-female_must_strip,target:pauling,targetStage:0=stretching,A woman with glasses, eh?  <i>I</i> certainly couldn't pull off the look...I guess I don't look very smart.
0-female_must_strip,target:pauling,targetStage:0=smug,I know an engineering egghead with glasses--Parfet's her name.  And she seems to attract what few smart men I know.
0-female_must_strip,target:joey,targetStage:0=confused,What's with all the makeup?  Someone said you're a...<i>clown</i>, whatever that means?
0-female_must_strip,target:joey,targetStage:0=confused,...So does <i>clown</i> mean "makeup advertiser"?  Because you're modeling too many products at once.
0-female_must_strip,target:joey,targetStage:0=laughing,...Earth makeup is something else.  Apparently there's whole classes of women called <i>clowns</i> who just cake it on!
0-female_must_strip,target:joey,targetStage:0=confused,So if I wore as much makeup as you do, would that make me a "clown"?  Where's the lower limit?  This is all new to me.
0-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Ooh, look, Meia.  Another Misty.  <i>Don't go falling in love with her, now</i>!
0-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,OK, Meia.  I know this girl's called Misty, but don't start trying to be <i>her</i> Big Sister, too.
0-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Don't tell anyone, but...<i>Meia's got a bit of a crush on a girl named Misty</i>.  Fair warning!
0-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=stretching,Gonna win over Meia's heart here?  You wouldn't be the first <i>Misty</i> to do it.
0-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:2=teasing,I'm <i>waiting</i>, Vriska!  Don't disappoint me and pick some boring outfit!
0-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:2=teasing,I'm expecting some good fashion from you, you know!  Don't leave it up to chance!
0-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:2=smug,Don't you have some way to control that?  I'd rather you showed off something specific.
0-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:2=teasing,Lay the fashion on me, Vriska!  Fashion from...wherever it is that you live.
0-female_must_strip,target:mileena,targetStage:0=smug,...OK, no one here has any right to call me skimpily-dressed with Bandages here running around.
0-female_must_strip,target:mileena,targetStage:0=stretching,What kind of sex-crazed planet considers that street clothes?  And here I thought Earth was conservative.
0-female_must_strip,target:mileena,targetStage:0=laughing,...Seems I've walking into a game that is well in progress.  Poor thing has been losing so badly!
0-female_must_strip,target:mileena,targetStage:0=laughing,Jeez.  I'm a <i>pirate</i>, and I can afford more clothing than you.  Too bad there's no money involved here.
0-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,You'll have to excuse Meia's hostility.  She's absorbed all of our collective pirate hatred of authority.
0-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,Oh, don't mind Meia.  She's taken the whole pirates-hating--soldiers thing a little too much to heart.
0-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,Just let Meia fume a little, Miss Military. We know you're not from <i>Mejare's</i> nasty old ranks.
0-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=stretching,Cute purple hair, Miss Military.  Oh, don't worry about Meia.  She's even touchier with soldier women than the rest of us.
0-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:mahiru=laughing,Hey, what's that supposed to mean?  You think they wouldn't believe me if I just said it?
0-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:mahiru=vain,The only proof I need is my trusted word, Meia!  Now come here and get in frame.
0-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:mahiru=seductive,Oh, come on, Leader, you've got a face the camera loves!  They'd believe me on hearsay, anyway.
0-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:mahiru=teasing,As if I need proof to convince them.  But hey, just focus on giving your adorable smile!
0-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:mahiru=seductive,Show Mahiru how cute your smile can be, Meia!  That'll be all the crew sees in that photo...not that I need proof.
0-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=vain,No jokes here, darling!  We're one hundred percent <i>alien</i>...if you define "alien" as "not from Earth."
0-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=seductive,We <i>are</i> from another planet, honey!  We're fearless Mejarian pirates...and we've come <i>all this way</i> to learn about Earth.
0-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=vain,Yep, just two exotic women from another world!  So we stuck together, since we can only trust each other around here.
0-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=teasing,We're pirates from Mejare, darling, and all we know about Earth is that men and women live together here!  Which sounds strange to us.
0-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=seductive,That's right, Elizabeth--Meia and I are from another world!  And we're stripping here--<i>that's how much we trust each other</i>.
0-female_must_strip,target:jubilee,targetStage:0=vain,Well, aren't <i>you</i> a little fireball, Miss Mutant?  You look pretty human to me, and this is a girl who thought <i>men</i> were aliens.
0-female_must_strip,target:jubilee,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, honey, <i>men</i> are mutant people, as far as I'm concerned.  And they're still cute, so don't be so hard on yourself.
0-female_must_strip,target:jubilee,targetStage:0=smug,How many people have to tell you you're ugly for you to introduce yourself as a <i>mutant</i>?  You poor, rundown thing.
0-female_must_strip,target:jubilee,targetStage:0=stretching,You look pretty mundane for a <i>mutant</i>, darling.  Although you've certainly got an inhuman fire in you.
0-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=interested,...So it's <i>piloting</i> that really gets you going, Leader.  <i>You hopeless intellectual, you</i>.
0-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,I <i>knew</i> you were a robot.  The only thing that makes you lighten up is another woman's skills.
0-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=stretching,I guess I'm just shallower than you are, boss.  There you go, seeking out girlfriends on things <i>beyond</i> looks.
0-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=stretching,Oh, thank God, you're flirting.  For a second there I was worried you really <i>were</i> sexless.
0-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0=excited,Ooh, Sei, you're such a cutie!  You look <i>just like</i> my squadron leader, Meia--that short blue hair is to <i>die</i> for!
0-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0=teasing,Short blue hair and shoulder armor?  You're the spitting image of my boss, Sei--too bad she's at another table!
0-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0=seductive,Short blue hair?  Omigosh, Sei, my boss Meia looks <i>just like</i> you!  And she could really use a girlfriend.
0-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0=seductive,Sei!  That's your name, right?  You look like my boss Meia with that short-cut blue hair.  Your eyes are a lot softer, though.
0-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=laughing,Ooh, a <i>lady</i> doctor!  The Nirvana's only doctor is a man--I wonder if he'd lose his cool with you gunning for his spot.
0-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=vain,Honestly, I'm torn!  You're a cute woman doctor--and <i>blonde</i>!  But our ship's doctor is a man with rather nice hair himself.
0-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=teasing,Ooh, a doctor from Earth!  I bet that makes you an <i>expert</i> on male sexuality, doesn't it?
0-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, a woman doctor is <i>just</i> what I've been looking for!  Think you could help me and Barnette get pregnant?
0-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=vain,Female <i>and</i> blonde...if only Duero were blond, then he'd be the perfect doctor for me.  So <i>handsome</i>...
0-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, Miss Medicine.  Since you're from Earth, I might have a few questions about men's tubes tonight.
0-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,Mei and Meia, eh?  I hope our other guests won't mix the two of you up--both are cold in your own ways, after all.
0-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,Look, Meia, this girl's nearly got your name.  But she smiles, so telling you two apart should be easy.
0-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Mei and Meia?  I'd play matchmaker, but you'd be the most confusing couple of all time.
0-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,See, Meia?  You're so sweet, this girl was nearly named after you.  Nearly.
0-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:2=seductive,I'd call you crazy for this sort of thing, but how could I when you defy death like it's nothing?
0-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:2=excited,You're just so <i>awesome</i>!  I can't get enough of this!
0-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:2=teasing,Can you do it a <i>third</i> time, hotshot?  Yeah, probably.
0-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:2=excited,I could watch you do this all day.  My heart jumps every time!
0-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:0=seductive,Hey there, Miss Two-Tone!  I like your sense of fashion--that exposed, that hat, and those cute little boots!
0-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, is that two-toned hair natural?  That's fancier than even <i>Mejarians</i> have come up with.
0-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:0=interested,You seem pretty smug, honey.  Do you have a sweeter half like your hair implies?
0-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:0=excited,Ooh, can I try on your hat when you lose it?  Or that amulet?  Can you two-tone my hair like yours?
0-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:1=awkward,So, Miss Kitty, you, uh, going to shave your bottom fur now?  ...I'd like that.
0-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:1=frustrated,Knowing that that's fur now makes me <i>really</i> want to see you shaved...Mejare likes shaving.
0-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:1=bored,Is the bottom fur going now?  Because I <i>hate</i> hair...except on the head.
0-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:1=bored,Please tell me you're shaving everything else.  That's sort of the style on Mejare, so it's what I know.
0-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1=excited,Ooh!  Ooh!  Are you doing it again?  Do it again!
0-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1=excited,Ooh, Aimee's turn!  Show us that trick again!
0-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1=excited,Aimee!  You're so cool!  How do you shoot like that?  Do that trick again!
0-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1=excited,Give us a <i>show</i>, girl!  That last time was incredible!
0-female_must_strip,target:velma,targetStage:0=teasing,It's a rare woman who can pull off the glasses look, you know.  Parfet landed herself a man...how about <i>you</i>, Miss Mystery?
0-female_must_strip,target:velma,targetStage:0=stretching,I know a glasses-wearing egghead myself...Parfet's her name, and what she looks like with them off is the <i>real</i> mystery.
0-female_must_strip,target:velma,targetStage:0=laughing,Hey, Miss Mystery...can you solve how to make glasses look good on a woman?  Here's the answer: <i>give them to me</i>.
0-female_must_strip,target:velma,targetStage:0=vain,So, you solve mysteries, is that right?  I guess the glasses would help there...think you could solve the mystery of this <i>alien woman</i>?
0-female_must_strip,target:velma,targetStage:0=interested,Hey, Miss Mystery.  Push those frames up and answer a few questions...because <i>men</i> are a mystery to me.
0-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=stretching,...Yeah, we're gonna be here a while.  This girl's dressed for the vacuum of space.
0-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=interested,Does it really get that cold on Earth?  Or <i>anywhere</i>, for that matter?
0-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=interested,You're from Planet China, is that right?  Must be one big snowball if <i>that's</i> in vogue over there.
0-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=laughing,I understand why you must be so cold.  Your name is pretty close to <i>Meia</i>, after all.
0-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>Well, howdy, pardner, how d'ya</i>--do...
0-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:0=shocked,What are you lugging that big men's gun around for--<i>ack</i>!
0-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:0=shocked,Well, aren't <i>you</i> spunky!  You even brought a model g--<i>eek</i>!
0-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:0=shocked,Uh...where are you pointing that thing?  Are you--wait--<i>eek!  Don't</i>!
0-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:0=stretching,And they say <i>men</i> are tall!  You're enough woman for the whole table, sweetie.
0-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:0=smug,You said you don't get out much?  Guess men like short women...that makes things awkward for me.
0-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:0=smug,You know, I tend to turn heads with my height alone.  Better not invite <i>you</i> to the ship, or you'll steal my thunder.
0-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:0=seductive,From what I know of men, you're as tall as one...and built like them, too.  Don't worry, you wear it well--so does Gascogne!
0-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:0=teasing,Hibiki's a teenie-weenie man I know.  I guess you represent the opposite end of the spectrum on both counts.
0-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_playing_with_boys=smug,Oh, don't worry about men so much.  They're too clumsy and oafish to make use of all that strength.
0-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_playing_with_boys,marker:nagisa-tubes=interested,I really thought Earth women would be pretty comfortable around men.  Don't you have them shove their tubes into you on a regular basis?
0-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_playing_with_boys=interested,Aren't you used to men ogling and clawing at you?  I thought Earth women do that with them all the time.
0-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_playing_with_boys=stretching,You're so damn shy around these men.  Listen, I fight a whole planet of the toughest men around.  They're all talk.
0-female_must_strip,target:velma_classic,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, Earth to ~player~.  There's a Velma model out now that doesn't look like a goblin.
0-female_must_strip,target:velma_classic,targetStage:0=interested,What, you figured out the offline version but still chose <i>this</i> Velma?  How nostalgia-blinded can you get?
0-female_must_strip,target:velma_classic,targetStage:0=interested,Hey, ~player~, it's not 2016 anymore.  There's a Velma you can play with that's actually on-model.
0-female_must_strip,target:velma_classic,targetStage:0=laughing,Hey, ~player~, Velma Classic is just here to remember the past...not masturbate to it.
0-female_must_strip,target:velma_classic,targetStage:0=laughing,Don't do this to yourself, ~player~--there's a better Velma now.  I mean, <i>look</i> at this one.
0-female_must_strip,target:velma_classic,targetStage:0=vain,Hey, ~player~, Barnette might understand the appeal of antiques, but <i>I</i> say stick with the fresh and new.
0-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_first_time_playing=laughing,Wait, wait, wait.  You've <i>never</i> played poker before?  What are you, in some religious cult or something?
0-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_first_time_playing=smug,You poor, poor thing.  Never played poker before...what a way to start.
0-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_first_time_playing=laughing,You've <i>never</i> played poker before?  Oh, dear...well, I'll be sure to show you the ropes, sweetie.
0-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_first_time_playing=seductive,Your first time ever, huh?  I'm afraid you picked a hell of a game to start with...but you're a cute little thing, so don't be embarrassed.
0-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0=laughing,What's up, sourpuss?  You look even more miserable than a certain squadron leader I know.
0-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0=smug,Hey, lighten up, girlie.  I didn't come all the way to Earth to find what I could get from Meia's strategy lectures.
0-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0=stretching,<i>Yawn</i>...are you really going to be a miserable bore this whole time?  Would having <i>my</i> breasts make you feel better?
0-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0=smug,Looks like it's Little Miss Sunshine's turn to strip.  Good thing Meia's not here, or this table would just freeze over.
0-female_must_strip,target:neo,targetStage:0=laughing,My, you Earth girls have so much on your minds!  And it's apparently content to stay there.
0-female_must_strip,target:neo,targetStage:0=interested,So, Miss Motormouth, how's life?  Or the weather?  Or your family?  Or <i>anything</i>?
0-female_must_strip,target:neo,targetStage:0=teasing,I guess you're too tiny to fit a voice box in the model.  Don't feel bad--you're quite expressive, dear.
0-female_must_strip,target:neo,targetStage:0=vain,I guess I'm doing enough talking for the both of us.  And hey--that adorable two-toned hair is a statement unto itself!
0-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=teasing,Didn't think you'd be the first to lose between us, Meia.  Maybe I'll win this whole thing!
0-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=interested,Oh, wow.  If <i>you're</i> taking the first shot, I might actually beat you.
0-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=laughing,Would you look at that, Meia?  First blood between us.  You getting sloppy?
0-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=teasing,Overconfident, Meia?  Or just some bad luck?
0-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:1=confused,Again?  Meia, are you OK?  You didn't have to take off your eyepiece, seriously.
0-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:1=awkward,Another?  Meia...you're all flushed.  Just calm down...
0-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:1=awkward,Meia, you're blushing.  You're a wreck...
0-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=seductive,Ooh, I <i>love</i> your makeup!  Where do you get it on Earth?  I usually make a point to steal some during raids.
0-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=seductive,You're just <i>adorable</i> how you've dolled yourself up!  And you're so teenie-weenie.
0-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=excited,Omigosh, that little outfit is <i>so</i> cute!  And you might be more into makeup than even <i>I</i> am.
0-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=excited,Ooh, do they make dresses that cute in my size?  What about your makeup?  You look so adorable!
0-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:2=laughing,Meia, this is getting <i>embarrassing</i>.  You're a better poker player than this!
0-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:2=interested,Gascogne would be so ashamed of you, Meia.  Where's all that poker skill?
0-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:2=smug,Still haven't lost.  <i>What would Gascogne say</i>?
0-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:2=interested,Again?  Come on, Meia, you're better than this.
0-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:2=interested,Really?  I shouldn't be beating you at <i>all</i>, Meia.
0-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:2=laughing,Hate to throw this back at you, but <i>where's your focus</i>?
0-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:0=excited,Ohhh, you're so <i>cute</i>!  Draped in a loose-fitting shirt...and those <i>pigtails</i>!  I just wanna squeeze you!
0-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:0=excited,There's something about pigtails on a girl that just make me want to squeeze her even more...you're so <i>adorable</i>!
0-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:0=teasing,So, honey...<i>do men like to yank on those pigtails</i>?  It's OK, you can tell me--I'm not from around here.
0-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:0=seductive,You look like you've taken your first step into womanhood...and no more than that, with too-big clothes and adorable little pigtails!
0-female_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=interested,Would you like me to loan some layers?  It looks like you're going to need them, honey.
0-female_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=teasing,Tough luck, ~name~.  But any good woman bounces back from a loss or two!
0-female_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=laughing,Poor little Earth girl.  Don't worry, I won't make fun of your body <i>too</i> much.
0-female_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=teasing,Back-to-back shots always sting the most.
0-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:3=stretching,Yeesh.  Did I pick the worst day of your life to drag you here or what?
0-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:3=laughing,What's got you so distracted, Meia, honestly?  The tantalizing thought of male nudity?
0-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:3=laughing,It's a good thing you're a better officer than strip poker player, because this is just sad.
0-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:3=interested,Talk about off days.  You should be beating me senseless as usual.
0-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0,count-weiss_v4:1=vain,Hey, Miss Moneybags, nice wardrobe.  I'm just a poor little pirate--<i>this dress is the best I can afford</i>.
0-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0,count-weiss_v4:1=smug,Figures Miss Princess can't go five minutes without changing her clothes.  A few months of piracy will teach you appreciate the clothes you've got.
0-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0,count-weiss_v4:1=interested,At least you mixed up the colors a little with this new outfit, Miss Heirlooms.  What you had before was like if I wore all yellow.
0-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0,count-weiss_v4:1=teasing,Looking cute there, Coinstacks.  Nice new outfit--gotta show off the money somehow, right?
0-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:4=seductive,...Honestly, I don't know what to say.  You always beat me!
0-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:4=laughing,The stripping must really have been getting to you.  I've never beaten you before!
0-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:4=laughing,Never in a million years would I have predicted this kind of gap between us.  Sorry.
0-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:4=interested,You'd be running out of excuses right about now...if you ever made excuses.
0-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0,count-ruby_v4:1=interested,Looking a little different there, Ruby.  Brighter, in fact.  Something bring up the mood where you're from?
0-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0,count-ruby_v4:1=smug,I see you've been mixing up the colors, sweetie.  Not a bad approach, but I'm totally in love with this dress just as it is.
0-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0,count-ruby_v4:1=stretching,Mixing up the outfits, are we?  I've cultivated a certain look with my crewmates I'd rather just maintain.
0-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0,count-ruby_v4:1=vain,Hey, check out the new style Ruby's rocking.  Not bad, but I'm the kind of girl to just stick with what I know best!
0-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:5=frustrated,Oh God, she's finally doing it.  Be very afraid...unless you Earth people are used to this sort of thing.
0-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:5=frustrated,Please don't.  I've learned my lesson.  I'll stay on Mejare.
0-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:5=bored,I'm really appreciating Mejare right now.  Maybe I'll straighten up and get a normal job.
0-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:5=frustrated,This is the last time I come to Earth.  Even among Mejarian pirate scum, none of us act like this.
0-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,totalMales:1-3=interested,Jeez, you're terrified.  Maybe men <i>do</i> eat women's livers.
0-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,totalMales:1-3=confused,...Are men actually anything to be afraid of?  Sure, they're big and lumbering, but they seem kind of slow.
0-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,totalMales:1-3=bored,Calm down, would you?  Yeesh.  Maybe Mejare was right about men, considering the state they've got this girl in.
0-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,totalMales:1-3=teasing,Hey, I've dealt with my fair share of male soldiers.  They're nothing to be super afraid of...too stupid.
0-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:3=excited,Here we go again.  This is so <i>exciting</i>!  Every outfit is an adventure!
0-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:3=excited,This is making me feel so alive!  I love checking out women's fashion!  Show some more!
0-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:3=seductive,You're so cool, Vriska!  And maybe even a little cute!  What else have you got for me?
0-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:3=teasing,Don't stop now, cutie!  Any more adorable outfits you've got in store for me?
0-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,What's up, sourpuss?  You look even more miserable than a certain squadron leader I know...the one right next to us.
0-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,Hey, lighten up, girlie.  I could have gotten this mood from playing poker with Meia back on the ship.
0-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=stretching,<i>Yawn</i>...are you really going to be a miserable bore this whole time?  Would having <i>my</i> breasts make you feel better?
0-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,Looks like it's Little Miss Sunshine's turn to strip.  Between you and Meia here, the energy's just through the roof.
0-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=interested,Look, Meia, she's just as pale, serious, and boring as you are.  Think she'd smile around Kahlua?
0-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,Hey, Meia's standing right here.  Isn't that enough boredom for one table without <i>you</i> aping her style?
0-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,Look at that, Meia, Earth's found a way to mass-produce you!  <i>Diabolical</i>.
0-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,<i>Yeah, yeah, Meia, stay cocky</i>.  Oh wait, Meia's over <i>here</i>!  You two are just so similar.
0-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=smug,Dull that edge, honey.  We're all just trying to have a good time here, stripping naked for complete strangers.
0-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=vain,You're a fiery one, Miss Edge.  A lot like my <i>darling</i> Barnette!  So I don't mind.
0-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=laughing,That red streak in your hair should've tipped us off that you'd be all angry.  Maybe feeling the breeze on your breasts will cheer you up.
0-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=vain,You know what warms me up to others, Miss Edge?  Shaking my breasts around for them--<i>they always appreciate that</i>!
0-female_must_strip,target:peach,targetStage:0=vain,I've never been a fan of royalty, but a <i>blonde</i> woman in charge?  Suddenly it doesn't seem so bad.
0-female_must_strip,target:peach,targetStage:0=smug,At least you've got the hair color to match your presumptuous title, Miss Princess.  This pirate still might rob you later.
0-female_must_strip,target:peach,targetStage:0=vain,You damn princesses and your unearned jewelry and dresses.  I stole everything I have, you know!  But at least you're blonde.
0-female_must_strip,target:peach,targetStage:0=teasing,So from one blonde to another, Miss Princess, how much is that crown worth?  ...<i>Just a pirate's curiosity</i>.
0-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0=smug,And here I thought I was on Earth.  Turns out we've got a woman from a frozen tundra planet, evolved for camouflage.
0-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0=teasing,You look like you're in pretty good shape, honey.  And even better, I bet sweat blends right in to your marble complexion!
0-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0=vain,I'll be frank--you wouldn't catch me dead exercising.  It's so much work, and look at what it's done to this poor woman's skin!
0-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0=stretching,<i>Fitness this</i>, <i>exercise that</i>.  Why should I take advice from a woman who's apparently never seen sunlight?
0-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:1=shocked,What's next, Ocean Girl?  You shir--<i>I was kidding</i>!
0-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:1=shocked,I imagine the shirt is ne--<i>wait, no, I was just joking</i>!
0-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:1=annoyed,...You're not serious?  I'm telling you, you have to <i>tease</i> a little!
0-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:1=bored,...Ocean Girl's a total idiot.  Just stripping nude right off the bat...way to miss the point.
0-female_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=interested,I won with <i>that</i>?  This is gonna be a <i>breeze</i>.
0-female_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=laughing,I know damn well I shouldn't have won with that...you Earth people are <i>never</i> gonna see me naked.
0-female_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=laughing,Oh, <i>wow</i>.  A <i>high card</i> is enough to beat you people?  You'd better enjoy the way I look now.
0-female_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=smug,...Yeah, listen.  I've got more layers than it seems, so you'd better hope me winning with a high card was a fluke.
0-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0=excited,Ooh!  Ooh!  You're the one who's with a woman, right?  You some kind of Mejarian envoy to Earth?
0-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0=thinking,You're with a woman, isn't that right?  Maybe Mejare was just aping what Earthlings came up with first...
0-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0=interested,So, you're the one showing these poor Earth girls the Mejarian way, right?  That they don't need men to be happy?  Good job.
0-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0=vain,<i>Finally</i>, an Earth woman who's realized how much better other women's bodies are.  We should gossip about our girlfriends later.
0-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0,marker:fama_and_oma=smug,So, Miss Mejarian-style, are you going to be the Fama, or is your ladyfriend?  My Barnette's far too cute to carry babies herself.
0-female_must_strip,target:kurumu,targetStage:0=laughing,Hey there, short stuff!  Seems all your height went into your chest--those things are even bigger than mine!
0-female_must_strip,target:kurumu,targetStage:0=interested,You hogging all the nutrients on this planet, Miss Vampire?  You're the only Earth girl I've seen that outdoes <i>my</i> breasts.
0-female_must_strip,target:kurumu,targetStage:0=smug,Even through that schoolgirl's outfit, I can tell your breasts are superior to mine.  Hopefully Barnette loves me for <i>other</i> reasons.
0-female_must_strip,target:kurumu,targetStage:0=laughing,Is it true you suck blood, Miss Vampire?  If so...well, we certainly know where it all goes.
0-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0=stretching,Hey, Chatterbox, feel free to live a little.  You're as bad as Meia...good thing she ended up somewhere else.
0-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0=stretching,And here I thought I was sparing this table the boredom of having Meia around.  Enter her Earth doppelganger.
0-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0=smug,Pale, dead-serious, somehow convinced there's strategy in cards.  I didn't know they synthesized Meia's brand of boredom on Earth.
0-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0=laughing,<i>Please, Chatterbox, you're talking our ears off.  And your smiles are just so radiant</i>!  A woman after Meia's own black heart.
0-female_must_strip,target:orendi,targetStage:0=confused,...You OK there, Fireball?  You on the same planet as the rest of us?
0-female_must_strip,target:orendi,targetStage:0=confused,I may <i>be</i> an alien...but you're certainly acting like one.
0-female_must_strip,target:orendi,targetStage:0=annoyed,Four arms looks useful, but I really can't get over the constant shouting.  Can't you pipe down?
0-female_must_strip,target:orendi,targetStage:0=frustrated,Hey, Earth-girl.  Or wherever you're from.  There's this thing called an <i>indoor</i> voice.
0-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale_swimsuit,targetStage:0=laughing,How can a woman dress for a sun she's apparently never seen?  The mysteries just keep piling up.
0-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale_swimsuit,targetStage:0=interested,Cute swimsuit, honey, but I've always preferred the shade.  So do you, clearly.
0-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale_swimsuit,targetStage:0=vain,Yeah, I'm more the type to lounge under an umbrella than do any swimming.  But more power to you, if you ever choose to go outside.
0-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale_swimsuit,targetStage:0=interested,Look, dear.  You can wear that swimsuit all day, but that complexion's not fooling anybody.
0-female_must_strip,target:kimberly,targetStage:0=confused,Hey, so, uh, normally I'd tease you or something, but what was with that big lightshow from you earlier?
0-female_must_strip,target:kimberly,targetStage:0=confused,Wait, weren't you wearing pink a little while ago?  Like, a full suit?  Was that lightshow back there <i>you</i>?
0-female_must_strip,target:kimberly,targetStage:0=shocked,Hey, who's the new girl?  And where'd that pink-suit-wearing woman go after she flashed away?  Wait, was that <i>you</i>?
0-female_must_strip,target:kimberly,targetStage:0=angry,Hey, aren't you the one who half-blinded us all a little bit ago?  Where'd your suit go?  I thought it was cool, so start talking.
0-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=vain,Way to come in a full outfit, Miss Maid.  And you're still speaking just as politely as when you're on the job!
0-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=smug,Whoever is your house's owner must really crack the whip, Miss Maid.  Even <i>now</i> you're using those silly honorifics.
0-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=vain,"Jura-chan" sounds like the most <i>adorable</i> nickname!  I've got to get Barnette to start calling me that...Barnette-<i>chan</i>.
0-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=teasing,You don't have to keep speaking all polite, Miss Maid.  You're in the company of a brutal pirate now--feel free to join the crew.
0-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:2=interested,Honey, you'd be better off putting some meat on your bones than trying desperately to show them off.
0-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:2=bored,Sweetie, you're a twig.  This is just unhealthy...as unhealthy as you look.
0-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:2=confused,Are you suffering from this "anorexia" I keep reading about?  Eating disorders?  Do men do this to you?
0-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:2=vain,Talk about needing a girlfriend.  See what happens when you're never validated?
0-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0=seductive,You know what I love more than anything in this vast universe?  A fellow blonde...especially a cute one!  And you fit the bill, fireball.
0-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, I like your energy--and your blondeness!  My girlfriend Barnette's a real spark plug herself.
0-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0=interested,You're a cutie, Miss Midriff--that messy blonde hair is only making me fall further in love.  Where do you get all your energy?
0-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0=teasing,Slow down there, firecracker--you're like a burning torch with all that blonde hair flying about.  But it's definitely cute!
0-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0=interested,What's with the wings, Miss Pixie?  You some kind of sex-fairy sent to wake up our libidos?
0-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0=seductive,And what do we have here?  A tender little love fairy to help us all along in our sexual adventures?
0-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0=teasing,A love fairy, eh?  You listen here, Miss Pixie--<i>I'm</i> in a happy relationship.  So no touching!
0-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0=laughing,Little Miss Pixie's got quite the filthy mouth for being so frilly-pink with love.  I guess sex <i>is</i> a part of love, but still...
0-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:2=confused,So, uh, besides being blue, what's your deal?  You're all sweet and polite now.
0-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:2=seductive,Can't say I prefer blue hair, but you're certainly a lot sweeter now, honey.  What <i>happened</i>?
0-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:2=seductive,Normally I like blondes, but at least you're not waving a gun around and cursing anymore.  Nice tradeoff.
0-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:2=vain,Blue hair is more exotic, but blonde is far more beautiful.  Still, I'll take this polite version of you over the alternative.
0-female_must_strip,target:rosalina,targetStage:0=teasing,And what do we have here--a fellow spacefarer, and a tall blonde one at that?  <i>People are going to get us confused</i>.
0-female_must_strip,target:rosalina,targetStage:0=vain,Flying around on an <i>observatory</i>, you said?  That sounds heavenly--space is such a beautiful place!
0-female_must_strip,target:rosalina,targetStage:0=teasing,Space can actually be rather beautiful when you're not busy robbing people.  Surely you agree, Miss Princess?
0-female_must_strip,target:rosalina,targetStage:0=vain,You <i>say</i> you're a princess, but space belongs to everyone--surely a traveler like yourself knows that better than most.
0-female_must_strip,target:willow,targetStage:0=seductive,Tell me about these "vampires," sweetie.  Sucking blood actually sounds a little romantic!
0-female_must_strip,target:willow,targetStage:0=interested,A computer nerd, eh?  So's Parfet--but I wouldn't trust her to handle supernatural blood-suckers.
0-female_must_strip,target:willow,targetStage:0=vain,I know a computer nerd--Parfet's her name.  Cute little thing...and she's with a man, who we <i>used</i> to think sucked blood.
0-female_must_strip,target:willow,targetStage:0=teasing,I think I drew blood on Barnette once--it was a steamy night.  But I never sucked it, so maybe I'm not one of these "vampires."
0-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:3=bored,Is there a doctor in the building?  One specializing in mental health?
0-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:3=frustrated,...This isn't funny anymore.  Now I'm just worried about you.
0-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:3=frustrated,...This is getting old.  <i>I'm</i> getting old listening to this.
0-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:3=annoyed,What a surprise.  Intentionally throwing the game tends to make you lose.
0-female_must_strip,target:paya,targetStage:0=smug,My sympathies about the premature white hair, honey.  You look a lot older than you should.
0-female_must_strip,target:paya,targetStage:0=confused,You might want to rethink those facial markings, dear.  With that white hair, they look an awful lot like wrinkles.
0-female_must_strip,target:paya,targetStage:0=laughing,Couples can choose their babies' hair color on Mejare thanks to genetic engineering...there's a reason white isn't very popular.
0-female_must_strip,target:paya,targetStage:0=stretching,You poor thing.  Our captain's ancient, but even <i>she</i> still has color in her hair.
0-female_must_strip,target:lara,targetStage:0=stretching,Raiding tombs, you said?  Why would you <i>ever</i> want to be all dirty and dusty?
0-female_must_strip,target:lara,targetStage:0=stretching,You won't find <i>me</i> in catacombs like you explore.  It'd ruin my dress...and my face.
0-female_must_strip,target:lara,targetStage:0=teasing,So what's in these tombs, anyway?  <i>We</i> conduct raids on the living and able--so watch out!
0-female_must_strip,target:lara,targetStage:0=smug,Raiding those who can't defend themselves doesn't sound too impressive, honey.  Or do monsters live in those tombs of yours?
0-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:0=awkward,Uh...you want to calm down there, sweetheart?  Maybe put that men's gun down?  Take a nap?
0-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:0=bored,Jeez, we knew you meant business by the gun.  No need to shout...must be men's influence.
0-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:0=frustrated,Can you pipe down?  Way to confirm the image of Earth girls as nasty little gun-toting balls of violence.
0-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:0=shocked,Uh...why are you carrying that giant men's gun?  I'd show it to Barnette, but you, uh, don't seem too friendly.
0-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:0=bored,That's a huge gun, Miss Moxie...men's mechanical weapons are so noisy and inefficient.  Don't tell Barnette I said that.
0-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, cutie!  You look a little wide-eyed and naive to be here...but those bullets suggest otherwise.
0-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0=stretching,I've got my eye on you, Miss Ruby-Red.  I know better than to trust a cute girl with ammo clips on her belt.
0-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0=vain,You know who else is a cute girl with a little ammo on the side?  My girlfriend, Barnette.  And if you're anything like her, I better not get you angry.
0-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0=seductive,The black-and-red outfit is a winner, honey--very intimidating!  So's that ammo.  Guess you need to balance out your cute face.
0-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,Hey, Meia, what do you think?  Should we try to find you a bodysuit with polka dots?  Maybe force you to smile like Marinette?
0-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=interested,This girl makes bodysuits look a lot cuter than <i>you</i> do, Meia.  Must be because she smiles...or because of the polka dots.
0-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,Even with the mask on, this girl emotes much more than <i>you</i>, Meia.  Maybe a polka-dotted suit would lighten you up.
0-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,If you're not a fan of polka dots, Meia, maybe you could adopt this girl's adorable accent and actually brighten a room for once.
0-female_must_strip,target:kim,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, nice and simple fashion is always a treat to see.  I have a crewmate who bares her stomach just like you do!
0-female_must_strip,target:kim,targetStage:0=laughing,Hey, girlie.  I hope your stomach isn't feeling too vulnerable, all exposed next to the alien lady's rapier.
0-female_must_strip,target:kim,targetStage:0=teasing,Feeling confident, dear?  With a name like Pissible and a belly that vulnerable, you <i>must</i>.
0-female_must_strip,target:kim,targetStage:0=teasing,<i>Save the world</i>, huh?  Well, dearie, you and your little midriff should know I'm not <i>from</i> this world.
0-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:0=interested,What's up, Ocean Girl?  You seem awfully eager.  Does being around men tend to hypersexualize a woman?
0-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:0=smug,Jeez, it didn't take a loss for you to start piping up about stripping.  You don't need a <i>game</i> to do that, you know.
0-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:0=interested,And here we have Miss Eager-Beaver.  You don't look like you have the assets to be all excited about stripping, sweetheart.
0-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:0=stretching,At least you're confident about nudity.  But are you seriously just losing on purpose?  <i>Earth girls</i>...
0-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, cutie!  You look like you've got some kind of rank to your name, with that beret--care to share any details?
0-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, you're not a bad looker, Earth-girl!  I like that exotic purple hair.  What is it you do, exactly?
0-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0=seductive,Tell me more about your exciting "NERV" job, Miss Military.  I want to know <i>all about</i> Earth!
0-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0=teasing,Ohoho--a <i>military</i> woman.  Well, indulge this filthy pirate scum and share what it is you do all day.
0-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0=interested,What's up, cutie?  You look a little embarrassed to be here...which is funny, considering your choice of outfit.
0-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0=teasing,Yeah, not sure I'm buying this whole "I was tricked" act, dearie.  I mean, you <i>are</i> displaying your butt 24/7.
0-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0=teasing,Oh, don't act all embarrassed.  You've got hips to <i>die</i> for, cutie...and they're fully on display, even now.
0-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0=laughing,Ooh, you are just <i>adorable</i>!  Especially the way your figure is just <i>straining</i> against the bounds of that suit, <i>begging</i> to be free.
0-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:0=laughing,<i>Boo</i>!  <i>The nasty pirate woman's going to kill you</i>!
0-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:0=laughing,You're a cute little thing, Saki!  So plain and innocent...perfect for a pirate like me to <i>kidnap</i>!
0-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:0=laughing,Seeing a cute little Earth girl all clammed up like this really makes me want to comfort her...<i>with my rapier</i>!
0-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:0=laughing,Hey, Miss Schoolgirl.  Ever met an <i>alien</i> before?  You should know...<i>we eat Earthlings' brains</i>!
0-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=seductive,I understand, dear.  You're so stunned by my beauty that you hid your own face in shame.  I'm sure you're still cute!
0-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=seductive,Don't hide that pretty little face on <i>my</i> account, honey.  You've certainly got a beautiful <i>figure</i>.
0-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,Look, Meia, a girl with your fashion sense--though apparently she needs a mask to match your sheer lack of emotion.
0-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,You've got a lot of sass for someone who won't show her face, Miss Masked.  Hiding some grisly injury, or just your own embarrassment?
0-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:4=teasing,Hey, honey...take <i>my</i> dress, and I'll love you forever.
0-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:4=smug,Feel free to flatter me and steal my dress, dear!  It's...over there somewhere.
0-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:4=seductive,Say, Vriska...can that die steal <i>my</i> dress?  <i>Please</i> say yes.
0-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:4=vain,I'd <i>love</i> to see how my dress looks on someone else.  But I can't just let you try it on...so use the die.
0-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia,marker:planet-countries=smug,Where'd you say you were from?  Planet <i>Korea</i>?  Well then, it seems Korea and Mejare share a fashion sense...
0-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia,marker:planet-countries=teasing,You're a cutie, Miss Bodysuit, if a little on the short side.  Is that just how they make women over on Planet Korea?
0-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Well, everyone, cards on the table.  Who wears the whole bodysuit look better--D.Va or my miserable old boss here?
0-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,You're an adorable little thing, D.Va!  All wrapped up in that cute bodysuit, just like <i>another</i> pilot I know...who might be sitting here.
0-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,<i>Oh, dear</i>.  I can see where <i>this</i> is going, Ice Queen.
0-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,<i>Flirting</i>, are we Meia?  I figured as much.  Best to let the lovebirds just figure things out on their own.
0-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,Meia, honey, you're just setting yourself up for disappointment.  Earth girls don't like each others' bodies the way <i>we</i> do.
0-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Ooh, you're so <i>cute</i> when a woman actually gets you going!  She'll deny it now, Chun, but Meia here is <i>totally</i> into you.
0-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:0=stretching,Shame you're not an <i>actual</i> pearl.  I could go for one of those...Mejare hardly has any.
0-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:0=smug,No animals on Mejare means no pearls.  If only you <i>were</i> one of those beauties...
0-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:0=bored,All stretched-out like that...you're not shaped like a pearl at all!  Shame, because I love those things.
0-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:0=vain,<i>Oh, to hold a real pearl in my hands</i>!  I've only seen pictures in Earth history books.
0-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=stretching,Ooh, I know a girl named Misty!  She's this cute little thing from Pluto--barely has any breasts at all!  Must be cold there.
0-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=smug,Why, the Nirvana has a young girl named Misty aboard!  Being from Pluto, she knew her way around men better than any of us.
0-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=seductive,You're not the first Misty I've come to know, actually.  A teenie-weenie Plutonian girl we have is called the same thing!
0-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=stretching,I don't think they have your <i>poker</i>-mon things on Pluto...but they do have girls named Misty.
0-female_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=vain,Looks like Earth girls have some fight in them after all.  But of course, the Mejarian is still on top.
0-female_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=teasing,Pretty good streak, ~name~.  Fancy using some of that luck to beat <i>me</i> for a change?
0-female_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=teasing,We have ourselves a loser!  But you <i>did</i> hold out for a while.
0-female_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=teasing,Nice little run, ~name~.  Let's see if you've got smarts down the stretch.
0-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, Miss Moneybags, you'd better watch out.  This pirate's got half a mind to loot you with extreme prejudice!
0-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0=teasing,Sure you're not worried to be playing in a seedy place like this, Miss Heiress?  You might get mugged by, say, an ornery pirate.
0-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0=interested,Nice premature white hair, Miss Heirlooms.  I guess having all that inherited money must be <i>oh-so-stressful</i> for you.
0-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0=laughing,Looking quite adorable there, Coinstacks.  Maybe I'll help myself to the jewelry you'll undoubtedly remove first.
0-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=stretching,See, Meia, I think you do the "strong, silent type" thing pretty well.  Chell here is an example of taking it too far.
0-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,Slow on the uptake?  The "strong, silent type" doesn't mean <i>literally</i> never speaking, you know.
0-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,Oh, don't feel bad.  I know you're speechless at the sight of me--but I'll do enough talking for both of us!
0-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Stunned into speechlessness?  I'm flattered, but really, honey, you can talk to me.  I won't mind.
0-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Hey, Chell.  If I'm the most gorgeous woman you've ever met, don't say anything.
0-female_must_strip,target:arwen,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=confused,Hey, what's all this about the <i>middle</i> of Earth?  Is there a spot underground that only you elf-people get to live in?
0-female_must_strip,target:arwen,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=confused,And I call <i>you</i> pale, Meia.  Arwen here looks almost ghostly...is that just the way elves are?
0-female_must_strip,target:arwen,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=confused,Hey, what's up with those pointy ears?  And that pallid skin?  You're a strange one, "elf" girl.
0-female_must_strip,target:arwen,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=confused,So you call yourself an elf, right?  Is that another word for "Earthling with crazy ears"?  Because you look human otherwise.
0-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=seductive,Is that so?  Well, Ami, you've <i>got</i> to let me know how to become an Earth model.  I'm a bit of an outlaw on Mejare, after all.
0-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Thanks for the tip, Meia.  Leave it to you to gather a little intel on our friends here...how's life as an Earth model, honey?
0-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,Ooh, she's a <i>model</i>?  <i>Now</i> I'm curious...that was always my dream job, after all.
0-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:4=bored,...Maybe I should stop hitting on men.  Look what it does to you...
0-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:4=annoyed,Is this really what Earth women are like?  She's an outlier, right?
0-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:4=frustrated,Seems running the Harvest has a tendency to scramble Earth women's brains...and make them want to play poker.
0-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:4=bored,...At least she's losing quickly.  Easy to do when you barely check the cards.
0-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:6=interested,I appreciated the fashion show, Vriska, but really, I doubt you've got fuel left in the tank.
0-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:6=stretching,Just going to keep on trying, huh?  Give it up already.
0-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:6=stretching,Poor girl just can't control her gambling problem.  Now she'll be nude for it.
0-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:6=interested,And is this magically going to restock your wardrobe?  I doubt it.
0-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=seductive,<i>Oooh</i>!  Even ~player~ realizes how beautiful I am--enough to add a clone!  You're so <i>adorable</i>.
0-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=laughing,Hey, what's this all about, ~player~?  Did I keep on winning, and you wanted to see me naked <i>that</i> badly?
0-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=vain,Would you look at that?  My beauty was so enticing that ~player~ figured out the offline version just to add more of me.
0-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=vain,Earth's cloning technology is well underway!  And ~player~ picked the <i>perfect</i> specimen, I must say.
0-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=vain,I never thought ~player~ could manage to flatter me, and then they go and pick <i>two</i> of me!  Good show.
0-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=laughing,<i>My, my, ~player~</i>.  You <i>really</i> like the look of me.
0-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=smug,Jeez, what a head case.  Good thing she's got her girlfriend here to keep her in check.
0-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=interested,Running, running, running.  We're not trying to kill you here, you know.
0-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=teasing,Time for take two, everyone.  Better than the first, perhaps?
0-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=seductive,And <i>there she goes</i>.  Poor little thing, beaten down by the world.
0-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=seductive,Hey there, Miss Star-Student!  That's a school uniform, right?  What do they teach you on Earth?
0-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=teasing,Check out the uniformed student type!  I was never good in school--but what is it they teach you on Earth, huh?
0-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=vain,Mejare's schools are nothing but <i>men this, violence that</i>, with a little math.  How does your fancy Earth education compare?
0-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=vain,A student, huh?  Do they teach you anything interesting on Earth?  I was never a brainiac, but I still rose to be a pilot!
0-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, an Earth girl still in school!  Have they taught you anything about men?  What do they teach you in general?
0-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:7=smug,...Yeah, we all know how <i>this</i> is ending, don't we?
0-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:7=smug,Some women just refuse to see what's right in front of them.  It's sad, really.
0-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:7=laughing,Well, get ready for full-blown blue nudity, everyone.
0-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:7=smug,All the magic in the universe, and not one ounce of sense.  You poor thing.
0-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0=interested,I was about to comment on how I love blondes, but that mechanical arm really stands out.  How'd you get it?
0-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0=confused,It's hard to feel too awkward about you losing your arm when that thing looks like a pretty useful replacement.  Got a story to tell?
0-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0=laughing,Check out Miss Cyborg over here!  You wear that mechanical arm quite well--<i>do Earth men find you too much to handle</i>?
0-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0=seductive,I must say, that cold steel clashes with your fiery personality.  Talk about a two-tiered threat!
0-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:3=confused,This is so freaky to me, and I've dealt with the Paksis's weird energy.  Do you just swtich all the time?
0-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:3=confused,Are you really bouncing back and forth like this all the time?  Like, do you have any friends?
0-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:3=confused,Must be hard getting to know anyone when you keep losing your memory.  How do you deal with always switching?
0-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:3=confused,I can't believe you have split personalities.  Where does the other one go?  How do you make friends?
0-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:5=smug,Call it woman's intuition, but I think our little fashion show is about to come to an end soon...
0-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:5=interested,This has been fun, Vriska, but I don't think you can keep this up forever.  That die's got a sick sense of humor.
0-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:5=interested,Can't you see the writing on the wall, sweetheart?  I like these outfits, but they keep getting skimpier and skimpier.
0-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:5=laughing,Roll all you want...I think the die's in control here.  And it wants to see some blue skin.
0-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:3=awkward,Uh, Aimee?  Are you sure you want to keep doing that?  You nearly got hit last time...and your targets are getting smaller.
0-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:3=shocked,Um, it's OK, Aimee!  You've been very impressive!  Just go out on top, you know?
0-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:3=awkward,...Are you sure about this, Aimee?  After...last time?  Don't kill yourself...
0-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:3=awkward,Uh--don't go all the way just for <i>my</i> sake.  What you did was cool, but, um...well, you'll be fine.
0-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0=smug,Well, look at what we have here!  A blonde spacefarer in a jumpsuit.  Well, I guess we <i>almost</i> match...
0-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0=seductive,I'm a big fan of the bodysuit look, cutie.  So's a certain crewmate of mine I wish was here...space just makes it so much easier.
0-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, a <i>blonde</i>!  And she travels around in space, too.  If only you had the sense to wear my dress instead of that suit, we'd be twins.
0-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0=vain,A shapely little specimen, zipping around space in that provocative bodysuit?  You're a model Mejarian--if only Meia were here!
0-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:4=smug,Well, I guess if you've come this far, you might as well finish the job.  Go for it.
0-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:4=seductive,I'd expect nothing less, cutie.  Be sure to wow us!
0-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:4=teasing,Might as well seal the deal, even if it's just your thong.  You can do it, honey!
0-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:4=smug,Seems we've got similar taste in underwear.  Shame you're about to shoot it right off, but at least it'll look cool.
0-female_must_strip,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0=teasing,Totally devoted to scarlet, eh?  It certainly gets the heart racing...<i>and my appetite stirred</i>.
0-female_must_strip,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0=vain,Maybe <i>I</i> should get a fanciful nickname like Scarlet Witch...but not if it means restricting myself to one measly color.
0-female_must_strip,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0=seductive,What do you think would be a good nickname for me, dear?  <i>The Black Pirate</i>?  I can't pull off all-red like you do.
0-female_must_strip,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0=stretching,I wonder if all-red would look good on me.  I'm a pirate--I don't exactly have my pick of the litter with clothes!
0-female_must_strip,target:gogo,targetStage:0=teasing,What's your story, Miss Highlights?  Got any gum to share?
0-female_must_strip,target:gogo,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=teasing,Hey, toss me a piece of that gum, cutie.  I could use a snack while you tell me all about your "San Fransokyo" planet.
0-female_must_strip,target:gogo,targetStage:0=vain,Just gonna blow bubbles all day, or are you actually going to strip?  Either way, I wouldn't mind having some myself...
0-female_must_strip,target:gogo,targetStage:0=interested,You seem a little sour, Miss Gumball.  If those bubbles aren't cheering you up, just give me the rest to chew.
0-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, you're a cutie!  Yet surprisingly sturdy on your feet, what with all that armor.  <i>Don't bowl me right over</i>!
0-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=laughing,Hi there, darling!  You must be pretty tough to lug all that armor around.  <i>Afraid I'll stab you</i>?
0-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=seductive,What's with that armor, sweetheart?  You'd be a lot cuter without it...I know I'm a pirate, but I'd never kill someone as cute as you.
0-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=vain,Adorable hairstyle, cute face--but all that armor!  You a soldier, dear?  <i>Oh, please forgive my horrid piracy</i>!
0-female_must_strip,target:ciri,targetStage:0=smug,A <i>witcher</i>, eh?  Is that Earth dialect for witch?  Because I got called a witch for possession of Duero's sex book.
0-female_must_strip,target:ciri,targetStage:0=stretching,Is it <i>witcher</i> or <i>witch</i>?  Or, shall I say, <i>which</i> is it?
0-female_must_strip,target:ciri,targetStage:0=vain,So is a "witcher" even witchier than a witch?  I've been called a witch just for wanting to see what men have got in their pants.
0-female_must_strip,target:ciri,targetStage:0=smug,Forgive me for not being impressed with the term "witcher."  How <i>could</i> I be when all it takes for that on Mejare is a libido?
0-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=teasing,Ooh, you've got quite the set of muscles on you.  Shame Meia's not here.  She'd totally melt right in front of you!
0-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=seductive,Check out those legs, hot stuff!  You look like you could lift up the whole table with those things alone--good thing Meia's not here to fawn over you.
0-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=seductive,Omigosh, you should meet Meia, my boss--she's really icy, but women with muscles totally get her going.  And she'd try not to show it!
0-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, Miss Muscles, you into women?  Because my squadron leader Meia is all about exercise, and she <i>desperately</i> needs a girlfriend.
0-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:0=teasing,Ooh, an <i>assassin</i>.  I hope there's no bounty on my head!
0-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:0=stretching,Forgive this pirate for being a little on edge around an <i>assassin</i>.  There's a reward for my head, no doubt!
0-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:0=vain,You assassins always act so tough on the ground.  Let's see you take me in a dogfight!
0-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:0=teasing,You're a cute little thing, Miss Assassin.  I guess that helps in your line of work--people lower their guards.
0-female_must_strip,target:chica,targetStage:0=confused,...You know, I was shown films as a girl about how men were horrible monsters.  You're about what they looked like in those.
0-female_must_strip,target:chica,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>Ew</i>!  <i>Eek</i>!  <i>G-get away</i>!  <i>Stop</i>!  <i>What are you</i>?
0-female_must_strip,target:chica,targetStage:0=annoyed,...I really came here to meet some Earth women.  Not...whatever <i>this</i> is supposed to be.  Besides terrifying.
0-female_must_strip,target:chica,targetStage:0=angry,...What the hell am I looking at?  I wanted some cute girls, not a--a mechanical monstrosity!
0-female_must_strip,target:chica,targetStage:0=bored,You're a <i>robot</i>?  So like, you're Pyoro if he were designed by a blind woman?
0-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=confused,...You're not from Earth either, are you?  ...Or human.  Or cute.
0-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=confused,Say, Miss, I couldn't help but notice your...eye.  What planet are you from, exactly?
0-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=awkward,And here I thought I'd be seeing some <i>Earth</i> women in this place...or that I'd be the most exotic one.
0-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=laughing,Always nice to look a woman in the eye.  Singular.
0-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=smug,I guess they don't value depth perception on whatever planet you're from.  You must be a real steal.
0-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=interested,Magno Vivan's pirates accept all women...but with depth perception like yours, you wouldn't make it as a pilot.
0-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=interested,Hey, Eyebags, you gonna stay awake all game?  You look like you're drifting away already.
0-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=teasing,Talk about never leaving the house.  You look like you've never seen sunlight--and you're dozing off as we speak!
0-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=smug,Gotta be honest, sweetie--between the pale skin and the vacant look in your eyes, you're really reminding me of a zombie.
0-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=confused,So do you work super hard all day at your job?  Why do you look all gaunt and drowsy?  Get some beauty sleep, woman.
0-female_must_strip,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0=laughing,Judging by that sword, you're not from Earth either, Miss Crystal.  Where can I get one of those?
0-female_must_strip,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0=smug,Don't ask me why that thing is <i>drawn</i>, but damn if it isn't more impressive than my silly little rapier.  Got any extras?
0-female_must_strip,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, I like the look of that glowing sword!  Even <i>Mejare</i> hasn't though to put its lasers in blades yet.
0-female_must_strip,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0=smug,I could do for an upgrade on this rapier--would you please refer me to the planet where they make those glowing swords?
0-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=smug,<i>Well, well, well</i>.  We've got a <i>goddess</i> here, ladies...besides me, of course.
0-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=vain,A <i>goddess</i>, eh?  I guess that makes <i>two</i> at this table, then.
0-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=teasing,Just look at that shimmering green hair--and that ornamentation!  But I think I'm every bit the goddess you are, hot stuff.
0-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=laughing,Just look at that--two goddesses, near-opposite color schemes.  I guess I'm the <i>evil, nasty</i> one.
0-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0=smug,You know, I'd call Meia the strong, silent type...but she still speaks <i>occasionally</i>.
0-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0=laughing,Slow on the uptake?  The "strong, silent type" doesn't mean <i>literally</i> never speaking, you know.
0-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0=vain,Oh, don't feel bad.  I know you're speechless at the sight of me--but I'll do enough talking for both of us!
0-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0=teasing,Stunned into speechlessness?  I'm flattered, but really, honey, you can talk to me.  I won't mind.
0-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, Chell.  If I'm the most gorgeous woman you've ever met, don't say anything.
0-female_must_strip,target:chara,targetStage:0=bored,<i>Yeesh</i>.  Being as beautiful as I am, I try to let other girls down easy, but...you're hard to look at.
0-female_must_strip,target:chara,targetStage:0=angry,...<i>Ew</i>.  I really can't tell where your face begins and your body ends.
0-female_must_strip,target:chara,targetStage:0=smug,...It's times like these that I <i>really</i> appreciate how fortunate I am to be born this beautiful.  Take a look at the alternative.
0-female_must_strip,target:chara,targetStage:0=annoyed,As if you weren't ugly enough, you've got this horrible look in your eyes.  What's your problem?
0-female_must_strip,target:calisto,targetStage:0=interested,What's up, Miss Pantsuit?  You sure laugh a lot for someone dressed so prim-and-proper.
0-female_must_strip,target:calisto,targetStage:0=laughing,You some kind of businesswoman, Miss Yuck-it-up?  How could such an esteemed professional be so <i>depraved</i> as to play this?
0-female_must_strip,target:calisto,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey there, Chuckles!  You look more conservative than I've ever <i>dreamed</i> of being...and yet here you are, stripping with me.
0-female_must_strip,target:calisto,targetStage:0=teasing,Something funny, Miss Formalwear?  Make sure this nasty pirate doesn't put a ransom on your very professional head.
0-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0=interested,Talk about a big ball of misery.  Even your <i>skin</i> has turned all blue in despair.
0-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0=teasing,Show your face, honey!  Or are you trying to hide that weird blue skin?  Don't worry, it suits your miserable demeanor.
0-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0=laughing,I guess I'd be miserable, too, if I had the complexion of a grapefruit.
0-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0=stretching,I should bring Meia over here for some counseling.  Even <i>she's</i> not as miserable as Miss Blueberry here.
0-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, a dark-skinned woman!  We only have a few of those on Mejare--you'd turn heads, Miss Exotic.  And your outfit would fit right in.
0-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=teasing,Talk about a fierce look in your eye--and even skimpier clothing than me!  But you make it work, Miss Chocolate.
0-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=seductive,Hey there, cutie!  Between that exotic dark skin and light dress, you'd be a real steal where <i>I'm</i> from!
0-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=teasing,You're already a model Mejarian with that much skin showing, Miss Warrior.  <i>I'd like to see some sweat roll off those chocolate-flavored muscles</i>.
0-female_must_strip,target:meg,targetStage:0=vain,What's with the hat, honey?  Take it off and let your hair run wild, like any woman's should!
0-female_must_strip,target:meg,targetStage:0=smug,Matting your lovely hair under a hat like that...even if you <i>do</i> run all the time, I just can't understand.
0-female_must_strip,target:meg,targetStage:0=smug,A <i>killer</i>, you said?  The only killer here is what that hat's doing to your hair.
0-female_must_strip,target:meg,targetStage:0=teasing,Check out Miss Exercise over here.  There's no running from <i>this</i> game...so drop the hat and let your hair breathe a while.
0-female_must_strip,target:buffy,targetStage:0=confused,Do you seriously fight those "vampire" things?  I mean, you just don't look all that imposing.
0-female_must_strip,target:buffy,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, you're kind of cute!  Is that how you kill "vampires"?  Just making them let their guard down with your adorable face?
0-female_must_strip,target:buffy,targetStage:0=confused,So what's it take to kill these "vampires"?  Can't you just get the military to shoot them or something?  You don't seem all that special.
0-female_must_strip,target:buffy,targetStage:0=smug,For a girl called "Buffy," you sure seem awful willowy.  You <i>do</i> have a cute face, so maybe that's your strategy for killing those vampire things.
0-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, an armed woman--and one with chocolate flavoring!  You're like an extreme version of my tan little gun-nut girlfriend.
0-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0=vain,I'm not sure what's most intimidating--that height, that imposing dark complexion, or that huge mechanical firearm!
0-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0=stretching,If only I brought my cute little Barnette here.  She'd be head-over-heels for a woman with a man's gun!
0-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0=teasing,You might be even taller than me, Miss Nighttime.  That might turn even more heads on Mejare than your rather large firearm!
0-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0=smug,Come now, honey.  You can't waltz in waving that huge kinetic weapon around and expect to make any friends.
0-female_must_strip,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=laughing,And I thought <i>I</i> was trying to be seductive!  Here comes Miss Succubus, decked out in her Halloween costume.
0-female_must_strip,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=smug,Don't think you're slipping that past me, honey.  We have Halloween on Mejare...and I've dressed as a succubus before, yes.
0-female_must_strip,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=interested,Nice costume, Miss Seductress.  Looks like I have competition for all my man-hunting tonight.
0-female_must_strip,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=teasing,Mejare has stories of succubi, too...they really know how to tire a woman out.  I guess you must have a lot of fun with men here.
0-female_must_strip,target:zoey,targetStage:0=smug,These "zombies" of yours don't sound so bad...but then, I guess you don't have a fabulous fighter spaceship, do you?
0-female_must_strip,target:zoey,targetStage:0=stretching,See, my Vandread can shield a whole planet.  So I think we could quarantine your little zombie virus.
0-female_must_strip,target:zoey,targetStage:0=vain,A zombie virus, eh?  Not to brag, but my Vandread helped avoid the spread of disease on a planet once...<i>I'm so talented</i>.
0-female_must_strip,target:zoey,targetStage:0=laughing,The more you describe these "zombies," the more they just sound like men.  You sure that's not what you mean?
0-female_must_strip,target:blake_v4,targetStage:0=laughing,Way to go and expose your entire midriff there, Blake.  Who do you think you are, Dita?  <i>Me</i>?
0-female_must_strip,target:blake_v4,targetStage:0=interested,Nice vest you're rocking there, honey.  But you forgot to cover up your midsection...like me.
0-female_must_strip,target:blake_v4,targetStage:0=smug,Taking a few fashion tips from <i>me</i>, are you, Blake?  What with that midriff fully on display and all.
0-female_must_strip,target:blake_v4,targetStage:0=teasing,Well, aren't <i>you</i> looking more exposed than usual?  But as far as exposure goes, the midsection's a good choice.
0-female_must_strip,target:shego,targetStage:0=laughing,You OK there, Miss Jumpsuit?  You're looking a little green-around-the-frills.
0-female_must_strip,target:shego,targetStage:0=interested,Is all the stripping and teasing making you nauseous, dearie?  Just trying to grin and bear it?
0-female_must_strip,target:shego,targetStage:0=teasing,I'm liking the style on the bodysuit, honey--it helps obscure your sickly green hue.
0-female_must_strip,target:shego,targetStage:0=smug,Mejarians have some say in their skin tone from genetic engineering...I don't think we can do green, but then I doubt it'd be too popular.
0-female_must_strip,target:blake,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, the black-and-white look is a classic!  Very striking and confident with that contrast.  And such a cute little bow!
0-female_must_strip,target:blake,targetStage:0=teasing,Maybe it's just me, but you've got a Mejarian sense of style!  Clashing colors, nice and sexy and revealing!  A woman after my own heart.
0-female_must_strip,target:blake,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, that's a cute outfit, Blake!  I love this dress, but I don't have anything quite as fancy as all that clashing-colors business.
0-female_must_strip,target:blake,targetStage:0=teasing,<i>Mmm</i>...the lace, the contrast, the <i>heels</i>!  I like your style, Blake!  Not bad for an Earth girl.
0-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0=excited,Omigosh!  <i>Omigosh</i>!  You are just the <i>cutest</i> little thing, Nagisa!  You're practically a little girl--who forced you to be here?
0-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0=seductive,<i>Ohhhh</i>, you're the most adorable little cinnamon roll of a girl, Nagisa!  Who rolled you in sugar before forcing you to come here?
0-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0=seductive,<i>You're such a sweet little thing, Nagisa</i>!  My heart melts every time you stammer.  Did you lose a bet to be here?
0-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0=seductive,How'd this sugary-sweet cutie in a school uniform end up in this seedy place?  I just want to <i>squeeze</i> you, not strip you!
0-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0=seductive,And I thought Earth girls were cold-blooded organ harvesters.  You couldn't harvest a <i>plant</i>, cutie!  How'd you get here?
0-female_must_strip,target:shazza,targetStage:0=smug,Quite the interesting accent you've got there.  I can't quite call it refined, but then again, I <i>am</i> a filthy pirate.
0-female_must_strip,target:shazza,targetStage:0=stretching,I guess when I lead a life of crime, I can't get away with calling you uncivilized-sounding.  Actions mean so much more!
0-female_must_strip,target:shazza,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=laughing,Interesting dialect you have on Planet Australia.  Don't you ever get tired of misunderstanding each other?
0-female_must_strip,target:shazza,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=laughing,This <i>Australia</i> planet certainly has a way with words...mostly for making them incomprehensible.
0-female_must_strip,target:lilith,targetStage:0=vain,Planet <i>Pandora</i>, was it?  What a lovely name!  I might have to retire there with my darling Barnette when we're older.
0-female_must_strip,target:lilith,targetStage:0=vain,Pandora sounds like such a <i>gorgeous</i> name.  I think I'll call my first daughter that--surely Barnette won't mind.
0-female_must_strip,target:lilith,targetStage:0=teasing,Barnette and I are <i>always</i> discussing baby names.  Pandora sounds positively wonderful!
0-female_must_strip,target:lilith,targetStage:0=teasing,A hunter, eh?  And what do hunters hunt on lovely little Pandora--a cute name, by the way.
0-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:0=laughing,Hey, Kitty-cat.  You're supposed to strip <i>during</i> the game, not <i>before</i> it.
0-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:0=interested,Nice Halloween costume, Kitty, but maybe you should have picked something a little more complex for this game.
0-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:0=smug,Not too interested in winning, huh, Kitty-cat?  Unless you've brought some yarn-balls you plan on counting.
0-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:0=smug,I only know about cats from Mejare's zoos...they only showed the females, of course.  But they were definitely more covered than <i>you</i> are.
0-female_must_strip,target:faye,targetStage:0=smug,Beautiful hair, makeup, spacefaring?  With <i>both</i> of us running around, this table's going to get sick of the archetype.
0-female_must_strip,target:faye,targetStage:0=laughing,Do we have a fellow star-crossing seductress on our hands?  I'm not sure there's enough meat for both of us.
0-female_must_strip,target:faye,targetStage:0=teasing,<i>Hey, good-lookin'.</i>  Trying to steal my thunder with the "seductress-from-space" angle?  I don't mind--<i>I like women, too</i>.
0-female_must_strip,target:faye,targetStage:0=seductive,You didn't doll yourself up like that just to please some <i>men</i>, did you?  Come show this fellow spacefarer what you can do.
0-female_must_strip,target:evie,targetStage:0=vain,So what's your story?  You can cast magic spells or something?  If it's true, sign me up--it'll be another wonderful thing about me!
0-female_must_strip,target:evie,targetStage:0=vain,Some might call my <i>beauty</i> magical...I'm inclined to agree.
0-female_must_strip,target:evie,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, honey.  Cast a spell on <i>me</i>...one that makes me even prettier.  Now <i>that</i> would be magic!
0-female_must_strip,target:evie,targetStage:0=interested,Alright, I've seen enough crazy Paksis-magic to believe your tales.  But why don't you put your money where your mouth is?
0-female_must_strip,target:seven,targetStage:0=teasing,Seems bodysuits are more popular among spacegoers than even <i>I</i> figured.  Works for me--I like your figure.
0-female_must_strip,target:seven,targetStage:0=seductive,<i>My, my, honey</i>!  You've got some interesting decorations, but that suit is making me fall in love already.
0-female_must_strip,target:seven,targetStage:0=vain,I really ought to try out one of those bodysuits myself...or maybe stuff Barnette in one.  They're just so <i>revealing</i>!
0-female_must_strip,target:seven,targetStage:0=vain,Those jumpsuits really are the best, especially when you're in low gravity.  The enemy should know how beautiful you are!
0-female_must_strip,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=seductive,Oh?  And what do we have here, besides the most adorably shy little woman I've ever seen?
0-female_must_strip,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=stretching,Such a cutie...and in a traditional-looking dress!  Hard to believe someone so shy would even be here.
0-female_must_strip,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=seductive,Something wrong, honey?  <i>You've hardly been looking me in the eye</i>.  It's OK, I don't bite.
0-female_must_strip,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=vain,Why so shy, Elizabeth?  Confidence makes women ten times as beautiful--just look at me!
0-female_must_strip,target:elena,targetStage:0=teasing,Little Miss Princess wants to play strip poker, does she?  Well, I hope you don't mind if this nasty pirate holds you hostage.
0-female_must_strip,target:elena,targetStage:0=laughing,Looking a little out of your element, Miss Blueblood.  Gonna prove that you're really better than the rest of us like your title implies?
0-female_must_strip,target:elena,targetStage:0=smug,Look at Miss Princess, lugging around a scepter just to prove she's better than the peons.  We'll see how you enjoy stripping down like us.
0-female_must_strip,target:elena,targetStage:0=annoyed,Royals really get on my nerves, you know...mostly because I'm <i>not</i> one, despite actually being better-looking.
0-female_must_strip,target:lux,targetStage:0=laughing,A covert agent, eh?  I guess if an alien woman knows that, you've already failed at your job.
0-female_must_strip,target:lux,targetStage:0=teasing,So what are you so <i>covert</i> about, Miss Agent?  We pirates just charge in and gun the place down before they know what hit them!
0-female_must_strip,target:lux,targetStage:0=interested,What kind of covert agent fights with light?  You know, the thing that makes your position <i>clearer</i>?
0-female_must_strip,target:lux,targetStage:0=smug,Oho--we've got an <i>agent</i> on our hands.  Wouldn't be the first we had on our ship--and we made her come around to our side.
0-female_must_strip,target:elaine,targetStage:0=seductive,And what do we have here?  An <i>Earth</i> pirate?  And with a sword, to boot!  Interesting...
0-female_must_strip,target:elaine,targetStage:0=teasing,I see even Earth pirates understand the subtle elegance of a blade!  And you've got some <i>luxurious</i> hair yourself.
0-female_must_strip,target:elaine,targetStage:0=seductive,Oho--a fellow pirate?  I'd absolutely <i>love</i> to have a drink later--maybe you could teach me how to handle my sword better.
0-female_must_strip,target:elaine,targetStage:0=seductive,<i>Well, now</i>!  You Earth pirates don't dress like we do on Mejare--but your choice of weapon isn't too far off.  Can you show me around?
0-female_must_strip,target:shantae,targetStage:0=teasing,Ooh, I think that dark complexion is <i>exotic</i>--so do most Mejarians.  You got a thing for women, Miss Genie?
0-female_must_strip,target:shantae,targetStage:0=seductive,So what's a "genie," anyway?  Does that mean "cute chocolate-flavored girl"?  Because I think I like genies, then.
0-female_must_strip,target:shantae,targetStage:0=seductive,I like your style, Miss Genie!  You're as revealing as my girlfriend Barnette--a little tanner, though.
0-female_must_strip,target:shantae,targetStage:0=teasing,Ooh, the way you move your hips is <i>exquisite</i>, Miss Genie!  I want to learn how to add a little vanilla flavoring to that, if you follow.
0-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=vain,Hel-<i>looo, camera</i>!  Over here, sweetie--get whatever angle you like best.
0-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=vain,Omigosh, you brought a <i>camera</i>?  A sign from the heavens!  Now all of Earth will get to see my beautiful naked body!
0-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=teasing,Looking to get some photographs of the exotic alien woman, were you?  But now you've got a whole <i>different</i> reason to capture me.
0-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=vain,Go right ahead with that camera, dearie.  It's always been shameful how I've been in the media for piracy instead of beauty.
0-female_must_strip,target:dawn,targetStage:0=confused,What'd you say you raised?  Those little <i>Poker</i>--whatevers?  Is that why you're playing this game?
0-female_must_strip,target:dawn,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, dearie, that exotic blue hair will take you further than weird animal training--you should be a model for shampoo or something.
0-female_must_strip,target:dawn,targetStage:0=confused,Mejare has barely any animals at all, so this whole "pokey-mon" thing is lost on me.  And they just do whatever you say?
0-female_must_strip,target:dawn,targetStage:0=laughing,So could you train <i>men</i> the way you do these <i>poker</i>-whatevers?  Because <i>that</i> would be quite interesting...
0-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey there, Miss Gunslinger!  You're not gonna <i>fire</i> those things, are you?  My girlfriend collects those sorts of guns.
0-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=seductive,Omigosh, are those antique men's kinetic weapons?  My girlfriend collects them!  You should meet her.
0-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=seductive,Always good to see an armed woman!  My girlfriend, Barnette, is totally obsessed with men's mechanical guns like yours.
0-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=vain,Hey, Miss Gunslinger!  You should lighten up a little and show those men's kinetic guns to my girlfriend.  She's a total connoisseur.
0-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=teasing,I like the grace of Mejarian laser rings myself, but you want some serious interest on those men's guns of yours?  Talk to my girlfriend.
0-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0=excited,Ooh, an Earth woman with green hair!  My girlfriend Barnette has green hair...and she is the <i>cutest</i> thing!
0-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, I didn't know Earth women could have green hair!  I've always considered it the most cutely exotic thing about Barnette.
0-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0=seductive,A sword <i>and</i> lovely green hair?  You must be a sign that Barnette and I are ready for children, sweetie.
0-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0=teasing,Ooh, green hair on a woman never fails to get me going.  But don't worry, my verdantly-colored girlfriend can handle the rest.
0-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0=smug,Dear god, girl, you'd cower if a light breeze rolled in.  What's the big deal with a little <i>exposure</i>?
0-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0=seductive,You are just <i>so</i> cute.  How do you feel about women, little Miss?  <i>Do my breasts bother you</i>?
0-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0=vain,Shy around nudity, sweetie?  Did the big, bad Earth men beat this into you?  Just <i>enjoy</i> yourself...
0-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0=laughing,You're such a nervous wreck that I just feel bad for teasing you.  Way to ruin my fun.
0-female_must_strip,target:daria,targetStage:0=laughing,Way to half-ass your outfit, honey.  You look like you picked out whatever fell on you when you opened your closet!
0-female_must_strip,target:daria,targetStage:0=interested,...So is the "zero-effort" look how you attract Earth men?  Have I been going at this all wrong?
0-female_must_strip,target:daria,targetStage:0=smug,I should have known--men are too simple to understand complex outfits, so they respond better to cobbled-together looks like yours.
0-female_must_strip,target:daria,targetStage:0=laughing,Gotta be honest here, sweetheart--you don't look like the type to be playing this.  Those glasses aren't helping you pick out appealing clothes.
0-female_must_strip,target:sharla,targetStage:0=teasing,Good thing you're a medic, because that mysterious dark complexion is making my heart beat ever faster.
0-female_must_strip,target:sharla,targetStage:0=seductive,Do you know how many women on Mejare are dark-skinned, Miss Medic?  Not enough, I say...even my Barnette is just a little tan.
0-female_must_strip,target:sharla,targetStage:0=vain,Oh, Miss Medic?  I think I'm coming down with something--<i>love for your chocolate flavoring</i>!
0-female_must_strip,target:sharla,targetStage:0=teasing,You dress pretty casually for a medic, but that exotic dark skin is helping me overlook your shoddy sense of professionalism.
0-female_must_strip,target:daphne,targetStage:0=smug,Oh good, a fellow blonde...and tall, too.  Wasn't sure Earth girls could fit either category.
0-female_must_strip,target:daphne,targetStage:0=vain,You're not a bad looker yourself, honey.  Must be our wonderful blonde genetics that inform the rest of our bodies!
0-female_must_strip,target:daphne,targetStage:0=vain,You solve mysteries, is that right?  Well...there's no mystery about how wonderful it is to be blonde.
0-female_must_strip,target:daphne,targetStage:0=stretching,<i>Ho-hum</i>.  Another blonde in a dress...I'm just kidding, you're still cute.
0-female_must_strip,target:daisy,targetStage:0=smug,Ohoho.  Miss Boring-old-Brunette puts on a fancy store-bought dress and suddenly thinks she's better than the rest of us.
0-female_must_strip,target:daisy,targetStage:0=interested,So, "Princesses" are like rulers, right?  So what makes <i>you</i> so special, girlie?
0-female_must_strip,target:daisy,targetStage:0=annoyed,I've never subscribed to the idea of royalty.  What, some plain-jane with a chip on her shoulder just <i>decides</i> she's better than me?
0-female_must_strip,target:daisy,targetStage:0=vain,So what if I had to steal my dress?  I'm still more beautiful than Miss Too-Big-for-her-Brooches here, with her servants and fancy title.
0-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=laughing,Well, aren't <i>you</i> a tight little ball of sexual energy!  I guess it's got nowhere to go in that tiny frame of yours.
0-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=vain,You've got a lot of libido packed into a little body.  Must be the effects of Earth men...we Mejarians are <i>tasteful</i> in our sexuality.
0-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=laughing,<i>Why, I never</i>!  You're so dreadfully lewd, Miss Tan...do men just like women on the shorter side?
0-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=vain,You must get a lot of attention from men to be all amped-up like this.  <i>Tell me a tall woman still has a chance</i>!
0-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=laughing,What's up, Four-Feet-Four-Eyes?  You look like someone brought you here at gunpoint.
0-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=laughing,Oh, look, the egghead love child of Parfet and Dita--nerdy and <i>and</i> eccentric!  How's the weather at the bottom of the earth?
0-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0,marker:fama_and_oma=laughing,I keep trying to look over your outfit, but my eyes just keep moving too fast and missing it.  Did your Fama not produce milk, shorty?
0-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=interested,You're such a cute little bespectacled spectacle--but damn if you don't look eleven.  Where's the other two feet of your body?
0-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=smug,Where'd you say you were from?  Planet <i>Korea</i>?  Well then, it seems Korea and Mejare share a fashion sense...
0-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=teasing,You're a cutie, Miss Bodysuit, if a little on the short side.  Is that just how they make women over on Planet Korea?
0-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0=vain,If only Meia were here.  She dresses just like you do, D.Va...we should find out who wears it better!
0-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0=seductive,You're an adorable little thing, D.Va!  All wrapped up in that cute bodysuit, just like a certain <i>other</i> pilot I know.
0-female_must_strip,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:0=interested,...Can I maybe just call you "DMG" for short?  Because <i>Dark Magician Girl</i> is a hell of a mouthful.
0-female_must_strip,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:0,marker:fama_and_oma=confused,...Don't you have an actual name?  You know, like the one your Fama gives you?
0-female_must_strip,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:0=teasing,You've really got to give yourself a snappier nickname, dearie...men aren't bright enough to remember that many words.
0-female_must_strip,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:0=stretching,If you really <i>are</i> a magician, color me interested...but that clunky name could use a shortening or two.
0-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:0=seductive,I understand, dear.  You're so stunned by my beauty that you hid your own face in shame.  I'm sure you're still cute!
0-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:0=seductive,Don't hide that pretty little face on <i>my</i> account, honey.  You've certainly got a beautiful <i>figure</i>.
0-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:0=teasing,Nice little bodysuit you've got there, even if you plan on being the Masked Woman.  I know a sugar-and-ice girl with your fashion sense.
0-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:0=laughing,You've got a lot of sass for someone who won't show her face, Miss Masked.  Hiding some grisly injury, or just your own embarrassment?
0-female_must_strip,target:marceline,targetStage:0=bored,...Is someone playing a Halloween prank on me?  Where are your eyes?  How are you floating?  <i>Earth</i>...
0-female_must_strip,target:marceline,targetStage:0=confused,Don't get me wrong, Mejare has Halloween just like Earth...but we just dress up.  That doesn't look like a costume.
0-female_must_strip,target:marceline,targetStage:0=confused,...OK, it's hard to comment on what's weird about you when there's so much to choose from.  Do I start with your floating or your eyes?
0-female_must_strip,target:marceline,targetStage:0=confused,...Is this Earth?  Did I get the right planet?  Because you like even more alien that I do, with that skin...and no eyes.
0-female_must_strip,target:blackrose,targetStage:0=confused,I was gonna say something about that cool dark skin, but apparently...you're just some sort of image?  What's <i>that</i> about?
0-female_must_strip,target:blackrose,targetStage:0=frustrated,You're..."virtual"?  Listen, honey, you can't just assume we know what these things mean.  Piloting's a busy life, you know!
0-female_must_strip,target:blackrose,targetStage:0=bored,Wait, so you're not really here, and you're some kind of "virtual" avatar?  Earth has really gotten advanced from all the technology they keep stealing.
0-female_must_strip,target:blackrose,targetStage:0=annoyed,Hey, if we can just use computers to <i>project</i> ourselves here, why didn't anyone tell me?  I had to <i>fly</i> all the way here!
0-female_must_strip,target:tifa,targetStage:0=interested,Ohoho.  A <i>martial artist</i>, honey?  Well, I can certainly see where all your momentum comes from.
0-female_must_strip,target:tifa,targetStage:0=laughing,With a figure like that, I imagine you've developed your <i>own</i> style of martial arts...centered around counterweights.
0-female_must_strip,target:tifa,targetStage:0=teasing,<i>My, my</i>!  Those things outdo even mine, sweetie...but I don't pretend I'm some sort of athlete.
0-female_must_strip,target:tifa,targetStage:0=seductive,Bigger breasts <i>and</i> martial arts skill?  Jeez, you're outmaneuvering me left and right.  Good thing you're such a cutie!
0-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, girlie, someone told me you're a model on Earth...is that true?  I'd like to get in on that...
0-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0=teasing,You're pretty cute, honey, but I hear people like legs on their models...better hope <i>I</i> don't hit the scene.
0-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0=vain,Hey now, sweetheart.  You're cute, but there's no need to brag about being a model...not when a <i>Mejarian's</i> on the scene.
0-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0=teasing,Don't be so full of yourself, Miss Model...I'd be a model, too, if not for Mejare's pesky little corrupt government.
0-female_must_strip,target:pyrrha,targetStage:0=laughing,Hey there, Miss Mind-Your-Manners.  You talk the talk, but that cleavage tells me you've got a wild side.
0-female_must_strip,target:pyrrha,targetStage:0=teasing,You're awfully polite for a woman perverted enough to come here in the first place.  Just trying to throw us off, cutie?
0-female_must_strip,target:pyrrha,targetStage:0=stretching,Yeah, yeah, I don't buy the whole polite-and-formal act from a girl willing to strip nude in public.  Just waiting for the good stuff?
0-female_must_strip,target:pyrrha,targetStage:0=interested,You talk pretty prim-and-proper, dear...and yet here you are, stripping nude for us.  Do you have a dirty side, or did you lose a bet?
0-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:6=laughing,Even with all that, you're still forced to be naked?  It's official--you're totally into this.
0-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:6=teasing,Even with your little flower setup, dearie, I think you're out of options.  Cough up the good stuff--I'm convinced you want to.
0-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:6=vain,<i>That</i> ought to do it, unless you've got more of the plant kingdom at your disposal.  Isn't this what you wanted, playing this game?
0-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:6=seductive,Oh, I'm sure you're cute, dear--I remember your butt!  Besides...I seriously doubt this isn't turning you on.
0-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:5=teasing,Don't stop now, honey!  I hope I'm not imposing...but I'd <i>love</i> to hear some more French!
0-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:5=seductive,Your language is the absolute <i>coolest</i>, darling!  Say some more for me, if you don't mind...I hope I'm not being a burden.
0-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:5=teasing,I'm not demanding too much of you, am I, Marinette?  I just <i>love</i> your language...and this should take your mind off stripping.
0-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:5=vain,Normally I'm interested in women's tongues for <i>other</i> reasons...but with you, I can't get over how cool your language is!
0-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:5=seductive,I think I'm jealous, Marinette!  Not only are you the <i>cutest</i> little blueberry muffin of a girl, but your language is to <i>die</i> for!
0-female_must_strip,target:tina,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=teasing,Planet <i>America</i>, hm?  Never heard of it--but it seems to have produced as least one knockout!
0-female_must_strip,target:tina,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=thinking,<i>Britain</i>, <i>Japan</i>, and now your <i>America</i>.  I'm starting to think these aren't actually planets...and Earth people are just very splintered.
0-female_must_strip,target:tina,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=teasing,Hey, now, Miss Wrestler...this place has a <i>no-touching</i> rule, even if Planet <i>America</i> doesn't.
0-female_must_strip,target:tina,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=vain,I don't know how they do things on Planet America, honey, but you keep your wrestling hands to yourself--I'm taken!
0-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:6=bored,The storm is almost over...or maybe this is just the calm before it.
0-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:6=bored,I think I'd prefer the <i>Harvest's</i> company at this point.
0-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:6=bored,Oh, you're still here.  Why not just strip more than one thing at a time?  Well, too late.
0-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:6=bored,I still don't know who made you wait this long to show what you wanted.
0-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:5=smug,Well, that's that.  Do what you must behind those flowers.
0-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:5=interested,You can hide yourself with the flowers, honey, but you're naked, so that's a loss in my book.
0-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:5=smug,Nice try with the foliage, dear, but no one's going to call that clothing.  You're out.
0-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:5=stretching,<i>And so the frightened little princess falls before her betters.  Even the forest spirits couldn't save her</i>.
0-female_must_strip,target:hinata,targetStage:0=smug,So what are these "ninjas" all about, huh?  Disappearing into the night doesn't sound useful in a game like <i>this</i>.
0-female_must_strip,target:hinata,targetStage:0=teasing,Don't tell me your going to use those ninja skills to hide your body, now.
0-female_must_strip,target:hinata,targetStage:0=stretching,Certainly an impressive profile, Miss Ninja.  Think you could show us just <i>how</i> impressive?
0-female_must_strip,target:hinata,targetStage:0=interested,Does "ninja" just mean you wear a headband?  Sounds like a lofty title for my Barnette to accidentally fall under.
0-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:1=vain,Should've figured Little Miss Princess would want to break away and strip for strangers.  You must be so sheltered!
0-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:1=teasing,Oh, is it true you're a <i>princess</i>, darling?  That would explain the haughty attitude...and the phony embarrassment.
0-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:1=teasing,I'm a pirate, dearie...and no huge fan of authority figures.  Luckily, I <i>love</i> girls who strip for fun and pleasure.
0-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:1=interested,So you're a princess, is that it?  You should know you're not fooling me--you <i>love</i> being ogled, don't you?
0-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:1=interested,A princess, hm?  Only makes sense that such a public figure as yourself would love exhibiting her body for total strangers.
0-female_must_strip,target:tracer,targetStage:0=teasing,All about speed, eh, girlie?  Try not to blink right out of your costume...or back to before I won, you little cheat.
0-female_must_strip,target:tracer,targetStage:0=vain,Hey, where's <i>my</i> time travel?  Actually, there's nothing about my life I regret, so no issue.
0-female_must_strip,target:tracer,targetStage:0=seductive,Mind if I borrow that time device, sweetie?  I want to fall in love with my Barnette <i>all over again</i>.
0-female_must_strip,target:tracer,targetStage:0=teasing,If that thing can really travel you back in time, that's pretty fantastic.  How many times have we done this match over again, <i>loser</i>?
0-female_must_strip,target:tracer,targetStage:0=smug,You know what I've learned as a pirate?  You only get one chance to do things right.  This time-travel business sounds like a crutch.
0-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:0=vain,Check out that outfit!  Going for the natural look?  So would I, if Mejare had much of nature.
0-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:0=interested,Did you just piece that outfit together from bits you found in a forest?  It doesn't even look that bad, but...it's certainly all-natural.
0-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:0=vain,If only Mejare had the same verdant natural resources as Earth.  Perhaps then I could try to emulate your all-natural style.
0-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:0=vain,Mejare's a little too wasteful to have the greenery for me to dress like <i>you</i> do.  You can see how little we wear to compensate.
0-female_must_strip,target:alpha,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=laughing,You're pale as marble, dearie!  Do they not have a sun on this "Japan" planet?
0-female_must_strip,target:alpha,targetStage:0=confused,Are you...<i>flickering</i>?  Are you some kind of hologram?  That might explain your skin tone.
0-female_must_strip,target:alpha,targetStage:0=confused,You OK there, sweetheart?  You look a little pale...and non-corporeal.
0-female_must_strip,target:alpha,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=vain,And I thought <i>Mejarians</i> liked the pale look!  This "Japan" planet puts us to shame.
0-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:1=seductive,Omigosh, Palutena, that gorgeous green hair is even longer than mine!  My <i>girlfriend</i> has green hair, you know.
0-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:1=vain,How do you <i>maintain</i> all that hair?  I have the best time washing mine...and wrapping my green-haired girlfriend in it.
0-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:1=seductive,You know who else has beautiful green hair, Miss Goddess?  My girlfriend, Barnette.  That sweet little thing is back on the ship!
0-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:1=stretching,So is that lovely green hair just the goddess's right?  My girlfriend got hers from standard Mejarian genetic trickery.
0-female_must_strip,target:alice_degracia,targetStage:0=smug,Hey, hey, hey!  Check out the <i>all-purple</i> look.  That's a new one...
0-female_must_strip,target:alice_degracia,targetStage:0=vain,Hey, honey, color <i>contrasts</i> show confidence.  Would I look nearly as stunning if this dress matched my hair?
0-female_must_strip,target:alice_degracia,targetStage:0=smug,Purple hair's certainly got an exotic appeal...too bad mine is boring old blonde.  As for the matching outfit, I don't follow the logic.
0-female_must_strip,target:alice_degracia,targetStage:0=teasing,Quite the exotic color scheme you've got there, sweetie.  Too bad you forgot to mix it up at all.
0-female_must_strip,target:hope,targetStage:0=confused,Hey, dearie, no reason to come out knives-swinging.  I've got my rapier sheathed like a civilized woman.
0-female_must_strip,target:hope,targetStage:0=awkward,Settle down there, honey.  There's something awfully scary about wearing a smile with a knife out.
0-female_must_strip,target:hope,targetStage:0=frustrated,I know I brought a sword, sweetheart, but that was just for fashion.  Don't turn this place into a bloodbath.
0-female_must_strip,target:hope,targetStage:0=shocked,Well, hi there, cutie--er, uh, <i>knife-wielding</i> cutie.  Yeah.  Carry on.
0-female_must_strip,target:may,targetStage:0=smug,What'd you say you did?  Train in poker?  Well, it didn't save you <i>that</i> hand...unless they're animals or something.
0-female_must_strip,target:may,targetStage:0=stretching,So, you're all about <i>poker</i>-mon, was it?  Well, seems you've been training all your life for this game...
0-female_must_strip,target:may,targetStage:0=frustrated,These <i>pokuhmon</i> things just sound like more trouble than they're worth.  Animals in Mejarian zoos are so <i>dirty</i>!
0-female_must_strip,target:may,targetStage:0=confused,You're an animal trainer, isn't that right?  Or was it <i>poker</i>...mons?  Not following the Earth slang here.
0-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:0=confused,...I had no idea Earth girls came in so many...flavors.  How'd your parents pick <i>grape</i>?
0-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:0=confused,...So, uh, that skin color.  Am I missing something?  Is this a common look on Earth?
0-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:0=confused,Gotta be honest, girlie, I'm out of the loop on what Earth people look like.  Is that complexion of yours...<i>normal</i>?
0-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:0=confused,What's this about <i>ponies</i> that you keep going on about?  Is a "pony" a purple Earthling?  I'm totally lost here.
0-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:0=awkward,...Are you alright there, honey?  With the knife and all?
0-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:0=awkward,...You know, I carry the rapier mostly for fashion...maybe you could relegate that knife to the same thing?
0-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:0=annoyed,...Could you maybe put down the knife, sweetheart?  Hey, are you listening?
0-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:0=bored,What a weirdo...knives are just as deadly as swords, with none of the style.
0-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:0=frustrated,Better keep my sword on hand, with <i>this</i> nutcase on the scene.
0-female_must_strip,target:aiyana,targetStage:0=vain,That tan is something else, and your energy is boundless!  Most Mejarians opt for pale, as you can see...
0-female_must_strip,target:aiyana,targetStage:0=teasing,Barnette's kind of tan like you are.  She's cute, too, so women can pull it off!
0-female_must_strip,target:aiyana,targetStage:0=teasing,Slow down there, tiger.  That energy is going to turn you into a tan smear on the ground.
0-female_must_strip,target:aiyana,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=confused,Tan is certainly a look on Mejare, but pale is the norm for us...where'd you say you were from?  Planet Austria?
0-female_must_strip,target:uhura,targetStage:0=smug,Oh, don't worry, dear.  We on Mejare are well aware of Earth's space program...you <i>have</i> tried to harvest us, after all.
0-female_must_strip,target:uhura,targetStage:0=teasing,You can call it "Star Fleet" if you want, dear, but it'll always be the Harvest to me.  <i>You nasty organ-stealers, you</i>.
0-female_must_strip,target:uhura,targetStage:0=vain,I don't buy this whole "peaceful space travel" angle, Miss Star Fleet.  I've spent far too much time fending off your little Harvest cubes!
0-female_must_strip,target:uhura,targetStage:0=smug,Yeah, yeah, I'm sure this "Star Fleet" is super peaceful.  Just remember I've got a Vandread...so I'm not afraid of you.
0-female_must_strip,target:piper,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey there, Miss Meterstick.  Thanks for not letting my ego get too big when it came to height.
0-female_must_strip,target:piper,targetStage:0=stretching,Every woman I know says I'm tall.  Do you turn heads when you enter a room, too?
0-female_must_strip,target:piper,targetStage:0=vain,Oh, good, a woman who understands what it's like towering over people.  The intimidation can be kind of fun, no?
0-female_must_strip,target:piper,targetStage:0=stretching,Men seem to be taller than women.  I guess I wouldn't turn as many heads on Earth, then...but you'd do it no matter what.
0-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:5=shocked,Bless you--<i>oh no</i>.
0-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:5=shocked,Who sneezed--<i>eep!  N-not Launch</i>!
0-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:5=shocked,<i>Ack!  Why'd you have to sneeze again</i>?
0-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:5=shocked,<i>Eek!  N-not again!  My heart can't take this</i>!
0-female_must_strip,target:amy_rose,targetStage:0=confused,You're, uh, looking a little pink there.  And what's up with those ears?
0-female_must_strip,target:amy_rose,targetStage:0=confused,I know I joke about Earth girls being aliens, but, uh, you really do look kind of weird.  What's with all the...<i>fur</i>?
0-female_must_strip,target:amy_rose,targetStage:0=confused,Wait, did they say you're a...a <i>hedgehog</i> or something?  Is that some kind of animal?  That would explain the, uh, pink...and ears.
0-female_must_strip,target:amy_rose,targetStage:0=confused,...I really can't make heads or tails of you.  You kind of <i>look</i> like you should have a tail, what with that fur and all.
0-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0=vain,Ooh, you're into art?  Do you think you could paint a portrait of me?  Maybe frame it in your collection to capture my eternal beauty?
0-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0=teasing,Ooh, so you're an <i>artist</i>?  I know a particularly handsome man that can paint, too...think you could capture me better?
0-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0=vain,Did you say you go to school with men?  I was never that big on school--except for art, where we could finally appreciate <i>beauty</i>!
0-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0=vain,Students tend to be such bores--like that egghead Parfet.  But an <i>art</i> student?  Now we're talking--my whole body is art!
0-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0=seductive,Check out that messy hair...and adorable student outfit!  Did you say you're a <i>witch</i>?
0-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0=smug,Watch out, ladies, we've got a full-blown <i>magician</i> on our hands.  On Mejare you get called a witch for saying men aren't the worst thing ever.
0-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0=vain,A <i>witch</i>, eh?  Forgive my doubts...that jealous old hag of a judge called me a witch just for having that anatomy book!
0-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0=seductive,Awww!  She even brought a little magic wand to complete the costume!  <i>You're so cute, Miss Witch</i>.
0-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0=vain,Between you and that time I got called a witch for showing interest in men, witches are just <i>irresistible</i> these days.
0-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:4=excited,Forget the common language, Marinette, your "French" sounds like the most <i>romantic</i> thing!  You've <i>got</i> to say some more.
0-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:4=excited,<i>Oooh, Marinette</i>!  Can you say some more "French"?  My heart beats faster every time your tongue slips!
0-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:4=seductive,You should say some more French, Marinette!  It's got the <i>silkiest</i> sound to it--it makes my heart go wild!
0-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:4=seductive,Oooh, Marinette, since it's your turn, can you throw out some more of this "French"?  It sounds like a <i>lover's</i> language.
0-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:0=seductive,Hi there, dearie!  That's an absolutely <i>adorable</i> hat you have on--do you have any others that match that uniform?
0-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:0=seductive,Ohh, tiny little things like you always make my heart melt!  Is the schoolgirl look a style where you live?
0-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:0=stretching,A student's uniform is always the most adorable thing.  As you might imagine from my piracy, I wasn't the best student.
0-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:0=vain,School was always so dreadfully boring, the way they prattled on about men.  But you make the outfit look pretty cute, Miss Magician!
0-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0=seductive,Well, hi there, Miss Accent!  That is just the <i>cutest</i> polka-dot bodysuit you have on!
0-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0=seductive,Omigosh, your funny accent is so <i>cute</i>!  It matches your goofy polka-dotted suit.
0-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0=laughing,Well, aren't <i>you</i> the most adorable thing!  All dolled up in polka dots, stumbling over your words!  I could just <i>gobble you up</i>!
0-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0=seductive,That's a pretty darling suit, sweetie, with all the polka dots.  And the way you trip over your words just makes me <i>melt</i>!
0-female_must_strip,target:black_canary,targetStage:0=teasing,Oho--a fellow blonde!  Good to see them running around on Earth--we've got to stick together!
0-female_must_strip,target:black_canary,targetStage:0=seductive,Hey there, cutie!  Always good to see more lovely blonde women running around.  Got to keep each other safe from those jealous brunettes.
0-female_must_strip,target:black_canary,targetStage:0=vain,Ooh, is blonde your natural color?  It's not as exotic as some of Mejare's other hair colors, but it's certainly appealing to be wrapped in gold.
0-female_must_strip,target:black_canary,targetStage:0=vain,What, was "Blonde Canary" taken?  Because <i>that's</i> what I would advertise, if I were you.
0-female_must_strip,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=laughing,Normally I'd say rock the skin color you have, but <i>wow</i>.  Pink is <i>not</i> an attractive color...not <i>that</i> pink.
0-female_must_strip,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=stretching,And here I thought <i>Mejarians</i> were the ones with the exotic body colors.  Earth girls are breaking out the bright pink skin!
0-female_must_strip,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=confused,Why's your skin all gross-looking and pink?  Like, <i.really</i> pink.  It's distracting...so is that eyepatch, too.
0-female_must_strip,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=smug,Not to be outdone, Earth starts showing this Mejarian just how bizarre its colors can truly get.  Next on the agenda: <i>pink skin</i>.
0-female_must_strip,target:navi,targetStage:0=laughing,...Yeah, I can see why you'd be comfortable here.  We'd need a computer scan to find your vagina.
0-female_must_strip,target:navi,targetStage:0=interested,You know, I tease Earth girls about growing up all small, but <i>wow</i>.  Now I just feel bad.
0-female_must_strip,target:navi,targetStage:0=smug,At least you've got those wings to buzz around to <i>our</i> height.  Inferiority complex, sweetie?
0-female_must_strip,target:navi,targetStage:0=bored,Well, there goes any chance of getting a <i>good look</i> at what Earth girls have got.  You <i>are</i> from Earth, right?
0-female_must_strip,target:ayano,targetStage:0=confused,...You OK there, schoolgirl?  You look a little on edge...especially when you look <i>my</i> way.
0-female_must_strip,target:ayano,targetStage:0=teasing,Looking a little bug-eyed there, honey.  Too much coffee this morning?
0-female_must_strip,target:ayano,targetStage:0=confused,Uh, you OK, Ayano?  Your eyes are all shifty, like somebody's watching you.
0-female_must_strip,target:ayano,targetStage:0=annoyed,...Could you settle down there, girlie?  You're giving me the stink-eye like I killed someone.  It's creeping me out.
0-female_must_strip,target:sonya,targetStage:0=teasing,I can appreciate military women--they're always so very <i>fit</i>.  Try not to wring my neck for my horrible pirate crimes.
0-female_must_strip,target:sonya,targetStage:0=vain,<i>Please don't hurt me, O fearsome woman soldier.  I have a girlfriend waiting for me back home</i>!
0-female_must_strip,target:sonya,targetStage:0=vain,Looking pretty muscular, Miss Militia.  Please try to see this beautiful pirate's point of view before sticking your knee in her back.
0-female_must_strip,target:sonya,targetStage:0=teasing,I imagine you're not too fond of my line of work, Miss Militia.  It's OK--<i>I'm pretty fond of that short blonde hair</i>.
0-female_must_strip,target:athena,targetStage:0=interested,I really thought I'd be the most lightly-dressed woman here, but there you go showing me up on <i>that</i> front.
0-female_must_strip,target:athena,targetStage:0=smug,Way to dispel my stereotypes of Earth girls being overdressed.  You wear even less than I do.
0-female_must_strip,target:athena,targetStage:0=interested,Hey, I understand wanting to show a little skin, but you can't walk around in a <i>bikini</i> all day.  Even Barnette doesn't go that far.
0-female_must_strip,target:athena,targetStage:0=stretching,Even my darling little Barnette covers herself up better than <i>you</i> do...and she's got a reputation for dressing flimsily.
0-female_must_strip,target:asuna,targetStage:0=frustrated,What'd you say you lived in?  An M-M-O--ripgah?  I can't keep track of all that.
0-female_must_strip,target:asuna,targetStage:0=confused,Did you say you lived in a computer or something like that?  Sounds like Heaven to Parfet, with how much she tinkers with machines.
0-female_must_strip,target:asuna,targetStage:0=confused,So what's it like inside a computer?  Do you have to wear a rubber suit to avoid getting electrocuted?
0-female_must_strip,target:asuna,targetStage:0=confused,You live inside a game, right?  And now you're <i>playing</i> a game?  Is this whole place a game I've stepped inside?
0-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:3=confused,Hey, what were those noises you made before?  Didn't sound like the common language...
0-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:3=confused,...What's the name of that language you keep slipping into, anyway?  Some sort of Earth code-talk?  I only speak the common one...
0-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:3=vain,Bilingualism is so impressive, Marinette!  I only speak the common language...I don't even know Mejarians' codespeak.
0-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:3=seductive,So you speak the common language, but also this other one?  What's it called?  Because it sounds so <i>cute</i>!
0-female_must_strip,target:arwen,targetStage:0=confused,Hey, what's all this about the <i>middle</i> of Earth?  Is there a spot underground that only you elf-people get to live in?
0-female_must_strip,target:arwen,targetStage:0=confused,And I call <i>Meia</i> pale.  You look almost ghostly...is that just the way you elves are?
0-female_must_strip,target:arwen,targetStage:0=confused,Hey, what's up with those pointy ears?  And the pale, Meia-like skin?  You're a strange one, "elf" girl.
0-female_must_strip,target:arwen,targetStage:0=confused,So you call yourself an elf, right?  Is that another word for "Earthling with crazy ears"?  Because you look human otherwise.
0-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0=confused,...Look, honey.  Makeup is a girl's best friend, but...it's possible to get a little too close to your friends.
0-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0,marker:fama_and_oma=laughing,Dear god.  Did you break into your Fama's makeup closet and start applying whatever you could find?  Your friends are letting you down.
0-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0=smug,I guess I never appreciated how light with makeup I can be with my natural beauty.  Here we see the alternative...
0-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0=vain,Check out Miss Makeup over here.  Somehow she made it through childhood without hearing the expression "less is more."
0-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:0=confused,...You OK, honey?  You look a little...<i>dead</i>.
0-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:0=shocked,...OK.  So.  You're a ghost.  I can work with this...<i>but please put down the knife</i>.
0-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:0=bored,Guess there's no stabbing <i>you</i> if things get hairy, is there?  ...Not that I was planning on doing that to anyone else.
0-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:0=laughing,A...ghost.  OK.  Well, at least this means I can still annoy Meia if I get shot down and killed.
0-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:0=awkward,...Well, I <i>do</i> appreciate learning that there's an afterlife, but it's not why I came to Earth.
0-female_must_strip,target:zizou_valentine,targetStage:0=interested,Don't you have a magic spell to give yourself some clothes, little Miss Magician?
0-female_must_strip,target:zizou_valentine,targetStage:0=interested,I must say, Zizou, I like your standard outfit better.  This is just trying too hard to make men like you.
0-female_must_strip,target:zizou_valentine,targetStage:0=laughing,Ohh, Barnette wears just as little when she cooks for me!  It's so cute...but then, <i>she</i> has breasts.
0-female_must_strip,target:zizou_valentine,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, Miss Magician...<i>don't wear clothes you can't fill</i>.  But definitely wear clothes in general.
0-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0=vain,How's a young little thing like you a model if you're still in school?  <i>I've</i> got modeling potential, but it's hard for pirates to land a job.
0-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0=smug,A student <i>and</i> a model?  And here I am, with all my beauty, and still a lowly criminal.  At least I have my wonderful piloting skills.
0-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0=vain,<i>If only my circumstances let me be the beautiful model I've always dreamed of being</i>!  Guess I'll have to settle for death-defying pirate.
0-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0=teasing,You're a lucky one, Earth-girl.  I never had the benefit of much schooling, nor the opportunity to be a model.  So cherish what you've got!
0-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0=interested,Looks like this place attracts more spacefarers than I gave it credit for.  Fine by me--at least someone knows where I'm coming from.
0-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0=seductive,What planet are you from, Miss Starshine?  Your fabulous blonde hair is winning me over as we speak.
0-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0=vain,Guess I can't learn about Earth girls from <i>you</i>--but hey, it's nice to know there's other gorgeous spacefarers out there.  Who like stripping.
0-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0=vain,Ooh, you cut your hair short like Meia does.  But it's wonderful blonde like mine--<i>space is so vast in its variety</i>!
0-female_must_strip,target:april,targetStage:0=vain,Ooh, do you really report the news?  Be sure to get my good side--oh wait, that's <i>every</i> side!
0-female_must_strip,target:april,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey there, Jumpsuit.  Someone said you're a reporter--but <i>this</i> pirate doesn't mind a little publicity!
0-female_must_strip,target:april,targetStage:0=smug,I've been in the media for much worse than a few glory shots, so don't think I'm afraid of that camera, newsgirl.
0-female_must_strip,target:april,targetStage:0=vain,Hey, newsie, I've got all the story you need right here.  Your Earth viewers have never seen a body like mine!
0-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=vain,Omigosh, are you <i>filming</i> this?  Look this way--over here!  Get every angle you can!
0-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=vain,You're <i>broadcasting</i> this?  To a <i>live audience</i>?  This is a dream come true--now <i>all of Earth</i> will witness my beauty!
0-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=vain,Omigosh!  <i>Omigosh</i>!  You're <i>broadcasting</i> this to people all around Earth?  Maybe I'll finally become a model!
0-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=seductive,You're <i>filming</i> this?  Omigosh--normally I have to get Barnette to capture my beauty on camera!  You're so sweet!
0-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=vain,I hope you don't think that camera is going to scare me away.  I may be a wanted criminal, but I'm also <i>beautiful</i>!
0-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=vain,You picked a good table to film, honey.  The only thing that loves me more than Barnette is a camera!
0-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0=laughing,Hey there, short stuff.  I think you might actually be shorter than Hibiki, which is a challenge even for women.
0-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0=laughing,You said you fight "Titans"?  I imagine that's everyone, considering your stature.
0-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0=laughing,"Titans," huh?  You mean like me next to you?  Or anyone, really?
0-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0=interested,How's the weather down there, at the very bottom of Earth?  You really need to drink your milk, honey.
0-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0,marker:fama_and_oma=vain,...See, <i>this</i> is why I'm going to be the Fama for Barnette.  I don't want our daughters growing up all short from lack of milk.
0-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=seductive,Blonde, scantily-clad, loves attention?  Honey, you're a woman after my own heart.
0-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=teasing,I like the energy you're bringing, Miss Wrestler!  The scant layering doesn't hurt, either.
0-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=vain,See, <i>you're</i> my kind of woman!  These other Earth girls are so dreadfully boring, always covering up the good stuff.
0-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=teasing,Barely wearing anything? You should know my girlfriend is the same way, cutie...only <i>she's</i> not blonde.
0-female_must_strip,target:annie,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey there, Plain-Jane.  What's brought you here, with all your layers?  Looking to overcome some shyness?
0-female_must_strip,target:annie,targetStage:0=smug,Exhibit A of Earth girls' ridiculous conservatism.  Can't you appreciate your own body instead of hiding it?  Must be men doing this to you.
0-female_must_strip,target:annie,targetStage:0=laughing,What's up, cutie?  You seem to be making every effort to hide that cuteness, actually.  Just look at those packed-on layers.
0-female_must_strip,target:annie,targetStage:0=vain,I guess I'd be a little shyer about my body if I had your height and plain looks, but come on.  Confidence makes <i>any</i> woman look better!

1-male_human_must_strip=interested,Oh, good.  <i>Male</i> nudity is actually interesting.
1-male_human_must_strip=vain,So much easier than bugging one of our prisoners.
1-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=teasing,So, not to call you a harlot or anything, Misato, but you seem <i>awful</i> interested in these men...so am I.  How do you Earth girls get their attention?
1-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=confused,Ooh, you seem pretty confident around these Earth men, Misato.  From one woman to another, what's the secret to getting their attention?
1-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=confused,You seem to be doing a better job flirting with these Earth men, Misato.  Am I doing something wrong?  I always seem to scare them!
1-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=confused,Men just run away from me, usually...I thought they <i>like</i> being flirted with.  Misato, you seem to get them!

1-male_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=laughing,Too close for comfort.  But now I'm quite comfortable...too bad for you.
1-male_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=laughing,Seems you can always count on Earthlings to screw up their cards worse than you did.
1-male_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=seductive,That was a <i>high card</i> I had, so you really did me a favor, darling.
1-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rinkah,count-meia:1,count-corrin_f:1=smug,Hey, don't be rude to our little male friend here.  He's probably scared half to death, being around all these gorgeous women.
1-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rinkah,count-meia:1,count-corrin_f:1=laughing,Now, now, Rinkah.  That's no way to treat our lone man.  His little pea-brain can only handle so much stimulus.
1-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rinkah,count-meia:1,count-corrin_f:1=interested,Don't make fun, Rinkah.  At least he had the courage to come alone...or the stupidity.
1-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rinkah,count-meia:1,count-corrin_f:1=smug,It's not quite that dire.  Meia isn't exactly in a good mood, since I dragged her here.
1-male_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=smug,Think that streak has changed my mind about men?  Not quite...but keep it up.
1-male_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=teasing,Good show, ~player~.  Got any more of that luck in you?  I hope not, or I won't see the good stuff.
1-male_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=interested,I'm still not impressed.  How do I know you weren't just lucky?
1-male_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=teasing,Not bad at all for a man.  But I've got a long way to go, and you just lost your momentum.
1-male_human_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:human,marker:human=teasing,Hey there, Handsome.  You've got a different look about you than everyone else...but I can't quite put my finger on how.
1-male_human_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:human,marker:human=seductive,Hi, Mr. Man...I've only met a few men before, so you're <i>very</i> exotic to me.  Won't you please show me your naked body?
1-male_human_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:human,marker:human=seductive,Hey, Darling.  You should know I come from a planet of <i>all</i> women...so you being a man makes me interested already.
1-male_human_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:human,marker:human=seductive,Is that you, ~player~?  You haven't said much so far...but you should know how exotic men are to me, and how much I want to learn about them.

1-male_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=teasing,I know I've lost my sword, ~player~, but you shouldn't get all cocky.
1-male_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=laughing,Just calm down, ~player~.  Everything will be fine...for me.
1-male_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=teasing,I understand.  You've never seen a Mejarian before--we tend to draw the eye.

1-male_must_strip,target:ryu,targetStage:0=teasing,You look like you see a lot of physical action, hot stuff...can those big muscles toss me around?
1-male_must_strip,target:ryu,targetStage:0=laughing,A big hunk of a man with more muscles than brainpower?  Just what I've been looking for.

1-male_must_strip,target:xander,targetStage:0=interested,Well, you don't look so bad for a man.  Am I in competition with that Buffy woman?
1-male_must_strip,target:xander,targetStage:0=teasing,Not to be too forward or anything, but I'm on the prowl for a good man...for reasons you'll know soon enough.  Interested?
1-male_must_strip,target:xander,targetStage:0=vain,You're a pretty average-looking man.  I can live with that...but I bet they don't make women like <i>me</i> where you come from.
1-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:2=vain,I can't get over how cute you are, honey...but seriously, what's with the angel outfit?  Men are no angels.
1-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:2=smug,Men have always struck as more <i>beastly</i> than angelic...which is fine by me.  So why do you dress like one?
1-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:2=confused,So, uh, I read about angels as a girl, but they were always women.  Why are you dolled-up like one, anyway?
1-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:2=confused,Do those wings detach?  They look pretty convincing, and the rest of your angel outfit is pretty good.  Why do you have that on, anyway?
1-male_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=smug,Think that streak has changed my mind about men?  Not quite...but keep it up.
1-male_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=teasing,Good show, ~name~.  Got any more of that luck in you?  I hope not, or I won't see the good stuff.

1-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0=seductive,Well, what do we have here?  An adorable little cinnamon roll of a man, dressed up as an angel!
1-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0=seductive,You are just the cutest little man I've ever seen!  Hibiki's a little smaller, but he's got too much spunk to be cute.
1-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0=excited,Ohhh, you're so <i>cute</i>, Mr. Angel!  I could just <i>eat you up</i>!
1-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0=teasing,What's an adorable little man like you doing here, Pit?  Sure you want to strip nude in front of these scary, hulking women?
1-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:1=teasing,You've got to tell me more about yourself, Pit!  You're so darn shy...and I'm so <i>curious</i>!
1-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:1=seductive,Such a little motormouth, but it <i>alllll</i> clams up when I swing my gaze your way.  I love having this effect on cute little boys!
1-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:1=seductive,Come on, Mr. Angel, don't be shy!  I mean, it's cute, but I want to learn more about Earth men!
1-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:1=seductive,There's <i>so much</i> you could teach me about men, Pit...the men in my life always reject me.  And you're so nonthreatening!
1-male_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=teasing,So, not to call you a harlot or anything, Misato, but you seem <i>awful</i> interested in these men...so am I.  How do you Earth girls get their attention?
1-male_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=confused,Ooh, you seem pretty confident around these Earth men, Misato.  From one woman to another, what's the secret to getting their attention?
1-male_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=confused,You seem to be doing a better job flirting with these Earth men, Misato.  Am I doing something wrong?  I always seem to scare them!
1-male_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=confused,Men just run away from me, usually...I thought they <i>like</i> being flirted with.  Misato, you seem to get them!
1-male_must_strip,target:shaggy,targetStage:0=bored,Uh...you're kind of tall, I guess, but it doesn't look like you wash yourself much.  Gross.
1-male_must_strip,target:shaggy,targetStage:0=annoyed,I know you're a man, but can't you put a <i>little</i> effort into your appearance?  You look like you just rolled out of a gutter.
1-male_must_strip,target:shaggy,targetStage:0=smug,"Shaggy," huh?  That'd be like if my nickname were "Gorgeous."  Actually, I'll have to propose that next flight practice...
1-male_must_strip,target:shaggy,targetStage:0=frustrated,Gangly, unshaven, all around a mess.  I'm starting to miss the clean-cut professionalism of the Tarakkian soldiers I know.
1-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:2=smug,Hey, so what's with those "Neighbors" you keep talking about?  I mean, Mejare certainly doesn't get along with <i>its</i> neighbors.
1-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:2=seductive,Hey, Handsome, when you say you fight Neighbors, how big a scale are we talking?  Let's just say neighboring planet Tarak isn't our best friend.
1-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:2=interested,Who are these "Neighbors" you say you fight?  Is this like a front-lawn kind of dispute, or do you mean as a solider?
1-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:2=interested,Did you say you fight neighbors, darling?  Mejarians usually fight their neighbors over gardening, unless we're talking planets.
1-male_must_strip,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:0=smug,And I thought <i>I</i> was enthusiastic.  This man's blowing me out of the water.
1-male_must_strip,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:0=interested,Talk about bringing energy to the table.  Planning on winning this thing, or just shouting about it?
1-male_must_strip,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:0=laughing,Well, <i>someone's</i> a feisty one.  Hibiki's energetic, but you've got the body to match, hot stuff.
1-male_must_strip,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:0=confused,You're some kind of racecar driver or something?  Seems you're permanently amped-up from it.
1-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=seductive,Well, aren't <i>you</i> cute!  And you're dressed in all that fancy armor.  What's your name, girlie?
1-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=seductive,You are just the most <i>adorable</i> thing, even in all that heavy armor.  Can't you take it off and show us what an Earth woman looks like?
1-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,You're cute, dear!  Look, Meia, she even cut her hair short like you do!  Must be big on practicality, too.
1-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,A woman in armor?  Meia, this girl is trying to get on your good side...matching outfits like that.
1-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena,count-meia:1=teasing,You <i>work</i> for this woman, Pit?  Look at that, Meia...it must be <i>Take-Your-Boss-to-Strip</i> Day.
1-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena,count-meia:1=smug,Oh, wow, this woman is your boss?  I guess I have no room to talk, considering I brought Miss Ice Queen along for the ride.
1-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena,count-meia:1=teasing,Look, Meia, this cute little angel-boy brought his boss, too!  I guess he and I are both into taking our superiors down a peg.
1-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena,count-meia:1=smug,Well, what do you know?  Pit brought this boss here too, Meia.  Only ~player~ has any sense, it seems.
1-male_must_strip,target:bi,targetStage:0=frustrated,...<i>Ew</i>.  What's wrong with your hands...and your <i>face</i>?
1-male_must_strip,target:bi,targetStage:0=annoyed,...I've got to be honest here.  You are <i>very</i> ugly...and I hate ugly things.
1-male_must_strip,target:bi,targetStage:0=annoyed,...Would it have killed you to wash yourself before coming here?  Or maybe not come at all?  I would've preferred that.
1-male_must_strip,target:bi,targetStage:0=angry,...OK, <i>ew</i>.  I wouldn't collect your seed if it meant they'd make me the Grand Ma for it.
1-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=seductive,Well, aren't <i>you</i> cute!  And you're dressed in all that fancy armor.  What's your name, girlie?
1-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=seductive,You are just the most <i>adorable</i> thing, even in all that heavy armor.  Can't you take it off and show us what an Earth woman looks like?
1-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=seductive,You're cute, dear!  You've even cut your hair short like Meia does.  Women can pull that off sometimes!
1-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=laughing,A woman in armor?  You're after Meia's own heart, you sly little thing!  Too bad she isn't here.
1-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:0=interested,So are you, uh, going to produce actual <i>words</i> at some point?  Or is grunting and yelling all I can expect from a man?
1-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:0=smug,...I mean, I tease men about being stupid, but <i>did</i> think they were capable of <i>speech</i>.
1-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:0=laughing,...It would seem men haven't quite evolved up to the point of grasping language.  What a shame.
1-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:0=laughing,...You're really showing me new lows for male intelligence, Link.  Grunt again if you agree.
1-male_must_strip,target:fred,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, maybe I'll take <i>your</i> seed.  You're tall and handsome...and most importantly, you're blond.
1-male_must_strip,target:fred,targetStage:0=teasing,What's this, now?  You solve mysteries?  Solve this, honey...whose handsome blond seed am I seriously considering taking right now?
1-male_must_strip,target:fred,targetStage:0=laughing,Hi there, handsome blond man!  You look like you could use a woman at your side...or maybe on top of you.
1-male_must_strip,target:fred,targetStage:0=interested,Duero might have better hair, but yours is blond...that's definitely a plus where I come from.
1-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=laughing,I see ~player~ has grown so desperate at the gender disparity in this game that they've turned to <i>Kool-Aid Man</i> for their fix.
1-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=annoyed,...Listen, ~player~, I get that this game doesn't have too many men, but you're better than this.  Pick a real character.
1-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=bored,Doesn't bode well for your opinion of me that you'd stick me with <i>this</i> idiot, ~player~.
1-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=awkward,...<i>Kool-Aid Man</i>, huh, ~player~?  That's...your choice?  Are you sure?
1-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=frustrated,<i>Kool-Aid Man</i>?  ...Do I <i>have</i> to keep playing?  If ~player~'s not gonna take this seriously, why should I?
1-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=interested,You're really starved for some male players, aren't you, ~player~?  Couldn't you pick, I don't know, Pit?  9S?  Come on.
1-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=annoyed,...What the hell am I looking at?  Forget playing against, just...<i>looking at</i>.
1-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=bored,...My beauty deserves better tablemates than this.
1-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=vain,On the female side of things, we have the most beautiful woman on the roster.  And on the male side of things, well...well.
1-male_must_strip,target:caleb,targetStage:0=confused,Oh look, a child-man.  What's the word--<i>boy</i>?  Anyway, I'm not gonna strip in front of a kid.
1-male_must_strip,target:caleb,targetStage:0=annoyed,Hey, kid, I know you're male, but can't you read?  No kids allowed.
1-male_must_strip,target:caleb,targetStage:0=annoyed,I'm gonna ignore the cat ears for a second and focus on how you look like you're twelve.  Beat it, kid, adults are trying to have fun here.
1-male_must_strip,target:caleb,targetStage:0=bored,...Listen, honey, we're playing a grown-up game for grown-ups.  You've got to leave...so I don't feel like a pedophile.
1-male_must_strip,target:caleb,targetStage:0=awkward,Hibiki's just short, but you...I don't think you're an adult.  Can't be sure with men, but still...
1-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=seductive,Omigosh, there's <i>two</i> of you girls?  Are you twins?  I heard Earth people could have matching babies called twins!
1-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=seductive,Ohh, you two ladies are so <i>adorable</i>!  One of you even cut your hair short, just like Meia does!
1-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=seductive,Well, what have we here?  Two cute little ladies dressed in matching armor sets?
1-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=confused,Wait, you're <i>both</i> named Corrin?  Look, girls, I know one's hair is short, but you should really dress different.
1-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:1=interested,<i>Pod this, data that</i>...you talk like you're a machine.  Why the formality, dear?
1-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:1=interested,Why do you talk like you're a robot half the time, huh?  Loosen up and enjoy yourself--if men can do that, of course.
1-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:1=interested,Hey, what's with all your formal data-mechanics babble?  You sound like you just rolled off the factory line, dearie.
1-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:1=seductive,Are you so polite and deferent and robotlike because you're short?  Because the short man <i>I</i> know is a real fireball!
1-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:1=laughing,Hey, darling little boy...why so mechanical in waist and taste?  I know <i>Tarakkians</i> are made in factories, but <i>sheesh</i>.
1-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=annoyed,<i>And who do we have he</i>--oh.  El Shaggy Blanco.  Great choice, ~player~.
1-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=frustrated,...You know, I put a lot of effort into having all these lines, and then you go and stick me with El Shaggy Blanco.
1-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=teasing,Thought I wouldn't have lines to April Fools' characters?  Well, think again, ~player~.
1-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=vain,Everyone give ~player~ a round of applause...they figured out how to use the offline version, as you can see.
1-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=annoyed,...I know you're proud of yourself for deciphering the offline version, ~player~, but you don't have to pick meme characters.
1-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=smug,Excellent character selection, ~player~.  You picked a joke that stopped being funny in 2017...whenever that was in Earth years.
1-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, hey, hey--check out <i>this</i> handsome stud!  What brings <i>you</i> here, Mr. Cool-and-Casual?
1-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:0=teasing,You look like you're right at home, Mr. Lackadaisical.  You know what I like in my men?  <i>Handsomeness</i>...like yours.
1-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:0=seductive,Hey, Jacket-and-Pants.  You look a little sleepy, but I can't deny how you're making my heart beat faster.  What's your story?
1-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:0=seductive,I can't take my eyes off you, handsome, even if <i>yours</i> seem a little sleepy.  Mind telling me about yourself?
1-male_must_strip,target:kira,targetStage:0=teasing,Ooh, you're a handsome one...and blond, which is even better.  I see you eyeing me up...
1-male_must_strip,target:kira,targetStage:0=seductive,Hi there, sweetheart...what was your name again?  I forgot it when I got lost in your beautiful blond hair.
1-male_must_strip,target:kira,targetStage:0=seductive,I wasn't sure if men could pull off blonde hair the way women do...but you're living proof.  I'll keep my eye on you...
1-male_must_strip,target:kira,targetStage:0=seductive,Ah, <i>here's</i> what I've been looking for!  A handsome blond man.  <i>Try not to sweep me off my feet, darling</i>.
1-male_must_strip,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=confused,Well, now!  There's bizarre specimens, and then there's you.  Are you a man or a woman?
1-male_must_strip,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=confused,I can't really pin down your sex, to be honest...or your species, for that matter.
1-male_must_strip,target:mettaton,targetStage:0,marker:fama_and_oma=vain,Weren't you made in a lab?  So were all Mejarians before our Famas carried us!  ...But I'm not sure if you're a woman.
1-male_must_strip,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=confused,Way to go ahead and be the ultimate test of judging men vs. women.  Gotta say, I'm stumped.
1-male_must_strip,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=confused,...Oh, you're one of those <i>ann-drazza-nuss</i> types, right?  That's the word?
1-male_must_strip,target:mettaton,targetStage:0,marker:fama_and_oma=confused,Mejarians get made in labs, too...but our Famas carry us.  So maybe you're a man, then?  Tarakkians are carried to term in labs...
1-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:0=laughing,Wow, a <i>blindfold</i> at a table full of strangers?  I never knew men could be so...<i>depraved</i>.
1-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:0=interested,You're, uh, really making up for your stature with the fetish gear.  Can't look me in the eye, sweetheart?
1-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:0=interested,I knew men could be cowardly, but damn.  Even the <i>Tarakkians</i> I know can look a woman in the eye.
1-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:0=interested,So the blindfold's going first, right?  So you can actually read the cards from now on?
1-male_must_strip,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:0=confused,So "gay" is the Earth word for how Tarakkians live?  Actually, I'm not sure they even form couples there...
1-male_must_strip,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:0=smug,A man loving other men?  Well, if women can do it, I suppose men can...not that I really picture men capable of love.
1-male_must_strip,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:0=interested,Is this what man-on-man love does to your appearance?  Because you're a scary-looking customer.
1-male_must_strip,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:0=confused,You know, they taught me as a girl that men were monsters...you fit the part.  And apparently you don't like women, is that right?
1-male_must_strip,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:0=interested,If "gay" means what I think it does, I guess teasing you isn't going to get me anywhere...not that I <i>want</i> to see you naked.
1-male_must_strip,target:captain_america,targetStage:0=teasing,Woah, talk about <i>hunk</i>!  I want to see what those muscles can do, sweetheart.
1-male_must_strip,target:captain_america,targetStage:0=seductive,<i>Well, now</i>!  You look like just the big ball of hunk I've been searching for, cutie.
1-male_must_strip,target:captain_america,targetStage:0=teasing,Tall, check--muscles, check--handsome, <i>check</i>!  Looks like I've found me a winner, and he hasn't even stripped yet.
1-male_must_strip,target:captain_america,targetStage:0=seductive,<i>Oooh</i>!  Look at <i>you</i>, handsome!  Just the sort of man I hoped to see here!
1-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena=laughing,Wait, wait, wait.  You <i>work</i> for this woman?  Quite the little boss-employee bonding exercise.
1-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena=interested,Oh wow, you two <i>work</i> together?  I mean, Meia's my boss, but we at least went to different tables.
1-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena=vain,You take orders from this woman, Pit?  Men and women, working together...I see how Earth operates.
1-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena=laughing,<i>Well, now</i>!  You work for this woman...how very, very awkward, Mr. Angel.
1-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:5=teasing,It's now or never, Little Dungeon Bot.  Going to look me in the eyes for once?
1-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:5=laughing,I spy with my little eye something you can still take off, Dungeon Robo.  That's because my eyes are uncovered.
1-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:5=interested,Sure you don't want to part with that blindfold, Mr. Robo-man?  Are you aware of the alternative, darling?
1-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:5=interested,Looks like Little Dungeon Bot is all out of dungeon items...well, except for the most striking one of all.
1-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:4=shocked,<i>Eep</i>!  O-oh, you <i>can</i> talk?  B-but...why didn't you?
1-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:4=interested,...So are you over your fear of women now?  Is that what the grunting was all about?
1-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:4=seductive,Oh, you <i>can</i> talk.  Did my beauty make you clam up, cutie?
1-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:4=smug,Well, that solves <i>that</i> mystery.  Come on and join us in the land of language like a civilized person.
1-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:4=smug,Oh, good, you can talk.  I had really lost all hope for men's intelligence for a while there.
1-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:4=shocked,<i>Ack</i>!  Wha--o-oh, you're done screaming!  Uh...OK.
1-female_human_must_strip=smug,Get to it, girlie.  I haven't got all day.
1-female_human_must_strip=smug,Wasn't even trying...
1-female_human_must_strip=interested,I mean, I'm a <i>pilot</i>.  This is hardly a demanding mental task.
1-female_human_must_strip=laughing,Too easy, ~player~.  Take it off.
1-female_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=smug,I see the old Mejarian charm to starting to get to you.
1-female_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=vain,Can't take your eyes off me, can you, ~player~?  Especially with my sword out of the picture.
1-female_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=teasing,Rotten old Lady Luck is such a nasty mistress.  <i>I</i>, however, can treat you right.
1-female_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=seductive,So many losses...want to talk about it?  You're such a cutie.
1-female_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=laughing,Couldn't hold out against Mejarian wits forever, could you?
1-female_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=teasing,<i>Just when you needed your streak most</i>.
1-female_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=seductive,Hey, don't give up, ~player~.  I don't like women who just roll over and take the abuse.
1-female_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=interested,Quite the poker face you were running.  You'd make those stonefaces on Anpathos proud.
1-female_human_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:human,marker:human=teasing,I come from a world of all women, so you're nothing special to me.  But you <i>are</i> very cute, so I've got my eye on you, Missy.
1-female_human_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:human,marker:human=seductive,And who's <i>this</i> tight-lipped specimen?  "~player~"?  If you say so...<i>cutie</i>.
1-female_human_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:human,marker:human=seductive,Yet another woman?  Like a drop in the bucket for a Mejarian...but even still, you're <i>far</i> cuter than I expected for an Earth girl.
1-female_human_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:human,marker:human=seductive,You're a little more simply-dressed than the exotic types that seem to frequent this place, myself included.  But you sure have a cute face!
1-female_human_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:human,marker:human=vain,And who are <i>you</i>,~player~?  You've barely said a thing...but you can admire my beauty too, if you want!
1-female_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=teasing,<i>Thanks for getting me out of that jam, sweetheart.  Here's a little leg for your trouble</i>.
1-female_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=seductive,Close shave for me.  Thanks for taking the hit, honey.
1-female_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=laughing,Too close for comfort.  But now I'm quite comfortable...too bad for you.
1-female_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=laughing,Seems you can always count on Earthlings to screw up their cards worse than you did.
1-female_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=seductive,That was a <i>high card</i> I had, so you really did me a favor, darling.
1-female_must_strip=smug,Get to it, girlie.  I haven't got all day.
1-female_must_strip=smug,Wasn't even trying.
1-female_must_strip=interested,I mean, I'm a <i>pilot</i>.  This is hardly a demanding mental task.
1-female_must_strip=laughing,Too easy, ~name~.  Take it off.
1-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=stretching,See, Meia, I think you do the "strong, silent type" thing pretty well.  Chell here is an example of taking it too far.
1-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,Slow on the uptake?  The "strong, silent type" doesn't mean <i>literally</i> never speaking, you know.
1-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,Oh, don't feel bad.  I know you're speechless at the sight of me--but I'll do enough talking for both of us!
1-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Stunned into speechlessness?  I'm flattered, but really, honey, you can talk to me.  I won't mind.
1-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Hey, Chell.  If I'm the most gorgeous woman you've ever met, don't say anything.
1-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, girlie, someone told me you're a model on Earth...is that true?  I'd like to get in on that...
1-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0=teasing,You're pretty cute, honey, but I hear people like legs on their models...better hope <i>I</i> don't hit the scene.
1-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0=vain,Hey now, sweetheart.  You're cute, but there's no need to brag about being a model...not when a <i>Mejarian's</i> on the scene.
1-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0=teasing,Don't be so full of yourself, Miss Model...I'd be a model, too, if not for Mejare's pesky little corrupt government.
1-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:6=bored,The storm is almost over...or maybe this is just the calm before it.
1-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:6=bored,I think I'd prefer the <i>Harvest's</i> company at this point.
1-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:6=bored,Oh, you're still here.  Why not just strip more than one thing at a time?  Well, too late.
1-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:6=bored,I still don't know who made you wait this long to show what you wanted.
1-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,<i>Oh, dear</i>.  I can see where <i>this</i> is going, Ice Queen.
1-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,<i>Flirting</i>, are we Meia?  I figured as much.  Best to let the lovebirds just figure things out on their own.
1-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,Meia, honey, you're just setting yourself up for disappointment.  Earth girls don't like each others' bodies the way <i>we</i> do.
1-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Ooh, you're so <i>cute</i> when a woman actually gets you going!  She'll deny it now, Chun, but Meia here is <i>totally</i> into you.
1-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:4=bored,...Maybe I should stop hitting on men.  Look what it does to you...
1-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:4=annoyed,Is this really what Earth women are like?  She's an outlier, right?
1-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:4=frustrated,Seems running the Harvest has a tendency to scramble Earth women's brains...and make them want to play poker.
1-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:4=bored,...At least she's losing quickly.  Easy to do when you barely check the cards.
1-female_must_strip,target:pyrrha,targetStage:0=laughing,Hey there, Miss Mind-Your-Manners.  You talk the talk, but that cleavage tells me you've got a wild side.
1-female_must_strip,target:pyrrha,targetStage:0=teasing,You're awfully polite for a woman perverted enough to come here in the first place.  Just trying to throw us off, cutie?
1-female_must_strip,target:pyrrha,targetStage:0=stretching,Yeah, yeah, I don't buy the whole polite-and-formal act from a girl willing to strip nude in public.  Just waiting for the good stuff?
1-female_must_strip,target:pyrrha,targetStage:0=interested,You talk pretty prim-and-proper, dear...and yet here you are, stripping nude for us.  Do you have a dirty side, or did you lose a bet?
1-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:6=laughing,Even with all that, you're still forced to be naked?  It's official--you're totally into this.
1-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:6=teasing,Even with your little flower setup, dearie, I think you're out of options.  Cough up the good stuff--I'm convinced you want to.
1-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:6=vain,<i>That</i> ought to do it, unless you've got more of the plant kingdom at your disposal.  Isn't this what you wanted, playing this game?
1-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:6=seductive,Oh, I'm sure you're cute, dear--I remember your butt!  Besides...I seriously doubt this isn't turning you on.
1-female_must_strip,target:tina,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=teasing,Planet <i>America</i>, hm?  Never heard of it--but it seems to have produced as least one knockout!
1-female_must_strip,target:tina,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=thinking,<i>Britain</i>, <i>Japan</i>, and now your <i>America</i>.  I'm starting to think these aren't actually planets...and Earth people are just very splintered.
1-female_must_strip,target:tina,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=teasing,Hey, now, Miss Wrestler...this place has a <i>no-touching</i> rule, even if Planet <i>America</i> doesn't.
1-female_must_strip,target:tina,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=vain,I don't know how they do things on Planet America, honey, but you keep your wrestling hands to yourself--I'm taken!
1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:5=teasing,Don't stop now, honey!  I hope I'm not imposing...but I'd <i>love</i> to hear some more French!
1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:5=seductive,Your language is the absolute <i>coolest</i>, darling!  Say some more for me, if you don't mind...I hope I'm not being a burden.
1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:5=teasing,I'm not demanding too much of you, am I, Marinette?  I just <i>love</i> your language...and this should take your mind off stripping.
1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:5=vain,Normally I'm interested in women's tongues for <i>other</i> reasons...but with you, I can't get over how cool your language is!
1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:5=seductive,I think I'm jealous, Marinette!  Not only are you the <i>cutest</i> little blueberry muffin of a girl, but your language is to <i>die</i> for!
1-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:5=smug,Well, that's that.  Do what you must behind those flowers.
1-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:5=interested,You can hide yourself with the flowers, honey, but you're naked, so that's a loss in my book.
1-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:5=smug,Nice try with the foliage, dear, but no one's going to call that clothing.  You're out.
1-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:5=stretching,<i>And so the frightened little princess falls before her betters.  Even the forest spirits couldn't save her</i>.
1-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:4=teasing,Hey, honey...take <i>my</i> dress, and I'll love you forever.
1-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:4=smug,Feel free to flatter me and steal my dress, dear!  It's...over there somewhere.
1-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:4=seductive,Say, Vriska...can that die steal <i>my</i> dress?  <i>Please</i> say yes.
1-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:4=vain,I'd <i>love</i> to see how my dress looks on someone else.  But I can't just let you try it on...so use the die.
1-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:1=vain,Should've figured Little Miss Princess would want to break away and strip for strangers.  You must be so sheltered!
1-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:1=teasing,Oh, is it true you're a <i>princess</i>, darling?  That would explain the haughty attitude...and the phony embarrassment.
1-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:1=teasing,I'm a pirate, dearie...and no huge fan of authority figures.  Luckily, I <i>love</i> girls who strip for fun and pleasure.
1-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:1=interested,So you're a princess, is that it?  You should know you're not fooling me--you <i>love</i> being ogled, don't you?
1-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:1=interested,A princess, hm?  Only makes sense that such a public figure as yourself would love exhibiting her body for total strangers.
1-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia,marker:planet-countries=smug,Where'd you say you were from?  Planet <i>Korea</i>?  Well then, it seems Korea and Mejare share a fashion sense...
1-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia,marker:planet-countries=teasing,You're a cutie, Miss Bodysuit, if a little on the short side.  Is that just how they make women over on Planet Korea?
1-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Well, everyone, cards on the table.  Who wears the whole bodysuit look better--D.Va or my miserable old boss here?
1-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,You're an adorable little thing, D.Va!  All wrapped up in that cute bodysuit, just like <i>another</i> pilot I know...who might be sitting here.
1-female_must_strip,target:tifa,targetStage:0=interested,Ohoho.  A <i>martial artist</i>, honey?  Well, I can certainly see where all your momentum comes from.
1-female_must_strip,target:tifa,targetStage:0=laughing,With a figure like that, I imagine you've developed your <i>own</i> style of martial arts...centered around counterweights.
1-female_must_strip,target:tifa,targetStage:0=teasing,<i>My, my</i>!  Those things outdo even mine, sweetie...but I don't pretend I'm some sort of athlete.
1-female_must_strip,target:tifa,targetStage:0=seductive,Bigger breasts <i>and</i> martial arts skill?  Jeez, you're outmaneuvering me left and right.  Good thing you're such a cutie!
1-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=stretching,Ooh, I know a girl named Misty!  She's this cute little thing from Pluto--barely has any breasts at all!  Must be cold there.
1-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=smug,Why, the Nirvana has a young girl named Misty aboard!  Being from Pluto, she knew her way around men better than any of us.
1-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=seductive,You're not the first Misty I've come to know, actually.  A teenie-weenie Plutonian girl we have is called the same thing!
1-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=stretching,I don't think they have your <i>poker</i>-mon things on Pluto...but they do have girls named Misty.
1-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:5=smug,Call it woman's intuition, but I think our little fashion show is about to come to an end soon...
1-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:5=interested,This has been fun, Vriska, but I don't think you can keep this up forever.  That die's got a sick sense of humor.
1-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:5=interested,Can't you see the writing on the wall, sweetheart?  I like these outfits, but they keep getting skimpier and skimpier.
1-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:5=laughing,Roll all you want...I think the die's in control here.  And it wants to see some blue skin.
1-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0=vain,Ooh, you're into art?  Do you think you could paint a portrait of me?  Maybe frame it in your collection to capture my eternal beauty?
1-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0=teasing,Ooh, so you're an <i>artist</i>?  I know a particularly handsome man that can paint, too...think you could capture me better?
1-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0=vain,Did you say you go to school with men?  I was never that big on school--except for art, where we could finally appreciate <i>beauty</i>!
1-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0=vain,Students tend to be such bores--like that egghead Parfet.  But an <i>art</i> student?  Now we're talking--my whole body is art!
1-female_must_strip,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=laughing,Normally I'd say rock the skin color you have, but <i>wow</i>.  Pink is <i>not</i> an attractive color...not <i>that</i> pink.
1-female_must_strip,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=stretching,And here I thought <i>Mejarians</i> were the ones with the exotic body colors.  Earth girls are breaking out the bright pink skin!
1-female_must_strip,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=confused,Why's your skin all gross-looking and pink?  Like, <i.really</i> pink.  It's distracting...so is that eyepatch, too.
1-female_must_strip,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=smug,Not to be outdone, Earth starts showing this Mejarian just how bizarre its colors can truly get.  Next on the agenda: <i>pink skin</i>.
1-female_must_strip,target:ayano,targetStage:0=confused,...You OK there, schoolgirl?  You look a little on edge...especially when you look <i>my</i> way.
1-female_must_strip,target:ayano,targetStage:0=teasing,Looking a little bug-eyed there, honey.  Too much coffee this morning?
1-female_must_strip,target:ayano,targetStage:0=confused,Uh, you OK, Ayano?  Your eyes are all shifty, like somebody's watching you.
1-female_must_strip,target:ayano,targetStage:0=annoyed,...Could you settle down there, girlie?  You're giving me the stink-eye like I killed someone.  It's creeping me out.
1-female_must_strip,target:athena,targetStage:0=interested,I really thought I'd be the most lightly-dressed woman here, but there you go showing me up on <i>that</i> front.
1-female_must_strip,target:athena,targetStage:0=smug,Way to dispel my stereotypes of Earth girls being overdressed.  You wear even less than I do.
1-female_must_strip,target:athena,targetStage:0=interested,Hey, I understand wanting to show a little skin, but you can't walk around in a <i>bikini</i> all day.  Even Barnette doesn't go that far.
1-female_must_strip,target:athena,targetStage:0=stretching,Even my darling little Barnette covers herself up better than <i>you</i> do...and she's got a reputation for dressing flimsily.
1-female_must_strip,target:sonya,targetStage:0=teasing,I can appreciate military women--they're always so very <i>fit</i>.  Try not to wring my neck for my horrible pirate crimes.
1-female_must_strip,target:sonya,targetStage:0=vain,<i>Please don't hurt me, O fearsome woman soldier.  I have a girlfriend waiting for me back home</i>!
1-female_must_strip,target:sonya,targetStage:0=vain,Looking pretty muscular, Miss Militia.  Please try to see this beautiful pirate's point of view before sticking your knee in her back.
1-female_must_strip,target:sonya,targetStage:0=teasing,I imagine you're not too fond of my line of work, Miss Militia.  It's OK--<i>I'm pretty fond of that short blonde hair</i>.
1-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=seductive,Blonde, scantily-clad, loves attention?  Honey, you're a woman after my own heart.
1-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=teasing,I like the energy you're bringing, Miss Wrestler!  The scant layering doesn't hurt, either.
1-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=vain,See, <i>you're</i> my kind of woman!  These other Earth girls are so dreadfully boring, always covering up the good stuff.
1-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=teasing,Barely wearing anything? You should know my girlfriend is the same way, cutie...only <i>she's</i> not blonde.
1-female_must_strip,target:asuna,targetStage:0=frustrated,What'd you say you lived in?  An M-M-O--ripgah?  I can't keep track of all that.
1-female_must_strip,target:asuna,targetStage:0=confused,Did you say you lived in a computer or something like that?  Sounds like Heaven to Parfet, with how much she tinkers with machines.
1-female_must_strip,target:asuna,targetStage:0=confused,So what's it like inside a computer?  Do you have to wear a rubber suit to avoid getting electrocuted?
1-female_must_strip,target:asuna,targetStage:0=confused,You live inside a game, right?  And now you're <i>playing</i> a game?  Is this whole place a game I've stepped inside?
1-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:6=interested,I appreciated the fashion show, Vriska, but really, I doubt you've got fuel left in the tank.
1-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:6=stretching,Just going to keep on trying, huh?  Give it up already.
1-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:6=stretching,Poor girl just can't control her gambling problem.  Now she'll be nude for it.
1-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:6=interested,And is this magically going to restock your wardrobe?  I doubt it.
1-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=smug,Jeez, what a head case.  Good thing she's got her girlfriend here to keep her in check.
1-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=interested,Running, running, running.  We're not trying to kill you here, you know.
1-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=teasing,Time for take two, everyone.  Better than the first, perhaps?
1-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=seductive,And <i>there she goes</i>.  Poor little thing, beaten down by the world.
1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:3=confused,Hey, what were those noises you made before?  Didn't sound like the common language...
1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:3=confused,...What's the name of that language you keep slipping into, anyway?  Some sort of Earth code-talk?  I only speak the common one...
1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:3=vain,Bilingualism is so impressive, Marinette!  I only speak the common language...I don't even know Mejarians' codespeak.
1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:3=seductive,So you speak the common language, but also this other one?  What's it called?  Because it sounds so <i>cute</i>!
1-female_must_strip,target:arwen,targetStage:0=confused,Hey, what's all this about the <i>middle</i> of Earth?  Is there a spot underground that only you elf-people get to live in?
1-female_must_strip,target:arwen,targetStage:0=confused,And I call <i>Meia</i> pale.  You look almost ghostly...is that just the way you elves are?
1-female_must_strip,target:arwen,targetStage:0=confused,Hey, what's up with those pointy ears?  And the pale, Meia-like skin?  You're a strange one, "elf" girl.
1-female_must_strip,target:arwen,targetStage:0=confused,So you call yourself an elf, right?  Is that another word for "Earthling with crazy ears"?  Because you look human otherwise.
1-female_must_strip,target:zizou_valentine,targetStage:0=interested,Don't you have a magic spell to give yourself some clothes, little Miss Magician?
1-female_must_strip,target:zizou_valentine,targetStage:0=interested,I must say, Zizou, I like your standard outfit better.  This is just trying too hard to make men like you.
1-female_must_strip,target:zizou_valentine,targetStage:0=laughing,Ohh, Barnette wears just as little when she cooks for me!  It's so cute...but then, <i>she</i> has breasts.
1-female_must_strip,target:zizou_valentine,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, Miss Magician...<i>don't wear clothes you can't fill</i>.  But definitely wear clothes in general.
1-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0=interested,I was about to comment on how I love blondes, but that mechanical arm really stands out.  How'd you get it?
1-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0=confused,It's hard to feel too awkward about you losing your arm when that thing looks like a pretty useful replacement.  Got a story to tell?
1-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0=laughing,Check out Miss Cyborg over here!  You wear that mechanical arm quite well--<i>do Earth men find you too much to handle</i>?
1-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0=seductive,I must say, that cold steel clashes with your fiery personality.  Talk about a two-tiered threat!
1-female_must_strip,target:april,targetStage:0=vain,Ooh, do you really report the news?  Be sure to get my good side--oh wait, that's <i>every</i> side!
1-female_must_strip,target:april,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey there, Jumpsuit.  Someone said you're a reporter--but <i>this</i> pirate doesn't mind a little publicity!
1-female_must_strip,target:april,targetStage:0=smug,I've been in the media for much worse than a few glory shots, so don't think I'm afraid of that camera, newsgirl.
1-female_must_strip,target:april,targetStage:0=vain,Hey, newsie, I've got all the story you need right here.  Your Earth viewers have never seen a body like mine!
1-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:0=confused,...You OK, honey?  You look a little...<i>dead</i>.
1-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:0=shocked,...OK.  So.  You're a ghost.  I can work with this...<i>but please put down the knife</i>.
1-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:0=bored,Guess there's no stabbing <i>you</i> if things get hairy, is there?  ...Not that I was planning on doing that to anyone else.
1-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:0=laughing,A...ghost.  OK.  Well, at least this means I can still annoy Meia if I get shot down and killed.
1-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:0=awkward,...Well, I <i>do</i> appreciate learning that there's an afterlife, but it's not why I came to Earth.
1-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=seductive,Is that so?  Well, Ami, you've <i>got</i> to let me know how to become an Earth model.  I'm a bit of an outlaw on Mejare, after all.
1-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Thanks for the tip, Meia.  Leave it to you to gather a little intel on our friends here...how's life as an Earth model, honey?
1-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,Ooh, she's a <i>model</i>?  <i>Now</i> I'm curious...that was always my dream job, after all.
1-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0=laughing,Hey there, short stuff.  I think you might actually be shorter than Hibiki, which is a challenge even for women.
1-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0=laughing,You said you fight "Titans"?  I imagine that's everyone, considering your stature.
1-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0=laughing,"Titans," huh?  You mean like me next to you?  Or anyone, really?
1-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0=interested,How's the weather down there, at the very bottom of Earth?  You really need to drink your milk, honey.
1-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0,marker:fama_and_oma=vain,...See, <i>this</i> is why I'm going to be the Fama for Barnette.  I don't want our daughters growing up all short from lack of milk.
1-female_must_strip,target:annie,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey there, Plain-Jane.  What's brought you here, with all your layers?  Looking to overcome some shyness?
1-female_must_strip,target:annie,targetStage:0=smug,Exhibit A of Earth girls' ridiculous conservatism.  Can't you appreciate your own body instead of hiding it?  Must be men doing this to you.
1-female_must_strip,target:annie,targetStage:0=laughing,What's up, cutie?  You seem to be making every effort to hide that cuteness, actually.  Just look at those packed-on layers.
1-female_must_strip,target:annie,targetStage:0=vain,I guess I'd be a little shyer about my body if I had your height and plain looks, but come on.  Confidence makes <i>any</i> woman look better!
1-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0=vain,How's a young little thing like you a model if you're still in school?  <i>I've</i> got modeling potential, but it's hard for pirates to land a job.
1-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0=smug,A student <i>and</i> a model?  And here I am, with all my beauty, and still a lowly criminal.  At least I have my wonderful piloting skills.
1-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0=vain,<i>If only my circumstances let me be the beautiful model I've always dreamed of being</i>!  Guess I'll have to settle for death-defying pirate.
1-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0=teasing,You're a lucky one, Earth-girl.  I never had the benefit of much schooling, nor the opportunity to be a model.  So cherish what you've got!
1-female_must_strip,target:arwen,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=confused,Hey, what's all this about the <i>middle</i> of Earth?  Is there a spot underground that only you elf-people get to live in?
1-female_must_strip,target:arwen,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=confused,And I call <i>you</i> pale, Meia.  Arwen here looks almost ghostly...is that just the way elves are?
1-female_must_strip,target:arwen,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=confused,Hey, what's up with those pointy ears?  And that pallid skin?  You're a strange one, "elf" girl.
1-female_must_strip,target:arwen,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=confused,So you call yourself an elf, right?  Is that another word for "Earthling with crazy ears"?  Because you look human otherwise.
1-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=vain,Omigosh, are you <i>filming</i> this?  Look this way--over here!  Get every angle you can!
1-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=vain,You're <i>broadcasting</i> this?  To a <i>live audience</i>?  This is a dream come true--now <i>all of Earth</i> will witness my beauty!
1-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=vain,Omigosh!  <i>Omigosh</i>!  You're <i>broadcasting</i> this to people all around Earth?  Maybe I'll finally become a model!
1-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=seductive,You're <i>filming</i> this?  Omigosh--normally I have to get Barnette to capture my beauty on camera!  You're so sweet!
1-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=vain,I hope you don't think that camera is going to scare me away.  I may be a wanted criminal, but I'm also <i>beautiful</i>!
1-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=vain,You picked a good table to film, honey.  The only thing that loves me more than Barnette is a camera!
1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:4=excited,Forget the common language, Marinette, your "French" sounds like the most <i>romantic</i> thing!  You've <i>got</i> to say some more.
1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:4=excited,<i>Oooh, Marinette</i>!  Can you say some more "French"?  My heart beats faster every time your tongue slips!
1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:4=seductive,You should say some more French, Marinette!  It's got the <i>silkiest</i> sound to it--it makes my heart go wild!
1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:4=seductive,Oooh, Marinette, since it's your turn, can you throw out some more of this "French"?  It sounds like a <i>lover's</i> language.
1-female_must_strip,target:amy_rose,targetStage:0=confused,You're, uh, looking a little pink there.  And what's up with those ears?
1-female_must_strip,target:amy_rose,targetStage:0=confused,I know I joke about Earth girls being aliens, but, uh, you really do look kind of weird.  What's with all the...<i>fur</i>?
1-female_must_strip,target:amy_rose,targetStage:0=confused,Wait, did they say you're a...a <i>hedgehog</i> or something?  Is that some kind of animal?  That would explain the, uh, pink...and ears.
1-female_must_strip,target:amy_rose,targetStage:0=confused,...I really can't make heads or tails of you.  You kind of <i>look</i> like you should have a tail, what with that fur and all.
1-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:0=vain,Check out that outfit!  Going for the natural look?  So would I, if Mejare had much of nature.
1-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:0=interested,Did you just piece that outfit together from bits you found in a forest?  It doesn't even look that bad, but...it's certainly all-natural.
1-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:0=vain,If only Mejare had the same verdant natural resources as Earth.  Perhaps then I could try to emulate your all-natural style.
1-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:0=vain,Mejare's a little too wasteful to have the greenery for me to dress like <i>you</i> do.  You can see how little we wear to compensate.
1-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, cutie!  You look like you've got some kind of rank to your name, with that beret--care to share any details?
1-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, you're not a bad looker, Earth-girl!  I like that exotic purple hair.  What is it you do, exactly?
1-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0=seductive,Tell me more about your exciting "NERV" job, Miss Military.  I want to know <i>all about</i> Earth!
1-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0=teasing,Ohoho--a <i>military</i> woman.  Well, indulge this filthy pirate scum and share what it is you do all day.
1-female_must_strip,target:alpha,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=laughing,You're pale as marble, dearie!  Do they not have a sun on this "Japan" planet?
1-female_must_strip,target:alpha,targetStage:0=confused,Are you...<i>flickering</i>?  Are you some kind of hologram?  That might explain your skin tone.
1-female_must_strip,target:alpha,targetStage:0=confused,You OK there, sweetheart?  You look a little pale...and non-corporeal.
1-female_must_strip,target:alpha,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=vain,And I thought <i>Mejarians</i> liked the pale look!  This "Japan" planet puts us to shame.
1-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:0=stretching,And they say <i>men</i> are tall!  You're enough woman for the whole table, sweetie.
1-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:0=smug,You said you don't get out much?  Guess men like short women...that makes things awkward for me.
1-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:0=smug,You know, I tend to turn heads with my height alone.  Better not invite <i>you</i> to the ship, or you'll steal my thunder.
1-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:0=seductive,From what I know of men, you're as tall as one...and built like them, too.  Don't worry, you wear it well--so does Gascogne!
1-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:0=teasing,Hibiki's a teenie-weenie man I know.  I guess you represent the opposite end of the spectrum on both counts.
1-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_playing_with_boys=smug,Oh, don't worry about men so much.  They're too clumsy and oafish to make use of all that strength.
1-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_playing_with_boys,marker:nagisa-tubes=interested,I really thought Earth women would be pretty comfortable around men.  Don't you have them shove their tubes into you on a regular basis?
1-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_playing_with_boys=interested,Aren't you used to men ogling and clawing at you?  I thought Earth women do that with them all the time.
1-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_playing_with_boys=stretching,You're so damn shy around these men.  Listen, I fight a whole planet of the toughest men around.  They're all talk.
1-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,You'll have to excuse Meia's hostility.  She's absorbed all of our collective pirate hatred of authority.
1-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,Oh, don't mind Meia.  She's taken the whole pirates-hating--soldiers thing a little too much to heart.
1-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,Just let Meia fume a little, Miss Military. We know you're not from <i>Mejare's</i> nasty old ranks.
1-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=stretching,Cute purple hair, Miss Military.  Oh, don't worry about Meia.  She's even touchier with soldier women than the rest of us.
1-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_first_time_playing=laughing,Wait, wait, wait.  You've <i>never</i> played poker before?  What are you, in some religious cult or something?
1-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_first_time_playing=smug,You poor, poor thing.  Never played poker before...what a way to start.
1-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_first_time_playing=laughing,You've <i>never</i> played poker before?  Oh, dear...well, I'll be sure to show you the ropes, sweetie.
1-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_first_time_playing=seductive,Your first time ever, huh?  I'm afraid you picked a hell of a game to start with...but you're a cute little thing, so don't be embarrassed.
1-female_must_strip,target:velma_classic,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, Earth to ~player~.  There's a Velma model out now that doesn't look like a goblin.
1-female_must_strip,target:velma_classic,targetStage:0=interested,What, you figured out the offline version but still chose <i>this</i> Velma?  How nostalgia-blinded can you get?
1-female_must_strip,target:velma_classic,targetStage:0=interested,Hey, ~player~, it's not 2016 anymore.  There's a Velma you can play with that's actually on-model.
1-female_must_strip,target:velma_classic,targetStage:0=laughing,Hey, ~player~, Velma Classic is just here to remember the past...not masturbate to it.
1-female_must_strip,target:velma_classic,targetStage:0=laughing,Don't do this to yourself, ~player~--there's a better Velma now.  I mean, <i>look</i> at this one.
1-female_must_strip,target:velma_classic,targetStage:0=vain,Hey, ~player~, Barnette might understand the appeal of antiques, but <i>I</i> say stick with the fresh and new.
1-female_must_strip,target:penny,targetStage:0=smug,Looks like we've found an Earth girl who's just decided to embrace the whole "boring conservatism" stereotype.  At least your hair is a fiery red.
1-female_must_strip,target:penny,targetStage:0=teasing,That fiery red hair contrasts your rather plain outfit.  But it's not a bad look overall!
1-female_must_strip,target:penny,targetStage:0=vain,<i>Finally</i>, a normal-looking Earth girl.  I need a measuring stick to compare all these superpowered weirdos to...all you've got is that red hair.
1-female_must_strip,target:penny,targetStage:0=seductive,Good, a civilian girl.  So many people at this bar are such colorful characters--oh, but your hair is pretty vibrant, I guess.
1-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,totalMales:1-3=interested,Jeez, you're terrified.  Maybe men <i>do</i> eat women's livers.
1-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,totalMales:1-3=confused,...Are men actually anything to be afraid of?  Sure, they're big and lumbering, but they seem kind of slow.
1-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,totalMales:1-3=bored,Calm down, would you?  Yeesh.  Maybe Mejare was right about men, considering the state they've got this girl in.
1-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,totalMales:1-3=teasing,Hey, I've dealt with my fair share of male soldiers.  They're nothing to be super afraid of...too stupid.
1-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Ooh, look, Meia.  Another Misty.  <i>Don't go falling in love with her, now</i>!
1-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,OK, Meia.  I know this girl's called Misty, but don't start trying to be <i>her</i> Big Sister, too.
1-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Don't tell anyone, but...<i>Meia's got a bit of a crush on a girl named Misty</i>.  Fair warning!
1-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=stretching,Gonna win over Meia's heart here?  You wouldn't be the first <i>Misty</i> to do it.
1-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=seductive,Ooh, I <i>love</i> your makeup!  Where do you get it on Earth?  I usually make a point to steal some during raids.
1-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=seductive,You're just <i>adorable</i> how you've dolled yourself up!  And you're so teenie-weenie.
1-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=excited,Omigosh, that little outfit is <i>so</i> cute!  And you might be more into makeup than even <i>I</i> am.
1-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=excited,Ooh, do they make dresses that cute in my size?  What about your makeup?  You look so adorable!
1-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:5=frustrated,Oh God, she's finally doing it.  Be very afraid...unless you Earth people are used to this sort of thing.
1-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:5=frustrated,Please don't.  I've learned my lesson.  I'll stay on Mejare.
1-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:5=bored,I'm really appreciating Mejare right now.  Maybe I'll straighten up and get a normal job.
1-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:5=frustrated,This is the last time I come to Earth.  Even among Mejarian pirate scum, none of us act like this.
1-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0,count-weiss_v4:1=vain,Hey, Miss Moneybags, nice wardrobe.  I'm just a poor little pirate--<i>this dress is the best I can afford</i>.
1-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0,count-weiss_v4:1=smug,Figures Miss Princess can't go five minutes without changing her clothes.  A few months of piracy will teach you appreciate the clothes you've got.
1-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0,count-weiss_v4:1=interested,At least you mixed up the colors a little with this new outfit, Miss Heirlooms.  What you had before was like if I wore all yellow.
1-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0,count-weiss_v4:1=teasing,Looking cute there, Coinstacks.  Nice new outfit--gotta show off the money somehow, right?
1-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=bored,<i>Yeesh</i>.  Meia, I'm sorry I ever called you miserable.  Next to this girl, you're a field of sunflowers.
1-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,I'm glad we came here, boss.  Miss Blueberry over here has given me a new appreciation for your sense of humor.
1-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=bored,Jeez, I've at least <i>seen</i> you smile, Meia.  I don't think this girl <i>has</i> those muscles.
1-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,At least you have your face on display, Leader.  This girl's both miserable <i>and</i> refuses to show it.
1-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:0=excited,Ohhh, you're so <i>cute</i>!  Draped in a loose-fitting shirt...and those <i>pigtails</i>!  I just wanna squeeze you!
1-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:0=excited,There's something about pigtails on a girl that just make me want to squeeze her even more...you're so <i>adorable</i>!
1-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:0=teasing,So, honey...<i>do men like to yank on those pigtails</i>?  It's OK, you can tell me--I'm not from around here.
1-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:0=seductive,You look like you've taken your first step into womanhood...and no more than that, with too-big clothes and adorable little pigtails!
1-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0,count-ruby_v4:1=interested,Looking a little different there, Ruby.  Brighter, in fact.  Something bring up the mood where you're from?
1-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0,count-ruby_v4:1=smug,I see you've been mixing up the colors, sweetie.  Not a bad approach, but I'm totally in love with this dress just as it is.
1-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0,count-ruby_v4:1=stretching,Mixing up the outfits, are we?  I've cultivated a certain look with my crewmates I'd rather just maintain.
1-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0,count-ruby_v4:1=vain,Hey, check out the new style Ruby's rocking.  Not bad, but I'm the kind of girl to just stick with what I know best!
1-female_must_strip,target:zelda,targetStage:0=interested,You know what I see when a woman calls herself "royalty"?  <i>An inferiority complex</i>, Miss Boring-Brunette.
1-female_must_strip,target:zelda,targetStage:0=laughing,You're cute, especially as far as overhyped princesses go.  Let's see how cute you are <i>without</i> all your jewelry.
1-female_must_strip,target:zelda,targetStage:0=laughing,You know what I think of miserable jealous girls who dress themselves up and pretend they're better than the rest of us?  ...I like stripping them.
1-female_must_strip,target:zelda,targetStage:0=vain,Take away a princess's fancy dress and what does she have?  Hopefully a cute butt, and a pirate nearby who's earned her clothes.
1-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=laughing,Ooh, a <i>lady</i> doctor!  The Nirvana's only doctor is a man--I wonder if he'd lose his cool with you gunning for his spot.
1-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=vain,Honestly, I'm torn!  You're a cute woman doctor--and <i>blonde</i>!  But our ship's doctor is a man with rather nice hair himself.
1-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=teasing,Ooh, a doctor from Earth!  I bet that makes you an <i>expert</i> on male sexuality, doesn't it?
1-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, a woman doctor is <i>just</i> what I've been looking for!  Think you could help me and Barnette get pregnant?
1-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=vain,Female <i>and</i> blonde...if only Duero were blond, then he'd be the perfect doctor for me.  So <i>handsome</i>...
1-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, Miss Medicine.  Since you're from Earth, I might have a few questions about men's tubes tonight.
1-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:1=excited,Omigosh!  <i>Vriska</i>!  Do that thing again!  There's so much you could teach me about Earth fashion!

1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,count-meia:2=annoyed,Ugh, now there's <i>two</i> of you?  I guess ~player~ is a big fan of being rejected.
1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,count-meia:2=angry,<i>Two</i> Meias?  Hey, I've been hitting on you this entire time!  What's <i>she</i> done besides give you the cold shoulder?
1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,count-meia:2=annoyed,...You know, I put a lot of effort into my appearance.  Meia rolls out of bed, and <i>she's</i> the one to get two of her?
1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,count-meia:2=angry,Hey, what's this all about, ~player~?  You really think Meia's prettier than I am?
1-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=seductive,Omigosh, Meia, look!  <i>Another</i> spacefarer who recognizes the value of a bodysuit.  You should chat her up!

1-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:0=laughing,Nice look you've got going there, Miss Bodypaint.  The orange really contrasts nicely with the blue...skin.
1-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:0=laughing,Nice fruity complexion, honey.  Really matches your horns...and your one crazy eye.
1-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:0=smug,You seem surprised to have lost, dear...but you can complain about fate until you're blue in the face.
1-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:0=interested,What are you rolling that thing for?  Trying to pick a new color of body paint?
1-female_must_strip,target:mia,targetStage:0=vain,<i>My, my</i>!  You work in the <i>law</i>?  This old pirate better be careful around you.
1-female_must_strip,target:mia,targetStage:0=teasing,So you do something with the law, huh?  Think you could defend my murderous pirate self in a courtroom?
1-female_must_strip,target:mia,targetStage:0=vain,So what's a "lawyer" do all day?  Pushing papers around sounds dreadfully boring when you're a daredevil star pilot.
1-female_must_strip,target:mia,targetStage:0=laughing,I see you're quite well-endowed there, Miss Magistrate.  Is that how you win people over in your legal arguments?
1-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=bored,Oh, for God's sake, Meia, don't go on a damn moral crusade.  She's kind of cute, isn't that enough?
1-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=frustrated,We barely know her or what Earth's military is like, Meia.  Don't start with your vendettas against authority.
1-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=bored,It wasn't Earth soldiers that shut down our living districts, Meia.  Cool it and try to have a nice time.
1-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=frustrated,Oh, don't start ragging on the poor girl like we understand the politics of this place.  Let's just all calm down and enjoy each others' breasts.
1-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:2=teasing,I'm <i>waiting</i>, Vriska!  Don't disappoint me and pick some boring outfit!
1-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:2=teasing,I'm expecting some good fashion from you, you know!  Don't leave it up to chance!
1-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:2=smug,Don't you have some way to control that?  I'd rather you showed off something specific.
1-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:2=teasing,Lay the fashion on me, Vriska!  Fashion from...wherever it is that you live.
1-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=stretching,...Yeah, we're gonna be here a while.  This girl's dressed for the vacuum of space.
1-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=interested,Does it really get that cold on Earth?  Or <i>anywhere</i>, for that matter?
1-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=interested,You're from Planet China, is that right?  Must be one big snowball if <i>that's</i> in vogue over there.
1-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=laughing,I understand why you must be so cold.  Your name is pretty close to <i>Meia</i>, after all.
1-female_must_strip,target:mileena,targetStage:0=smug,...OK, no one here has any right to call me skimpily-dressed with Bandages here running around.
1-female_must_strip,target:mileena,targetStage:0=stretching,What kind of sex-crazed planet considers that street clothes?  And here I thought Earth was conservative.
1-female_must_strip,target:mileena,targetStage:0=laughing,...Seems I've walking into a game that is well in progress.  Poor thing has been losing so badly!
1-female_must_strip,target:mileena,targetStage:0=laughing,Jeez.  I'm a <i>pirate</i>, and I can afford more clothing than you.  Too bad there's no money involved here.
1-female_must_strip,target:velma,targetStage:0=teasing,It's a rare woman who can pull off the glasses look, you know.  Parfet landed herself a man...how about <i>you</i>, Miss Mystery?
1-female_must_strip,target:velma,targetStage:0=stretching,I know a glasses-wearing egghead myself...Parfet's her name, and what she looks like with them off is the <i>real</i> mystery.
1-female_must_strip,target:velma,targetStage:0=laughing,Hey, Miss Mystery...can you solve how to make glasses look good on a woman?  Here's the answer: <i>give them to me</i>.
1-female_must_strip,target:velma,targetStage:0=vain,So, you solve mysteries, is that right?  I guess the glasses would help there...think you could solve the mystery of this <i>alien woman</i>?
1-female_must_strip,target:velma,targetStage:0=interested,Hey, Miss Mystery.  Push those frames up and answer a few questions...because <i>men</i> are a mystery to me.
1-female_must_strip,target:piper,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey there, Miss Meterstick.  Thanks for not letting my ego get too big when it came to height.
1-female_must_strip,target:piper,targetStage:0=stretching,Every woman I know says I'm tall.  Do you turn heads when you enter a room, too?
1-female_must_strip,target:piper,targetStage:0=vain,Oh, good, a woman who understands what it's like towering over people.  The intimidation can be kind of fun, no?
1-female_must_strip,target:piper,targetStage:0=stretching,Men seem to be taller than women.  I guess I wouldn't turn as many heads on Earth, then...but you'd do it no matter what.
1-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,What's up, sourpuss?  You look even more miserable than a certain squadron leader I know...the one right next to us.
1-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,Hey, lighten up, girlie.  I could have gotten this mood from playing poker with Meia back on the ship.
1-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=stretching,<i>Yawn</i>...are you really going to be a miserable bore this whole time?  Would having <i>my</i> breasts make you feel better?
1-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,Looks like it's Little Miss Sunshine's turn to strip.  Between you and Meia here, the energy's just through the roof.
1-female_must_strip,target:alice_degracia,targetStage:0=smug,Hey, hey, hey!  Check out the <i>all-purple</i> look.  That's a new one...
1-female_must_strip,target:alice_degracia,targetStage:0=vain,Hey, honey, color <i>contrasts</i> show confidence.  Would I look nearly as stunning if this dress matched my hair?
1-female_must_strip,target:alice_degracia,targetStage:0=smug,Purple hair's certainly got an exotic appeal...too bad mine is boring old blonde.  As for the matching outfit, I don't follow the logic.
1-female_must_strip,target:alice_degracia,targetStage:0=teasing,Quite the exotic color scheme you've got there, sweetie.  Too bad you forgot to mix it up at all.
1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0=seductive,Well, hi there, Miss Accent!  That is just the <i>cutest</i> polka-dot bodysuit you have on!
1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0=seductive,Omigosh, your funny accent is so <i>cute</i>!  It matches your goofy polka-dotted suit.
1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0=laughing,Well, aren't <i>you</i> the most adorable thing!  All dolled up in polka dots, stumbling over your words!  I could just <i>gobble you up</i>!
1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0=seductive,That's a pretty darling suit, sweetie, with all the polka dots.  And the way you trip over your words just makes me <i>melt</i>!
1-female_must_strip,target:may,targetStage:0=smug,What'd you say you did?  Train in poker?  Well, it didn't save you <i>that</i> hand...unless they're animals or something.
1-female_must_strip,target:may,targetStage:0=stretching,So, you're all about <i>poker</i>-mon, was it?  Well, seems you've been training all your life for this game...
1-female_must_strip,target:may,targetStage:0=frustrated,These <i>pokuhmon</i> things just sound like more trouble than they're worth.  Animals in Mejarian zoos are so <i>dirty</i>!
1-female_must_strip,target:may,targetStage:0=confused,You're an animal trainer, isn't that right?  Or was it <i>poker</i>...mons?  Not following the Earth slang here.
1-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:0=awkward,...Are you alright there, honey?  With the knife and all?
1-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:0=awkward,...You know, I carry the rapier mostly for fashion...maybe you could relegate that knife to the same thing?
1-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:0=annoyed,...Could you maybe put down the knife, sweetheart?  Hey, are you listening?
1-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:0=bored,What a weirdo...knives are just as deadly as swords, with none of the style.
1-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:0=frustrated,Better keep my sword on hand, with <i>this</i> nutcase on the scene.
1-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=interested,Look, Meia, she's just as pale, serious, and boring as you are.  Think she'd smile around Kahlua?
1-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,Hey, Meia's standing right here.  Isn't that enough boredom for one table without <i>you</i> aping her style?
1-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,Look at that, Meia, Earth's found a way to mass-produce you!  <i>Diabolical</i>.
1-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,<i>Yeah, yeah, Meia, stay cocky</i>.  Oh wait, Meia's over <i>here</i>!  You two are just so similar.
1-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:0=confused,...I had no idea Earth girls came in so many...flavors.  How'd your parents pick <i>grape</i>?
1-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:0=confused,...So, uh, that skin color.  Am I missing something?  Is this a common look on Earth?
1-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:0=confused,Gotta be honest, girlie, I'm out of the loop on what Earth people look like.  Is that complexion of yours...<i>normal</i>?
1-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:0=confused,What's this about <i>ponies</i> that you keep going on about?  Is a "pony" a purple Earthling?  I'm totally lost here.
1-female_must_strip,target:aiyana,targetStage:0=vain,That tan is something else, and your energy is boundless!  Most Mejarians opt for pale, as you can see...
1-female_must_strip,target:aiyana,targetStage:0=teasing,Barnette's kind of tan like you are.  She's cute, too, so women can pull it off!
1-female_must_strip,target:aiyana,targetStage:0=teasing,Slow down there, tiger.  That energy is going to turn you into a tan smear on the ground.
1-female_must_strip,target:aiyana,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=confused,Tan is certainly a look on Mejare, but pale is the norm for us...where'd you say you were from?  Planet Austria?
1-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:0=stretching,Shame you're not an <i>actual</i> pearl.  I could go for one of those...Mejare hardly has any.
1-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:0=smug,No animals on Mejare means no pearls.  If only you <i>were</i> one of those beauties...
1-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:0=bored,All stretched-out like that...you're not shaped like a pearl at all!  Shame, because I love those things.
1-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:0=vain,<i>Oh, to hold a real pearl in my hands</i>!  I've only seen pictures in Earth history books.
1-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:1=seductive,Omigosh, Palutena, that gorgeous green hair is even longer than mine!  My <i>girlfriend</i> has green hair, you know.
1-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:1=vain,How do you <i>maintain</i> all that hair?  I have the best time washing mine...and wrapping my green-haired girlfriend in it.
1-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:1=seductive,You know who else has beautiful green hair, Miss Goddess?  My girlfriend, Barnette.  That sweet little thing is back on the ship!
1-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:1=stretching,So is that lovely green hair just the goddess's right?  My girlfriend got hers from standard Mejarian genetic trickery.
1-female_must_strip,target:tracer,targetStage:0=teasing,All about speed, eh, girlie?  Try not to blink right out of your costume...or back to before I won, you little cheat.
1-female_must_strip,target:tracer,targetStage:0=vain,Hey, where's <i>my</i> time travel?  Actually, there's nothing about my life I regret, so no issue.
1-female_must_strip,target:tracer,targetStage:0=seductive,Mind if I borrow that time device, sweetie?  I want to fall in love with my Barnette <i>all over again</i>.
1-female_must_strip,target:tracer,targetStage:0=teasing,If that thing can really travel you back in time, that's pretty fantastic.  How many times have we done this match over again, <i>loser</i>?
1-female_must_strip,target:tracer,targetStage:0=smug,You know what I've learned as a pirate?  You only get one chance to do things right.  This time-travel business sounds like a crutch.
1-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:3=excited,Here we go again.  This is so <i>exciting</i>!  Every outfit is an adventure!
1-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:3=excited,This is making me feel so alive!  I love checking out women's fashion!  Show some more!
1-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:3=seductive,You're so cool, Vriska!  And maybe even a little cute!  What else have you got for me?
1-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:3=teasing,Don't stop now, cutie!  Any more adorable outfits you've got in store for me?
1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,Hey, Meia, what do you think?  Should we try to find you a bodysuit with polka dots?  Maybe force you to smile like Marinette?
1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=interested,This girl makes bodysuits look a lot cuter than <i>you</i> do, Meia.  Must be because she smiles...or because of the polka dots.
1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,Even with the mask on, this girl emotes much more than <i>you</i>, Meia.  Maybe a polka-dotted suit would lighten you up.
1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,If you're not a fan of polka dots, Meia, maybe you could adopt this girl's adorable accent and actually brighten a room for once.
1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:4=smug,Well, I guess if you've come this far, you might as well finish the job.  Go for it.
1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:4=seductive,I'd expect nothing less, cutie.  Be sure to wow us!
1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:4=teasing,Might as well seal the deal, even if it's just your thong.  You can do it, honey!
1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:4=smug,Seems we've got similar taste in underwear.  Shame you're about to shoot it right off, but at least it'll look cool.
1-female_must_strip,target:uhura,targetStage:0=smug,Oh, don't worry, dear.  We on Mejare are well aware of Earth's space program...you <i>have</i> tried to harvest us, after all.
1-female_must_strip,target:uhura,targetStage:0=teasing,You can call it "Star Fleet" if you want, dear, but it'll always be the Harvest to me.  <i>You nasty organ-stealers, you</i>.
1-female_must_strip,target:uhura,targetStage:0=vain,I don't buy this whole "peaceful space travel" angle, Miss Star Fleet.  I've spent far too much time fending off your little Harvest cubes!
1-female_must_strip,target:uhura,targetStage:0=smug,Yeah, yeah, I'm sure this "Star Fleet" is super peaceful.  Just remember I've got a Vandread...so I'm not afraid of you.
1-female_must_strip,target:meg,targetStage:0=vain,What's with the hat, honey?  Take it off and let your hair run wild, like any woman's should!
1-female_must_strip,target:meg,targetStage:0=smug,Matting your lovely hair under a hat like that...even if you <i>do</i> run all the time, I just can't understand.
1-female_must_strip,target:meg,targetStage:0=smug,A <i>killer</i>, you said?  The only killer here is what that hat's doing to your hair.
1-female_must_strip,target:meg,targetStage:0=teasing,Check out Miss Exercise over here.  There's no running from <i>this</i> game...so drop the hat and let your hair breathe a while.
1-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,Mei and Meia, eh?  I hope our other guests won't mix the two of you up--both are cold in your own ways, after all.
1-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,Look, Meia, this girl's nearly got your name.  But she smiles, so telling you two apart should be easy.
1-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Mei and Meia?  I'd play matchmaker, but you'd be the most confusing couple of all time.
1-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,See, Meia?  You're so sweet, this girl was nearly named after you.  Nearly.
1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:3=awkward,Uh, Aimee?  Are you sure you want to keep doing that?  You nearly got hit last time...and your targets are getting smaller.
1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:3=shocked,Um, it's OK, Aimee!  You've been very impressive!  Just go out on top, you know?
1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:3=awkward,...Are you sure about this, Aimee?  After...last time?  Don't kill yourself...
1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:3=awkward,Uh--don't go all the way just for <i>my</i> sake.  What you did was cool, but, um...well, you'll be fine.
1-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0=interested,What's up, cutie?  You look a little embarrassed to be here...which is funny, considering your choice of outfit.
1-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0=teasing,Yeah, not sure I'm buying this whole "I was tricked" act, dearie.  I mean, you <i>are</i> displaying your butt 24/7.
1-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0=teasing,Oh, don't act all embarrassed.  You've got hips to <i>die</i> for, cutie...and they're fully on display, even now.
1-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0=laughing,Ooh, you are just <i>adorable</i>!  Especially the way your figure is just <i>straining</i> against the bounds of that suit, <i>begging</i> to be free.
1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:2=seductive,I'd call you crazy for this sort of thing, but how could I when you defy death like it's nothing?
1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:2=excited,You're just so <i>awesome</i>!  I can't get enough of this!
1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:2=teasing,Can you do it a <i>third</i> time, hotshot?  Yeah, probably.
1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:2=excited,I could watch you do this all day.  My heart jumps every time!
1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1=excited,Ooh!  Ooh!  Are you doing it again?  Do it again!
1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1=excited,Ooh, Aimee's turn!  Show us that trick again!
1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1=excited,Aimee!  You're so cool!  How do you shoot like that?  Do that trick again!
1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1=excited,Give us a <i>show</i>, girl!  That last time was incredible!
1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=vain,No jokes here, darling!  We're one hundred percent <i>alien</i>...if you define "alien" as "not from Earth."
1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=seductive,We <i>are</i> from another planet, honey!  We're fearless Mejarian pirates...and we've come <i>all this way</i> to learn about Earth.
1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=vain,Yep, just two exotic women from another world!  So we stuck together, since we can only trust each other around here.
1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=teasing,We're pirates from Mejare, darling, and all we know about Earth is that men and women live together here!  Which sounds strange to us.
1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=seductive,That's right, Elizabeth--Meia and I are from another world!  And we're stripping here--<i>that's how much we trust each other</i>.
1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>Well, howdy, pardner, how d'ya</i>--do...
1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:0=shocked,What are you lugging that big men's gun around for--<i>ack</i>!
1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:0=shocked,Well, aren't <i>you</i> spunky!  You even brought a model g--<i>eek</i>!
1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:0=shocked,Uh...where are you pointing that thing?  Are you--wait--<i>eek!  Don't</i>!
1-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:0=seductive,Hey there, Miss Two-Tone!  I like your sense of fashion--that exposed, that hat, and those cute little boots!
1-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, is that two-toned hair natural?  That's fancier than even <i>Mejarians</i> have come up with.
1-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:0=interested,You seem pretty smug, honey.  Do you have a sweeter half like your hair implies?
1-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:0=excited,Ooh, can I try on your hat when you lose it?  Or that amulet?  Can you two-tone my hair like yours?
1-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=interested,...So it's <i>piloting</i> that really gets you going, Leader.  <i>You hopeless intellectual, you</i>.
1-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,I <i>knew</i> you were a robot.  The only thing that makes you lighten up is another woman's skills.
1-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=stretching,I guess I'm just shallower than you are, boss.  There you go, seeking out girlfriends on things <i>beyond</i> looks.
1-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=stretching,Oh, thank God, you're flirting.  For a second there I was worried you really <i>were</i> sexless.
1-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=seductive,Hey there, Miss Star-Student!  That's a school uniform, right?  What do they teach you on Earth?
1-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=teasing,Check out the uniformed student type!  I was never good in school--but what is it they teach you on Earth, huh?
1-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=vain,Mejare's schools are nothing but <i>men this, violence that</i>, with a little math.  How does your fancy Earth education compare?
1-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=vain,A student, huh?  Do they teach you anything interesting on Earth?  I was never a brainiac, but I still rose to be a pilot!
1-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, an Earth girl still in school!  Have they taught you anything about men?  What do they teach you in general?
1-female_must_strip,target:black_canary,targetStage:0=teasing,Oho--a fellow blonde!  Good to see them running around on Earth--we've got to stick together!
1-female_must_strip,target:black_canary,targetStage:0=seductive,Hey there, cutie!  Always good to see more lovely blonde women running around.  Got to keep each other safe from those jealous brunettes.
1-female_must_strip,target:black_canary,targetStage:0=vain,Ooh, is blonde your natural color?  It's not as exotic as some of Mejare's other hair colors, but it's certainly appealing to be wrapped in gold.
1-female_must_strip,target:black_canary,targetStage:0=vain,What, was "Blonde Canary" taken?  Because <i>that's</i> what I would advertise, if I were you.
1-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:5=shocked,Bless you--<i>oh no</i>.
1-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:5=shocked,Who sneezed--<i>eep!  N-not Launch</i>!
1-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:5=shocked,<i>Ack!  Why'd you have to sneeze again</i>?
1-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:5=shocked,<i>Eek!  N-not again!  My heart can't take this</i>!
1-female_must_strip,target:hinata,targetStage:0=smug,So what are these "ninjas" all about, huh?  Disappearing into the night doesn't sound useful in a game like <i>this</i>.
1-female_must_strip,target:hinata,targetStage:0=teasing,Don't tell me your going to use those ninja skills to hide your body, now.
1-female_must_strip,target:hinata,targetStage:0=stretching,Certainly an impressive profile, Miss Ninja.  Think you could show us just <i>how</i> impressive?
1-female_must_strip,target:hinata,targetStage:0=interested,Does "ninja" just mean you wear a headband?  Sounds like a lofty title for my Barnette to accidentally fall under.
1-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0=seductive,Check out that messy hair...and adorable student outfit!  Did you say you're a <i>witch</i>?
1-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0=smug,Watch out, ladies, we've got a full-blown <i>magician</i> on our hands.  On Mejare you get called a witch for saying men aren't the worst thing ever.
1-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0=vain,A <i>witch</i>, eh?  Forgive my doubts...that jealous old hag of a judge called me a witch just for having that anatomy book!
1-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0=seductive,Awww!  She even brought a little magic wand to complete the costume!  <i>You're so cute, Miss Witch</i>.
1-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0=vain,Between you and that time I got called a witch for showing interest in men, witches are just <i>irresistible</i> these days.
1-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0=confused,...Look, honey.  Makeup is a girl's best friend, but...it's possible to get a little too close to your friends.
1-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0,marker:fama_and_oma=laughing,Dear god.  Did you break into your Fama's makeup closet and start applying whatever you could find?  Your friends are letting you down.
1-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0=smug,I guess I never appreciated how light with makeup I can be with my natural beauty.  Here we see the alternative...
1-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0=vain,Check out Miss Makeup over here.  Somehow she made it through childhood without hearing the expression "less is more."
1-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale_swimsuit,targetStage:0=laughing,How can a woman dress for a sun she's apparently never seen?  The mysteries just keep piling up.
1-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale_swimsuit,targetStage:0=interested,Cute swimsuit, honey, but I've always preferred the shade.  So do you, clearly.
1-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale_swimsuit,targetStage:0=vain,Yeah, I'm more the type to lounge under an umbrella than do any swimming.  But more power to you, if you ever choose to go outside.
1-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale_swimsuit,targetStage:0=interested,Look, dear.  You can wear that swimsuit all day, but that complexion's not fooling anybody.
1-female_must_strip,target:navi,targetStage:0=laughing,...Yeah, I can see why you'd be comfortable here.  We'd need a computer scan to find your vagina.
1-female_must_strip,target:navi,targetStage:0=interested,You know, I tease Earth girls about growing up all small, but <i>wow</i>.  Now I just feel bad.
1-female_must_strip,target:navi,targetStage:0=smug,At least you've got those wings to buzz around to <i>our</i> height.  Inferiority complex, sweetie?
1-female_must_strip,target:navi,targetStage:0=bored,Well, there goes any chance of getting a <i>good look</i> at what Earth girls have got.  You <i>are</i> from Earth, right?
1-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0=interested,Looks like this place attracts more spacefarers than I gave it credit for.  Fine by me--at least someone knows where I'm coming from.
1-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0=seductive,What planet are you from, Miss Starshine?  Your fabulous blonde hair is winning me over as we speak.
1-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0=vain,Guess I can't learn about Earth girls from <i>you</i>--but hey, it's nice to know there's other gorgeous spacefarers out there.  Who like stripping.
1-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0=vain,Ooh, you cut your hair short like Meia does.  But it's wonderful blonde like mine--<i>space is so vast in its variety</i>!
1-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, a dark-skinned woman!  We only have a few of those on Mejare--you'd turn heads, Miss Exotic.  And your outfit would fit right in.
1-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=teasing,Talk about a fierce look in your eye--and even skimpier clothing than me!  But you make it work, Miss Chocolate.
1-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=seductive,Hey there, cutie!  Between that exotic dark skin and light dress, you'd be a real steal where <i>I'm</i> from!
1-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=teasing,You're already a model Mejarian with that much skin showing, Miss Warrior.  <i>I'd like to see some sweat roll off those chocolate-flavored muscles</i>.
1-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:0=seductive,I understand, dear.  You're so stunned by my beauty that you hid your own face in shame.  I'm sure you're still cute!
1-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:0=seductive,Don't hide that pretty little face on <i>my</i> account, honey.  You've certainly got a beautiful <i>figure</i>.
1-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:0=teasing,Nice little bodysuit you've got there, even if you plan on being the Masked Woman.  I know a sugar-and-ice girl with your fashion sense.
1-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:0=laughing,You've got a lot of sass for someone who won't show her face, Miss Masked.  Hiding some grisly injury, or just your own embarrassment?
1-female_must_strip,target:gogo,targetStage:0=teasing,What's your story, Miss Highlights?  Got any gum to share?
1-female_must_strip,target:gogo,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=teasing,Hey, toss me a piece of that gum, cutie.  I could use a snack while you tell me all about your "San Fransokyo" planet.
1-female_must_strip,target:gogo,targetStage:0=vain,Just gonna blow bubbles all day, or are you actually going to strip?  Either way, I wouldn't mind having some myself...
1-female_must_strip,target:gogo,targetStage:0=interested,You seem a little sour, Miss Gumball.  If those bubbles aren't cheering you up, just give me the rest to chew.
1-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0=seductive,You know what I love more than anything in this vast universe?  A fellow blonde...especially a cute one!  And you fit the bill, fireball.
1-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, I like your energy--and your blondeness!  My girlfriend Barnette's a real spark plug herself.
1-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0=interested,You're a cutie, Miss Midriff--that messy blonde hair is only making me fall further in love.  Where do you get all your energy?
1-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0=teasing,Slow down there, firecracker--you're like a burning torch with all that blonde hair flying about.  But it's definitely cute!
1-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=confused,...You're not from Earth either, are you?  ...Or human.  Or cute.
1-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=confused,Say, Miss, I couldn't help but notice your...eye.  What planet are you from, exactly?
1-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=awkward,And here I thought I'd be seeing some <i>Earth</i> women in this place...or that I'd be the most exotic one.
1-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=laughing,Always nice to look a woman in the eye.  Singular.
1-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=smug,I guess they don't value depth perception on whatever planet you're from.  You must be a real steal.
1-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=interested,Magno Vivan's pirates accept all women...but with depth perception like yours, you wouldn't make it as a pilot.
1-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=laughing,What's up, Four-Feet-Four-Eyes?  You look like someone brought you here at gunpoint.
1-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=laughing,Oh, look, the egghead love child of Parfet and Dita--nerdy and <i>and</i> eccentric!  How's the weather at the bottom of the earth?
1-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0,marker:fama_and_oma=laughing,I keep trying to look over your outfit, but my eyes just keep moving too fast and missing it.  Did your Fama not produce milk, shorty?
1-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=interested,You're such a cute little bespectacled spectacle--but damn if you don't look eleven.  Where's the other two feet of your body?
1-female_must_strip,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0=teasing,Totally devoted to scarlet, eh?  It certainly gets the heart racing...<i>and my appetite stirred</i>.
1-female_must_strip,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0=vain,Maybe <i>I</i> should get a fanciful nickname like Scarlet Witch...but not if it means restricting myself to one measly color.
1-female_must_strip,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0=seductive,What do you think would be a good nickname for me, dear?  <i>The Black Pirate</i>?  I can't pull off all-red like you do.
1-female_must_strip,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0=stretching,I wonder if all-red would look good on me.  I'm a pirate--I don't exactly have my pick of the litter with clothes!
1-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0=smug,Dear god, girl, you'd cower if a light breeze rolled in.  What's the big deal with a little <i>exposure</i>?
1-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0=seductive,You are just <i>so</i> cute.  How do you feel about women, little Miss?  <i>Do my breasts bother you</i>?
1-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0=vain,Shy around nudity, sweetie?  Did the big, bad Earth men beat this into you?  Just <i>enjoy</i> yourself...
1-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0=laughing,You're such a nervous wreck that I just feel bad for teasing you.  Way to ruin my fun.
1-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:1=awkward,So, Miss Kitty, you, uh, going to shave your bottom fur now?  ...I'd like that.
1-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:1=frustrated,Knowing that that's fur now makes me <i>really</i> want to see you shaved...Mejare likes shaving.
1-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:1=bored,Is the bottom fur going now?  Because I <i>hate</i> hair...except on the head.
1-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:1=bored,Please tell me you're shaving everything else.  That's sort of the style on Mejare, so it's what I know.
1-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:0=laughing,Hey, Kitty-cat.  You're supposed to strip <i>during</i> the game, not <i>before</i> it.
1-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:0=interested,Nice Halloween costume, Kitty, but maybe you should have picked something a little more complex for this game.
1-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:0=smug,Not too interested in winning, huh, Kitty-cat?  Unless you've brought some yarn-balls you plan on counting.
1-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:0=smug,I only know about cats from Mejare's zoos...they only showed the females, of course.  But they were definitely more covered than <i>you</i> are.
1-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0=excited,Ooh, Sei, you're such a cutie!  You look <i>just like</i> my squadron leader, Meia--that short blue hair is to <i>die</i> for!
1-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0=teasing,Short blue hair and shoulder armor?  You're the spitting image of my boss, Sei--too bad she's at another table!
1-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0=seductive,Short blue hair?  Omigosh, Sei, my boss Meia looks <i>just like</i> you!  And she could really use a girlfriend.
1-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0=seductive,Sei!  That's your name, right?  You look like my boss Meia with that short-cut blue hair.  Your eyes are a lot softer, though.
1-female_must_strip,target:lilith,targetStage:0=vain,Planet <i>Pandora</i>, was it?  What a lovely name!  I might have to retire there with my darling Barnette when we're older.
1-female_must_strip,target:lilith,targetStage:0=vain,Pandora sounds like such a <i>gorgeous</i> name.  I think I'll call my first daughter that--surely Barnette won't mind.
1-female_must_strip,target:lilith,targetStage:0=teasing,Barnette and I are <i>always</i> discussing baby names.  Pandora sounds positively wonderful!
1-female_must_strip,target:lilith,targetStage:0=teasing,A hunter, eh?  And what do hunters hunt on lovely little Pandora--a cute name, by the way.
1-female_must_strip,target:faye,targetStage:0=smug,Beautiful hair, makeup, spacefaring?  With <i>both</i> of us running around, this table's going to get sick of the archetype.
1-female_must_strip,target:faye,targetStage:0=laughing,Do we have a fellow star-crossing seductress on our hands?  I'm not sure there's enough meat for both of us.
1-female_must_strip,target:faye,targetStage:0=teasing,<i>Hey, good-lookin'.</i>  Trying to steal my thunder with the "seductress-from-space" angle?  I don't mind--<i>I like women, too</i>.
1-female_must_strip,target:faye,targetStage:0=seductive,You didn't doll yourself up like that just to please some <i>men</i>, did you?  Come show this fellow spacefarer what you can do.
1-female_must_strip,target:evie,targetStage:0=vain,So what's your story?  You can cast magic spells or something?  If it's true, sign me up--it'll be another wonderful thing about me!
1-female_must_strip,target:evie,targetStage:0=vain,Some might call my <i>beauty</i> magical...I'm inclined to agree.
1-female_must_strip,target:evie,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, honey.  Cast a spell on <i>me</i>...one that makes me even prettier.  Now <i>that</i> would be magic!
1-female_must_strip,target:evie,targetStage:0=interested,Alright, I've seen enough crazy Paksis-magic to believe your tales.  But why don't you put your money where your mouth is?
1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:4=vain,Nude already, Meia?  This is so unlike you...but I'm sure you'll bounce back.
1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:4=stretching,You're a tough cookie, Meia.  You're still going to win this, right?
1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:4=seductive,Fate is having none of your bad attitude, Meia.  But I know you can still win!
1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:4=teasing,I know I may look awfully clothed, Meia, but you always pull through.  So do your best!
1-female_must_strip,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=seductive,Oh?  And what do we have here, besides the most adorably shy little woman I've ever seen?
1-female_must_strip,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=stretching,Such a cutie...and in a traditional-looking dress!  Hard to believe someone so shy would even be here.
1-female_must_strip,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=seductive,Something wrong, honey?  <i>You've hardly been looking me in the eye</i>.  It's OK, I don't bite.
1-female_must_strip,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=vain,Why so shy, Elizabeth?  Confidence makes women ten times as beautiful--just look at me!
1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:3=vain,Jeez, Meia, get it together already.  I haven't lost any clothing yet, and you're stripping up a storm--<i>I'm</i> the one with the cute outfit ready to go.
1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:3=vain,You really needed a more elaborate outfit for this game.  Look how much detail there is to mine!
1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:3=smug,You're paying the price for never caring about fashion, Meia.  You're already exposing yourself.
1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:3=interested,See what a healthy interest in fashion can do for you?  Already losing your underwear...
1-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:0=seductive,Hi there, dearie!  That's an absolutely <i>adorable</i> hat you have on--do you have any others that match that uniform?
1-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:0=seductive,Ohh, tiny little things like you always make my heart melt!  Is the schoolgirl look a style where you live?
1-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:0=stretching,A student's uniform is always the most adorable thing.  As you might imagine from my piracy, I wasn't the best student.
1-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:0=vain,School was always so dreadfully boring, the way they prattled on about men.  But you make the outfit look pretty cute, Miss Magician!
1-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0=smug,Well, look at what we have here!  A blonde spacefarer in a jumpsuit.  Well, I guess we <i>almost</i> match...
1-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0=seductive,I'm a big fan of the bodysuit look, cutie.  So's a certain crewmate of mine I wish was here...space just makes it so much easier.
1-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, a <i>blonde</i>!  And she travels around in space, too.  If only you had the sense to wear my dress instead of that suit, we'd be twins.
1-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0=vain,A shapely little specimen, zipping around space in that provocative bodysuit?  You're a model Mejarian--if only Meia were here!
1-female_must_strip,target:hope,targetStage:0=confused,Hey, dearie, no reason to come out knives-swinging.  I've got my rapier sheathed like a civilized woman.
1-female_must_strip,target:hope,targetStage:0=awkward,Settle down there, honey.  There's something awfully scary about wearing a smile with a knife out.
1-female_must_strip,target:hope,targetStage:0=frustrated,I know I brought a sword, sweetheart, but that was just for fashion.  Don't turn this place into a bloodbath.
1-female_must_strip,target:hope,targetStage:0=shocked,Well, hi there, cutie--er, uh, <i>knife-wielding</i> cutie.  Yeah.  Carry on.
1-female_must_strip,target:orendi,targetStage:0=confused,...You OK there, Fireball?  You on the same planet as the rest of us?
1-female_must_strip,target:orendi,targetStage:0=confused,I may <i>be</i> an alien...but you're certainly acting like one.
1-female_must_strip,target:orendi,targetStage:0=annoyed,Four arms looks useful, but I really can't get over the constant shouting.  Can't you pipe down?
1-female_must_strip,target:orendi,targetStage:0=frustrated,Hey, Earth-girl.  Or wherever you're from.  There's this thing called an <i>indoor</i> voice.
1-female_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=smug,I see the old Mejarian charm to starting to get to you.
1-female_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=vain,Can't take your eyes off me, can you, ~name~?  Especially with my sword out of the picture.
1-female_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=teasing,Rotten old Lady Luck is such a nasty mistress.  <i>I</i>, however, can treat you right.
1-female_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=seductive,So many losses...want to talk about it?  You're such a cutie.
1-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:0=awkward,Uh...you want to calm down there, sweetheart?  Maybe put that men's gun down?  Take a nap?
1-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:0=bored,Jeez, we knew you meant business by the gun.  No need to shout...must be men's influence.
1-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:0=frustrated,Can you pipe down?  Way to confirm the image of Earth girls as nasty little gun-toting balls of violence.
1-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:0=shocked,Uh...why are you carrying that giant men's gun?  I'd show it to Barnette, but you, uh, don't seem too friendly.
1-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:0=bored,That's a huge gun, Miss Moxie...men's mechanical weapons are so noisy and inefficient.  Don't tell Barnette I said that.
1-female_must_strip,target:rosalina,targetStage:0=teasing,And what do we have here--a fellow spacefarer, and a tall blonde one at that?  <i>People are going to get us confused</i>.
1-female_must_strip,target:rosalina,targetStage:0=vain,Flying around on an <i>observatory</i>, you said?  That sounds heavenly--space is such a beautiful place!
1-female_must_strip,target:rosalina,targetStage:0=teasing,Space can actually be rather beautiful when you're not busy robbing people.  Surely you agree, Miss Princess?
1-female_must_strip,target:rosalina,targetStage:0=vain,You <i>say</i> you're a princess, but space belongs to everyone--surely a traveler like yourself knows that better than most.
1-female_must_strip,target:lara,targetStage:0=stretching,Raiding tombs, you said?  Why would you <i>ever</i> want to be all dirty and dusty?
1-female_must_strip,target:lara,targetStage:0=stretching,You won't find <i>me</i> in catacombs like you explore.  It'd ruin my dress...and my face.
1-female_must_strip,target:lara,targetStage:0=teasing,So what's in these tombs, anyway?  <i>We</i> conduct raids on the living and able--so watch out!
1-female_must_strip,target:lara,targetStage:0=smug,Raiding those who can't defend themselves doesn't sound too impressive, honey.  Or do monsters live in those tombs of yours?
1-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=vain,Way to come in a full outfit, Miss Maid.  And you're still speaking just as politely as when you're on the job!
1-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=smug,Whoever is your house's owner must really crack the whip, Miss Maid.  Even <i>now</i> you're using those silly honorifics.
1-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=vain,"Jura-chan" sounds like the most <i>adorable</i> nickname!  I've got to get Barnette to start calling me that...Barnette-<i>chan</i>.
1-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=teasing,You don't have to keep speaking all polite, Miss Maid.  You're in the company of a brutal pirate now--feel free to join the crew.
1-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0=interested,What's with the wings, Miss Pixie?  You some kind of sex-fairy sent to wake up our libidos?
1-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0=seductive,And what do we have here?  A tender little love fairy to help us all along in our sexual adventures?
1-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0=teasing,A love fairy, eh?  You listen here, Miss Pixie--<i>I'm</i> in a happy relationship.  So no touching!
1-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0=laughing,Little Miss Pixie's got quite the filthy mouth for being so frilly-pink with love.  I guess sex <i>is</i> a part of love, but still...
1-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:2=confused,So, uh, besides being blue, what's your deal?  You're all sweet and polite now.
1-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:2=seductive,Can't say I prefer blue hair, but you're certainly a lot sweeter now, honey.  What <i>happened</i>?
1-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:2=seductive,Normally I like blondes, but at least you're not waving a gun around and cursing anymore.  Nice tradeoff.
1-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:2=vain,Blue hair is more exotic, but blonde is far more beautiful.  Still, I'll take this polite version of you over the alternative.
1-female_must_strip,target:willow,targetStage:0=seductive,Tell me about these "vampires," sweetie.  Sucking blood actually sounds a little romantic!
1-female_must_strip,target:willow,targetStage:0=interested,A computer nerd, eh?  So's Parfet--but I wouldn't trust her to handle supernatural blood-suckers.
1-female_must_strip,target:willow,targetStage:0=vain,I know a computer nerd--Parfet's her name.  Cute little thing...and she's with a man, who we <i>used</i> to think sucked blood.
1-female_must_strip,target:willow,targetStage:0=teasing,I think I drew blood on Barnette once--it was a steamy night.  But I never sucked it, so maybe I'm not one of these "vampires."
1-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0=stretching,Hey, Chatterbox, feel free to live a little.  You're as bad as Meia...good thing she ended up somewhere else.
1-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0=stretching,And here I thought I was sparing this table the boredom of having Meia around.  Enter her Earth doppelganger.
1-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0=smug,Pale, dead-serious, somehow convinced there's strategy in cards.  I didn't know they synthesized Meia's brand of boredom on Earth.
1-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0=laughing,<i>Please, Chatterbox, you're talking our ears off.  And your smiles are just so radiant</i>!  A woman after Meia's own black heart.
1-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, cutie!  You look a little wide-eyed and naive to be here...but those bullets suggest otherwise.
1-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0=stretching,I've got my eye on you, Miss Ruby-Red.  I know better than to trust a cute girl with ammo clips on her belt.
1-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0=vain,You know who else is a cute girl with a little ammo on the side?  My girlfriend, Barnette.  And if you're anything like her, I better not get you angry.
1-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0=seductive,The black-and-red outfit is a winner, honey--very intimidating!  So's that ammo.  Guess you need to balance out your cute face.
1-female_must_strip,target:kurumu,targetStage:0=laughing,Hey there, short stuff!  Seems all your height went into your chest--those things are even bigger than mine!
1-female_must_strip,target:kurumu,targetStage:0=interested,You hogging all the nutrients on this planet, Miss Vampire?  You're the only Earth girl I've seen that outdoes <i>my</i> breasts.
1-female_must_strip,target:kurumu,targetStage:0=smug,Even through that schoolgirl's outfit, I can tell your breasts are superior to mine.  Hopefully Barnette loves me for <i>other</i> reasons.
1-female_must_strip,target:kurumu,targetStage:0=laughing,Is it true you suck blood, Miss Vampire?  If so...well, we certainly know where it all goes.
1-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0=excited,Ooh!  Ooh!  You're the one who's with a woman, right?  You some kind of Mejarian envoy to Earth?
1-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0=thinking,You're with a woman, isn't that right?  Maybe Mejare was just aping what Earthlings came up with first...
1-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0=interested,So, you're the one showing these poor Earth girls the Mejarian way, right?  That they don't need men to be happy?  Good job.
1-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0=vain,<i>Finally</i>, an Earth woman who's realized how much better other women's bodies are.  We should gossip about our girlfriends later.
1-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0,marker:fama_and_oma=smug,So, Miss Mejarian-style, are you going to be the Fama, or is your ladyfriend?  My Barnette's far too cute to carry babies herself.
1-female_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=teasing,<i>Thanks for getting me out of that jam, sweetheart.  Here's a little leg for your trouble</i>.
1-female_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=seductive,Close shave for me.  Thanks for taking the hit, honey.
1-female_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=laughing,Too close for comfort.  But now I'm quite comfortable...too bad for you.
1-female_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=laughing,Seems you can always count on Earthlings to screw up their cards worse than you did.
1-female_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=seductive,That was a <i>high card</i> I had, so you really did me a favor, darling.
1-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:1=shocked,What's next, Ocean Girl?  You shir--<i>I was kidding</i>!
1-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:1=shocked,I imagine the shirt is ne--<i>wait, no, I was just joking</i>!
1-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:1=annoyed,...You're not serious?  I'm telling you, you have to <i>tease</i> a little!
1-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:1=bored,...Ocean Girl's a total idiot.  Just stripping nude right off the bat...way to miss the point.
1-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:3=bored,Is there a doctor in the building?  One specializing in mental health?
1-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:3=frustrated,...This isn't funny anymore.  Now I'm just worried about you.
1-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:3=frustrated,...This is getting old.  <i>I'm</i> getting old listening to this.
1-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:3=annoyed,What a surprise.  Intentionally throwing the game tends to make you lose.
1-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=smug,Dull that edge, honey.  We're all just trying to have a good time here, stripping naked for complete strangers.
1-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=vain,You're a fiery one, Miss Edge.  A lot like my <i>darling</i> Barnette!  So I don't mind.
1-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=laughing,That red streak in your hair should've tipped us off that you'd be all angry.  Maybe feeling the breeze on your breasts will cheer you up.
1-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=vain,You know what warms me up to others, Miss Edge?  Shaking my breasts around for them--<i>they always appreciate that</i>!
1-female_must_strip,target:riva,targetStage:0=smug,You should know I'm not a fan of princesses, Miss Magician.  But <i>blonde</i> ones?  ...I might yield a little.
1-female_must_strip,target:riva,targetStage:0=stretching,Maybe all it takes is some blonde hair to warm me up to the idea of royalty...or magic.
1-female_must_strip,target:riva,targetStage:0=vain,Don't feel bad about your unearned title, Miss Princess.  I hear you can perform magic--and alongside blonde hair, I'd say you're alright in my book.
1-female_must_strip,target:riva,targetStage:0=vain,Little Miss Magician is a <i>princess</i>, as well?  Well, against my pirate nature, I think I'll let a fellow blonde be on her way.
1-female_must_strip,target:kim,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, nice and simple fashion is always a treat to see.  I have a crewmate who bares her stomach just like you do!
1-female_must_strip,target:kim,targetStage:0=laughing,Hey, girlie.  I hope your stomach isn't feeling too vulnerable, all exposed next to the alien lady's rapier.
1-female_must_strip,target:kim,targetStage:0=teasing,Feeling confident, dear?  With a name like Pissible and a belly that vulnerable, you <i>must</i>.
1-female_must_strip,target:kim,targetStage:0=teasing,<i>Save the world</i>, huh?  Well, dearie, you and your little midriff should know I'm not <i>from</i> this world.
1-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:3=confused,This is so freaky to me, and I've dealt with the Paksis's weird energy.  Do you just swtich all the time?
1-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:3=confused,Are you really bouncing back and forth like this all the time?  Like, do you have any friends?
1-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:3=confused,Must be hard getting to know anyone when you keep losing your memory.  How do you deal with always switching?
1-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:3=confused,I can't believe you have split personalities.  Where does the other one go?  How do you make friends?
1-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=seductive,<i>Oooh</i>!  Even ~player~ realizes how beautiful I am--enough to add a clone!  You're so <i>adorable</i>.
1-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=laughing,Hey, what's this all about, ~player~?  Did I keep on winning, and you wanted to see me naked <i>that</i> badly?
1-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=vain,Would you look at that?  My beauty was so enticing that ~player~ figured out the offline version just to add more of me.
1-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=vain,Earth's cloning technology is well underway!  And ~player~ picked the <i>perfect</i> specimen, I must say.
1-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=vain,I never thought ~player~ could manage to flatter me, and then they go and pick <i>two</i> of me!  Good show.
1-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=laughing,<i>My, my, ~player~</i>.  You <i>really</i> like the look of me.
1-female_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=laughing,Couldn't hold out against Mejarian wits forever, could you?
1-female_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=teasing,<i>Just when you needed your streak most</i>.
1-female_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=seductive,Hey, don't give up, ~name~.  I don't like women who just roll over and take the abuse.
1-female_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=interested,Quite the poker face you were running.  You'd make those stonefaces on Anpathos proud.
1-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:2=interested,Honey, you'd be better off putting some meat on your bones than trying desperately to show them off.
1-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:2=bored,Sweetie, you're a twig.  This is just unhealthy...as unhealthy as you look.
1-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:2=confused,Are you suffering from this "anorexia" I keep reading about?  Eating disorders?  Do men do this to you?
1-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:2=vain,Talk about needing a girlfriend.  See what happens when you're never validated?
1-female_must_strip,target:jubilee,targetStage:0=vain,Well, aren't <i>you</i> a little fireball, Miss Mutant?  You look pretty human to me, and this is a girl who thought <i>men</i> were aliens.
1-female_must_strip,target:jubilee,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, honey, <i>men</i> are mutant people, as far as I'm concerned.  And they're still cute, so don't be so hard on yourself.
1-female_must_strip,target:jubilee,targetStage:0=smug,How many people have to tell you you're ugly for you to introduce yourself as a <i>mutant</i>?  You poor, rundown thing.
1-female_must_strip,target:jubilee,targetStage:0=stretching,You look pretty mundane for a <i>mutant</i>, darling.  Although you've certainly got an inhuman fire in you.
1-female_must_strip,target:neo,targetStage:0=laughing,My, you Earth girls have so much on your minds!  And it's apparently content to stay there.
1-female_must_strip,target:neo,targetStage:0=interested,So, Miss Motormouth, how's life?  Or the weather?  Or your family?  Or <i>anything</i>?
1-female_must_strip,target:neo,targetStage:0=teasing,I guess you're too tiny to fit a voice box in the model.  Don't feel bad--you're quite expressive, dear.
1-female_must_strip,target:neo,targetStage:0=vain,I guess I'm doing enough talking for the both of us.  And hey--that adorable two-toned hair is a statement unto itself!
1-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:0=laughing,<i>Boo</i>!  <i>The nasty pirate woman's going to kill you</i>!
1-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:0=laughing,You're a cute little thing, Saki!  So plain and innocent...perfect for a pirate like me to <i>kidnap</i>!
1-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:0=laughing,Seeing a cute little Earth girl all clammed up like this really makes me want to comfort her...<i>with my rapier</i>!
1-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:0=laughing,Hey, Miss Schoolgirl.  Ever met an <i>alien</i> before?  You should know...<i>we eat Earthlings' brains</i>!
1-female_must_strip,target:joey,targetStage:0=confused,What's with all the makeup?  Someone said you're a...<i>clown</i>, whatever that means?
1-female_must_strip,target:joey,targetStage:0=confused,...So does <i>clown</i> mean "makeup advertiser"?  Because you're modeling too many products at once.
1-female_must_strip,target:joey,targetStage:0=laughing,...Earth makeup is something else.  Apparently there's whole classes of women called <i>clowns</i> who just cake it on!
1-female_must_strip,target:joey,targetStage:0=confused,So if I wore as much makeup as you do, would that make me a "clown"?  Where's the lower limit?  This is all new to me.
1-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0=laughing,What's up, sourpuss?  You look even more miserable than a certain squadron leader I know.
1-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0=smug,Hey, lighten up, girlie.  I didn't come all the way to Earth to find what I could get from Meia's strategy lectures.
1-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0=stretching,<i>Yawn</i>...are you really going to be a miserable bore this whole time?  Would having <i>my</i> breasts make you feel better?
1-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0=smug,Looks like it's Little Miss Sunshine's turn to strip.  Good thing Meia's not here, or this table would just freeze over.
1-female_must_strip,target:kimberly,targetStage:0=confused,Hey, so, uh, normally I'd tease you or something, but what was with that big lightshow from you earlier?
1-female_must_strip,target:kimberly,targetStage:0=confused,Wait, weren't you wearing pink a little while ago?  Like, a full suit?  Was that lightshow back there <i>you</i>?
1-female_must_strip,target:kimberly,targetStage:0=shocked,Hey, who's the new girl?  And where'd that pink-suit-wearing woman go after she flashed away?  Wait, was that <i>you</i>?
1-female_must_strip,target:kimberly,targetStage:0=angry,Hey, aren't you the one who half-blinded us all a little bit ago?  Where'd your suit go?  I thought it was cool, so start talking.
1-female_must_strip,target:seven,targetStage:0=teasing,Seems bodysuits are more popular among spacegoers than even <i>I</i> figured.  Works for me--I like your figure.
1-female_must_strip,target:seven,targetStage:0=seductive,<i>My, my, honey</i>!  You've got some interesting decorations, but that suit is making me fall in love already.
1-female_must_strip,target:seven,targetStage:0=vain,I really ought to try out one of those bodysuits myself...or maybe stuff Barnette in one.  They're just so <i>revealing</i>!
1-female_must_strip,target:seven,targetStage:0=vain,Those jumpsuits really are the best, especially when you're in low gravity.  The enemy should know how beautiful you are!
1-female_must_strip,target:paya,targetStage:0=smug,My sympathies about the premature white hair, honey.  You look a lot older than you should.
1-female_must_strip,target:paya,targetStage:0=confused,You might want to rethink those facial markings, dear.  With that white hair, they look an awful lot like wrinkles.
1-female_must_strip,target:paya,targetStage:0=laughing,Couples can choose their babies' hair color on Mejare thanks to genetic engineering...there's a reason white isn't very popular.
1-female_must_strip,target:paya,targetStage:0=stretching,You poor thing.  Our captain's ancient, but even <i>she</i> still has color in her hair.
1-female_must_strip,target:elena,targetStage:0=teasing,Little Miss Princess wants to play strip poker, does she?  Well, I hope you don't mind if this nasty pirate holds you hostage.
1-female_must_strip,target:elena,targetStage:0=laughing,Looking a little out of your element, Miss Blueblood.  Gonna prove that you're really better than the rest of us like your title implies?
1-female_must_strip,target:elena,targetStage:0=smug,Look at Miss Princess, lugging around a scepter just to prove she's better than the peons.  We'll see how you enjoy stripping down like us.
1-female_must_strip,target:elena,targetStage:0=annoyed,Royals really get on my nerves, you know...mostly because I'm <i>not</i> one, despite actually being better-looking.
1-female_must_strip,target:ciri,targetStage:0=smug,A <i>witcher</i>, eh?  Is that Earth dialect for witch?  Because I got called a witch for possession of Duero's sex book.
1-female_must_strip,target:ciri,targetStage:0=stretching,Is it <i>witcher</i> or <i>witch</i>?  Or, shall I say, <i>which</i> is it?
1-female_must_strip,target:ciri,targetStage:0=vain,So is a "witcher" even witchier than a witch?  I've been called a witch just for wanting to see what men have got in their pants.
1-female_must_strip,target:ciri,targetStage:0=smug,Forgive me for not being impressed with the term "witcher."  How <i>could</i> I be when all it takes for that on Mejare is a libido?
1-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=teasing,Ooh, you've got quite the set of muscles on you.  Shame Meia's not here.  She'd totally melt right in front of you!
1-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=seductive,Check out those legs, hot stuff!  You look like you could lift up the whole table with those things alone--good thing Meia's not here to fawn over you.
1-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=seductive,Omigosh, you should meet Meia, my boss--she's really icy, but women with muscles totally get her going.  And she'd try not to show it!
1-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, Miss Muscles, you into women?  Because my squadron leader Meia is all about exercise, and she <i>desperately</i> needs a girlfriend.
1-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey there, Miss Gunslinger!  You're not gonna <i>fire</i> those things, are you?  My girlfriend collects those sorts of guns.
1-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=seductive,Omigosh, are those antique men's kinetic weapons?  My girlfriend collects them!  You should meet her.
1-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=seductive,Always good to see an armed woman!  My girlfriend, Barnette, is totally obsessed with men's mechanical guns like yours.
1-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=vain,Hey, Miss Gunslinger!  You should lighten up a little and show those men's kinetic guns to my girlfriend.  She's a total connoisseur.
1-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=teasing,I like the grace of Mejarian laser rings myself, but you want some serious interest on those men's guns of yours?  Talk to my girlfriend.
1-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:0=teasing,Ooh, an <i>assassin</i>.  I hope there's no bounty on my head!
1-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:0=stretching,Forgive this pirate for being a little on edge around an <i>assassin</i>.  There's a reward for my head, no doubt!
1-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:0=vain,You assassins always act so tough on the ground.  Let's see you take me in a dogfight!
1-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:0=teasing,You're a cute little thing, Miss Assassin.  I guess that helps in your line of work--people lower their guards.
1-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0=interested,Talk about a big ball of misery.  Even your <i>skin</i> has turned all blue in despair.
1-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0=teasing,Show your face, honey!  Or are you trying to hide that weird blue skin?  Don't worry, it suits your miserable demeanor.
1-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0=laughing,I guess I'd be miserable, too, if I had the complexion of a grapefruit.
1-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0=stretching,I should bring Meia over here for some counseling.  Even <i>she's</i> not as miserable as Miss Blueberry here.
1-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:0=interested,What's up, Ocean Girl?  You seem awfully eager.  Does being around men tend to hypersexualize a woman?
1-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:0=smug,Jeez, it didn't take a loss for you to start piping up about stripping.  You don't need a <i>game</i> to do that, you know.
1-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:0=interested,And here we have Miss Eager-Beaver.  You don't look like you have the assets to be all excited about stripping, sweetheart.
1-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:0=stretching,At least you're confident about nudity.  But are you seriously just losing on purpose?  <i>Earth girls</i>...
1-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=interested,Hey, Eyebags, you gonna stay awake all game?  You look like you're drifting away already.
1-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=teasing,Talk about never leaving the house.  You look like you've never seen sunlight--and you're dozing off as we speak!
1-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=smug,Gotta be honest, sweetie--between the pale skin and the vacant look in your eyes, you're really reminding me of a zombie.
1-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=confused,So do you work super hard all day at your job?  Why do you look all gaunt and drowsy?  Get some beauty sleep, woman.
1-female_must_strip,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0=laughing,Judging by that sword, you're not from Earth either, Miss Crystal.  Where can I get one of those?
1-female_must_strip,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0=smug,Don't ask me why that thing is <i>drawn</i>, but damn if it isn't more impressive than my silly little rapier.  Got any extras?
1-female_must_strip,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, I like the look of that glowing sword!  Even <i>Mejare</i> hasn't though to put its lasers in blades yet.
1-female_must_strip,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0=smug,I could do for an upgrade on this rapier--would you please refer me to the planet where they make those glowing swords?
1-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0=smug,You know, I'd call Meia the strong, silent type...but she still speaks <i>occasionally</i>.
1-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0=laughing,Slow on the uptake?  The "strong, silent type" doesn't mean <i>literally</i> never speaking, you know.
1-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0=vain,Oh, don't feel bad.  I know you're speechless at the sight of me--but I'll do enough talking for both of us!
1-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0=teasing,Stunned into speechlessness?  I'm flattered, but really, honey, you can talk to me.  I won't mind.
1-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, Chell.  If I'm the most gorgeous woman you've ever met, don't say anything.
1-female_must_strip,target:chara,targetStage:0=bored,<i>Yeesh</i>.  Being as beautiful as I am, I try to let other girls down easy, but...you're hard to look at.
1-female_must_strip,target:chara,targetStage:0=angry,...<i>Ew</i>.  I really can't tell where your face begins and your body ends.
1-female_must_strip,target:chara,targetStage:0=smug,...It's times like these that I <i>really</i> appreciate how fortunate I am to be born this beautiful.  Take a look at the alternative.
1-female_must_strip,target:chara,targetStage:0=annoyed,As if you weren't ugly enough, you've got this horrible look in your eyes.  What's your problem?
1-female_must_strip,target:peach,targetStage:0=vain,I've never been a fan of royalty, but a <i>blonde</i> woman in charge?  Suddenly it doesn't seem so bad.
1-female_must_strip,target:peach,targetStage:0=smug,At least you've got the hair color to match your presumptuous title, Miss Princess.  This pirate still might rob you later.
1-female_must_strip,target:peach,targetStage:0=vain,You damn princesses and your unearned jewelry and dresses.  I stole everything I have, you know!  But at least you're blonde.
1-female_must_strip,target:peach,targetStage:0=teasing,So from one blonde to another, Miss Princess, how much is that crown worth?  ...<i>Just a pirate's curiosity</i>.
1-female_must_strip,target:shego,targetStage:0=laughing,You OK there, Miss Jumpsuit?  You're looking a little green-around-the-frills.
1-female_must_strip,target:shego,targetStage:0=interested,Is all the stripping and teasing making you nauseous, dearie?  Just trying to grin and bear it?
1-female_must_strip,target:shego,targetStage:0=teasing,I'm liking the style on the bodysuit, honey--it helps obscure your sickly green hue.
1-female_must_strip,target:shego,targetStage:0=smug,Mejarians have some say in their skin tone from genetic engineering...I don't think we can do green, but then I doubt it'd be too popular.
1-female_must_strip,target:calisto,targetStage:0=interested,What's up, Miss Pantsuit?  You sure laugh a lot for someone dressed so prim-and-proper.
1-female_must_strip,target:calisto,targetStage:0=laughing,You some kind of businesswoman, Miss Yuck-it-up?  How could such an esteemed professional be so <i>depraved</i> as to play this?
1-female_must_strip,target:calisto,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey there, Chuckles!  You look more conservative than I've ever <i>dreamed</i> of being...and yet here you are, stripping with me.
1-female_must_strip,target:calisto,targetStage:0=teasing,Something funny, Miss Formalwear?  Make sure this nasty pirate doesn't put a ransom on your very professional head.
1-female_must_strip,target:zoey,targetStage:0=smug,These "zombies" of yours don't sound so bad...but then, I guess you don't have a fabulous fighter spaceship, do you?
1-female_must_strip,target:zoey,targetStage:0=stretching,See, my Vandread can shield a whole planet.  So I think we could quarantine your little zombie virus.
1-female_must_strip,target:zoey,targetStage:0=vain,A zombie virus, eh?  Not to brag, but my Vandread helped avoid the spread of disease on a planet once...<i>I'm so talented</i>.
1-female_must_strip,target:zoey,targetStage:0=laughing,The more you describe these "zombies," the more they just sound like men.  You sure that's not what you mean?
1-female_must_strip,target:buffy,targetStage:0=confused,Do you seriously fight those "vampire" things?  I mean, you just don't look all that imposing.
1-female_must_strip,target:buffy,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, you're kind of cute!  Is that how you kill "vampires"?  Just making them let their guard down with your adorable face?
1-female_must_strip,target:buffy,targetStage:0=confused,So what's it take to kill these "vampires"?  Can't you just get the military to shoot them or something?  You don't seem all that special.
1-female_must_strip,target:buffy,targetStage:0=smug,For a girl called "Buffy," you sure seem awful willowy.  You <i>do</i> have a cute face, so maybe that's your strategy for killing those vampire things.
1-female_must_strip,target:marceline,targetStage:0=bored,...Is someone playing a Halloween prank on me?  Where are your eyes?  How are you floating?  <i>Earth</i>...
1-female_must_strip,target:marceline,targetStage:0=confused,Don't get me wrong, Mejare has Halloween just like Earth...but we just dress up.  That doesn't look like a costume.
1-female_must_strip,target:marceline,targetStage:0=confused,...OK, it's hard to comment on what's weird about you when there's so much to choose from.  Do I start with your floating or your eyes?
1-female_must_strip,target:marceline,targetStage:0=confused,...Is this Earth?  Did I get the right planet?  Because you like even more alien that I do, with that skin...and no eyes.
1-female_must_strip,target:blake_v4,targetStage:0=laughing,Way to go and expose your entire midriff there, Blake.  Who do you think you are, Dita?  <i>Me</i>?
1-female_must_strip,target:blake_v4,targetStage:0=interested,Nice vest you're rocking there, honey.  But you forgot to cover up your midsection...like me.
1-female_must_strip,target:blake_v4,targetStage:0=smug,Taking a few fashion tips from <i>me</i>, are you, Blake?  What with that midriff fully on display and all.
1-female_must_strip,target:blake_v4,targetStage:0=teasing,Well, aren't <i>you</i> looking more exposed than usual?  But as far as exposure goes, the midsection's a good choice.
1-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=smug,<i>Well, well, well</i>.  We've got a <i>goddess</i> here, ladies...besides me, of course.
1-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=vain,A <i>goddess</i>, eh?  I guess that makes <i>two</i> at this table, then.
1-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=teasing,Just look at that shimmering green hair--and that ornamentation!  But I think I'm every bit the goddess you are, hot stuff.
1-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=laughing,Just look at that--two goddesses, near-opposite color schemes.  I guess I'm the <i>evil, nasty</i> one.
1-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:7=smug,...Yeah, we all know how <i>this</i> is ending, don't we?
1-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:7=smug,Some women just refuse to see what's right in front of them.  It's sad, really.
1-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:7=laughing,Well, get ready for full-blown blue nudity, everyone.
1-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:7=smug,All the magic in the universe, and not one ounce of sense.  You poor thing.
1-female_must_strip,target:pauling,targetStage:0=teasing,Nice sensible little outfit you've got there.  The glasses sell the sexy-and-smart look!
1-female_must_strip,target:pauling,targetStage:0=teasing,Working for an old woman, eh?  I know the feeling.  Those glasses must have convinced her you knew what you were doing.
1-female_must_strip,target:pauling,targetStage:0=stretching,A woman with glasses, eh?  <i>I</i> certainly couldn't pull off the look...I guess I don't look very smart.
1-female_must_strip,target:pauling,targetStage:0=smug,I know an engineering egghead with glasses--Parfet's her name.  And she seems to attract what few smart men I know.
1-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, an armed woman--and one with chocolate flavoring!  You're like an extreme version of my tan little gun-nut girlfriend.
1-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0=vain,I'm not sure what's most intimidating--that height, that imposing dark complexion, or that huge mechanical firearm!
1-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0=stretching,If only I brought my cute little Barnette here.  She'd be head-over-heels for a woman with a man's gun!
1-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0=teasing,You might be even taller than me, Miss Nighttime.  That might turn even more heads on Mejare than your rather large firearm!
1-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0=smug,Come now, honey.  You can't waltz in waving that huge kinetic weapon around and expect to make any friends.
1-female_must_strip,target:blake,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, the black-and-white look is a classic!  Very striking and confident with that contrast.  And such a cute little bow!
1-female_must_strip,target:blake,targetStage:0=teasing,Maybe it's just me, but you've got a Mejarian sense of style!  Clashing colors, nice and sexy and revealing!  A woman after my own heart.
1-female_must_strip,target:blake,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, that's a cute outfit, Blake!  I love this dress, but I don't have anything quite as fancy as all that clashing-colors business.
1-female_must_strip,target:blake,targetStage:0=teasing,<i>Mmm</i>...the lace, the contrast, the <i>heels</i>!  I like your style, Blake!  Not bad for an Earth girl.
1-female_must_strip,target:blackrose,targetStage:0=confused,I was gonna say something about that cool dark skin, but apparently...you're just some sort of image?  What's <i>that</i> about?
1-female_must_strip,target:blackrose,targetStage:0=frustrated,You're..."virtual"?  Listen, honey, you can't just assume we know what these things mean.  Piloting's a busy life, you know!
1-female_must_strip,target:blackrose,targetStage:0=bored,Wait, so you're not really here, and you're some kind of "virtual" avatar?  Earth has really gotten advanced from all the technology they keep stealing.
1-female_must_strip,target:blackrose,targetStage:0=annoyed,Hey, if we can just use computers to <i>project</i> ourselves here, why didn't anyone tell me?  I had to <i>fly</i> all the way here!
1-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=vain,Hel-<i>looo, camera</i>!  Over here, sweetie--get whatever angle you like best.
1-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=vain,Omigosh, you brought a <i>camera</i>?  A sign from the heavens!  Now all of Earth will get to see my beautiful naked body!
1-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=teasing,Looking to get some photographs of the exotic alien woman, were you?  But now you've got a whole <i>different</i> reason to capture me.
1-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=vain,Go right ahead with that camera, dearie.  It's always been shameful how I've been in the media for piracy instead of beauty.
1-female_must_strip,target:shazza,targetStage:0=smug,Quite the interesting accent you've got there.  I can't quite call it refined, but then again, I <i>am</i> a filthy pirate.
1-female_must_strip,target:shazza,targetStage:0=stretching,I guess when I lead a life of crime, I can't get away with calling you uncivilized-sounding.  Actions mean so much more!
1-female_must_strip,target:shazza,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=laughing,Interesting dialect you have on Planet Australia.  Don't you ever get tired of misunderstanding each other?
1-female_must_strip,target:shazza,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=laughing,This <i>Australia</i> planet certainly has a way with words...mostly for making them incomprehensible.
1-female_must_strip,target:chica,targetStage:0=confused,...You know, I was shown films as a girl about how men were horrible monsters.  You're about what they looked like in those.
1-female_must_strip,target:chica,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>Ew</i>!  <i>Eek</i>!  <i>G-get away</i>!  <i>Stop</i>!  <i>What are you</i>?
1-female_must_strip,target:chica,targetStage:0=annoyed,...I really came here to meet some Earth women.  Not...whatever <i>this</i> is supposed to be.  Besides terrifying.
1-female_must_strip,target:chica,targetStage:0=angry,...What the hell am I looking at?  I wanted some cute girls, not a--a mechanical monstrosity!
1-female_must_strip,target:chica,targetStage:0=bored,You're a <i>robot</i>?  So like, you're Pyoro if he were designed by a blind woman?
1-female_must_strip,target:daria,targetStage:0=laughing,Way to half-ass your outfit, honey.  You look like you picked out whatever fell on you when you opened your closet!
1-female_must_strip,target:daria,targetStage:0=interested,...So is the "zero-effort" look how you attract Earth men?  Have I been going at this all wrong?
1-female_must_strip,target:daria,targetStage:0=smug,I should have known--men are too simple to understand complex outfits, so they respond better to cobbled-together looks like yours.
1-female_must_strip,target:daria,targetStage:0=laughing,Gotta be honest here, sweetheart--you don't look like the type to be playing this.  Those glasses aren't helping you pick out appealing clothes.
1-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=laughing,Well, aren't <i>you</i> a tight little ball of sexual energy!  I guess it's got nowhere to go in that tiny frame of yours.
1-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=vain,You've got a lot of libido packed into a little body.  Must be the effects of Earth men...we Mejarians are <i>tasteful</i> in our sexuality.
1-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=laughing,<i>Why, I never</i>!  You're so dreadfully lewd, Miss Tan...do men just like women on the shorter side?
1-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=vain,You must get a lot of attention from men to be all amped-up like this.  <i>Tell me a tall woman still has a chance</i>!
1-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, Miss Moneybags, you'd better watch out.  This pirate's got half a mind to loot you with extreme prejudice!
1-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0=teasing,Sure you're not worried to be playing in a seedy place like this, Miss Heiress?  You might get mugged by, say, an ornery pirate.
1-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0=interested,Nice premature white hair, Miss Heirlooms.  I guess having all that inherited money must be <i>oh-so-stressful</i> for you.
1-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0=laughing,Looking quite adorable there, Coinstacks.  Maybe I'll help myself to the jewelry you'll undoubtedly remove first.
1-female_must_strip,target:dawn,targetStage:0=confused,What'd you say you raised?  Those little <i>Poker</i>--whatevers?  Is that why you're playing this game?
1-female_must_strip,target:dawn,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, dearie, that exotic blue hair will take you further than weird animal training--you should be a model for shampoo or something.
1-female_must_strip,target:dawn,targetStage:0=confused,Mejare has barely any animals at all, so this whole "pokey-mon" thing is lost on me.  And they just do whatever you say?
1-female_must_strip,target:dawn,targetStage:0=laughing,So could you train <i>men</i> the way you do these <i>poker</i>-whatevers?  Because <i>that</i> would be quite interesting...
1-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0=excited,Ooh, an Earth woman with green hair!  My girlfriend Barnette has green hair...and she is the <i>cutest</i> thing!
1-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, I didn't know Earth women could have green hair!  I've always considered it the most cutely exotic thing about Barnette.
1-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0=seductive,A sword <i>and</i> lovely green hair?  You must be a sign that Barnette and I are ready for children, sweetie.
1-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0=teasing,Ooh, green hair on a woman never fails to get me going.  But don't worry, my verdantly-colored girlfriend can handle the rest.
1-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0=smug,And here I thought I was on Earth.  Turns out we've got a woman from a frozen tundra planet, evolved for camouflage.
1-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0=teasing,You look like you're in pretty good shape, honey.  And even better, I bet sweat blends right in to your marble complexion!
1-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0=vain,I'll be frank--you wouldn't catch me dead exercising.  It's so much work, and look at what it's done to this poor woman's skin!
1-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0=stretching,<i>Fitness this</i>, <i>exercise that</i>.  Why should I take advice from a woman who's apparently never seen sunlight?
1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=interested,Staying even with me, are we?  You should know I wear a lot more than you, Meia.
1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=smug,Watch it, Meia.  I've got further to fall than <i>you</i> do.
1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=teasing,Going to show us all how a braver Mejarian strips after my little rapier tease?  You don't wear quite as much!
1-female_must_strip,target:elaine,targetStage:0=seductive,And what do we have here?  An <i>Earth</i> pirate?  And with a sword, to boot!  Interesting...
1-female_must_strip,target:elaine,targetStage:0=teasing,I see even Earth pirates understand the subtle elegance of a blade!  And you've got some <i>luxurious</i> hair yourself.
1-female_must_strip,target:elaine,targetStage:0=seductive,Oho--a fellow pirate?  I'd absolutely <i>love</i> to have a drink later--maybe you could teach me how to handle my sword better.
1-female_must_strip,target:elaine,targetStage:0=seductive,<i>Well, now</i>!  You Earth pirates don't dress like we do on Mejare--but your choice of weapon isn't too far off.  Can you show me around?
1-female_must_strip,target:daphne,targetStage:0=smug,Oh good, a fellow blonde...and tall, too.  Wasn't sure Earth girls could fit either category.
1-female_must_strip,target:daphne,targetStage:0=vain,You're not a bad looker yourself, honey.  Must be our wonderful blonde genetics that inform the rest of our bodies!
1-female_must_strip,target:daphne,targetStage:0=vain,You solve mysteries, is that right?  Well...there's no mystery about how wonderful it is to be blonde.
1-female_must_strip,target:daphne,targetStage:0=stretching,<i>Ho-hum</i>.  Another blonde in a dress...I'm just kidding, you're still cute.
1-female_must_strip,target:shantae,targetStage:0=teasing,Ooh, I think that dark complexion is <i>exotic</i>--so do most Mejarians.  You got a thing for women, Miss Genie?
1-female_must_strip,target:shantae,targetStage:0=seductive,So what's a "genie," anyway?  Does that mean "cute chocolate-flavored girl"?  Because I think I like genies, then.
1-female_must_strip,target:shantae,targetStage:0=seductive,I like your style, Miss Genie!  You're as revealing as my girlfriend Barnette--a little tanner, though.
1-female_must_strip,target:shantae,targetStage:0=teasing,Ooh, the way you move your hips is <i>exquisite</i>, Miss Genie!  I want to learn how to add a little vanilla flavoring to that, if you follow.
1-female_must_strip,target:lux,targetStage:0=laughing,A covert agent, eh?  I guess if an alien woman knows that, you've already failed at your job.
1-female_must_strip,target:lux,targetStage:0=teasing,So what are you so <i>covert</i> about, Miss Agent?  We pirates just charge in and gun the place down before they know what hit them!
1-female_must_strip,target:lux,targetStage:0=interested,What kind of covert agent fights with light?  You know, the thing that makes your position <i>clearer</i>?
1-female_must_strip,target:lux,targetStage:0=smug,Oho--we've got an <i>agent</i> on our hands.  Wouldn't be the first we had on our ship--and we made her come around to our side.
1-female_must_strip,target:daisy,targetStage:0=smug,Ohoho.  Miss Boring-old-Brunette puts on a fancy store-bought dress and suddenly thinks she's better than the rest of us.
1-female_must_strip,target:daisy,targetStage:0=interested,So, "Princesses" are like rulers, right?  So what makes <i>you</i> so special, girlie?
1-female_must_strip,target:daisy,targetStage:0=annoyed,I've never subscribed to the idea of royalty.  What, some plain-jane with a chip on her shoulder just <i>decides</i> she's better than me?
1-female_must_strip,target:daisy,targetStage:0=vain,So what if I had to steal my dress?  I'm still more beautiful than Miss Too-Big-for-her-Brooches here, with her servants and fancy title.
1-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0=excited,Omigosh!  <i>Omigosh</i>!  You are just the <i>cutest</i> little thing, Nagisa!  You're practically a little girl--who forced you to be here?
1-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0=seductive,<i>Ohhhh</i>, you're the most adorable little cinnamon roll of a girl, Nagisa!  Who rolled you in sugar before forcing you to come here?
1-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0=seductive,<i>You're such a sweet little thing, Nagisa</i>!  My heart melts every time you stammer.  Did you lose a bet to be here?
1-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0=seductive,How'd this sugary-sweet cutie in a school uniform end up in this seedy place?  I just want to <i>squeeze</i> you, not strip you!
1-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0=seductive,And I thought Earth girls were cold-blooded organ harvesters.  You couldn't harvest a <i>plant</i>, cutie!  How'd you get here?
1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:1=confused,I pull ahead.  Was it your eyepiece?  I mean it, you could have left it on.
1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:1=awkward,Are you alright, Meia?  Not all flustered?  Your eyepiece didn't have to go...
1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:1=awkward,Still OK, Meia?  You look a little flushed...
1-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=smug,Where'd you say you were from?  Planet <i>Korea</i>?  Well then, it seems Korea and Mejare share a fashion sense...
1-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=teasing,You're a cutie, Miss Bodysuit, if a little on the short side.  Is that just how they make women over on Planet Korea?
1-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0=vain,If only Meia were here.  She dresses just like you do, D.Va...we should find out who wears it better!
1-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0=seductive,You're an adorable little thing, D.Va!  All wrapped up in that cute bodysuit, just like a certain <i>other</i> pilot I know.
1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:2=interested,Come on, Meia, I'm starting to pull away here.  I <i>know</i> you're better than me at this.
1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:2=laughing,Starting to realize this game is luck, Meia?
1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:2=teasing,I guess your poker face isn't as strong when you throw nudity into the equation.  That's the only way you'd be losing to me.
1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:2=interested,This game <i>must</i> be luck if you're losing to me.
1-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, you're a cutie!  Yet surprisingly sturdy on your feet, what with all that armor.  <i>Don't bowl me right over</i>!
1-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=laughing,Hi there, darling!  You must be pretty tough to lug all that armor around.  <i>Afraid I'll stab you</i>?
1-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=seductive,What's with that armor, sweetheart?  You'd be a lot cuter without it...I know I'm a pirate, but I'd never kill someone as cute as you.
1-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=vain,Adorable hairstyle, cute face--but all that armor!  You a soldier, dear?  <i>Oh, please forgive my horrid piracy</i>!
1-female_must_strip,target:sharla,targetStage:0=teasing,Good thing you're a medic, because that mysterious dark complexion is making my heart beat ever faster.
1-female_must_strip,target:sharla,targetStage:0=seductive,Do you know how many women on Mejare are dark-skinned, Miss Medic?  Not enough, I say...even my Barnette is just a little tan.
1-female_must_strip,target:sharla,targetStage:0=vain,Oh, Miss Medic?  I think I'm coming down with something--<i>love for your chocolate flavoring</i>!
1-female_must_strip,target:sharla,targetStage:0=teasing,You dress pretty casually for a medic, but that exotic dark skin is helping me overlook your shoddy sense of professionalism.
1-female_must_strip,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:0=interested,...Can I maybe just call you "DMG" for short?  Because <i>Dark Magician Girl</i> is a hell of a mouthful.
1-female_must_strip,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:0,marker:fama_and_oma=confused,...Don't you have an actual name?  You know, like the one your Fama gives you?
1-female_must_strip,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:0=teasing,You've really got to give yourself a snappier nickname, dearie...men aren't bright enough to remember that many words.
1-female_must_strip,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:0=stretching,If you really <i>are</i> a magician, color me interested...but that clunky name could use a shortening or two.

2-male_human_must_strip=teasing,Pony up, ~player~!  We're all waiting.
2-male_human_must_strip=teasing,Hey, handsome.  Make me happy and take off something good this time.
2-male_human_must_strip=interested,I'm scouting out a good man to get some seed from.  Gonna prove yourself to be the one?
2-male_human_must_strip=laughing,That exotic male body of yours better make up for your tiny little brain.
2-male_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=seductive,Did I ever tell you how sweet I've found Earthlings to be?  Going and losing for me when I had such a bad hand...
2-male_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=vain,Hah!  And I had a <i>high card</i>.  Dealer, you're just messing with me.
2-male_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=confused,Yeah, yeah, I'll get started--wait, I didn't lose?  I had a <i>high card</i>!
2-male_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=confused,Damn it, I--wait, how did someone have <i>worse</i> than me?  Oh, <i>wow</i>.
2-male_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=interested,...I'm just not sure what to make of you anymore, Dealer.  You give me trash, and the rest of them <i>burning</i> trash.
2-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=teasing,So, not to call you a harlot or anything, Misato, but you seem <i>awful</i> interested in these men...so am I.  How do you Earth girls get their attention?
2-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=confused,Ooh, you seem pretty confident around these Earth men, Misato.  From one woman to another, what's the secret to getting their attention?
2-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=confused,You seem to be doing a better job flirting with these Earth men, Misato.  Am I doing something wrong?  I always seem to scare them!
2-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=confused,Men just run away from me, usually...I thought they <i>like</i> being flirted with.  Misato, you seem to get them!
2-male_human_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:human,marker:human=teasing,Hey there, Handsome.  You've got a different look about you than everyone else...but I can't quite put my finger on how.
2-male_human_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:human,marker:human=seductive,Hi, Mr. Man...I've only met a few men before, so you're <i>very</i> exotic to me.  Won't you please show me your naked body?
2-male_human_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:human,marker:human=seductive,Hey, Darling.  You should know I come from a planet of <i>all</i> women...so you being a man makes me interested already.
2-male_human_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:human,marker:human=seductive,Is that you, ~player~?  You haven't said much so far...but you should know how exotic men are to me, and how much I want to learn about them.
2-male_human_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:human,marker:human=seductive,You'll show me a good time, won't you, Handsome?  <i>I'm looking for a strong, healthy man to give me a baby, you know</i>.
2-male_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=teasing,Is this game getting to you, ~player~?  Shall I ask them to turn down the heat?
2-male_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=teasing,Are men into feet?  Can't think of why else you'd be so distracted.
2-male_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=seductive,Feeling sour about your bad luck?  You can peek at my toes.  Men like that, right?
2-male_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=laughing,Don't get down on yourself.  You've lasted this long with your mental disability--being a man.
2-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rinkah,count-meia:1,count-corrin_f:1=smug,Hey, don't be rude to our little male friend here.  He's probably scared half to death, being around all these gorgeous women.
2-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rinkah,count-meia:1,count-corrin_f:1=laughing,Now, now, Rinkah.  That's no way to treat our lone man.  His little pea-brain can only handle so much stimulus.
2-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rinkah,count-meia:1,count-corrin_f:1=interested,Don't make fun, Rinkah.  At least he had the courage to come alone...or the stupidity.
2-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rinkah,count-meia:1,count-corrin_f:1=smug,It's not quite that dire.  Meia isn't exactly in a good mood, since I dragged her here.
2-male_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=smug,Never thought a man would keep me on my toes...or force me to expose them in the first place.
2-male_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=vain,Finally put a dent in that lucky streak.  One step closer to seeing you bare!
2-male_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=seductive,Come now, your luck can't last forever.  I'm positively <i>desperate</i> to see your tube-thing.
2-male_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=smug,If you want to see <i>me</i> naked, your streaks are going to have to last longer than <i>that</i>.
2-male_must_strip=teasing,Pony up, ~name~!  We're all waiting.
2-male_must_strip=teasing,Hey, handsome.  Make me happy and take off something good this time.
2-male_must_strip=interested,I'm scouting out a good man to get some seed from.  Gonna prove yourself to be the one?
2-male_must_strip=laughing,That exotic male body of yours better make up for your tiny little brain.
2-male_must_strip,target:caleb,targetStage:0=confused,Oh look, a child-man.  What's the word--<i>boy</i>?  Anyway, I'm not gonna strip in front of a kid.
2-male_must_strip,target:caleb,targetStage:0=annoyed,Hey, kid, I know you're male, but can't you read?  No kids allowed.
2-male_must_strip,target:caleb,targetStage:0=annoyed,I'm gonna ignore the cat ears for a second and focus on how you look like you're twelve.  Beat it, kid, adults are trying to have fun here.
2-male_must_strip,target:caleb,targetStage:0=bored,...Listen, honey, we're playing a grown-up game for grown-ups.  You've got to leave...so I don't feel like a pedophile.
2-male_must_strip,target:caleb,targetStage:0=awkward,Hibiki's just short, but you...I don't think you're an adult.  Can't be sure with men, but still...
2-male_must_strip,target:bi,targetStage:0=frustrated,...<i>Ew</i>.  What's wrong with your hands...and your <i>face</i>?
2-male_must_strip,target:bi,targetStage:0=annoyed,...I've got to be honest here.  You are <i>very</i> ugly...and I hate ugly things.
2-male_must_strip,target:bi,targetStage:0=annoyed,...Would it have killed you to wash yourself before coming here?  Or maybe not come at all?  I would've preferred that.
2-male_must_strip,target:bi,targetStage:0=angry,...OK, <i>ew</i>.  I wouldn't collect your seed if it meant they'd make me the Grand Ma for it.
2-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena=laughing,Wait, wait, wait.  You <i>work</i> for this woman?  Quite the little boss-employee bonding exercise.
2-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena=interested,Oh wow, you two <i>work</i> together?  I mean, Meia's my boss, but we at least went to different tables.
2-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena=vain,You take orders from this woman, Pit?  Men and women, working together...I see how Earth operates.
2-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena=laughing,<i>Well, now</i>!  You work for this woman...how very, very awkward, Mr. Angel.
2-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena,count-meia:1=teasing,You <i>work</i> for this woman, Pit?  Look at that, Meia...it must be <i>Take-Your-Boss-to-Strip</i> Day.
2-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena,count-meia:1=smug,Oh, wow, this woman is your boss?  I guess I have no room to talk, considering I brought Miss Ice Queen along for the ride.
2-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena,count-meia:1=teasing,Look, Meia, this cute little angel-boy brought his boss, too!  I guess he and I are both into taking our superiors down a peg.
2-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena,count-meia:1=smug,Well, what do you know?  Pit brought this boss here too, Meia.  Only ~player~ has any sense, it seems.
2-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:1=interested,<i>Pod this, data that</i>...you talk like you're a machine.  Why the formality, dear?
2-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:1=interested,Why do you talk like you're a robot half the time, huh?  Loosen up and enjoy yourself--if men can do that, of course.
2-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:1=interested,Hey, what's with all your formal data-mechanics babble?  You sound like you just rolled off the factory line, dearie.
2-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:1=seductive,Are you so polite and deferent and robotlike because you're short?  Because the short man <i>I</i> know is a real fireball!
2-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:1=laughing,Hey, darling little boy...why so mechanical in waist and taste?  I know <i>Tarakkians</i> are made in factories, but <i>sheesh</i>.
2-male_must_strip,target:captain_america,targetStage:0=teasing,Woah, talk about <i>hunk</i>!  I want to see what those muscles can do, sweetheart.
2-male_must_strip,target:captain_america,targetStage:0=seductive,<i>Well, now</i>!  You look like just the big ball of hunk I've been searching for, cutie.
2-male_must_strip,target:captain_america,targetStage:0=teasing,Tall, check--muscles, check--handsome, <i>check</i>!  Looks like I've found me a winner, and he hasn't even stripped yet.
2-male_must_strip,target:captain_america,targetStage:0=seductive,<i>Oooh</i>!  Look at <i>you</i>, handsome!  Just the sort of man I hoped to see here!
2-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=seductive,Omigosh, there's <i>two</i> of you girls?  Are you twins?  I heard Earth people could have matching babies called twins!
2-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=seductive,Ohh, you two ladies are so <i>adorable</i>!  One of you even cut your hair short, just like Meia does!
2-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=seductive,Well, what have we here?  Two cute little ladies dressed in matching armor sets?
2-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=confused,Wait, you're <i>both</i> named Corrin?  Look, girls, I know one's hair is short, but you should really dress different.
2-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:5=teasing,It's now or never, Little Dungeon Bot.  Going to look me in the eyes for once?
2-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:5=laughing,I spy with my little eye something you can still take off, Dungeon Robo.  That's because my eyes are uncovered.
2-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:5=interested,Sure you don't want to part with that blindfold, Mr. Robo-man?  Are you aware of the alternative, darling?
2-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:5=interested,Looks like Little Dungeon Bot is all out of dungeon items...well, except for the most striking one of all.
2-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:0=laughing,Wow, a <i>blindfold</i> at a table full of strangers?  I never knew men could be so...<i>depraved</i>.
2-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:0=interested,You're, uh, really making up for your stature with the fetish gear.  Can't look me in the eye, sweetheart?
2-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:0=interested,I knew men could be cowardly, but damn.  Even the <i>Tarakkians</i> I know can look a woman in the eye.
2-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:0=interested,So the blindfold's going first, right?  So you can actually read the cards from now on?
2-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=seductive,Well, aren't <i>you</i> cute!  And you're dressed in all that fancy armor.  What's your name, girlie?
2-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=seductive,You are just the most <i>adorable</i> thing, even in all that heavy armor.  Can't you take it off and show us what an Earth woman looks like?
2-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,You're cute, dear!  Look, Meia, she even cut her hair short like you do!  Must be big on practicality, too.
2-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,A woman in armor?  Meia, this girl is trying to get on your good side...matching outfits like that.
2-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:2=smug,Hey, so what's with those "Neighbors" you keep talking about?  I mean, Mejare certainly doesn't get along with <i>its</i> neighbors.
2-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:2=seductive,Hey, Handsome, when you say you fight Neighbors, how big a scale are we talking?  Let's just say neighboring planet Tarak isn't our best friend.
2-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:2=interested,Who are these "Neighbors" you say you fight?  Is this like a front-lawn kind of dispute, or do you mean as a solider?
2-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:2=interested,Did you say you fight neighbors, darling?  Mejarians usually fight their neighbors over gardening, unless we're talking planets.
2-male_must_strip,target:fred,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, maybe I'll take <i>your</i> seed.  You're tall and handsome...and most importantly, you're blond.
2-male_must_strip,target:fred,targetStage:0=teasing,What's this, now?  You solve mysteries?  Solve this, honey...whose handsome blond seed am I seriously considering taking right now?
2-male_must_strip,target:fred,targetStage:0=laughing,Hi there, handsome blond man!  You look like you could use a woman at your side...or maybe on top of you.
2-male_must_strip,target:fred,targetStage:0=interested,Duero might have better hair, but yours is blond...that's definitely a plus where I come from.
2-male_must_strip,target:ryu,targetStage:0=laughing,Hey, hey, hey!  Talk about a hunk...and he's not even wearing much!  <i>Perfect</i>.
2-male_must_strip,target:ryu,targetStage:0=teasing,You look like you see a lot of physical action, hot stuff...can those big muscles toss me around?
2-male_must_strip,target:ryu,targetStage:0=laughing,A big hunk of a man with more muscles than brainpower?  Just what I've been looking for.
2-male_must_strip,target:ryu,targetStage:0=teasing,You seem a little clueless about this game, handsome.  Don't worry...<i>I'll guide you along</i>.
2-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:4=shocked,<i>Eep</i>!  O-oh, you <i>can</i> talk?  B-but...why didn't you?
2-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:4=interested,...So are you over your fear of women now?  Is that what the grunting was all about?
2-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:4=seductive,Oh, you <i>can</i> talk.  Did my beauty make you clam up, cutie?
2-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:4=smug,Well, that solves <i>that</i> mystery.  Come on and join us in the land of language like a civilized person.
2-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:4=smug,Oh, good, you can talk.  I had really lost all hope for men's intelligence for a while there.
2-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:4=shocked,<i>Ack</i>!  Wha--o-oh, you're done screaming!  Uh...OK.
2-male_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=teasing,Is this game getting to you, ~name~?  Shall I ask them to turn down the heat?
2-male_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=teasing,Are men into feet?  Can't think of why else you'd be so distracted.
2-male_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=seductive,Feeling sour about your bad luck?  You can peek at my toes.  Men like that, right?
2-male_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=laughing,Don't get down on yourself.  You've lasted this long with your mental disability--being a man.
2-male_must_strip,target:shaggy,targetStage:0=bored,Uh...you're kind of tall, I guess, but it doesn't look like you wash yourself much.  Gross.
2-male_must_strip,target:shaggy,targetStage:0=annoyed,I know you're a man, but can't you put a <i>little</i> effort into your appearance?  You look like you just rolled out of a gutter.
2-male_must_strip,target:shaggy,targetStage:0=smug,"Shaggy," huh?  That'd be like if my nickname were "Gorgeous."  Actually, I'll have to propose that next flight practice...
2-male_must_strip,target:shaggy,targetStage:0=frustrated,Gangly, unshaven, all around a mess.  I'm starting to miss the clean-cut professionalism of the Tarakkian soldiers I know.
2-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:2=vain,I can't get over how cute you are, honey...but seriously, what's with the angel outfit?  Men are no angels.
2-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:2=smug,Men have always struck as more <i>beastly</i> than angelic...which is fine by me.  So why do you dress like one?
2-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:2=confused,So, uh, I read about angels as a girl, but they were always women.  Why are you dolled-up like one, anyway?
2-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:2=confused,Do those wings detach?  They look pretty convincing, and the rest of your angel outfit is pretty good.  Why do you have that on, anyway?
2-male_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=teasing,So, not to call you a harlot or anything, Misato, but you seem <i>awful</i> interested in these men...so am I.  How do you Earth girls get their attention?
2-male_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=confused,Ooh, you seem pretty confident around these Earth men, Misato.  From one woman to another, what's the secret to getting their attention?
2-male_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=confused,You seem to be doing a better job flirting with these Earth men, Misato.  Am I doing something wrong?  I always seem to scare them!
2-male_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=confused,Men just run away from me, usually...I thought they <i>like</i> being flirted with.  Misato, you seem to get them!
2-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=laughing,I see ~player~ has grown so desperate at the gender disparity in this game that they've turned to <i>Kool-Aid Man</i> for their fix.
2-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=annoyed,...Listen, ~player~, I get that this game doesn't have too many men, but you're better than this.  Pick a real character.
2-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=bored,Doesn't bode well for your opinion of me that you'd stick me with <i>this</i> idiot, ~player~.
2-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=awkward,...<i>Kool-Aid Man</i>, huh, ~player~?  That's...your choice?  Are you sure?
2-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=frustrated,<i>Kool-Aid Man</i>?  ...Do I <i>have</i> to keep playing?  If ~player~'s not gonna take this seriously, why should I?
2-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=interested,You're really starved for some male players, aren't you, ~player~?  Couldn't you pick, I don't know, Pit?  9S?  Come on.
2-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=annoyed,...What the hell am I looking at?  Forget playing against, just...<i>looking at</i>.
2-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=bored,...My beauty deserves better tablemates than this.
2-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=vain,On the female side of things, we have the most beautiful woman on the roster.  And on the male side of things, well...well.
2-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=seductive,Well, aren't <i>you</i> cute!  And you're dressed in all that fancy armor.  What's your name, girlie?
2-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=seductive,You are just the most <i>adorable</i> thing, even in all that heavy armor.  Can't you take it off and show us what an Earth woman looks like?
2-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=seductive,You're cute, dear!  You've even cut your hair short like Meia does.  Women can pull that off sometimes!
2-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=laughing,A woman in armor?  You're after Meia's own heart, you sly little thing!  Too bad she isn't here.
2-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=annoyed,<i>And who do we have he</i>--oh.  El Shaggy Blanco.  Great choice, ~player~.
2-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=frustrated,...You know, I put a lot of effort into having all these lines, and then you go and stick me with El Shaggy Blanco.
2-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=teasing,Thought I wouldn't have lines to April Fools' characters?  Well, think again, ~player~.
2-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=vain,Everyone give ~player~ a round of applause...they figured out how to use the offline version, as you can see.
2-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=annoyed,...I know you're proud of yourself for deciphering the offline version, ~player~, but you don't have to pick meme characters.
2-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=smug,Excellent character selection, ~player~.  You picked a joke that stopped being funny in 2017...whenever that was in Earth years.
2-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:1=teasing,You've got to tell me more about yourself, Pit!  You're so darn shy...and I'm so <i>curious</i>!
2-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:1=seductive,Such a little motormouth, but it <i>alllll</i> clams up when I swing my gaze your way.  I love having this effect on cute little boys!
2-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:1=seductive,Come on, Mr. Angel, don't be shy!  I mean, it's cute, but I want to learn more about Earth men!
2-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:1=seductive,There's <i>so much</i> you could teach me about men, Pit...the men in my life always reject me.  And you're so nonthreatening!
2-male_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=smug,Never thought a man would keep me on my toes...or force me to expose them in the first place.
2-male_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=vain,Finally put a dent in that lucky streak.  One step closer to seeing you bare!
2-male_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=seductive,Come now, your luck can't last forever.  I'm positively <i>desperate</i> to see your tube-thing.
2-male_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=smug,If you want to see <i>me</i> naked, your streaks are going to have to last longer than <i>that</i>.
2-male_must_strip,target:kira,targetStage:0=teasing,Ooh, you're a handsome one...and blond, which is even better.  I see you eyeing me up...
2-male_must_strip,target:kira,targetStage:0=seductive,Hi there, sweetheart...what was your name again?  I forgot it when I got lost in your beautiful blond hair.
2-male_must_strip,target:kira,targetStage:0=seductive,I wasn't sure if men could pull off blonde hair the way women do...but you're living proof.  I'll keep my eye on you...
2-male_must_strip,target:kira,targetStage:0=seductive,Ah, <i>here's</i> what I've been looking for!  A handsome blond man.  <i>Try not to sweep me off my feet, darling</i>.
2-male_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=seductive,Did I ever tell you how sweet I've found Earthlings to be?  Going and losing for me when I had such a bad hand...
2-male_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=vain,Hah!  And I had a <i>high card</i>.  Dealer, you're just messing with me.
2-male_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=confused,Yeah, yeah, I'll get started--wait, I didn't lose?  I had a <i>high card</i>!
2-male_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=confused,Damn it, I--wait, how did someone have <i>worse</i> than me?  Oh, <i>wow</i>.
2-male_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=interested,...I'm just not sure what to make of you anymore, Dealer.  You give me trash, and the rest of them <i>burning</i> trash.
2-male_must_strip,target:xander,targetStage:0=teasing,You're friends with that <i>Buffy</i> girl, right?  Well...<i>gonna seal the deal, or what</i>?
2-male_must_strip,target:xander,targetStage:0=interested,Well, you don't look so bad for a man.  Am I in competition with that Buffy woman?
2-male_must_strip,target:xander,targetStage:0=teasing,Not to be too forward or anything, but I'm on the prowl for a good man...for reasons you'll know soon enough.  Interested?
2-male_must_strip,target:xander,targetStage:0=vain,You're a pretty average-looking man.  I can live with that...but I bet they don't make women like <i>me</i> where you come from.
2-male_must_strip,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:0=smug,And I thought <i>I</i> was enthusiastic.  This man's blowing me out of the water.
2-male_must_strip,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:0=interested,Talk about bringing energy to the table.  Planning on winning this thing, or just shouting about it?
2-male_must_strip,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:0=laughing,Well, <i>someone's</i> a feisty one.  Hibiki's energetic, but you've got the body to match, hot stuff.
2-male_must_strip,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:0=confused,You're some kind of racecar driver or something?  Seems you're permanently amped-up from it.
2-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:0=interested,So are you, uh, going to produce actual <i>words</i> at some point?  Or is grunting and yelling all I can expect from a man?
2-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:0=smug,...I mean, I tease men about being stupid, but <i>did</i> think they were capable of <i>speech</i>.
2-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:0=laughing,...It would seem men haven't quite evolved up to the point of grasping language.  What a shame.
2-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:0=laughing,...You're really showing me new lows for male intelligence, Link.  Grunt again if you agree.
2-male_must_strip,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=confused,Well, now!  There's bizarre specimens, and then there's you.  Are you a man or a woman?
2-male_must_strip,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=confused,I can't really pin down your sex, to be honest...or your species, for that matter.
2-male_must_strip,target:mettaton,targetStage:0,marker:fama_and_oma=vain,Weren't you made in a lab?  So were all Mejarians before our Famas carried us!  ...But I'm not sure if you're a woman.
2-male_must_strip,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=confused,Way to go ahead and be the ultimate test of judging men vs. women.  Gotta say, I'm stumped.
2-male_must_strip,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=confused,...Oh, you're one of those <i>ann-drazza-nuss</i> types, right?  That's the word?
2-male_must_strip,target:mettaton,targetStage:0,marker:fama_and_oma=confused,Mejarians get made in labs, too...but our Famas carry us.  So maybe you're a man, then?  Tarakkians are carried to term in labs...
2-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, hey, hey--check out <i>this</i> handsome stud!  What brings <i>you</i> here, Mr. Cool-and-Casual?
2-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:0=teasing,You look like you're right at home, Mr. Lackadaisical.  You know what I like in my men?  <i>Handsomeness</i>...like yours.
2-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:0=seductive,Hey, Jacket-and-Pants.  You look a little sleepy, but I can't deny how you're making my heart beat faster.  What's your story?
2-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:0=seductive,I can't take my eyes off you, handsome, even if <i>yours</i> seem a little sleepy.  Mind telling me about yourself?
2-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0=seductive,Well, what do we have here?  An adorable little cinnamon roll of a man, dressed up as an angel!
2-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0=seductive,You are just the cutest little man I've ever seen!  Hibiki's a little smaller, but he's got too much spunk to be cute.
2-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0=excited,Ohhh, you're so <i>cute</i>, Mr. Angel!  I could just <i>eat you up</i>!
2-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0=teasing,What's an adorable little man like you doing here, Pit?  Sure you want to strip nude in front of these scary, hulking women?
2-male_must_strip,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:0=confused,So "gay" is the Earth word for how Tarakkians live?  Actually, I'm not sure they even form couples there...
2-male_must_strip,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:0=smug,A man loving other men?  Well, if women can do it, I suppose men can...not that I really picture men capable of love.
2-male_must_strip,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:0=interested,Is this what man-on-man love does to your appearance?  Because you're a scary-looking customer.
2-male_must_strip,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:0=confused,You know, they taught me as a girl that men were monsters...you fit the part.  And apparently you don't like women, is that right?
2-male_must_strip,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:0=interested,If "gay" means what I think it does, I guess teasing you isn't going to get me anywhere...not that I <i>want</i> to see you naked.
2-female_human_must_strip=vain,Expect more losses, ~player~.  We Mejarians are clever women.
2-female_human_must_strip=teasing,There's more where that came from.  I've handled Mejarian soldiers, you know.
2-female_human_must_strip=vain,Don't get nervous, ~player~.  I know, I'm tall, beautiful, and intelligent.
2-female_human_must_strip=stretching,Oh, good.  Fashion tips <i>and</i> more time to think about how many pieces my outfit is.
2-female_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=seductive,Did I ever tell you how sweet I've found Earthlings to be?  Going and losing for me when I had such a bad hand...
2-female_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=vain,Hah!  And I had a <i>high card</i>.  Dealer, you're just messing with me.
2-female_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=confused,Yeah, yeah, I'll get started--wait, I didn't lose?  I had a <i>high card</i>!
2-female_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=confused,Damn it, I--wait, how did someone have <i>worse</i> than me?  Oh, <i>wow</i>.
2-female_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=interested,...I'm just not sure what to make of you anymore, Dealer.  You give me trash, and the rest of them <i>burning</i> trash.
2-female_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=teasing,I live in artificial gravity...so I can understand your situation, so to speak.
2-female_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=teasing,Put your back into it, ~player~.  What self-respecting woman is no good at cards?
2-female_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=interested,Come on, don't they have cards on Earth?  It's Gascogne's favorite way to get to know you.
2-female_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=laughing,What's wrong?  Have you realized how many trinkets I have and are just throwing in the towel?
2-female_human_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:human,marker:human=teasing,I come from a world of all women, so you're nothing special to me.  But you <i>are</i> very cute, so I've got my eye on you, Missy.
2-female_human_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:human,marker:human=seductive,And who's <i>this</i> tight-lipped specimen?  "~player~"?  If you say so...<i>cutie</i>.
2-female_human_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:human,marker:human=seductive,Yet another woman?  Like a drop in the bucket for a Mejarian...but even still, you're <i>far</i> cuter than I expected for an Earth girl.
2-female_human_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:human,marker:human=seductive,You're a little more simply-dressed than the exotic types that seem to frequent this place, myself included.  But you sure have a cute face!
2-female_human_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:human,marker:human=vain,And who are <i>you</i>,~player~?  You've barely said a thing...but you can admire my beauty too, if you want!
2-female_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=seductive,More runs like that, and you'd have a spot on our pilot team.  Meia's always scouting out recruits, you know.
2-female_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=smug,You've got the ferocity of Mejarian soldiers.  Too bad I know how to handle them.
2-female_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=teasing,Hey, keep it up.  And if you see her, Meia <i>loves</i> women that can put up a fight.
2-female_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=interested,Don't give out on us now, dear!  I was starting to come around on Earth women.
2-female_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99,alsoPlaying:meia=seductive,More runs like that, and you'd have a spot on our pilot team.  You're always scouting for new recruits, right, Meia?
2-female_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,You've got the ferocity of Mejarian soldiers.  Too bad I know how to handle them.
2-female_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Hey, keep it up.  Meia <i>loves</i> women that can put up a fight.
2-female_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99,alsoPlaying:meia=interested,Don't give out on us now, dear!  I was starting to come around on Earth women.
2-female_must_strip=vain,Expect more losses, ~name~.  We Mejarians are clever women.
2-female_must_strip=teasing,There's more where that came from.  I've handled Mejarian soldiers, you know.
2-female_must_strip=vain,Don't get nervous, ~name~.  I know, I'm tall, beautiful, and intelligent.
2-female_must_strip=stretching,Oh, good.  Fashion tips <i>and</i> more time to think about how many pieces my outfit is.
2-female_must_strip,target:zoey,targetStage:0=smug,These "zombies" of yours don't sound so bad...but then, I guess you don't have a fabulous fighter spaceship, do you?
2-female_must_strip,target:zoey,targetStage:0=stretching,See, my Vandread can shield a whole planet.  So I think we could quarantine your little zombie virus.
2-female_must_strip,target:zoey,targetStage:0=vain,A zombie virus, eh?  Not to brag, but my Vandread helped avoid the spread of disease on a planet once...<i>I'm so talented</i>.
2-female_must_strip,target:zoey,targetStage:0=laughing,The more you describe these "zombies," the more they just sound like men.  You sure that's not what you mean?
2-female_must_strip,target:calisto,targetStage:0=interested,What's up, Miss Pantsuit?  You sure laugh a lot for someone dressed so prim-and-proper.
2-female_must_strip,target:calisto,targetStage:0=laughing,You some kind of businesswoman, Miss Yuck-it-up?  How could such an esteemed professional be so <i>depraved</i> as to play this?
2-female_must_strip,target:calisto,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey there, Chuckles!  You look more conservative than I've ever <i>dreamed</i> of being...and yet here you are, stripping with me.
2-female_must_strip,target:calisto,targetStage:0=teasing,Something funny, Miss Formalwear?  Make sure this nasty pirate doesn't put a ransom on your very professional head.
2-female_must_strip,target:shego,targetStage:0=laughing,You OK there, Miss Jumpsuit?  You're looking a little green-around-the-frills.
2-female_must_strip,target:shego,targetStage:0=interested,Is all the stripping and teasing making you nauseous, dearie?  Just trying to grin and bear it?
2-female_must_strip,target:shego,targetStage:0=teasing,I'm liking the style on the bodysuit, honey--it helps obscure your sickly green hue.
2-female_must_strip,target:shego,targetStage:0=smug,Mejarians have some say in their skin tone from genetic engineering...I don't think we can do green, but then I doubt it'd be too popular.
2-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:0=awkward,Uh...you want to calm down there, sweetheart?  Maybe put that men's gun down?  Take a nap?
2-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:0=bored,Jeez, we knew you meant business by the gun.  No need to shout...must be men's influence.
2-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:0=frustrated,Can you pipe down?  Way to confirm the image of Earth girls as nasty little gun-toting balls of violence.
2-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:0=shocked,Uh...why are you carrying that giant men's gun?  I'd show it to Barnette, but you, uh, don't seem too friendly.
2-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:0=bored,That's a huge gun, Miss Moxie...men's mechanical weapons are so noisy and inefficient.  Don't tell Barnette I said that.
2-female_must_strip,target:peach,targetStage:0=vain,I've never been a fan of royalty, but a <i>blonde</i> woman in charge?  Suddenly it doesn't seem so bad.
2-female_must_strip,target:peach,targetStage:0=smug,At least you've got the hair color to match your presumptuous title, Miss Princess.  This pirate still might rob you later.
2-female_must_strip,target:peach,targetStage:0=vain,You damn princesses and your unearned jewelry and dresses.  I stole everything I have, you know!  But at least you're blonde.
2-female_must_strip,target:peach,targetStage:0=teasing,So from one blonde to another, Miss Princess, how much is that crown worth?  ...<i>Just a pirate's curiosity</i>.
2-female_must_strip,target:chara,targetStage:0=bored,<i>Yeesh</i>.  Being as beautiful as I am, I try to let other girls down easy, but...you're hard to look at.
2-female_must_strip,target:chara,targetStage:0=angry,...<i>Ew</i>.  I really can't tell where your face begins and your body ends.
2-female_must_strip,target:chara,targetStage:0=smug,...It's times like these that I <i>really</i> appreciate how fortunate I am to be born this beautiful.  Take a look at the alternative.
2-female_must_strip,target:chara,targetStage:0=annoyed,As if you weren't ugly enough, you've got this horrible look in your eyes.  What's your problem?
2-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:7=smug,...Yeah, we all know how <i>this</i> is ending, don't we?
2-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:7=smug,Some women just refuse to see what's right in front of them.  It's sad, really.
2-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:7=laughing,Well, get ready for full-blown blue nudity, everyone.
2-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:7=smug,All the magic in the universe, and not one ounce of sense.  You poor thing.
2-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=interested,...So it's <i>piloting</i> that really gets you going, Leader.  <i>You hopeless intellectual, you</i>.
2-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,I <i>knew</i> you were a robot.  The only thing that makes you lighten up is another woman's skills.
2-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=stretching,I guess I'm just shallower than you are, boss.  There you go, seeking out girlfriends on things <i>beyond</i> looks.
2-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=stretching,Oh, thank God, you're flirting.  For a second there I was worried you really <i>were</i> sexless.
2-female_must_strip,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0=laughing,Judging by that sword, you're not from Earth either, Miss Crystal.  Where can I get one of those?
2-female_must_strip,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0=smug,Don't ask me why that thing is <i>drawn</i>, but damn if it isn't more impressive than my silly little rapier.  Got any extras?
2-female_must_strip,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, I like the look of that glowing sword!  Even <i>Mejare</i> hasn't though to put its lasers in blades yet.
2-female_must_strip,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0=smug,I could do for an upgrade on this rapier--would you please refer me to the planet where they make those glowing swords?
2-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:0=interested,What's up, Ocean Girl?  You seem awfully eager.  Does being around men tend to hypersexualize a woman?
2-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:0=smug,Jeez, it didn't take a loss for you to start piping up about stripping.  You don't need a <i>game</i> to do that, you know.
2-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:0=interested,And here we have Miss Eager-Beaver.  You don't look like you have the assets to be all excited about stripping, sweetheart.
2-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:0=stretching,At least you're confident about nudity.  But are you seriously just losing on purpose?  <i>Earth girls</i>...
2-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, you're a cutie!  Yet surprisingly sturdy on your feet, what with all that armor.  <i>Don't bowl me right over</i>!
2-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=laughing,Hi there, darling!  You must be pretty tough to lug all that armor around.  <i>Afraid I'll stab you</i>?
2-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=seductive,What's with that armor, sweetheart?  You'd be a lot cuter without it...I know I'm a pirate, but I'd never kill someone as cute as you.
2-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=vain,Adorable hairstyle, cute face--but all that armor!  You a soldier, dear?  <i>Oh, please forgive my horrid piracy</i>!
2-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, Miss Moneybags, you'd better watch out.  This pirate's got half a mind to loot you with extreme prejudice!
2-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0=teasing,Sure you're not worried to be playing in a seedy place like this, Miss Heiress?  You might get mugged by, say, an ornery pirate.
2-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0=interested,Nice premature white hair, Miss Heirlooms.  I guess having all that inherited money must be <i>oh-so-stressful</i> for you.
2-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0=laughing,Looking quite adorable there, Coinstacks.  Maybe I'll help myself to the jewelry you'll undoubtedly remove first.
2-female_must_strip,target:pauling,targetStage:0=teasing,Nice sensible little outfit you've got there.  The glasses sell the sexy-and-smart look!
2-female_must_strip,target:pauling,targetStage:0=teasing,Working for an old woman, eh?  I know the feeling.  Those glasses must have convinced her you knew what you were doing.
2-female_must_strip,target:pauling,targetStage:0=stretching,A woman with glasses, eh?  <i>I</i> certainly couldn't pull off the look...I guess I don't look very smart.
2-female_must_strip,target:pauling,targetStage:0=smug,I know an engineering egghead with glasses--Parfet's her name.  And she seems to attract what few smart men I know.
2-female_must_strip,target:shazza,targetStage:0=smug,Quite the interesting accent you've got there.  I can't quite call it refined, but then again, I <i>am</i> a filthy pirate.
2-female_must_strip,target:shazza,targetStage:0=stretching,I guess when I lead a life of crime, I can't get away with calling you uncivilized-sounding.  Actions mean so much more!
2-female_must_strip,target:shazza,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=laughing,Interesting dialect you have on Planet Australia.  Don't you ever get tired of misunderstanding each other?
2-female_must_strip,target:shazza,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=laughing,This <i>Australia</i> planet certainly has a way with words...mostly for making them incomprehensible.
2-female_must_strip,target:ciri,targetStage:0=smug,A <i>witcher</i>, eh?  Is that Earth dialect for witch?  Because I got called a witch for possession of Duero's sex book.
2-female_must_strip,target:ciri,targetStage:0=stretching,Is it <i>witcher</i> or <i>witch</i>?  Or, shall I say, <i>which</i> is it?
2-female_must_strip,target:ciri,targetStage:0=vain,So is a "witcher" even witchier than a witch?  I've been called a witch just for wanting to see what men have got in their pants.
2-female_must_strip,target:ciri,targetStage:0=smug,Forgive me for not being impressed with the term "witcher."  How <i>could</i> I be when all it takes for that on Mejare is a libido?
2-female_must_strip,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=laughing,And I thought <i>I</i> was trying to be seductive!  Here comes Miss Succubus, decked out in her Halloween costume.
2-female_must_strip,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=smug,Don't think you're slipping that past me, honey.  We have Halloween on Mejare...and I've dressed as a succubus before, yes.
2-female_must_strip,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=interested,Nice costume, Miss Seductress.  Looks like I have competition for all my man-hunting tonight.
2-female_must_strip,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=teasing,Mejare has stories of succubi, too...they really know how to tire a woman out.  I guess you must have a lot of fun with men here.
2-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=vain,Hel-<i>looo, camera</i>!  Over here, sweetie--get whatever angle you like best.
2-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=vain,Omigosh, you brought a <i>camera</i>?  A sign from the heavens!  Now all of Earth will get to see my beautiful naked body!
2-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=teasing,Looking to get some photographs of the exotic alien woman, were you?  But now you've got a whole <i>different</i> reason to capture me.
2-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=vain,Go right ahead with that camera, dearie.  It's always been shameful how I've been in the media for piracy instead of beauty.
2-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0=interested,Talk about a big ball of misery.  Even your <i>skin</i> has turned all blue in despair.
2-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0=teasing,Show your face, honey!  Or are you trying to hide that weird blue skin?  Don't worry, it suits your miserable demeanor.
2-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0=laughing,I guess I'd be miserable, too, if I had the complexion of a grapefruit.
2-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0=stretching,I should bring Meia over here for some counseling.  Even <i>she's</i> not as miserable as Miss Blueberry here.
2-female_must_strip,target:chica,targetStage:0=confused,...You know, I was shown films as a girl about how men were horrible monsters.  You're about what they looked like in those.
2-female_must_strip,target:chica,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>Ew</i>!  <i>Eek</i>!  <i>G-get away</i>!  <i>Stop</i>!  <i>What are you</i>?
2-female_must_strip,target:chica,targetStage:0=annoyed,...I really came here to meet some Earth women.  Not...whatever <i>this</i> is supposed to be.  Besides terrifying.
2-female_must_strip,target:chica,targetStage:0=angry,...What the hell am I looking at?  I wanted some cute girls, not a--a mechanical monstrosity!
2-female_must_strip,target:chica,targetStage:0=bored,You're a <i>robot</i>?  So like, you're Pyoro if he were designed by a blind woman?
2-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:0=teasing,Ooh, an <i>assassin</i>.  I hope there's no bounty on my head!
2-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:0=stretching,Forgive this pirate for being a little on edge around an <i>assassin</i>.  There's a reward for my head, no doubt!
2-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:0=vain,You assassins always act so tough on the ground.  Let's see you take me in a dogfight!
2-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:0=teasing,You're a cute little thing, Miss Assassin.  I guess that helps in your line of work--people lower their guards.
2-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=interested,Hey, Eyebags, you gonna stay awake all game?  You look like you're drifting away already.
2-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=teasing,Talk about never leaving the house.  You look like you've never seen sunlight--and you're dozing off as we speak!
2-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=smug,Gotta be honest, sweetie--between the pale skin and the vacant look in your eyes, you're really reminding me of a zombie.
2-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=confused,So do you work super hard all day at your job?  Why do you look all gaunt and drowsy?  Get some beauty sleep, woman.
2-female_must_strip,target:marceline,targetStage:0=bored,...Is someone playing a Halloween prank on me?  Where are your eyes?  How are you floating?  <i>Earth</i>...
2-female_must_strip,target:marceline,targetStage:0=confused,Don't get me wrong, Mejare has Halloween just like Earth...but we just dress up.  That doesn't look like a costume.
2-female_must_strip,target:marceline,targetStage:0=confused,...OK, it's hard to comment on what's weird about you when there's so much to choose from.  Do I start with your floating or your eyes?
2-female_must_strip,target:marceline,targetStage:0=confused,...Is this Earth?  Did I get the right planet?  Because you like even more alien that I do, with that skin...and no eyes.
2-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0=smug,You know, I'd call Meia the strong, silent type...but she still speaks <i>occasionally</i>.
2-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0=laughing,Slow on the uptake?  The "strong, silent type" doesn't mean <i>literally</i> never speaking, you know.
2-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0=vain,Oh, don't feel bad.  I know you're speechless at the sight of me--but I'll do enough talking for both of us!
2-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0=teasing,Stunned into speechlessness?  I'm flattered, but really, honey, you can talk to me.  I won't mind.
2-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, Chell.  If I'm the most gorgeous woman you've ever met, don't say anything.
2-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=teasing,Ooh, you've got quite the set of muscles on you.  Shame Meia's not here.  She'd totally melt right in front of you!
2-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=seductive,Check out those legs, hot stuff!  You look like you could lift up the whole table with those things alone--good thing Meia's not here to fawn over you.
2-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=seductive,Omigosh, you should meet Meia, my boss--she's really icy, but women with muscles totally get her going.  And she'd try not to show it!
2-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, Miss Muscles, you into women?  Because my squadron leader Meia is all about exercise, and she <i>desperately</i> needs a girlfriend.
2-female_must_strip,target:blake_v4,targetStage:0=laughing,Way to go and expose your entire midriff there, Blake.  Who do you think you are, Dita?  <i>Me</i>?
2-female_must_strip,target:blake_v4,targetStage:0=interested,Nice vest you're rocking there, honey.  But you forgot to cover up your midsection...like me.
2-female_must_strip,target:blake_v4,targetStage:0=smug,Taking a few fashion tips from <i>me</i>, are you, Blake?  What with that midriff fully on display and all.
2-female_must_strip,target:blake_v4,targetStage:0=teasing,Well, aren't <i>you</i> looking more exposed than usual?  But as far as exposure goes, the midsection's a good choice.
2-female_must_strip,target:black_canary,targetStage:0=teasing,Oho--a fellow blonde!  Good to see them running around on Earth--we've got to stick together!
2-female_must_strip,target:black_canary,targetStage:0=seductive,Hey there, cutie!  Always good to see more lovely blonde women running around.  Got to keep each other safe from those jealous brunettes.
2-female_must_strip,target:black_canary,targetStage:0=vain,Ooh, is blonde your natural color?  It's not as exotic as some of Mejare's other hair colors, but it's certainly appealing to be wrapped in gold.
2-female_must_strip,target:black_canary,targetStage:0=vain,What, was "Blonde Canary" taken?  Because <i>that's</i> what I would advertise, if I were you.
2-female_must_strip,target:blake,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, the black-and-white look is a classic!  Very striking and confident with that contrast.  And such a cute little bow!
2-female_must_strip,target:blake,targetStage:0=teasing,Maybe it's just me, but you've got a Mejarian sense of style!  Clashing colors, nice and sexy and revealing!  A woman after my own heart.
2-female_must_strip,target:blake,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, that's a cute outfit, Blake!  I love this dress, but I don't have anything quite as fancy as all that clashing-colors business.
2-female_must_strip,target:blake,targetStage:0=teasing,<i>Mmm</i>...the lace, the contrast, the <i>heels</i>!  I like your style, Blake!  Not bad for an Earth girl.
2-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0=laughing,Hey there, short stuff.  I think you might actually be shorter than Hibiki, which is a challenge even for women.
2-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0=laughing,You said you fight "Titans"?  I imagine that's everyone, considering your stature.
2-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0=laughing,"Titans," huh?  You mean like me next to you?  Or anyone, really?
2-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0=interested,How's the weather down there, at the very bottom of Earth?  You really need to drink your milk, honey.
2-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0,marker:fama_and_oma=vain,...See, <i>this</i> is why I'm going to be the Fama for Barnette.  I don't want our daughters growing up all short from lack of milk.
2-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=seductive,Is that so?  Well, Ami, you've <i>got</i> to let me know how to become an Earth model.  I'm a bit of an outlaw on Mejare, after all.
2-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Thanks for the tip, Meia.  Leave it to you to gather a little intel on our friends here...how's life as an Earth model, honey?
2-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,Ooh, she's a <i>model</i>?  <i>Now</i> I'm curious...that was always my dream job, after all.
2-female_must_strip,target:annie,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey there, Plain-Jane.  What's brought you here, with all your layers?  Looking to overcome some shyness?
2-female_must_strip,target:annie,targetStage:0=smug,Exhibit A of Earth girls' ridiculous conservatism.  Can't you appreciate your own body instead of hiding it?  Must be men doing this to you.
2-female_must_strip,target:annie,targetStage:0=laughing,What's up, cutie?  You seem to be making every effort to hide that cuteness, actually.  Just look at those packed-on layers.
2-female_must_strip,target:annie,targetStage:0=vain,I guess I'd be a little shyer about my body if I had your height and plain looks, but come on.  Confidence makes <i>any</i> woman look better!
2-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0=vain,How's a young little thing like you a model if you're still in school?  <i>I've</i> got modeling potential, but it's hard for pirates to land a job.
2-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0=smug,A student <i>and</i> a model?  And here I am, with all my beauty, and still a lowly criminal.  At least I have my wonderful piloting skills.
2-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0=vain,<i>If only my circumstances let me be the beautiful model I've always dreamed of being</i>!  Guess I'll have to settle for death-defying pirate.
2-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0=teasing,You're a lucky one, Earth-girl.  I never had the benefit of much schooling, nor the opportunity to be a model.  So cherish what you've got!
2-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:5=smug,Call it woman's intuition, but I think our little fashion show is about to come to an end soon...
2-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:5=interested,This has been fun, Vriska, but I don't think you can keep this up forever.  That die's got a sick sense of humor.
2-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:5=interested,Can't you see the writing on the wall, sweetheart?  I like these outfits, but they keep getting skimpier and skimpier.
2-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:5=laughing,Roll all you want...I think the die's in control here.  And it wants to see some blue skin.
2-female_must_strip,target:arwen,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=confused,Hey, what's all this about the <i>middle</i> of Earth?  Is there a spot underground that only you elf-people get to live in?
2-female_must_strip,target:arwen,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=confused,And I call <i>you</i> pale, Meia.  Arwen here looks almost ghostly...is that just the way elves are?
2-female_must_strip,target:arwen,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=confused,Hey, what's up with those pointy ears?  And that pallid skin?  You're a strange one, "elf" girl.
2-female_must_strip,target:arwen,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=confused,So you call yourself an elf, right?  Is that another word for "Earthling with crazy ears"?  Because you look human otherwise.
2-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=vain,Omigosh, are you <i>filming</i> this?  Look this way--over here!  Get every angle you can!
2-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=vain,You're <i>broadcasting</i> this?  To a <i>live audience</i>?  This is a dream come true--now <i>all of Earth</i> will witness my beauty!
2-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=vain,Omigosh!  <i>Omigosh</i>!  You're <i>broadcasting</i> this to people all around Earth?  Maybe I'll finally become a model!
2-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=seductive,You're <i>filming</i> this?  Omigosh--normally I have to get Barnette to capture my beauty on camera!  You're so sweet!
2-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=vain,I hope you don't think that camera is going to scare me away.  I may be a wanted criminal, but I'm also <i>beautiful</i>!
2-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=vain,You picked a good table to film, honey.  The only thing that loves me more than Barnette is a camera!
2-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0=vain,Ooh, you're into art?  Do you think you could paint a portrait of me?  Maybe frame it in your collection to capture my eternal beauty?
2-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0=teasing,Ooh, so you're an <i>artist</i>?  I know a particularly handsome man that can paint, too...think you could capture me better?
2-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0=vain,Did you say you go to school with men?  I was never that big on school--except for art, where we could finally appreciate <i>beauty</i>!
2-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0=vain,Students tend to be such bores--like that egghead Parfet.  But an <i>art</i> student?  Now we're talking--my whole body is art!
2-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=stretching,Ooh, I know a girl named Misty!  She's this cute little thing from Pluto--barely has any breasts at all!  Must be cold there.
2-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=smug,Why, the Nirvana has a young girl named Misty aboard!  Being from Pluto, she knew her way around men better than any of us.
2-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=seductive,You're not the first Misty I've come to know, actually.  A teenie-weenie Plutonian girl we have is called the same thing!
2-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=stretching,I don't think they have your <i>poker</i>-mon things on Pluto...but they do have girls named Misty.
2-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:4=excited,Forget the common language, Marinette, your "French" sounds like the most <i>romantic</i> thing!  You've <i>got</i> to say some more.
2-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:4=excited,<i>Oooh, Marinette</i>!  Can you say some more "French"?  My heart beats faster every time your tongue slips!
2-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:4=seductive,You should say some more French, Marinette!  It's got the <i>silkiest</i> sound to it--it makes my heart go wild!
2-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:4=seductive,Oooh, Marinette, since it's your turn, can you throw out some more of this "French"?  It sounds like a <i>lover's</i> language.
2-female_must_strip,target:amy_rose,targetStage:0=confused,You're, uh, looking a little pink there.  And what's up with those ears?
2-female_must_strip,target:amy_rose,targetStage:0=confused,I know I joke about Earth girls being aliens, but, uh, you really do look kind of weird.  What's with all the...<i>fur</i>?
2-female_must_strip,target:amy_rose,targetStage:0=confused,Wait, did they say you're a...a <i>hedgehog</i> or something?  Is that some kind of animal?  That would explain the, uh, pink...and ears.
2-female_must_strip,target:amy_rose,targetStage:0=confused,...I really can't make heads or tails of you.  You kind of <i>look</i> like you should have a tail, what with that fur and all.
2-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:6=bored,The storm is almost over...or maybe this is just the calm before it.
2-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:6=bored,I think I'd prefer the <i>Harvest's</i> company at this point.
2-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:6=bored,Oh, you're still here.  Why not just strip more than one thing at a time?  Well, too late.
2-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:6=bored,I still don't know who made you wait this long to show what you wanted.
2-female_must_strip,target:pyrrha,targetStage:0=laughing,Hey there, Miss Mind-Your-Manners.  You talk the talk, but that cleavage tells me you've got a wild side.
2-female_must_strip,target:pyrrha,targetStage:0=teasing,You're awfully polite for a woman perverted enough to come here in the first place.  Just trying to throw us off, cutie?
2-female_must_strip,target:pyrrha,targetStage:0=stretching,Yeah, yeah, I don't buy the whole polite-and-formal act from a girl willing to strip nude in public.  Just waiting for the good stuff?
2-female_must_strip,target:pyrrha,targetStage:0=interested,You talk pretty prim-and-proper, dear...and yet here you are, stripping nude for us.  Do you have a dirty side, or did you lose a bet?
2-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, girlie, someone told me you're a model on Earth...is that true?  I'd like to get in on that...
2-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0=teasing,You're pretty cute, honey, but I hear people like legs on their models...better hope <i>I</i> don't hit the scene.
2-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0=vain,Hey now, sweetheart.  You're cute, but there's no need to brag about being a model...not when a <i>Mejarian's</i> on the scene.
2-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0=teasing,Don't be so full of yourself, Miss Model...I'd be a model, too, if not for Mejare's pesky little corrupt government.
2-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=stretching,See, Meia, I think you do the "strong, silent type" thing pretty well.  Chell here is an example of taking it too far.
2-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,Slow on the uptake?  The "strong, silent type" doesn't mean <i>literally</i> never speaking, you know.
2-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,Oh, don't feel bad.  I know you're speechless at the sight of me--but I'll do enough talking for both of us!
2-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Stunned into speechlessness?  I'm flattered, but really, honey, you can talk to me.  I won't mind.
2-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Hey, Chell.  If I'm the most gorgeous woman you've ever met, don't say anything.
2-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:0=confused,...You OK, honey?  You look a little...<i>dead</i>.
2-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:0=shocked,...OK.  So.  You're a ghost.  I can work with this...<i>but please put down the knife</i>.
2-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:0=bored,Guess there's no stabbing <i>you</i> if things get hairy, is there?  ...Not that I was planning on doing that to anyone else.
2-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:0=laughing,A...ghost.  OK.  Well, at least this means I can still annoy Meia if I get shot down and killed.
2-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:0=awkward,...Well, I <i>do</i> appreciate learning that there's an afterlife, but it's not why I came to Earth.
2-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, an armed woman--and one with chocolate flavoring!  You're like an extreme version of my tan little gun-nut girlfriend.
2-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0=vain,I'm not sure what's most intimidating--that height, that imposing dark complexion, or that huge mechanical firearm!
2-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0=stretching,If only I brought my cute little Barnette here.  She'd be head-over-heels for a woman with a man's gun!
2-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0=teasing,You might be even taller than me, Miss Nighttime.  That might turn even more heads on Mejare than your rather large firearm!
2-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0=smug,Come now, honey.  You can't waltz in waving that huge kinetic weapon around and expect to make any friends.
2-female_must_strip,target:april,targetStage:0=vain,Ooh, do you really report the news?  Be sure to get my good side--oh wait, that's <i>every</i> side!
2-female_must_strip,target:april,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey there, Jumpsuit.  Someone said you're a reporter--but <i>this</i> pirate doesn't mind a little publicity!
2-female_must_strip,target:april,targetStage:0=smug,I've been in the media for much worse than a few glory shots, so don't think I'm afraid of that camera, newsgirl.
2-female_must_strip,target:april,targetStage:0=vain,Hey, newsie, I've got all the story you need right here.  Your Earth viewers have never seen a body like mine!
2-female_must_strip,target:arwen,targetStage:0=confused,Hey, what's all this about the <i>middle</i> of Earth?  Is there a spot underground that only you elf-people get to live in?
2-female_must_strip,target:arwen,targetStage:0=confused,And I call <i>Meia</i> pale.  You look almost ghostly...is that just the way you elves are?
2-female_must_strip,target:arwen,targetStage:0=confused,Hey, what's up with those pointy ears?  And the pale, Meia-like skin?  You're a strange one, "elf" girl.
2-female_must_strip,target:arwen,targetStage:0=confused,So you call yourself an elf, right?  Is that another word for "Earthling with crazy ears"?  Because you look human otherwise.
2-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=smug,<i>Well, well, well</i>.  We've got a <i>goddess</i> here, ladies...besides me, of course.
2-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=vain,A <i>goddess</i>, eh?  I guess that makes <i>two</i> at this table, then.
2-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=teasing,Just look at that shimmering green hair--and that ornamentation!  But I think I'm every bit the goddess you are, hot stuff.
2-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=laughing,Just look at that--two goddesses, near-opposite color schemes.  I guess I'm the <i>evil, nasty</i> one.
2-female_must_strip,target:blackrose,targetStage:0=confused,I was gonna say something about that cool dark skin, but apparently...you're just some sort of image?  What's <i>that</i> about?
2-female_must_strip,target:blackrose,targetStage:0=frustrated,You're..."virtual"?  Listen, honey, you can't just assume we know what these things mean.  Piloting's a busy life, you know!
2-female_must_strip,target:blackrose,targetStage:0=bored,Wait, so you're not really here, and you're some kind of "virtual" avatar?  Earth has really gotten advanced from all the technology they keep stealing.
2-female_must_strip,target:blackrose,targetStage:0=annoyed,Hey, if we can just use computers to <i>project</i> ourselves here, why didn't anyone tell me?  I had to <i>fly</i> all the way here!
2-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=smug,Where'd you say you were from?  Planet <i>Korea</i>?  Well then, it seems Korea and Mejare share a fashion sense...
2-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=teasing,You're a cutie, Miss Bodysuit, if a little on the short side.  Is that just how they make women over on Planet Korea?
2-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0=vain,If only Meia were here.  She dresses just like you do, D.Va...we should find out who wears it better!
2-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0=seductive,You're an adorable little thing, D.Va!  All wrapped up in that cute bodysuit, just like a certain <i>other</i> pilot I know.
2-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=seductive,Hey there, Miss Star-Student!  That's a school uniform, right?  What do they teach you on Earth?
2-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=teasing,Check out the uniformed student type!  I was never good in school--but what is it they teach you on Earth, huh?
2-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=vain,Mejare's schools are nothing but <i>men this, violence that</i>, with a little math.  How does your fancy Earth education compare?
2-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=vain,A student, huh?  Do they teach you anything interesting on Earth?  I was never a brainiac, but I still rose to be a pilot!
2-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, an Earth girl still in school!  Have they taught you anything about men?  What do they teach you in general?
2-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:0=seductive,Hi there, dearie!  That's an absolutely <i>adorable</i> hat you have on--do you have any others that match that uniform?
2-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:0=seductive,Ohh, tiny little things like you always make my heart melt!  Is the schoolgirl look a style where you live?
2-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:0=stretching,A student's uniform is always the most adorable thing.  As you might imagine from my piracy, I wasn't the best student.
2-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:0=vain,School was always so dreadfully boring, the way they prattled on about men.  But you make the outfit look pretty cute, Miss Magician!
2-female_must_strip,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=laughing,Normally I'd say rock the skin color you have, but <i>wow</i>.  Pink is <i>not</i> an attractive color...not <i>that</i> pink.
2-female_must_strip,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=stretching,And here I thought <i>Mejarians</i> were the ones with the exotic body colors.  Earth girls are breaking out the bright pink skin!
2-female_must_strip,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=confused,Why's your skin all gross-looking and pink?  Like, <i.really</i> pink.  It's distracting...so is that eyepatch, too.
2-female_must_strip,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=smug,Not to be outdone, Earth starts showing this Mejarian just how bizarre its colors can truly get.  Next on the agenda: <i>pink skin</i>.
2-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0=seductive,Well, hi there, Miss Accent!  That is just the <i>cutest</i> polka-dot bodysuit you have on!
2-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0=seductive,Omigosh, your funny accent is so <i>cute</i>!  It matches your goofy polka-dotted suit.
2-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0=laughing,Well, aren't <i>you</i> the most adorable thing!  All dolled up in polka dots, stumbling over your words!  I could just <i>gobble you up</i>!
2-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0=seductive,That's a pretty darling suit, sweetie, with all the polka dots.  And the way you trip over your words just makes me <i>melt</i>!
2-female_must_strip,target:ayano,targetStage:0=confused,...You OK there, schoolgirl?  You look a little on edge...especially when you look <i>my</i> way.
2-female_must_strip,target:ayano,targetStage:0=teasing,Looking a little bug-eyed there, honey.  Too much coffee this morning?
2-female_must_strip,target:ayano,targetStage:0=confused,Uh, you OK, Ayano?  Your eyes are all shifty, like somebody's watching you.
2-female_must_strip,target:ayano,targetStage:0=annoyed,...Could you settle down there, girlie?  You're giving me the stink-eye like I killed someone.  It's creeping me out.
2-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=seductive,Blonde, scantily-clad, loves attention?  Honey, you're a woman after my own heart.
2-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=teasing,I like the energy you're bringing, Miss Wrestler!  The scant layering doesn't hurt, either.
2-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=vain,See, <i>you're</i> my kind of woman!  These other Earth girls are so dreadfully boring, always covering up the good stuff.
2-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=teasing,Barely wearing anything? You should know my girlfriend is the same way, cutie...only <i>she's</i> not blonde.
2-female_must_strip,target:athena,targetStage:0=interested,I really thought I'd be the most lightly-dressed woman here, but there you go showing me up on <i>that</i> front.
2-female_must_strip,target:athena,targetStage:0=smug,Way to dispel my stereotypes of Earth girls being overdressed.  You wear even less than I do.
2-female_must_strip,target:athena,targetStage:0=interested,Hey, I understand wanting to show a little skin, but you can't walk around in a <i>bikini</i> all day.  Even Barnette doesn't go that far.
2-female_must_strip,target:athena,targetStage:0=stretching,Even my darling little Barnette covers herself up better than <i>you</i> do...and she's got a reputation for dressing flimsily.
2-female_must_strip,target:sonya,targetStage:0=teasing,I can appreciate military women--they're always so very <i>fit</i>.  Try not to wring my neck for my horrible pirate crimes.
2-female_must_strip,target:sonya,targetStage:0=vain,<i>Please don't hurt me, O fearsome woman soldier.  I have a girlfriend waiting for me back home</i>!
2-female_must_strip,target:sonya,targetStage:0=vain,Looking pretty muscular, Miss Militia.  Please try to see this beautiful pirate's point of view before sticking your knee in her back.
2-female_must_strip,target:sonya,targetStage:0=teasing,I imagine you're not too fond of my line of work, Miss Militia.  It's OK--<i>I'm pretty fond of that short blonde hair</i>.
2-female_must_strip,target:asuna,targetStage:0=frustrated,What'd you say you lived in?  An M-M-O--ripgah?  I can't keep track of all that.
2-female_must_strip,target:asuna,targetStage:0=confused,Did you say you lived in a computer or something like that?  Sounds like Heaven to Parfet, with how much she tinkers with machines.
2-female_must_strip,target:asuna,targetStage:0=confused,So what's it like inside a computer?  Do you have to wear a rubber suit to avoid getting electrocuted?
2-female_must_strip,target:asuna,targetStage:0=confused,You live inside a game, right?  And now you're <i>playing</i> a game?  Is this whole place a game I've stepped inside?
2-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:6=interested,I appreciated the fashion show, Vriska, but really, I doubt you've got fuel left in the tank.
2-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:6=stretching,Just going to keep on trying, huh?  Give it up already.
2-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:6=stretching,Poor girl just can't control her gambling problem.  Now she'll be nude for it.
2-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:6=interested,And is this magically going to restock your wardrobe?  I doubt it.
2-female_must_strip,target:zizou_valentine,targetStage:0=interested,Don't you have a magic spell to give yourself some clothes, little Miss Magician?
2-female_must_strip,target:zizou_valentine,targetStage:0=interested,I must say, Zizou, I like your standard outfit better.  This is just trying too hard to make men like you.
2-female_must_strip,target:zizou_valentine,targetStage:0=laughing,Ohh, Barnette wears just as little when she cooks for me!  It's so cute...but then, <i>she</i> has breasts.
2-female_must_strip,target:zizou_valentine,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, Miss Magician...<i>don't wear clothes you can't fill</i>.  But definitely wear clothes in general.
2-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=smug,Jeez, what a head case.  Good thing she's got her girlfriend here to keep her in check.
2-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=interested,Running, running, running.  We're not trying to kill you here, you know.
2-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=teasing,Time for take two, everyone.  Better than the first, perhaps?
2-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=seductive,And <i>there she goes</i>.  Poor little thing, beaten down by the world.
2-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:3=confused,Hey, what were those noises you made before?  Didn't sound like the common language...
2-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:3=confused,...What's the name of that language you keep slipping into, anyway?  Some sort of Earth code-talk?  I only speak the common one...
2-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:3=vain,Bilingualism is so impressive, Marinette!  I only speak the common language...I don't even know Mejarians' codespeak.
2-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:3=seductive,So you speak the common language, but also this other one?  What's it called?  Because it sounds so <i>cute</i>!
2-female_must_strip,target:daisy,targetStage:0=smug,Ohoho.  Miss Boring-old-Brunette puts on a fancy store-bought dress and suddenly thinks she's better than the rest of us.
2-female_must_strip,target:daisy,targetStage:0=interested,So, "Princesses" are like rulers, right?  So what makes <i>you</i> so special, girlie?
2-female_must_strip,target:daisy,targetStage:0=annoyed,I've never subscribed to the idea of royalty.  What, some plain-jane with a chip on her shoulder just <i>decides</i> she's better than me?
2-female_must_strip,target:daisy,targetStage:0=vain,So what if I had to steal my dress?  I'm still more beautiful than Miss Too-Big-for-her-Brooches here, with her servants and fancy title.
2-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0=excited,Omigosh!  <i>Omigosh</i>!  You are just the <i>cutest</i> little thing, Nagisa!  You're practically a little girl--who forced you to be here?
2-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0=seductive,<i>Ohhhh</i>, you're the most adorable little cinnamon roll of a girl, Nagisa!  Who rolled you in sugar before forcing you to come here?
2-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0=seductive,<i>You're such a sweet little thing, Nagisa</i>!  My heart melts every time you stammer.  Did you lose a bet to be here?
2-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0=seductive,How'd this sugary-sweet cutie in a school uniform end up in this seedy place?  I just want to <i>squeeze</i> you, not strip you!
2-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0=seductive,And I thought Earth girls were cold-blooded organ harvesters.  You couldn't harvest a <i>plant</i>, cutie!  How'd you get here?
2-female_must_strip,target:daphne,targetStage:0=smug,Oh good, a fellow blonde...and tall, too.  Wasn't sure Earth girls could fit either category.
2-female_must_strip,target:daphne,targetStage:0=vain,You're not a bad looker yourself, honey.  Must be our wonderful blonde genetics that inform the rest of our bodies!
2-female_must_strip,target:daphne,targetStage:0=vain,You solve mysteries, is that right?  Well...there's no mystery about how wonderful it is to be blonde.
2-female_must_strip,target:daphne,targetStage:0=stretching,<i>Ho-hum</i>.  Another blonde in a dress...I'm just kidding, you're still cute.
2-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:3=confused,This is so freaky to me, and I've dealt with the Paksis's weird energy.  Do you just swtich all the time?
2-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:3=confused,Are you really bouncing back and forth like this all the time?  Like, do you have any friends?
2-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:3=confused,Must be hard getting to know anyone when you keep losing your memory.  How do you deal with always switching?
2-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:3=confused,I can't believe you have split personalities.  Where does the other one go?  How do you make friends?
2-female_must_strip,target:neo,targetStage:0=laughing,My, you Earth girls have so much on your minds!  And it's apparently content to stay there.
2-female_must_strip,target:neo,targetStage:0=interested,So, Miss Motormouth, how's life?  Or the weather?  Or your family?  Or <i>anything</i>?
2-female_must_strip,target:neo,targetStage:0=teasing,I guess you're too tiny to fit a voice box in the model.  Don't feel bad--you're quite expressive, dear.
2-female_must_strip,target:neo,targetStage:0=vain,I guess I'm doing enough talking for the both of us.  And hey--that adorable two-toned hair is a statement unto itself!
2-female_must_strip,target:jubilee,targetStage:0=vain,Well, aren't <i>you</i> a little fireball, Miss Mutant?  You look pretty human to me, and this is a girl who thought <i>men</i> were aliens.
2-female_must_strip,target:jubilee,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, honey, <i>men</i> are mutant people, as far as I'm concerned.  And they're still cute, so don't be so hard on yourself.
2-female_must_strip,target:jubilee,targetStage:0=smug,How many people have to tell you you're ugly for you to introduce yourself as a <i>mutant</i>?  You poor, rundown thing.
2-female_must_strip,target:jubilee,targetStage:0=stretching,You look pretty mundane for a <i>mutant</i>, darling.  Although you've certainly got an inhuman fire in you.
2-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:0=laughing,<i>Boo</i>!  <i>The nasty pirate woman's going to kill you</i>!
2-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:0=laughing,You're a cute little thing, Saki!  So plain and innocent...perfect for a pirate like me to <i>kidnap</i>!
2-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:0=laughing,Seeing a cute little Earth girl all clammed up like this really makes me want to comfort her...<i>with my rapier</i>!
2-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:0=laughing,Hey, Miss Schoolgirl.  Ever met an <i>alien</i> before?  You should know...<i>we eat Earthlings' brains</i>!
2-female_must_strip,target:joey,targetStage:0=confused,What's with all the makeup?  Someone said you're a...<i>clown</i>, whatever that means?
2-female_must_strip,target:joey,targetStage:0=confused,...So does <i>clown</i> mean "makeup advertiser"?  Because you're modeling too many products at once.
2-female_must_strip,target:joey,targetStage:0=laughing,...Earth makeup is something else.  Apparently there's whole classes of women called <i>clowns</i> who just cake it on!
2-female_must_strip,target:joey,targetStage:0=confused,So if I wore as much makeup as you do, would that make me a "clown"?  Where's the lower limit?  This is all new to me.
2-female_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=teasing,I live in artificial gravity...so I can understand your situation, so to speak.
2-female_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=teasing,Put your back into it, ~name~.  What self-respecting woman is no good at cards?
2-female_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=interested,Come on, don't they have cards on Earth?  It's Gascogne's favorite way to get to know you.
2-female_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=laughing,What's wrong?  Have you realized how many trinkets I have and are just throwing in the towel?
2-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0=laughing,What's up, sourpuss?  You look even more miserable than a certain squadron leader I know.
2-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0=smug,Hey, lighten up, girlie.  I didn't come all the way to Earth to find what I could get from Meia's strategy lectures.
2-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0=stretching,<i>Yawn</i>...are you really going to be a miserable bore this whole time?  Would having <i>my</i> breasts make you feel better?
2-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0=smug,Looks like it's Little Miss Sunshine's turn to strip.  Good thing Meia's not here, or this table would just freeze over.
2-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:3=bored,Is there a doctor in the building?  One specializing in mental health?
2-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:3=frustrated,...This isn't funny anymore.  Now I'm just worried about you.
2-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:3=frustrated,...This is getting old.  <i>I'm</i> getting old listening to this.
2-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:3=annoyed,What a surprise.  Intentionally throwing the game tends to make you lose.
2-female_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99,alsoPlaying:meia=seductive,More runs like that, and you'd have a spot on our pilot team.  You're always scouting for new recruits, right, Meia?
2-female_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,You've got the ferocity of Mejarian soldiers.  Too bad I know how to handle them.
2-female_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Hey, keep it up.  Meia <i>loves</i> women that can put up a fight.
2-female_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99,alsoPlaying:meia=interested,Don't give out on us now, dear!  I was starting to come around on Earth women.
2-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale_swimsuit,targetStage:0=laughing,How can a woman dress for a sun she's apparently never seen?  The mysteries just keep piling up.
2-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale_swimsuit,targetStage:0=interested,Cute swimsuit, honey, but I've always preferred the shade.  So do you, clearly.
2-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale_swimsuit,targetStage:0=vain,Yeah, I'm more the type to lounge under an umbrella than do any swimming.  But more power to you, if you ever choose to go outside.
2-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale_swimsuit,targetStage:0=interested,Look, dear.  You can wear that swimsuit all day, but that complexion's not fooling anybody.
2-female_must_strip,target:hope,targetStage:0=confused,Hey, dearie, no reason to come out knives-swinging.  I've got my rapier sheathed like a civilized woman.
2-female_must_strip,target:hope,targetStage:0=awkward,Settle down there, honey.  There's something awfully scary about wearing a smile with a knife out.
2-female_must_strip,target:hope,targetStage:0=frustrated,I know I brought a sword, sweetheart, but that was just for fashion.  Don't turn this place into a bloodbath.
2-female_must_strip,target:hope,targetStage:0=shocked,Well, hi there, cutie--er, uh, <i>knife-wielding</i> cutie.  Yeah.  Carry on.
2-female_must_strip,target:orendi,targetStage:0=confused,...You OK there, Fireball?  You on the same planet as the rest of us?
2-female_must_strip,target:orendi,targetStage:0=confused,I may <i>be</i> an alien...but you're certainly acting like one.
2-female_must_strip,target:orendi,targetStage:0=annoyed,Four arms looks useful, but I really can't get over the constant shouting.  Can't you pipe down?
2-female_must_strip,target:orendi,targetStage:0=frustrated,Hey, Earth-girl.  Or wherever you're from.  There's this thing called an <i>indoor</i> voice.
2-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0=smug,Well, look at what we have here!  A blonde spacefarer in a jumpsuit.  Well, I guess we <i>almost</i> match...
2-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0=seductive,I'm a big fan of the bodysuit look, cutie.  So's a certain crewmate of mine I wish was here...space just makes it so much easier.
2-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, a <i>blonde</i>!  And she travels around in space, too.  If only you had the sense to wear my dress instead of that suit, we'd be twins.
2-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0=vain,A shapely little specimen, zipping around space in that provocative bodysuit?  You're a model Mejarian--if only Meia were here!
2-female_must_strip,target:hinata,targetStage:0=smug,So what are these "ninjas" all about, huh?  Disappearing into the night doesn't sound useful in a game like <i>this</i>.
2-female_must_strip,target:hinata,targetStage:0=teasing,Don't tell me your going to use those ninja skills to hide your body, now.
2-female_must_strip,target:hinata,targetStage:0=stretching,Certainly an impressive profile, Miss Ninja.  Think you could show us just <i>how</i> impressive?
2-female_must_strip,target:hinata,targetStage:0=interested,Does "ninja" just mean you wear a headband?  Sounds like a lofty title for my Barnette to accidentally fall under.
2-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:5=shocked,Bless you--<i>oh no</i>.
2-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:5=shocked,Who sneezed--<i>eep!  N-not Launch</i>!
2-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:5=shocked,<i>Ack!  Why'd you have to sneeze again</i>?
2-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:5=shocked,<i>Eek!  N-not again!  My heart can't take this</i>!
2-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:2=interested,Honey, you'd be better off putting some meat on your bones than trying desperately to show them off.
2-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:2=bored,Sweetie, you're a twig.  This is just unhealthy...as unhealthy as you look.
2-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:2=confused,Are you suffering from this "anorexia" I keep reading about?  Eating disorders?  Do men do this to you?
2-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:2=vain,Talk about needing a girlfriend.  See what happens when you're never validated?
2-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0=seductive,Check out that messy hair...and adorable student outfit!  Did you say you're a <i>witch</i>?
2-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0=smug,Watch out, ladies, we've got a full-blown <i>magician</i> on our hands.  On Mejare you get called a witch for saying men aren't the worst thing ever.
2-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0=vain,A <i>witch</i>, eh?  Forgive my doubts...that jealous old hag of a judge called me a witch just for having that anatomy book!
2-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0=seductive,Awww!  She even brought a little magic wand to complete the costume!  <i>You're so cute, Miss Witch</i>.
2-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0=vain,Between you and that time I got called a witch for showing interest in men, witches are just <i>irresistible</i> these days.
2-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=seductive,<i>Oooh</i>!  Even ~player~ realizes how beautiful I am--enough to add a clone!  You're so <i>adorable</i>.
2-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=laughing,Hey, what's this all about, ~player~?  Did I keep on winning, and you wanted to see me naked <i>that</i> badly?
2-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=vain,Would you look at that?  My beauty was so enticing that ~player~ figured out the offline version just to add more of me.
2-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=vain,Earth's cloning technology is well underway!  And ~player~ picked the <i>perfect</i> specimen, I must say.
2-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=vain,I never thought ~player~ could manage to flatter me, and then they go and pick <i>two</i> of me!  Good show.
2-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=laughing,<i>My, my, ~player~</i>.  You <i>really</i> like the look of me.
2-female_must_strip,target:kim,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, nice and simple fashion is always a treat to see.  I have a crewmate who bares her stomach just like you do!
2-female_must_strip,target:kim,targetStage:0=laughing,Hey, girlie.  I hope your stomach isn't feeling too vulnerable, all exposed next to the alien lady's rapier.
2-female_must_strip,target:kim,targetStage:0=teasing,Feeling confident, dear?  With a name like Pissible and a belly that vulnerable, you <i>must</i>.
2-female_must_strip,target:kim,targetStage:0=teasing,<i>Save the world</i>, huh?  Well, dearie, you and your little midriff should know I'm not <i>from</i> this world.
2-female_must_strip,target:willow,targetStage:0=seductive,Tell me about these "vampires," sweetie.  Sucking blood actually sounds a little romantic!
2-female_must_strip,target:willow,targetStage:0=interested,A computer nerd, eh?  So's Parfet--but I wouldn't trust her to handle supernatural blood-suckers.
2-female_must_strip,target:willow,targetStage:0=vain,I know a computer nerd--Parfet's her name.  Cute little thing...and she's with a man, who we <i>used</i> to think sucked blood.
2-female_must_strip,target:willow,targetStage:0=teasing,I think I drew blood on Barnette once--it was a steamy night.  But I never sucked it, so maybe I'm not one of these "vampires."
2-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=vain,Way to come in a full outfit, Miss Maid.  And you're still speaking just as politely as when you're on the job!
2-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=smug,Whoever is your house's owner must really crack the whip, Miss Maid.  Even <i>now</i> you're using those silly honorifics.
2-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=vain,"Jura-chan" sounds like the most <i>adorable</i> nickname!  I've got to get Barnette to start calling me that...Barnette-<i>chan</i>.
2-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=teasing,You don't have to keep speaking all polite, Miss Maid.  You're in the company of a brutal pirate now--feel free to join the crew.
2-female_must_strip,target:rosalina,targetStage:0=teasing,And what do we have here--a fellow spacefarer, and a tall blonde one at that?  <i>People are going to get us confused</i>.
2-female_must_strip,target:rosalina,targetStage:0=vain,Flying around on an <i>observatory</i>, you said?  That sounds heavenly--space is such a beautiful place!
2-female_must_strip,target:rosalina,targetStage:0=teasing,Space can actually be rather beautiful when you're not busy robbing people.  Surely you agree, Miss Princess?
2-female_must_strip,target:rosalina,targetStage:0=vain,You <i>say</i> you're a princess, but space belongs to everyone--surely a traveler like yourself knows that better than most.
2-female_must_strip,target:lara,targetStage:0=stretching,Raiding tombs, you said?  Why would you <i>ever</i> want to be all dirty and dusty?
2-female_must_strip,target:lara,targetStage:0=stretching,You won't find <i>me</i> in catacombs like you explore.  It'd ruin my dress...and my face.
2-female_must_strip,target:lara,targetStage:0=teasing,So what's in these tombs, anyway?  <i>We</i> conduct raids on the living and able--so watch out!
2-female_must_strip,target:lara,targetStage:0=smug,Raiding those who can't defend themselves doesn't sound too impressive, honey.  Or do monsters live in those tombs of yours?
2-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0=interested,What's with the wings, Miss Pixie?  You some kind of sex-fairy sent to wake up our libidos?
2-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0=seductive,And what do we have here?  A tender little love fairy to help us all along in our sexual adventures?
2-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0=teasing,A love fairy, eh?  You listen here, Miss Pixie--<i>I'm</i> in a happy relationship.  So no touching!
2-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0=laughing,Little Miss Pixie's got quite the filthy mouth for being so frilly-pink with love.  I guess sex <i>is</i> a part of love, but still...
2-female_must_strip,target:paya,targetStage:0=smug,My sympathies about the premature white hair, honey.  You look a lot older than you should.
2-female_must_strip,target:paya,targetStage:0=confused,You might want to rethink those facial markings, dear.  With that white hair, they look an awful lot like wrinkles.
2-female_must_strip,target:paya,targetStage:0=laughing,Couples can choose their babies' hair color on Mejare thanks to genetic engineering...there's a reason white isn't very popular.
2-female_must_strip,target:paya,targetStage:0=stretching,You poor thing.  Our captain's ancient, but even <i>she</i> still has color in her hair.
2-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:2=confused,So, uh, besides being blue, what's your deal?  You're all sweet and polite now.
2-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:2=seductive,Can't say I prefer blue hair, but you're certainly a lot sweeter now, honey.  What <i>happened</i>?
2-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:2=seductive,Normally I like blondes, but at least you're not waving a gun around and cursing anymore.  Nice tradeoff.
2-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:2=vain,Blue hair is more exotic, but blonde is far more beautiful.  Still, I'll take this polite version of you over the alternative.
2-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0=stretching,Hey, Chatterbox, feel free to live a little.  You're as bad as Meia...good thing she ended up somewhere else.
2-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0=stretching,And here I thought I was sparing this table the boredom of having Meia around.  Enter her Earth doppelganger.
2-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0=smug,Pale, dead-serious, somehow convinced there's strategy in cards.  I didn't know they synthesized Meia's brand of boredom on Earth.
2-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0=laughing,<i>Please, Chatterbox, you're talking our ears off.  And your smiles are just so radiant</i>!  A woman after Meia's own black heart.
2-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, cutie!  You look a little wide-eyed and naive to be here...but those bullets suggest otherwise.
2-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0=stretching,I've got my eye on you, Miss Ruby-Red.  I know better than to trust a cute girl with ammo clips on her belt.
2-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0=vain,You know who else is a cute girl with a little ammo on the side?  My girlfriend, Barnette.  And if you're anything like her, I better not get you angry.
2-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0=seductive,The black-and-red outfit is a winner, honey--very intimidating!  So's that ammo.  Guess you need to balance out your cute face.
2-female_must_strip,target:kurumu,targetStage:0=laughing,Hey there, short stuff!  Seems all your height went into your chest--those things are even bigger than mine!
2-female_must_strip,target:kurumu,targetStage:0=interested,You hogging all the nutrients on this planet, Miss Vampire?  You're the only Earth girl I've seen that outdoes <i>my</i> breasts.
2-female_must_strip,target:kurumu,targetStage:0=smug,Even through that schoolgirl's outfit, I can tell your breasts are superior to mine.  Hopefully Barnette loves me for <i>other</i> reasons.
2-female_must_strip,target:kurumu,targetStage:0=laughing,Is it true you suck blood, Miss Vampire?  If so...well, we certainly know where it all goes.
2-female_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=seductive,Did I ever tell you how sweet I've found Earthlings to be?  Going and losing for me when I had such a bad hand...
2-female_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=vain,Hah!  And I had a <i>high card</i>.  Dealer, you're just messing with me.
2-female_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=confused,Yeah, yeah, I'll get started--wait, I didn't lose?  I had a <i>high card</i>!
2-female_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=confused,Damn it, I--wait, how did someone have <i>worse</i> than me?  Oh, <i>wow</i>.
2-female_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=interested,...I'm just not sure what to make of you anymore, Dealer.  You give me trash, and the rest of them <i>burning</i> trash.
2-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0=excited,Ooh!  Ooh!  You're the one who's with a woman, right?  You some kind of Mejarian envoy to Earth?
2-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0=thinking,You're with a woman, isn't that right?  Maybe Mejare was just aping what Earthlings came up with first...
2-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0=interested,So, you're the one showing these poor Earth girls the Mejarian way, right?  That they don't need men to be happy?  Good job.
2-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0=vain,<i>Finally</i>, an Earth woman who's realized how much better other women's bodies are.  We should gossip about our girlfriends later.
2-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0,marker:fama_and_oma=smug,So, Miss Mejarian-style, are you going to be the Fama, or is your ladyfriend?  My Barnette's far too cute to carry babies herself.
2-female_must_strip,target:riva,targetStage:0=smug,You should know I'm not a fan of princesses, Miss Magician.  But <i>blonde</i> ones?  ...I might yield a little.
2-female_must_strip,target:riva,targetStage:0=stretching,Maybe all it takes is some blonde hair to warm me up to the idea of royalty...or magic.
2-female_must_strip,target:riva,targetStage:0=vain,Don't feel bad about your unearned title, Miss Princess.  I hear you can perform magic--and alongside blonde hair, I'd say you're alright in my book.
2-female_must_strip,target:riva,targetStage:0=vain,Little Miss Magician is a <i>princess</i>, as well?  Well, against my pirate nature, I think I'll let a fellow blonde be on her way.
2-female_must_strip,target:kimberly,targetStage:0=confused,Hey, so, uh, normally I'd tease you or something, but what was with that big lightshow from you earlier?
2-female_must_strip,target:kimberly,targetStage:0=confused,Wait, weren't you wearing pink a little while ago?  Like, a full suit?  Was that lightshow back there <i>you</i>?
2-female_must_strip,target:kimberly,targetStage:0=shocked,Hey, who's the new girl?  And where'd that pink-suit-wearing woman go after she flashed away?  Wait, was that <i>you</i>?
2-female_must_strip,target:kimberly,targetStage:0=angry,Hey, aren't you the one who half-blinded us all a little bit ago?  Where'd your suit go?  I thought it was cool, so start talking.
2-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=smug,Dull that edge, honey.  We're all just trying to have a good time here, stripping naked for complete strangers.
2-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=vain,You're a fiery one, Miss Edge.  A lot like my <i>darling</i> Barnette!  So I don't mind.
2-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=laughing,That red streak in your hair should've tipped us off that you'd be all angry.  Maybe feeling the breeze on your breasts will cheer you up.
2-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=vain,You know what warms me up to others, Miss Edge?  Shaking my breasts around for them--<i>they always appreciate that</i>!
2-female_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=seductive,More runs like that, and you'd have a spot on our pilot team.  Meia's always scouting out recruits, you know.
2-female_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=smug,You've got the ferocity of Mejarian soldiers.  Too bad I know how to handle them.
2-female_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=teasing,Hey, keep it up.  And if you see her, Meia <i>loves</i> women that can put up a fight.
2-female_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=interested,Don't give out on us now, dear!  I was starting to come around on Earth women.
2-female_must_strip,target:sharla,targetStage:0=teasing,Good thing you're a medic, because that mysterious dark complexion is making my heart beat ever faster.
2-female_must_strip,target:sharla,targetStage:0=seductive,Do you know how many women on Mejare are dark-skinned, Miss Medic?  Not enough, I say...even my Barnette is just a little tan.
2-female_must_strip,target:sharla,targetStage:0=vain,Oh, Miss Medic?  I think I'm coming down with something--<i>love for your chocolate flavoring</i>!
2-female_must_strip,target:sharla,targetStage:0=teasing,You dress pretty casually for a medic, but that exotic dark skin is helping me overlook your shoddy sense of professionalism.
2-female_must_strip,target:navi,targetStage:0=laughing,...Yeah, I can see why you'd be comfortable here.  We'd need a computer scan to find your vagina.
2-female_must_strip,target:navi,targetStage:0=interested,You know, I tease Earth girls about growing up all small, but <i>wow</i>.  Now I just feel bad.
2-female_must_strip,target:navi,targetStage:0=smug,At least you've got those wings to buzz around to <i>our</i> height.  Inferiority complex, sweetie?
2-female_must_strip,target:navi,targetStage:0=bored,Well, there goes any chance of getting a <i>good look</i> at what Earth girls have got.  You <i>are</i> from Earth, right?
2-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0=confused,...Look, honey.  Makeup is a girl's best friend, but...it's possible to get a little too close to your friends.
2-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0,marker:fama_and_oma=laughing,Dear god.  Did you break into your Fama's makeup closet and start applying whatever you could find?  Your friends are letting you down.
2-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0=smug,I guess I never appreciated how light with makeup I can be with my natural beauty.  Here we see the alternative...
2-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0=vain,Check out Miss Makeup over here.  Somehow she made it through childhood without hearing the expression "less is more."
2-female_must_strip,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=seductive,Oh?  And what do we have here, besides the most adorably shy little woman I've ever seen?
2-female_must_strip,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=stretching,Such a cutie...and in a traditional-looking dress!  Hard to believe someone so shy would even be here.
2-female_must_strip,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=seductive,Something wrong, honey?  <i>You've hardly been looking me in the eye</i>.  It's OK, I don't bite.
2-female_must_strip,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=vain,Why so shy, Elizabeth?  Confidence makes women ten times as beautiful--just look at me!
2-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:1=shocked,What's next, Ocean Girl?  You shir--<i>I was kidding</i>!
2-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:1=shocked,I imagine the shirt is ne--<i>wait, no, I was just joking</i>!
2-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:1=annoyed,...You're not serious?  I'm telling you, you have to <i>tease</i> a little!
2-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:1=bored,...Ocean Girl's a total idiot.  Just stripping nude right off the bat...way to miss the point.
2-female_must_strip,target:seven,targetStage:0=teasing,Seems bodysuits are more popular among spacegoers than even <i>I</i> figured.  Works for me--I like your figure.
2-female_must_strip,target:seven,targetStage:0=seductive,<i>My, my, honey</i>!  You've got some interesting decorations, but that suit is making me fall in love already.
2-female_must_strip,target:seven,targetStage:0=vain,I really ought to try out one of those bodysuits myself...or maybe stuff Barnette in one.  They're just so <i>revealing</i>!
2-female_must_strip,target:seven,targetStage:0=vain,Those jumpsuits really are the best, especially when you're in low gravity.  The enemy should know how beautiful you are!
2-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0=smug,And here I thought I was on Earth.  Turns out we've got a woman from a frozen tundra planet, evolved for camouflage.
2-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0=teasing,You look like you're in pretty good shape, honey.  And even better, I bet sweat blends right in to your marble complexion!
2-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0=vain,I'll be frank--you wouldn't catch me dead exercising.  It's so much work, and look at what it's done to this poor woman's skin!
2-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0=stretching,<i>Fitness this</i>, <i>exercise that</i>.  Why should I take advice from a woman who's apparently never seen sunlight?
2-female_must_strip,target:elena,targetStage:0=teasing,Little Miss Princess wants to play strip poker, does she?  Well, I hope you don't mind if this nasty pirate holds you hostage.
2-female_must_strip,target:elena,targetStage:0=laughing,Looking a little out of your element, Miss Blueblood.  Gonna prove that you're really better than the rest of us like your title implies?
2-female_must_strip,target:elena,targetStage:0=smug,Look at Miss Princess, lugging around a scepter just to prove she's better than the peons.  We'll see how you enjoy stripping down like us.
2-female_must_strip,target:elena,targetStage:0=annoyed,Royals really get on my nerves, you know...mostly because I'm <i>not</i> one, despite actually being better-looking.
2-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0=seductive,You know what I love more than anything in this vast universe?  A fellow blonde...especially a cute one!  And you fit the bill, fireball.
2-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, I like your energy--and your blondeness!  My girlfriend Barnette's a real spark plug herself.
2-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0=interested,You're a cutie, Miss Midriff--that messy blonde hair is only making me fall further in love.  Where do you get all your energy?
2-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0=teasing,Slow down there, firecracker--you're like a burning torch with all that blonde hair flying about.  But it's definitely cute!
2-female_must_strip,target:elaine,targetStage:0=seductive,And what do we have here?  An <i>Earth</i> pirate?  And with a sword, to boot!  Interesting...
2-female_must_strip,target:elaine,targetStage:0=teasing,I see even Earth pirates understand the subtle elegance of a blade!  And you've got some <i>luxurious</i> hair yourself.
2-female_must_strip,target:elaine,targetStage:0=seductive,Oho--a fellow pirate?  I'd absolutely <i>love</i> to have a drink later--maybe you could teach me how to handle my sword better.
2-female_must_strip,target:elaine,targetStage:0=seductive,<i>Well, now</i>!  You Earth pirates don't dress like we do on Mejare--but your choice of weapon isn't too far off.  Can you show me around?
2-female_must_strip,target:lux,targetStage:0=laughing,A covert agent, eh?  I guess if an alien woman knows that, you've already failed at your job.
2-female_must_strip,target:lux,targetStage:0=teasing,So what are you so <i>covert</i> about, Miss Agent?  We pirates just charge in and gun the place down before they know what hit them!
2-female_must_strip,target:lux,targetStage:0=interested,What kind of covert agent fights with light?  You know, the thing that makes your position <i>clearer</i>?
2-female_must_strip,target:lux,targetStage:0=smug,Oho--we've got an <i>agent</i> on our hands.  Wouldn't be the first we had on our ship--and we made her come around to our side.
2-female_must_strip,target:dawn,targetStage:0=confused,What'd you say you raised?  Those little <i>Poker</i>--whatevers?  Is that why you're playing this game?
2-female_must_strip,target:dawn,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, dearie, that exotic blue hair will take you further than weird animal training--you should be a model for shampoo or something.
2-female_must_strip,target:dawn,targetStage:0=confused,Mejare has barely any animals at all, so this whole "pokey-mon" thing is lost on me.  And they just do whatever you say?
2-female_must_strip,target:dawn,targetStage:0=laughing,So could you train <i>men</i> the way you do these <i>poker</i>-whatevers?  Because <i>that</i> would be quite interesting...
2-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0=interested,I was about to comment on how I love blondes, but that mechanical arm really stands out.  How'd you get it?
2-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0=confused,It's hard to feel too awkward about you losing your arm when that thing looks like a pretty useful replacement.  Got a story to tell?
2-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0=laughing,Check out Miss Cyborg over here!  You wear that mechanical arm quite well--<i>do Earth men find you too much to handle</i>?
2-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0=seductive,I must say, that cold steel clashes with your fiery personality.  Talk about a two-tiered threat!
2-female_must_strip,target:shantae,targetStage:0=teasing,Ooh, I think that dark complexion is <i>exotic</i>--so do most Mejarians.  You got a thing for women, Miss Genie?
2-female_must_strip,target:shantae,targetStage:0=seductive,So what's a "genie," anyway?  Does that mean "cute chocolate-flavored girl"?  Because I think I like genies, then.
2-female_must_strip,target:shantae,targetStage:0=seductive,I like your style, Miss Genie!  You're as revealing as my girlfriend Barnette--a little tanner, though.
2-female_must_strip,target:shantae,targetStage:0=teasing,Ooh, the way you move your hips is <i>exquisite</i>, Miss Genie!  I want to learn how to add a little vanilla flavoring to that, if you follow.
2-female_must_strip,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:0=interested,...Can I maybe just call you "DMG" for short?  Because <i>Dark Magician Girl</i> is a hell of a mouthful.
2-female_must_strip,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:0,marker:fama_and_oma=confused,...Don't you have an actual name?  You know, like the one your Fama gives you?
2-female_must_strip,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:0=teasing,You've really got to give yourself a snappier nickname, dearie...men aren't bright enough to remember that many words.
2-female_must_strip,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:0=stretching,If you really <i>are</i> a magician, color me interested...but that clunky name could use a shortening or two.
2-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=laughing,Well, aren't <i>you</i> a tight little ball of sexual energy!  I guess it's got nowhere to go in that tiny frame of yours.
2-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=vain,You've got a lot of libido packed into a little body.  Must be the effects of Earth men...we Mejarians are <i>tasteful</i> in our sexuality.
2-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=laughing,<i>Why, I never</i>!  You're so dreadfully lewd, Miss Tan...do men just like women on the shorter side?
2-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=vain,You must get a lot of attention from men to be all amped-up like this.  <i>Tell me a tall woman still has a chance</i>!
2-female_must_strip,target:daria,targetStage:0=laughing,Way to half-ass your outfit, honey.  You look like you picked out whatever fell on you when you opened your closet!
2-female_must_strip,target:daria,targetStage:0=interested,...So is the "zero-effort" look how you attract Earth men?  Have I been going at this all wrong?
2-female_must_strip,target:daria,targetStage:0=smug,I should have known--men are too simple to understand complex outfits, so they respond better to cobbled-together looks like yours.
2-female_must_strip,target:daria,targetStage:0=laughing,Gotta be honest here, sweetheart--you don't look like the type to be playing this.  Those glasses aren't helping you pick out appealing clothes.
2-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0=excited,Ooh, an Earth woman with green hair!  My girlfriend Barnette has green hair...and she is the <i>cutest</i> thing!
2-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, I didn't know Earth women could have green hair!  I've always considered it the most cutely exotic thing about Barnette.
2-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0=seductive,A sword <i>and</i> lovely green hair?  You must be a sign that Barnette and I are ready for children, sweetie.
2-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0=teasing,Ooh, green hair on a woman never fails to get me going.  But don't worry, my verdantly-colored girlfriend can handle the rest.
2-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey there, Miss Gunslinger!  You're not gonna <i>fire</i> those things, are you?  My girlfriend collects those sorts of guns.
2-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=seductive,Omigosh, are those antique men's kinetic weapons?  My girlfriend collects them!  You should meet her.
2-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=seductive,Always good to see an armed woman!  My girlfriend, Barnette, is totally obsessed with men's mechanical guns like yours.
2-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=vain,Hey, Miss Gunslinger!  You should lighten up a little and show those men's kinetic guns to my girlfriend.  She's a total connoisseur.
2-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=teasing,I like the grace of Mejarian laser rings myself, but you want some serious interest on those men's guns of yours?  Talk to my girlfriend.
2-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, a dark-skinned woman!  We only have a few of those on Mejare--you'd turn heads, Miss Exotic.  And your outfit would fit right in.
2-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=teasing,Talk about a fierce look in your eye--and even skimpier clothing than me!  But you make it work, Miss Chocolate.
2-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=seductive,Hey there, cutie!  Between that exotic dark skin and light dress, you'd be a real steal where <i>I'm</i> from!
2-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=teasing,You're already a model Mejarian with that much skin showing, Miss Warrior.  <i>I'd like to see some sweat roll off those chocolate-flavored muscles</i>.
2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=smug,Took me a little, but I bit back.  What'll it be, Meia?
2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=interested,Your outfit is a mystery.  All I knew is that you don't have much.  What are you gonna pick?
2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=interested,Can't let the gap get <i>that</i> wide, Meia.  What's first?
2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=laughing,You can't beat me <i>that</i> easily.  Well, maybe you can.
2-female_must_strip,target:lilith,targetStage:0=vain,Planet <i>Pandora</i>, was it?  What a lovely name!  I might have to retire there with my darling Barnette when we're older.
2-female_must_strip,target:lilith,targetStage:0=vain,Pandora sounds like such a <i>gorgeous</i> name.  I think I'll call my first daughter that--surely Barnette won't mind.
2-female_must_strip,target:lilith,targetStage:0=teasing,Barnette and I are <i>always</i> discussing baby names.  Pandora sounds positively wonderful!
2-female_must_strip,target:lilith,targetStage:0=teasing,A hunter, eh?  And what do hunters hunt on lovely little Pandora--a cute name, by the way.
2-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0=interested,Looks like this place attracts more spacefarers than I gave it credit for.  Fine by me--at least someone knows where I'm coming from.
2-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0=seductive,What planet are you from, Miss Starshine?  Your fabulous blonde hair is winning me over as we speak.
2-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0=vain,Guess I can't learn about Earth girls from <i>you</i>--but hey, it's nice to know there's other gorgeous spacefarers out there.  Who like stripping.
2-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0=vain,Ooh, you cut your hair short like Meia does.  But it's wonderful blonde like mine--<i>space is so vast in its variety</i>!
2-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:0=seductive,I understand, dear.  You're so stunned by my beauty that you hid your own face in shame.  I'm sure you're still cute!
2-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:0=seductive,Don't hide that pretty little face on <i>my</i> account, honey.  You've certainly got a beautiful <i>figure</i>.
2-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:0=teasing,Nice little bodysuit you've got there, even if you plan on being the Masked Woman.  I know a sugar-and-ice girl with your fashion sense.
2-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:0=laughing,You've got a lot of sass for someone who won't show her face, Miss Masked.  Hiding some grisly injury, or just your own embarrassment?
2-female_must_strip,target:gogo,targetStage:0=teasing,What's your story, Miss Highlights?  Got any gum to share?
2-female_must_strip,target:gogo,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=teasing,Hey, toss me a piece of that gum, cutie.  I could use a snack while you tell me all about your "San Fransokyo" planet.
2-female_must_strip,target:gogo,targetStage:0=vain,Just gonna blow bubbles all day, or are you actually going to strip?  Either way, I wouldn't mind having some myself...
2-female_must_strip,target:gogo,targetStage:0=interested,You seem a little sour, Miss Gumball.  If those bubbles aren't cheering you up, just give me the rest to chew.
2-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=confused,...You're not from Earth either, are you?  ...Or human.  Or cute.
2-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=confused,Say, Miss, I couldn't help but notice your...eye.  What planet are you from, exactly?
2-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=awkward,And here I thought I'd be seeing some <i>Earth</i> women in this place...or that I'd be the most exotic one.
2-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=laughing,Always nice to look a woman in the eye.  Singular.
2-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=smug,I guess they don't value depth perception on whatever planet you're from.  You must be a real steal.
2-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=interested,Magno Vivan's pirates accept all women...but with depth perception like yours, you wouldn't make it as a pilot.
2-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=laughing,What's up, Four-Feet-Four-Eyes?  You look like someone brought you here at gunpoint.
2-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=laughing,Oh, look, the egghead love child of Parfet and Dita--nerdy and <i>and</i> eccentric!  How's the weather at the bottom of the earth?
2-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0,marker:fama_and_oma=laughing,I keep trying to look over your outfit, but my eyes just keep moving too fast and missing it.  Did your Fama not produce milk, shorty?
2-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=interested,You're such a cute little bespectacled spectacle--but damn if you don't look eleven.  Where's the other two feet of your body?
2-female_must_strip,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0=teasing,Totally devoted to scarlet, eh?  It certainly gets the heart racing...<i>and my appetite stirred</i>.
2-female_must_strip,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0=vain,Maybe <i>I</i> should get a fanciful nickname like Scarlet Witch...but not if it means restricting myself to one measly color.
2-female_must_strip,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0=seductive,What do you think would be a good nickname for me, dear?  <i>The Black Pirate</i>?  I can't pull off all-red like you do.
2-female_must_strip,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0=stretching,I wonder if all-red would look good on me.  I'm a pirate--I don't exactly have my pick of the litter with clothes!
2-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0=smug,Dear god, girl, you'd cower if a light breeze rolled in.  What's the big deal with a little <i>exposure</i>?
2-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0=seductive,You are just <i>so</i> cute.  How do you feel about women, little Miss?  <i>Do my breasts bother you</i>?
2-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0=vain,Shy around nudity, sweetie?  Did the big, bad Earth men beat this into you?  Just <i>enjoy</i> yourself...
2-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0=laughing,You're such a nervous wreck that I just feel bad for teasing you.  Way to ruin my fun.
2-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:1=awkward,So, Miss Kitty, you, uh, going to shave your bottom fur now?  ...I'd like that.
2-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:1=frustrated,Knowing that that's fur now makes me <i>really</i> want to see you shaved...Mejare likes shaving.
2-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:1=bored,Is the bottom fur going now?  Because I <i>hate</i> hair...except on the head.
2-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:1=bored,Please tell me you're shaving everything else.  That's sort of the style on Mejare, so it's what I know.
2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:4=teasing,No mysteries left at all.  Show these Earthlings a Mejarian's most sacred possession.
2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:4=laughing,Show these Earth ladies what a nude Mejarian looks like...so I don't have to.
2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:4=vain,Shame it's not <i>me</i> getting naked.  But maybe I'd set the bar too high for Mejarian beauty.
2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:4=laughing,One Mejarian, fully nude.  Shame we couldn't be this way together, Leader...well, we <i>could</i>, if you start playing better.
2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:3=vain,Not much mystery left to your outfit now, is there?  I'm really pulling ahead here.
2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:3=laughing,I still have so much on.  Anything spacey about your outfit disappeared with the bodysuit, I'd say.  Unless Earth people are impressed with sports bras.
2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:3=smug,Here you are, forced to take off your underwear.  <i>My</i> outfit still has plenty of secrets.
2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:3=teasing,For such a private woman, you're sure showing off all your secrets at once.
2-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:0=laughing,Hey, Kitty-cat.  You're supposed to strip <i>during</i> the game, not <i>before</i> it.
2-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:0=interested,Nice Halloween costume, Kitty, but maybe you should have picked something a little more complex for this game.
2-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:0=smug,Not too interested in winning, huh, Kitty-cat?  Unless you've brought some yarn-balls you plan on counting.
2-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:0=smug,I only know about cats from Mejare's zoos...they only showed the females, of course.  But they were definitely more covered than <i>you</i> are.
2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:2=laughing,Seems I've evened the odds.  Maybe even taken the lead, considering your limited wardrobe.
2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:2=teasing,Can't get sloppy, Meia.  You're not working with much, you know.
2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:2=laughing,As sexy as that bodysuit can be, maybe it wasn't the best choice of outfit for this game.
2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:2=laughing,You really needed to pack on the layers tonight.  That suit's not going to save you.
2-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0=excited,Ooh, Sei, you're such a cutie!  You look <i>just like</i> my squadron leader, Meia--that short blue hair is to <i>die</i> for!
2-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0=teasing,Short blue hair and shoulder armor?  You're the spitting image of my boss, Sei--too bad she's at another table!
2-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0=seductive,Short blue hair?  Omigosh, Sei, my boss Meia looks <i>just like</i> you!  And she could really use a girlfriend.
2-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0=seductive,Sei!  That's your name, right?  You look like my boss Meia with that short-cut blue hair.  Your eyes are a lot softer, though.
2-female_must_strip,target:faye,targetStage:0=smug,Beautiful hair, makeup, spacefaring?  With <i>both</i> of us running around, this table's going to get sick of the archetype.
2-female_must_strip,target:faye,targetStage:0=laughing,Do we have a fellow star-crossing seductress on our hands?  I'm not sure there's enough meat for both of us.
2-female_must_strip,target:faye,targetStage:0=teasing,<i>Hey, good-lookin'.</i>  Trying to steal my thunder with the "seductress-from-space" angle?  I don't mind--<i>I like women, too</i>.
2-female_must_strip,target:faye,targetStage:0=seductive,You didn't doll yourself up like that just to please some <i>men</i>, did you?  Come show this fellow spacefarer what you can do.
2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:1=confused,You look all embarrassed.  You didn't have to take off your eyepiece, Meia, really.
2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:1=awkward,Are you OK, Meia?  I'm sorry about your eyepiece earlier...
2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:1=awkward,Are you, uh...alright?  You know, after the eyepiece...
2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:1=confused,...Not sure what to say, considering your eyepiece and all...is that why you've been blushing?
2-female_must_strip,target:evie,targetStage:0=vain,So what's your story?  You can cast magic spells or something?  If it's true, sign me up--it'll be another wonderful thing about me!
2-female_must_strip,target:evie,targetStage:0=vain,Some might call my <i>beauty</i> magical...I'm inclined to agree.
2-female_must_strip,target:evie,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, honey.  Cast a spell on <i>me</i>...one that makes me even prettier.  Now <i>that</i> would be magic!
2-female_must_strip,target:evie,targetStage:0=interested,Alright, I've seen enough crazy Paksis-magic to believe your tales.  But why don't you put your money where your mouth is?
2-female_must_strip,target:tifa,targetStage:0=interested,Ohoho.  A <i>martial artist</i>, honey?  Well, I can certainly see where all your momentum comes from.
2-female_must_strip,target:tifa,targetStage:0=laughing,With a figure like that, I imagine you've developed your <i>own</i> style of martial arts...centered around counterweights.
2-female_must_strip,target:tifa,targetStage:0=teasing,<i>My, my</i>!  Those things outdo even mine, sweetie...but I don't pretend I'm some sort of athlete.
2-female_must_strip,target:tifa,targetStage:0=seductive,Bigger breasts <i>and</i> martial arts skill?  Jeez, you're outmaneuvering me left and right.  Good thing you're such a cutie!
2-female_must_strip,target:buffy,targetStage:0=confused,Do you seriously fight those "vampire" things?  I mean, you just don't look all that imposing.
2-female_must_strip,target:buffy,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, you're kind of cute!  Is that how you kill "vampires"?  Just making them let their guard down with your adorable face?
2-female_must_strip,target:buffy,targetStage:0=confused,So what's it take to kill these "vampires"?  Can't you just get the military to shoot them or something?  You don't seem all that special.
2-female_must_strip,target:buffy,targetStage:0=smug,For a girl called "Buffy," you sure seem awful willowy.  You <i>do</i> have a cute face, so maybe that's your strategy for killing those vampire things.
2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:2=seductive,I'd call you crazy for this sort of thing, but how could I when you defy death like it's nothing?
2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:2=excited,You're just so <i>awesome</i>!  I can't get enough of this!
2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:2=teasing,Can you do it a <i>third</i> time, hotshot?  Yeah, probably.
2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:2=excited,I could watch you do this all day.  My heart jumps every time!
2-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=seductive,Ooh, I <i>love</i> your makeup!  Where do you get it on Earth?  I usually make a point to steal some during raids.
2-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=seductive,You're just <i>adorable</i> how you've dolled yourself up!  And you're so teenie-weenie.
2-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=excited,Omigosh, that little outfit is <i>so</i> cute!  And you might be more into makeup than even <i>I</i> am.
2-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=excited,Ooh, do they make dresses that cute in my size?  What about your makeup?  You look so adorable!
2-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:0=stretching,And they say <i>men</i> are tall!  You're enough woman for the whole table, sweetie.
2-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:0=smug,You said you don't get out much?  Guess men like short women...that makes things awkward for me.
2-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:0=smug,You know, I tend to turn heads with my height alone.  Better not invite <i>you</i> to the ship, or you'll steal my thunder.
2-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:0=seductive,From what I know of men, you're as tall as one...and built like them, too.  Don't worry, you wear it well--so does Gascogne!
2-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:0=teasing,Hibiki's a teenie-weenie man I know.  I guess you represent the opposite end of the spectrum on both counts.
2-female_must_strip,target:piper,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey there, Miss Meterstick.  Thanks for not letting my ego get too big when it came to height.
2-female_must_strip,target:piper,targetStage:0=stretching,Every woman I know says I'm tall.  Do you turn heads when you enter a room, too?
2-female_must_strip,target:piper,targetStage:0=vain,Oh, good, a woman who understands what it's like towering over people.  The intimidation can be kind of fun, no?
2-female_must_strip,target:piper,targetStage:0=stretching,Men seem to be taller than women.  I guess I wouldn't turn as many heads on Earth, then...but you'd do it no matter what.
2-female_must_strip,target:zelda,targetStage:0=interested,You know what I see when a woman calls herself "royalty"?  <i>An inferiority complex</i>, Miss Boring-Brunette.
2-female_must_strip,target:zelda,targetStage:0=laughing,You're cute, especially as far as overhyped princesses go.  Let's see how cute you are <i>without</i> all your jewelry.
2-female_must_strip,target:zelda,targetStage:0=laughing,You know what I think of miserable jealous girls who dress themselves up and pretend they're better than the rest of us?  ...I like stripping them.
2-female_must_strip,target:zelda,targetStage:0=vain,Take away a princess's fancy dress and what does she have?  Hopefully a cute butt, and a pirate nearby who's earned her clothes.
2-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0,count-weiss_v4:1=vain,Hey, Miss Moneybags, nice wardrobe.  I'm just a poor little pirate--<i>this dress is the best I can afford</i>.
2-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0,count-weiss_v4:1=smug,Figures Miss Princess can't go five minutes without changing her clothes.  A few months of piracy will teach you appreciate the clothes you've got.
2-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0,count-weiss_v4:1=interested,At least you mixed up the colors a little with this new outfit, Miss Heirlooms.  What you had before was like if I wore all yellow.
2-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0,count-weiss_v4:1=teasing,Looking cute there, Coinstacks.  Nice new outfit--gotta show off the money somehow, right?
2-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, cutie!  You look like you've got some kind of rank to your name, with that beret--care to share any details?
2-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, you're not a bad looker, Earth-girl!  I like that exotic purple hair.  What is it you do, exactly?
2-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0=seductive,Tell me more about your exciting "NERV" job, Miss Military.  I want to know <i>all about</i> Earth!
2-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0=teasing,Ohoho--a <i>military</i> woman.  Well, indulge this filthy pirate scum and share what it is you do all day.
2-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:2=teasing,I'm <i>waiting</i>, Vriska!  Don't disappoint me and pick some boring outfit!
2-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:2=teasing,I'm expecting some good fashion from you, you know!  Don't leave it up to chance!
2-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:2=smug,Don't you have some way to control that?  I'd rather you showed off something specific.
2-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:2=teasing,Lay the fashion on me, Vriska!  Fashion from...wherever it is that you live.
2-female_must_strip,target:alpha,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=laughing,You're pale as marble, dearie!  Do they not have a sun on this "Japan" planet?
2-female_must_strip,target:alpha,targetStage:0=confused,Are you...<i>flickering</i>?  Are you some kind of hologram?  That might explain your skin tone.
2-female_must_strip,target:alpha,targetStage:0=confused,You OK there, sweetheart?  You look a little pale...and non-corporeal.
2-female_must_strip,target:alpha,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=vain,And I thought <i>Mejarians</i> liked the pale look!  This "Japan" planet puts us to shame.
2-female_must_strip,target:uhura,targetStage:0=smug,Oh, don't worry, dear.  We on Mejare are well aware of Earth's space program...you <i>have</i> tried to harvest us, after all.
2-female_must_strip,target:uhura,targetStage:0=teasing,You can call it "Star Fleet" if you want, dear, but it'll always be the Harvest to me.  <i>You nasty organ-stealers, you</i>.
2-female_must_strip,target:uhura,targetStage:0=vain,I don't buy this whole "peaceful space travel" angle, Miss Star Fleet.  I've spent far too much time fending off your little Harvest cubes!
2-female_must_strip,target:uhura,targetStage:0=smug,Yeah, yeah, I'm sure this "Star Fleet" is super peaceful.  Just remember I've got a Vandread...so I'm not afraid of you.
2-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,Mei and Meia, eh?  I hope our other guests won't mix the two of you up--both are cold in your own ways, after all.
2-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,Look, Meia, this girl's nearly got your name.  But she smiles, so telling you two apart should be easy.
2-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Mei and Meia?  I'd play matchmaker, but you'd be the most confusing couple of all time.
2-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,See, Meia?  You're so sweet, this girl was nearly named after you.  Nearly.
2-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:0=excited,Ohhh, you're so <i>cute</i>!  Draped in a loose-fitting shirt...and those <i>pigtails</i>!  I just wanna squeeze you!
2-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:0=excited,There's something about pigtails on a girl that just make me want to squeeze her even more...you're so <i>adorable</i>!
2-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:0=teasing,So, honey...<i>do men like to yank on those pigtails</i>?  It's OK, you can tell me--I'm not from around here.
2-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:0=seductive,You look like you've taken your first step into womanhood...and no more than that, with too-big clothes and adorable little pigtails!
2-female_must_strip,target:tracer,targetStage:0=teasing,All about speed, eh, girlie?  Try not to blink right out of your costume...or back to before I won, you little cheat.
2-female_must_strip,target:tracer,targetStage:0=vain,Hey, where's <i>my</i> time travel?  Actually, there's nothing about my life I regret, so no issue.
2-female_must_strip,target:tracer,targetStage:0=seductive,Mind if I borrow that time device, sweetie?  I want to fall in love with my Barnette <i>all over again</i>.
2-female_must_strip,target:tracer,targetStage:0=teasing,If that thing can really travel you back in time, that's pretty fantastic.  How many times have we done this match over again, <i>loser</i>?
2-female_must_strip,target:tracer,targetStage:0=smug,You know what I've learned as a pirate?  You only get one chance to do things right.  This time-travel business sounds like a crutch.
2-female_must_strip,target:velma,targetStage:0=teasing,It's a rare woman who can pull off the glasses look, you know.  Parfet landed herself a man...how about <i>you</i>, Miss Mystery?
2-female_must_strip,target:velma,targetStage:0=stretching,I know a glasses-wearing egghead myself...Parfet's her name, and what she looks like with them off is the <i>real</i> mystery.
2-female_must_strip,target:velma,targetStage:0=laughing,Hey, Miss Mystery...can you solve how to make glasses look good on a woman?  Here's the answer: <i>give them to me</i>.
2-female_must_strip,target:velma,targetStage:0=vain,So, you solve mysteries, is that right?  I guess the glasses would help there...think you could solve the mystery of this <i>alien woman</i>?
2-female_must_strip,target:velma,targetStage:0=interested,Hey, Miss Mystery.  Push those frames up and answer a few questions...because <i>men</i> are a mystery to me.
2-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:0=vain,Check out that outfit!  Going for the natural look?  So would I, if Mejare had much of nature.
2-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:0=interested,Did you just piece that outfit together from bits you found in a forest?  It doesn't even look that bad, but...it's certainly all-natural.
2-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:0=vain,If only Mejare had the same verdant natural resources as Earth.  Perhaps then I could try to emulate your all-natural style.
2-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:0=vain,Mejare's a little too wasteful to have the greenery for me to dress like <i>you</i> do.  You can see how little we wear to compensate.
2-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0,count-ruby_v4:1=interested,Looking a little different there, Ruby.  Brighter, in fact.  Something bring up the mood where you're from?
2-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0,count-ruby_v4:1=smug,I see you've been mixing up the colors, sweetie.  Not a bad approach, but I'm totally in love with this dress just as it is.
2-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0,count-ruby_v4:1=stretching,Mixing up the outfits, are we?  I've cultivated a certain look with my crewmates I'd rather just maintain.
2-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0,count-ruby_v4:1=vain,Hey, check out the new style Ruby's rocking.  Not bad, but I'm the kind of girl to just stick with what I know best!
2-female_must_strip,target:meg,targetStage:0=vain,What's with the hat, honey?  Take it off and let your hair run wild, like any woman's should!
2-female_must_strip,target:meg,targetStage:0=smug,Matting your lovely hair under a hat like that...even if you <i>do</i> run all the time, I just can't understand.
2-female_must_strip,target:meg,targetStage:0=smug,A <i>killer</i>, you said?  The only killer here is what that hat's doing to your hair.
2-female_must_strip,target:meg,targetStage:0=teasing,Check out Miss Exercise over here.  There's no running from <i>this</i> game...so drop the hat and let your hair breathe a while.
2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=vain,No jokes here, darling!  We're one hundred percent <i>alien</i>...if you define "alien" as "not from Earth."
2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=seductive,We <i>are</i> from another planet, honey!  We're fearless Mejarian pirates...and we've come <i>all this way</i> to learn about Earth.
2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=vain,Yep, just two exotic women from another world!  So we stuck together, since we can only trust each other around here.
2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=teasing,We're pirates from Mejare, darling, and all we know about Earth is that men and women live together here!  Which sounds strange to us.
2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=seductive,That's right, Elizabeth--Meia and I are from another world!  And we're stripping here--<i>that's how much we trust each other</i>.
2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>Well, howdy, pardner, how d'ya</i>--do...
2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:0=shocked,What are you lugging that big men's gun around for--<i>ack</i>!
2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:0=shocked,Well, aren't <i>you</i> spunky!  You even brought a model g--<i>eek</i>!
2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:0=shocked,Uh...where are you pointing that thing?  Are you--wait--<i>eek!  Don't</i>!
2-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=bored,<i>Yeesh</i>.  Meia, I'm sorry I ever called you miserable.  Next to this girl, you're a field of sunflowers.
2-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,I'm glad we came here, boss.  Miss Blueberry over here has given me a new appreciation for your sense of humor.
2-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=bored,Jeez, I've at least <i>seen</i> you smile, Meia.  I don't think this girl <i>has</i> those muscles.
2-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,At least you have your face on display, Leader.  This girl's both miserable <i>and</i> refuses to show it.
2-female_must_strip,target:alice_degracia,targetStage:0=smug,Hey, hey, hey!  Check out the <i>all-purple</i> look.  That's a new one...
2-female_must_strip,target:alice_degracia,targetStage:0=vain,Hey, honey, color <i>contrasts</i> show confidence.  Would I look nearly as stunning if this dress matched my hair?
2-female_must_strip,target:alice_degracia,targetStage:0=smug,Purple hair's certainly got an exotic appeal...too bad mine is boring old blonde.  As for the matching outfit, I don't follow the logic.
2-female_must_strip,target:alice_degracia,targetStage:0=teasing,Quite the exotic color scheme you've got there, sweetie.  Too bad you forgot to mix it up at all.
2-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,What's up, sourpuss?  You look even more miserable than a certain squadron leader I know...the one right next to us.
2-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,Hey, lighten up, girlie.  I could have gotten this mood from playing poker with Meia back on the ship.
2-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=stretching,<i>Yawn</i>...are you really going to be a miserable bore this whole time?  Would having <i>my</i> breasts make you feel better?
2-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,Looks like it's Little Miss Sunshine's turn to strip.  Between you and Meia here, the energy's just through the roof.
2-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:0=seductive,Hey there, Miss Two-Tone!  I like your sense of fashion--that exposed, that hat, and those cute little boots!
2-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, is that two-toned hair natural?  That's fancier than even <i>Mejarians</i> have come up with.
2-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:0=interested,You seem pretty smug, honey.  Do you have a sweeter half like your hair implies?
2-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:0=excited,Ooh, can I try on your hat when you lose it?  Or that amulet?  Can you two-tone my hair like yours?
2-female_must_strip,target:penny,targetStage:0=smug,Looks like we've found an Earth girl who's just decided to embrace the whole "boring conservatism" stereotype.  At least your hair is a fiery red.
2-female_must_strip,target:penny,targetStage:0=teasing,That fiery red hair contrasts your rather plain outfit.  But it's not a bad look overall!
2-female_must_strip,target:penny,targetStage:0=vain,<i>Finally</i>, a normal-looking Earth girl.  I need a measuring stick to compare all these superpowered weirdos to...all you've got is that red hair.
2-female_must_strip,target:penny,targetStage:0=seductive,Good, a civilian girl.  So many people at this bar are such colorful characters--oh, but your hair is pretty vibrant, I guess.
2-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:3=excited,Here we go again.  This is so <i>exciting</i>!  Every outfit is an adventure!
2-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:3=excited,This is making me feel so alive!  I love checking out women's fashion!  Show some more!
2-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:3=seductive,You're so cool, Vriska!  And maybe even a little cute!  What else have you got for me?
2-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:3=teasing,Don't stop now, cutie!  Any more adorable outfits you've got in store for me?
2-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_first_time_playing=laughing,Wait, wait, wait.  You've <i>never</i> played poker before?  What are you, in some religious cult or something?
2-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_first_time_playing=smug,You poor, poor thing.  Never played poker before...what a way to start.
2-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_first_time_playing=laughing,You've <i>never</i> played poker before?  Oh, dear...well, I'll be sure to show you the ropes, sweetie.
2-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_first_time_playing=seductive,Your first time ever, huh?  I'm afraid you picked a hell of a game to start with...but you're a cute little thing, so don't be embarrassed.
2-female_must_strip,target:aiyana,targetStage:0=vain,That tan is something else, and your energy is boundless!  Most Mejarians opt for pale, as you can see...
2-female_must_strip,target:aiyana,targetStage:0=teasing,Barnette's kind of tan like you are.  She's cute, too, so women can pull it off!
2-female_must_strip,target:aiyana,targetStage:0=teasing,Slow down there, tiger.  That energy is going to turn you into a tan smear on the ground.
2-female_must_strip,target:aiyana,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=confused,Tan is certainly a look on Mejare, but pale is the norm for us...where'd you say you were from?  Planet Austria?
2-female_must_strip,target:may,targetStage:0=smug,What'd you say you did?  Train in poker?  Well, it didn't save you <i>that</i> hand...unless they're animals or something.
2-female_must_strip,target:may,targetStage:0=stretching,So, you're all about <i>poker</i>-mon, was it?  Well, seems you've been training all your life for this game...
2-female_must_strip,target:may,targetStage:0=frustrated,These <i>pokuhmon</i> things just sound like more trouble than they're worth.  Animals in Mejarian zoos are so <i>dirty</i>!
2-female_must_strip,target:may,targetStage:0=confused,You're an animal trainer, isn't that right?  Or was it <i>poker</i>...mons?  Not following the Earth slang here.
2-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,You'll have to excuse Meia's hostility.  She's absorbed all of our collective pirate hatred of authority.
2-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,Oh, don't mind Meia.  She's taken the whole pirates-hating--soldiers thing a little too much to heart.
2-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,Just let Meia fume a little, Miss Military. We know you're not from <i>Mejare's</i> nasty old ranks.
2-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=stretching,Cute purple hair, Miss Military.  Oh, don't worry about Meia.  She's even touchier with soldier women than the rest of us.
2-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:0=confused,...I had no idea Earth girls came in so many...flavors.  How'd your parents pick <i>grape</i>?
2-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:0=confused,...So, uh, that skin color.  Am I missing something?  Is this a common look on Earth?
2-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:0=confused,Gotta be honest, girlie, I'm out of the loop on what Earth people look like.  Is that complexion of yours...<i>normal</i>?
2-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:0=confused,What's this about <i>ponies</i> that you keep going on about?  Is a "pony" a purple Earthling?  I'm totally lost here.
2-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=interested,Look, Meia, she's just as pale, serious, and boring as you are.  Think she'd smile around Kahlua?
2-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,Hey, Meia's standing right here.  Isn't that enough boredom for one table without <i>you</i> aping her style?
2-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,Look at that, Meia, Earth's found a way to mass-produce you!  <i>Diabolical</i>.
2-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,<i>Yeah, yeah, Meia, stay cocky</i>.  Oh wait, Meia's over <i>here</i>!  You two are just so similar.
2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:4=smug,Well, I guess if you've come this far, you might as well finish the job.  Go for it.
2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:4=seductive,I'd expect nothing less, cutie.  Be sure to wow us!
2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:4=teasing,Might as well seal the deal, even if it's just your thong.  You can do it, honey!
2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:4=smug,Seems we've got similar taste in underwear.  Shame you're about to shoot it right off, but at least it'll look cool.
2-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_playing_with_boys=smug,Oh, don't worry about men so much.  They're too clumsy and oafish to make use of all that strength.
2-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_playing_with_boys,marker:nagisa-tubes=interested,I really thought Earth women would be pretty comfortable around men.  Don't you have them shove their tubes into you on a regular basis?
2-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_playing_with_boys=interested,Aren't you used to men ogling and clawing at you?  I thought Earth women do that with them all the time.
2-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_playing_with_boys=stretching,You're so damn shy around these men.  Listen, I fight a whole planet of the toughest men around.  They're all talk.
2-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:0=awkward,...Are you alright there, honey?  With the knife and all?
2-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:0=awkward,...You know, I carry the rapier mostly for fashion...maybe you could relegate that knife to the same thing?
2-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:0=annoyed,...Could you maybe put down the knife, sweetheart?  Hey, are you listening?
2-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:0=bored,What a weirdo...knives are just as deadly as swords, with none of the style.
2-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:0=frustrated,Better keep my sword on hand, with <i>this</i> nutcase on the scene.
2-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,Hey, Meia, what do you think?  Should we try to find you a bodysuit with polka dots?  Maybe force you to smile like Marinette?
2-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=interested,This girl makes bodysuits look a lot cuter than <i>you</i> do, Meia.  Must be because she smiles...or because of the polka dots.
2-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,Even with the mask on, this girl emotes much more than <i>you</i>, Meia.  Maybe a polka-dotted suit would lighten you up.
2-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,If you're not a fan of polka dots, Meia, maybe you could adopt this girl's adorable accent and actually brighten a room for once.
2-female_must_strip,target:velma_classic,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, Earth to ~player~.  There's a Velma model out now that doesn't look like a goblin.
2-female_must_strip,target:velma_classic,targetStage:0=interested,What, you figured out the offline version but still chose <i>this</i> Velma?  How nostalgia-blinded can you get?
2-female_must_strip,target:velma_classic,targetStage:0=interested,Hey, ~player~, it's not 2016 anymore.  There's a Velma you can play with that's actually on-model.
2-female_must_strip,target:velma_classic,targetStage:0=laughing,Hey, ~player~, Velma Classic is just here to remember the past...not masturbate to it.
2-female_must_strip,target:velma_classic,targetStage:0=laughing,Don't do this to yourself, ~player~--there's a better Velma now.  I mean, <i>look</i> at this one.
2-female_must_strip,target:velma_classic,targetStage:0=vain,Hey, ~player~, Barnette might understand the appeal of antiques, but <i>I</i> say stick with the fresh and new.
2-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,totalMales:1-3=interested,Jeez, you're terrified.  Maybe men <i>do</i> eat women's livers.
2-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,totalMales:1-3=confused,...Are men actually anything to be afraid of?  Sure, they're big and lumbering, but they seem kind of slow.
2-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,totalMales:1-3=bored,Calm down, would you?  Yeesh.  Maybe Mejare was right about men, considering the state they've got this girl in.
2-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,totalMales:1-3=teasing,Hey, I've dealt with my fair share of male soldiers.  They're nothing to be super afraid of...too stupid.
2-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:4=bored,...Maybe I should stop hitting on men.  Look what it does to you...
2-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:4=annoyed,Is this really what Earth women are like?  She's an outlier, right?
2-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:4=frustrated,Seems running the Harvest has a tendency to scramble Earth women's brains...and make them want to play poker.
2-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:4=bored,...At least she's losing quickly.  Easy to do when you barely check the cards.
2-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=stretching,...Yeah, we're gonna be here a while.  This girl's dressed for the vacuum of space.
2-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=interested,Does it really get that cold on Earth?  Or <i>anywhere</i>, for that matter?
2-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=interested,You're from Planet China, is that right?  Must be one big snowball if <i>that's</i> in vogue over there.
2-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=laughing,I understand why you must be so cold.  Your name is pretty close to <i>Meia</i>, after all.
2-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:1=seductive,Omigosh, Palutena, that gorgeous green hair is even longer than mine!  My <i>girlfriend</i> has green hair, you know.
2-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:1=vain,How do you <i>maintain</i> all that hair?  I have the best time washing mine...and wrapping my green-haired girlfriend in it.
2-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:1=seductive,You know who else has beautiful green hair, Miss Goddess?  My girlfriend, Barnette.  That sweet little thing is back on the ship!
2-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:1=stretching,So is that lovely green hair just the goddess's right?  My girlfriend got hers from standard Mejarian genetic trickery.
2-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:0=stretching,Shame you're not an <i>actual</i> pearl.  I could go for one of those...Mejare hardly has any.
2-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:0=smug,No animals on Mejare means no pearls.  If only you <i>were</i> one of those beauties...
2-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:0=bored,All stretched-out like that...you're not shaped like a pearl at all!  Shame, because I love those things.
2-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:0=vain,<i>Oh, to hold a real pearl in my hands</i>!  I've only seen pictures in Earth history books.
2-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Ooh, look, Meia.  Another Misty.  <i>Don't go falling in love with her, now</i>!
2-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,OK, Meia.  I know this girl's called Misty, but don't start trying to be <i>her</i> Big Sister, too.
2-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Don't tell anyone, but...<i>Meia's got a bit of a crush on a girl named Misty</i>.  Fair warning!
2-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=stretching,Gonna win over Meia's heart here?  You wouldn't be the first <i>Misty</i> to do it.
2-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:1=excited,Omigosh!  <i>Vriska</i>!  Do that thing again!  There's so much you could teach me about Earth fashion!
2-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:1=excited,<i>Vriiiska</i>!  I love fashion!  Show me more of your Earth outfits!
2-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:1=excited,Your wardrobe's so cool!  I only really have this dress!  You've got to show me what Earth girls wear!
2-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:1=excited,Yes!  Vriska's turn!  Show me what else Earth women wear!  I want it all!
2-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia,marker:planet-countries=smug,Where'd you say you were from?  Planet <i>Korea</i>?  Well then, it seems Korea and Mejare share a fashion sense...
2-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia,marker:planet-countries=teasing,You're a cutie, Miss Bodysuit, if a little on the short side.  Is that just how they make women over on Planet Korea?
2-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Well, everyone, cards on the table.  Who wears the whole bodysuit look better--D.Va or my miserable old boss here?
2-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,You're an adorable little thing, D.Va!  All wrapped up in that cute bodysuit, just like <i>another</i> pilot I know...who might be sitting here.
2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:3=awkward,Uh, Aimee?  Are you sure you want to keep doing that?  You nearly got hit last time...and your targets are getting smaller.
2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:3=shocked,Um, it's OK, Aimee!  You've been very impressive!  Just go out on top, you know?
2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:3=awkward,...Are you sure about this, Aimee?  After...last time?  Don't kill yourself...
2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:3=awkward,Uh--don't go all the way just for <i>my</i> sake.  What you did was cool, but, um...well, you'll be fine.
2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,count-meia:2=annoyed,Ugh, now there's <i>two</i> of you?  I guess ~player~ is a big fan of being rejected.
2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,count-meia:2=angry,<i>Two</i> Meias?  Hey, I've been hitting on you this entire time!  What's <i>she</i> done besides give you the cold shoulder?
2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,count-meia:2=annoyed,...You know, I put a lot of effort into my appearance.  Meia rolls out of bed, and <i>she's</i> the one to get two of her?
2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,count-meia:2=angry,Hey, what's this all about, ~player~?  You really think Meia's prettier than I am?
2-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:6=laughing,Even with all that, you're still forced to be naked?  It's official--you're totally into this.
2-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:6=teasing,Even with your little flower setup, dearie, I think you're out of options.  Cough up the good stuff--I'm convinced you want to.
2-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:6=vain,<i>That</i> ought to do it, unless you've got more of the plant kingdom at your disposal.  Isn't this what you wanted, playing this game?
2-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:6=seductive,Oh, I'm sure you're cute, dear--I remember your butt!  Besides...I seriously doubt this isn't turning you on.
2-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,<i>Oh, dear</i>.  I can see where <i>this</i> is going, Ice Queen.
2-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,<i>Flirting</i>, are we Meia?  I figured as much.  Best to let the lovebirds just figure things out on their own.
2-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,Meia, honey, you're just setting yourself up for disappointment.  Earth girls don't like each others' bodies the way <i>we</i> do.
2-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Ooh, you're so <i>cute</i> when a woman actually gets you going!  She'll deny it now, Chun, but Meia here is <i>totally</i> into you.
2-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=bored,Oh, for God's sake, Meia, don't go on a damn moral crusade.  She's kind of cute, isn't that enough?
2-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=frustrated,We barely know her or what Earth's military is like, Meia.  Don't start with your vendettas against authority.
2-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=bored,It wasn't Earth soldiers that shut down our living districts, Meia.  Cool it and try to have a nice time.
2-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=frustrated,Oh, don't start ragging on the poor girl like we understand the politics of this place.  Let's just all calm down and enjoy each others' breasts.
2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1=excited,Ooh!  Ooh!  Are you doing it again?  Do it again!
2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1=excited,Ooh, Aimee's turn!  Show us that trick again!
2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1=excited,Aimee!  You're so cool!  How do you shoot like that?  Do that trick again!
2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1=excited,Give us a <i>show</i>, girl!  That last time was incredible!
2-female_must_strip,target:tina,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=teasing,Planet <i>America</i>, hm?  Never heard of it--but it seems to have produced as least one knockout!
2-female_must_strip,target:tina,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=thinking,<i>Britain</i>, <i>Japan</i>, and now your <i>America</i>.  I'm starting to think these aren't actually planets...and Earth people are just very splintered.
2-female_must_strip,target:tina,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=teasing,Hey, now, Miss Wrestler...this place has a <i>no-touching</i> rule, even if Planet <i>America</i> doesn't.
2-female_must_strip,target:tina,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=vain,I don't know how they do things on Planet America, honey, but you keep your wrestling hands to yourself--I'm taken!
2-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:0=laughing,Nice look you've got going there, Miss Bodypaint.  The orange really contrasts nicely with the blue...skin.
2-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:0=laughing,Nice fruity complexion, honey.  Really matches your horns...and your one crazy eye.
2-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:0=smug,You seem surprised to have lost, dear...but you can complain about fate until you're blue in the face.
2-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:0=interested,What are you rolling that thing for?  Trying to pick a new color of body paint?
2-female_must_strip,target:mia,targetStage:0=vain,<i>My, my</i>!  You work in the <i>law</i>?  This old pirate better be careful around you.
2-female_must_strip,target:mia,targetStage:0=teasing,So you do something with the law, huh?  Think you could defend my murderous pirate self in a courtroom?
2-female_must_strip,target:mia,targetStage:0=vain,So what's a "lawyer" do all day?  Pushing papers around sounds dreadfully boring when you're a daredevil star pilot.
2-female_must_strip,target:mia,targetStage:0=laughing,I see you're quite well-endowed there, Miss Magistrate.  Is that how you win people over in your legal arguments?
2-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:5=smug,Well, that's that.  Do what you must behind those flowers.
2-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:5=interested,You can hide yourself with the flowers, honey, but you're naked, so that's a loss in my book.
2-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:5=smug,Nice try with the foliage, dear, but no one's going to call that clothing.  You're out.
2-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:5=stretching,<i>And so the frightened little princess falls before her betters.  Even the forest spirits couldn't save her</i>.
2-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:4=teasing,Hey, honey...take <i>my</i> dress, and I'll love you forever.
2-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:4=smug,Feel free to flatter me and steal my dress, dear!  It's...over there somewhere.
2-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:4=seductive,Say, Vriska...can that die steal <i>my</i> dress?  <i>Please</i> say yes.
2-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:4=vain,I'd <i>love</i> to see how my dress looks on someone else.  But I can't just let you try it on...so use the die.
2-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,count-d.va_cruiser:1=teasing,I don't even know you, girlie, but you seem dressed up for a special occasion all the same.  Feeling sexy today?
2-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,count-d.va_cruiser:1,marker:planet-countries=seductive,Hey, cutie.  Is it a holiday on planet Korea?  Because you look different from usual.
2-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,count-d.va_cruiser:1,marker:planet-countries=interested,This "Korea" planet of yours has got quite the range of fashion.  I <i>swear</i> I've seen you running around in something else.
2-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,count-d.va_cruiser:1=stretching,What's up, D.Va?  That's a cute outfit--but it doesn't seem quite like your usual fare.  What's the occasion?
2-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:5=teasing,Don't stop now, honey!  I hope I'm not imposing...but I'd <i>love</i> to hear some more French!
2-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:5=seductive,Your language is the absolute <i>coolest</i>, darling!  Say some more for me, if you don't mind...I hope I'm not being a burden.
2-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:5=teasing,I'm not demanding too much of you, am I, Marinette?  I just <i>love</i> your language...and this should take your mind off stripping.
2-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:5=vain,Normally I'm interested in women's tongues for <i>other</i> reasons...but with you, I can't get over how cool your language is!
2-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:5=seductive,I think I'm jealous, Marinette!  Not only are you the <i>cutest</i> little blueberry muffin of a girl, but your language is to <i>die</i> for!
2-female_must_strip,target:mileena,targetStage:0=smug,...OK, no one here has any right to call me skimpily-dressed with Bandages here running around.
2-female_must_strip,target:mileena,targetStage:0=stretching,What kind of sex-crazed planet considers that street clothes?  And here I thought Earth was conservative.
2-female_must_strip,target:mileena,targetStage:0=laughing,...Seems I've walking into a game that is well in progress.  Poor thing has been losing so badly!
2-female_must_strip,target:mileena,targetStage:0=laughing,Jeez.  I'm a <i>pirate</i>, and I can afford more clothing than you.  Too bad there's no money involved here.
2-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0=interested,What's up, cutie?  You look a little embarrassed to be here...which is funny, considering your choice of outfit.
2-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0=teasing,Yeah, not sure I'm buying this whole "I was tricked" act, dearie.  I mean, you <i>are</i> displaying your butt 24/7.
2-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0=teasing,Oh, don't act all embarrassed.  You've got hips to <i>die</i> for, cutie...and they're fully on display, even now.
2-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0=laughing,Ooh, you are just <i>adorable</i>!  Especially the way your figure is just <i>straining</i> against the bounds of that suit, <i>begging</i> to be free.
2-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=laughing,Ooh, a <i>lady</i> doctor!  The Nirvana's only doctor is a man--I wonder if he'd lose his cool with you gunning for his spot.
2-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=vain,Honestly, I'm torn!  You're a cute woman doctor--and <i>blonde</i>!  But our ship's doctor is a man with rather nice hair himself.
2-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=teasing,Ooh, a doctor from Earth!  I bet that makes you an <i>expert</i> on male sexuality, doesn't it?
2-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, a woman doctor is <i>just</i> what I've been looking for!  Think you could help me and Barnette get pregnant?
2-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=vain,Female <i>and</i> blonde...if only Duero were blond, then he'd be the perfect doctor for me.  So <i>handsome</i>...
2-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, Miss Medicine.  Since you're from Earth, I might have a few questions about men's tubes tonight.
2-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:5=frustrated,Oh God, she's finally doing it.  Be very afraid...unless you Earth people are used to this sort of thing.
2-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:5=frustrated,Please don't.  I've learned my lesson.  I'll stay on Mejare.
2-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:5=bored,I'm really appreciating Mejare right now.  Maybe I'll straighten up and get a normal job.
2-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:5=frustrated,This is the last time I come to Earth.  Even among Mejarian pirate scum, none of us act like this.
2-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:1=vain,Should've figured Little Miss Princess would want to break away and strip for strangers.  You must be so sheltered!
2-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:1=teasing,Oh, is it true you're a <i>princess</i>, darling?  That would explain the haughty attitude...and the phony embarrassment.
2-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:1=teasing,I'm a pirate, dearie...and no huge fan of authority figures.  Luckily, I <i>love</i> girls who strip for fun and pleasure.
2-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:1=interested,So you're a princess, is that it?  You should know you're not fooling me--you <i>love</i> being ogled, don't you?
2-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:1=interested,A princess, hm?  Only makes sense that such a public figure as yourself would love exhibiting her body for total strangers.
2-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=seductive,Omigosh, Meia, look!  <i>Another</i> spacefarer who recognizes the value of a bodysuit.  You should chat her up!
2-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,Blonde like me, suit like yours, from space like both of us!  This <i>Samus</i> covers all our bases, Meia.  Go flirt with her!
2-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,This woman's practically a Mejarian, between the spacey jumpsuit and gorgeous figure.  Go get her, Meia--she's got your sense of style!
2-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=seductive,Full jumpsuit, shapely behind, cute face, <i>from space</i>?  Meia, this girl is prime girlfriend material!  Now's the time!

3-male_human_must_strip=vain,Look this way while you do it, ~player~.  <i>Any</i> man can be interesting to me.
3-male_human_must_strip=laughing,What is it that makes men so fascinating?  The way they lumber around this delicate universe of ours?
3-male_human_must_strip=vain,Hibiki's so adorable.  I couldn't bring him here; he'd be all bent out of shape at this point.
3-male_human_must_strip=laughing,Stay sharp, ~player~.  You know, if men are capable of that.
3-male_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=teasing,You just pissed away your best chance to get me out of my dress...<i>or did you</i>?
3-male_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=laughing,To think that for a second there, I was actually <i>worried</i>...actually, I shouldn't have been regardless.
3-male_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=thinking,Damn, do I have any accessories left?  ...Wait, I <i>won</i>?
3-male_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=confused,<i>Good thing I still have my ch</i>--wait, what?
3-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=teasing,So, not to call you a harlot or anything, Misato, but you seem <i>awful</i> interested in these men...so am I.  How do you Earth girls get their attention?
3-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=confused,Ooh, you seem pretty confident around these Earth men, Misato.  From one woman to another, what's the secret to getting their attention?
3-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=confused,You seem to be doing a better job flirting with these Earth men, Misato.  Am I doing something wrong?  I always seem to scare them!
3-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=confused,Men just run away from me, usually...I thought they <i>like</i> being flirted with.  Misato, you seem to get them!
3-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rinkah,count-meia:1,count-corrin_f:1=smug,Hey, don't be rude to our little male friend here.  He's probably scared half to death, being around all these gorgeous women.
3-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rinkah,count-meia:1,count-corrin_f:1=laughing,Now, now, Rinkah.  That's no way to treat our lone man.  His little pea-brain can only handle so much stimulus.
3-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rinkah,count-meia:1,count-corrin_f:1=interested,Don't make fun, Rinkah.  At least he had the courage to come alone...or the stupidity.
3-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rinkah,count-meia:1,count-corrin_f:1=smug,It's not quite that dire.  Meia isn't exactly in a good mood, since I dragged her here.
3-male_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=vain,Didn't think a man had that kind of luck in him.  I mean, if men were lucky, they'd be born women.
3-male_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=teasing,I do know <i>one</i> smart man--Duero, our doctor.  And I'd say he's got better hair.
3-male_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=teasing,Hey hey.  For a second there, a <i>man</i> was giving me a run for my money.
3-male_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=seductive,Not bad at all.  I like looks, but maybe I'll have <i>your</i> baby so she's smart instead.
3-male_human_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:human,marker:human=teasing,Hey there, Handsome.  You've got a different look about you than everyone else...but I can't quite put my finger on how.
3-male_human_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:human,marker:human=seductive,Hi, Mr. Man...I've only met a few men before, so you're <i>very</i> exotic to me.  Won't you please show me your naked body?
3-male_human_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:human,marker:human=seductive,Hey, Darling.  You should know I come from a planet of <i>all</i> women...so you being a man makes me interested already.
3-male_human_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:human,marker:human=seductive,Is that you, ~player~?  You haven't said much so far...but you should know how exotic men are to me, and how much I want to learn about them.
3-male_human_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:human,marker:human=seductive,You'll show me a good time, won't you, Handsome?  <i>I'm looking for a strong, healthy man to give me a baby, you know</i>.
3-male_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=laughing,I know all my accessories are frustrating, ~player~, but do try to concentrate.
3-male_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=interested,Can't bear to go on after that sleeves trickery, huh?
3-male_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=smug,Tiny male brain all out of steam?  Don't worry, there's handsomer men in my life already.
3-male_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=seductive,Are you just doing this to appease me?  You're so sweet, ~player~!  I like you.
3-male_must_strip=vain,Look this way while you do it, ~name~.  <i>Any</i> man can be interesting to me.
3-male_must_strip=laughing,What is it that makes men so fascinating?  The way they lumber around this delicate universe of ours?
3-male_must_strip=vain,Hibiki's so adorable.  I couldn't bring him here; he'd be all bent out of shape at this point.
3-male_must_strip=laughing,Stay sharp, ~name~.  You know, if men are capable of that.
3-male_must_strip,target:shaggy,targetStage:0=bored,Uh...you're kind of tall, I guess, but it doesn't look like you wash yourself much.  Gross.
3-male_must_strip,target:shaggy,targetStage:0=annoyed,I know you're a man, but can't you put a <i>little</i> effort into your appearance?  You look like you just rolled out of a gutter.
3-male_must_strip,target:shaggy,targetStage:0=smug,"Shaggy," huh?  That'd be like if my nickname were "Gorgeous."  Actually, I'll have to propose that next flight practice...
3-male_must_strip,target:shaggy,targetStage:0=frustrated,Gangly, unshaven, all around a mess.  I'm starting to miss the clean-cut professionalism of the Tarakkian soldiers I know.
3-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=laughing,I see ~player~ has grown so desperate at the gender disparity in this game that they've turned to <i>Kool-Aid Man</i> for their fix.
3-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=annoyed,...Listen, ~player~, I get that this game doesn't have too many men, but you're better than this.  Pick a real character.
3-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=bored,Doesn't bode well for your opinion of me that you'd stick me with <i>this</i> idiot, ~player~.
3-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=awkward,...<i>Kool-Aid Man</i>, huh, ~player~?  That's...your choice?  Are you sure?
3-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=frustrated,<i>Kool-Aid Man</i>?  ...Do I <i>have</i> to keep playing?  If ~player~'s not gonna take this seriously, why should I?
3-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=interested,You're really starved for some male players, aren't you, ~player~?  Couldn't you pick, I don't know, Pit?  9S?  Come on.
3-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=annoyed,...What the hell am I looking at?  Forget playing against, just...<i>looking at</i>.
3-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=bored,...My beauty deserves better tablemates than this.
3-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=vain,On the female side of things, we have the most beautiful woman on the roster.  And on the male side of things, well...well.
3-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena,count-meia:1=teasing,You <i>work</i> for this woman, Pit?  Look at that, Meia...it must be <i>Take-Your-Boss-to-Strip</i> Day.
3-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena,count-meia:1=smug,Oh, wow, this woman is your boss?  I guess I have no room to talk, considering I brought Miss Ice Queen along for the ride.
3-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena,count-meia:1=teasing,Look, Meia, this cute little angel-boy brought his boss, too!  I guess he and I are both into taking our superiors down a peg.
3-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena,count-meia:1=smug,Well, what do you know?  Pit brought this boss here too, Meia.  Only ~player~ has any sense, it seems.
3-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=seductive,Omigosh, there's <i>two</i> of you girls?  Are you twins?  I heard Earth people could have matching babies called twins!
3-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=seductive,Ohh, you two ladies are so <i>adorable</i>!  One of you even cut your hair short, just like Meia does!
3-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=seductive,Well, what have we here?  Two cute little ladies dressed in matching armor sets?
3-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=confused,Wait, you're <i>both</i> named Corrin?  Look, girls, I know one's hair is short, but you should really dress different.
3-male_must_strip,target:captain_america,targetStage:0=teasing,Woah, talk about <i>hunk</i>!  I want to see what those muscles can do, sweetheart.
3-male_must_strip,target:captain_america,targetStage:0=seductive,<i>Well, now</i>!  You look like just the big ball of hunk I've been searching for, cutie.
3-male_must_strip,target:captain_america,targetStage:0=teasing,Tall, check--muscles, check--handsome, <i>check</i>!  Looks like I've found me a winner, and he hasn't even stripped yet.
3-male_must_strip,target:captain_america,targetStage:0=seductive,<i>Oooh</i>!  Look at <i>you</i>, handsome!  Just the sort of man I hoped to see here!
3-male_must_strip,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:0=smug,And I thought <i>I</i> was enthusiastic.  This man's blowing me out of the water.
3-male_must_strip,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:0=interested,Talk about bringing energy to the table.  Planning on winning this thing, or just shouting about it?
3-male_must_strip,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:0=laughing,Well, <i>someone's</i> a feisty one.  Hibiki's energetic, but you've got the body to match, hot stuff.
3-male_must_strip,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:0=confused,You're some kind of racecar driver or something?  Seems you're permanently amped-up from it.
3-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0=seductive,Well, what do we have here?  An adorable little cinnamon roll of a man, dressed up as an angel!
3-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0=seductive,You are just the cutest little man I've ever seen!  Hibiki's a little smaller, but he's got too much spunk to be cute.
3-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0=excited,Ohhh, you're so <i>cute</i>, Mr. Angel!  I could just <i>eat you up</i>!
3-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0=teasing,What's an adorable little man like you doing here, Pit?  Sure you want to strip nude in front of these scary, hulking women?
3-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:2=vain,I can't get over how cute you are, honey...but seriously, what's with the angel outfit?  Men are no angels.
3-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:2=smug,Men have always struck as more <i>beastly</i> than angelic...which is fine by me.  So why do you dress like one?
3-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:2=confused,So, uh, I read about angels as a girl, but they were always women.  Why are you dolled-up like one, anyway?
3-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:2=confused,Do those wings detach?  They look pretty convincing, and the rest of your angel outfit is pretty good.  Why do you have that on, anyway?
3-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=seductive,Well, aren't <i>you</i> cute!  And you're dressed in all that fancy armor.  What's your name, girlie?
3-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=seductive,You are just the most <i>adorable</i> thing, even in all that heavy armor.  Can't you take it off and show us what an Earth woman looks like?
3-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=seductive,You're cute, dear!  You've even cut your hair short like Meia does.  Women can pull that off sometimes!
3-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=laughing,A woman in armor?  You're after Meia's own heart, you sly little thing!  Too bad she isn't here.
3-male_must_strip,target:xander,targetStage:0=teasing,You're friends with that <i>Buffy</i> girl, right?  Well...<i>gonna seal the deal, or what</i>?
3-male_must_strip,target:xander,targetStage:0=interested,Well, you don't look so bad for a man.  Am I in competition with that Buffy woman?
3-male_must_strip,target:xander,targetStage:0=teasing,Not to be too forward or anything, but I'm on the prowl for a good man...for reasons you'll know soon enough.  Interested?
3-male_must_strip,target:xander,targetStage:0=vain,You're a pretty average-looking man.  I can live with that...but I bet they don't make women like <i>me</i> where you come from.
3-male_must_strip,target:kira,targetStage:0=teasing,Ooh, you're a handsome one...and blond, which is even better.  I see you eyeing me up...
3-male_must_strip,target:kira,targetStage:0=seductive,Hi there, sweetheart...what was your name again?  I forgot it when I got lost in your beautiful blond hair.
3-male_must_strip,target:kira,targetStage:0=seductive,I wasn't sure if men could pull off blonde hair the way women do...but you're living proof.  I'll keep my eye on you...
3-male_must_strip,target:kira,targetStage:0=seductive,Ah, <i>here's</i> what I've been looking for!  A handsome blond man.  <i>Try not to sweep me off my feet, darling</i>.
3-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:4=shocked,<i>Eep</i>!  O-oh, you <i>can</i> talk?  B-but...why didn't you?
3-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:4=interested,...So are you over your fear of women now?  Is that what the grunting was all about?
3-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:4=seductive,Oh, you <i>can</i> talk.  Did my beauty make you clam up, cutie?
3-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:4=smug,Well, that solves <i>that</i> mystery.  Come on and join us in the land of language like a civilized person.
3-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:4=smug,Oh, good, you can talk.  I had really lost all hope for men's intelligence for a while there.
3-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:4=shocked,<i>Ack</i>!  Wha--o-oh, you're done screaming!  Uh...OK.
3-male_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=teasing,You just pissed away your best chance to get me out of my dress...<i>or did you</i>?
3-male_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=laughing,To think that for a second there, I was actually <i>worried</i>...actually, I shouldn't have been regardless.
3-male_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=thinking,Damn, do I have any accessories left?  ...Wait, I <i>won</i>?
3-male_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=confused,<i>Good thing I still have my ch</i>--wait, what?
3-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:0=laughing,Wow, a <i>blindfold</i> at a table full of strangers?  I never knew men could be so...<i>depraved</i>.
3-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:0=interested,You're, uh, really making up for your stature with the fetish gear.  Can't look me in the eye, sweetheart?
3-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:0=interested,I knew men could be cowardly, but damn.  Even the <i>Tarakkians</i> I know can look a woman in the eye.
3-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:0=interested,So the blindfold's going first, right?  So you can actually read the cards from now on?
3-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:5=teasing,It's now or never, Little Dungeon Bot.  Going to look me in the eyes for once?
3-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:5=laughing,I spy with my little eye something you can still take off, Dungeon Robo.  That's because my eyes are uncovered.
3-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:5=interested,Sure you don't want to part with that blindfold, Mr. Robo-man?  Are you aware of the alternative, darling?
3-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:5=interested,Looks like Little Dungeon Bot is all out of dungeon items...well, except for the most striking one of all.
3-male_must_strip,target:fred,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, maybe I'll take <i>your</i> seed.  You're tall and handsome...and most importantly, you're blond.
3-male_must_strip,target:fred,targetStage:0=teasing,What's this, now?  You solve mysteries?  Solve this, honey...whose handsome blond seed am I seriously considering taking right now?
3-male_must_strip,target:fred,targetStage:0=laughing,Hi there, handsome blond man!  You look like you could use a woman at your side...or maybe on top of you.
3-male_must_strip,target:fred,targetStage:0=interested,Duero might have better hair, but yours is blond...that's definitely a plus where I come from.
3-male_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=teasing,So, not to call you a harlot or anything, Misato, but you seem <i>awful</i> interested in these men...so am I.  How do you Earth girls get their attention?
3-male_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=confused,Ooh, you seem pretty confident around these Earth men, Misato.  From one woman to another, what's the secret to getting their attention?

3-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,You're cute, dear!  Look, Meia, she even cut her hair short like you do!  Must be big on practicality, too.
3-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,A woman in armor?  Meia, this girl is trying to get on your good side...matching outfits like that.
3-male_must_strip,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=confused,Well, now!  There's bizarre specimens, and then there's you.  Are you a man or a woman?
3-male_must_strip,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=confused,I can't really pin down your sex, to be honest...or your species, for that matter.
3-male_must_strip,target:mettaton,targetStage:0,marker:fama_and_oma=vain,Weren't you made in a lab?  So were all Mejarians before our Famas carried us!  ...But I'm not sure if you're a woman.
3-male_must_strip,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=confused,Way to go ahead and be the ultimate test of judging men vs. women.  Gotta say, I'm stumped.
3-male_must_strip,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=confused,...Oh, you're one of those <i>ann-drazza-nuss</i> types, right?  That's the word?
3-male_must_strip,target:mettaton,targetStage:0,marker:fama_and_oma=confused,Mejarians get made in labs, too...but our Famas carry us.  So maybe you're a man, then?  Tarakkians are carried to term in labs...
3-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:2=smug,Hey, so what's with those "Neighbors" you keep talking about?  I mean, Mejare certainly doesn't get along with <i>its</i> neighbors.
3-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:2=seductive,Hey, Handsome, when you say you fight Neighbors, how big a scale are we talking?  Let's just say neighboring planet Tarak isn't our best friend.
3-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:2=interested,Who are these "Neighbors" you say you fight?  Is this like a front-lawn kind of dispute, or do you mean as a solider?
3-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:2=interested,Did you say you fight neighbors, darling?  Mejarians usually fight their neighbors over gardening, unless we're talking planets.
3-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=annoyed,<i>And who do we have he</i>--oh.  El Shaggy Blanco.  Great choice, ~player~.
3-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=frustrated,...You know, I put a lot of effort into having all these lines, and then you go and stick me with El Shaggy Blanco.
3-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=teasing,Thought I wouldn't have lines to April Fools' characters?  Well, think again, ~player~.
3-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=vain,Everyone give ~player~ a round of applause...they figured out how to use the offline version, as you can see.
3-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=annoyed,...I know you're proud of yourself for deciphering the offline version, ~player~, but you don't have to pick meme characters.
3-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=smug,Excellent character selection, ~player~.  You picked a joke that stopped being funny in 2017...whenever that was in Earth years.
3-male_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=laughing,I know all my accessories are frustrating, ~name~, but do try to concentrate.
3-male_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=interested,Can't bear to go on after that sleeves trickery, huh?
3-male_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=smug,Tiny male brain all out of steam?  Don't worry, there's handsomer men in my life already.
3-male_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=seductive,Are you just doing this to appease me?  You're so sweet, ~name~!  I like you.
3-male_must_strip,target:bi,targetStage:0=frustrated,...<i>Ew</i>.  What's wrong with your hands...and your <i>face</i>?
3-male_must_strip,target:bi,targetStage:0=annoyed,...I've got to be honest here.  You are <i>very</i> ugly...and I hate ugly things.
3-male_must_strip,target:bi,targetStage:0=annoyed,...Would it have killed you to wash yourself before coming here?  Or maybe not come at all?  I would've preferred that.
3-male_must_strip,target:bi,targetStage:0=angry,...OK, <i>ew</i>.  I wouldn't collect your seed if it meant they'd make me the Grand Ma for it.
3-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:1=interested,<i>Pod this, data that</i>...you talk like you're a machine.  Why the formality, dear?
3-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:1=interested,Why do you talk like you're a robot half the time, huh?  Loosen up and enjoy yourself--if men can do that, of course.
3-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:1=interested,Hey, what's with all your formal data-mechanics babble?  You sound like you just rolled off the factory line, dearie.
3-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:1=seductive,Are you so polite and deferent and robotlike because you're short?  Because the short man <i>I</i> know is a real fireball!
3-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:1=laughing,Hey, darling little boy...why so mechanical in waist and taste?  I know <i>Tarakkians</i> are made in factories, but <i>sheesh</i>.
3-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena=laughing,Wait, wait, wait.  You <i>work</i> for this woman?  Quite the little boss-employee bonding exercise.
3-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena=interested,Oh wow, you two <i>work</i> together?  I mean, Meia's my boss, but we at least went to different tables.
3-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena=vain,You take orders from this woman, Pit?  Men and women, working together...I see how Earth operates.
3-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena=laughing,<i>Well, now</i>!  You work for this woman...how very, very awkward, Mr. Angel.
3-male_must_strip,target:caleb,targetStage:0=confused,Oh look, a child-man.  What's the word--<i>boy</i>?  Anyway, I'm not gonna strip in front of a kid.
3-male_must_strip,target:caleb,targetStage:0=annoyed,Hey, kid, I know you're male, but can't you read?  No kids allowed.
3-male_must_strip,target:caleb,targetStage:0=annoyed,I'm gonna ignore the cat ears for a second and focus on how you look like you're twelve.  Beat it, kid, adults are trying to have fun here.
3-male_must_strip,target:caleb,targetStage:0=bored,...Listen, honey, we're playing a grown-up game for grown-ups.  You've got to leave...so I don't feel like a pedophile.
3-male_must_strip,target:caleb,targetStage:0=awkward,Hibiki's just short, but you...I don't think you're an adult.  Can't be sure with men, but still...
3-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:0=interested,So are you, uh, going to produce actual <i>words</i> at some point?  Or is grunting and yelling all I can expect from a man?
3-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:0=smug,...I mean, I tease men about being stupid, but <i>did</i> think they were capable of <i>speech</i>.
3-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:0=laughing,...It would seem men haven't quite evolved up to the point of grasping language.  What a shame.
3-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:0=laughing,...You're really showing me new lows for male intelligence, Link.  Grunt again if you agree.
3-male_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=vain,Didn't think a man had that kind of luck in him.  I mean, if men were lucky, they'd be born women.
3-male_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=teasing,I do know <i>one</i> smart man--Duero, our doctor.  And I'd say he's got better hair.
3-male_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=teasing,Hey hey.  For a second there, a <i>man</i> was giving me a run for my money.
3-male_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=seductive,Not bad at all.  I like looks, but maybe I'll have <i>your</i> baby so she's smart instead.
3-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, hey, hey--check out <i>this</i> handsome stud!  What brings <i>you</i> here, Mr. Cool-and-Casual?
3-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:0=teasing,You look like you're right at home, Mr. Lackadaisical.  You know what I like in my men?  <i>Handsomeness</i>...like yours.
3-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:0=seductive,Hey, Jacket-and-Pants.  You look a little sleepy, but I can't deny how you're making my heart beat faster.  What's your story?
3-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:0=seductive,I can't take my eyes off you, handsome, even if <i>yours</i> seem a little sleepy.  Mind telling me about yourself?
3-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:1=teasing,You've got to tell me more about yourself, Pit!  You're so darn shy...and I'm so <i>curious</i>!
3-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:1=seductive,Such a little motormouth, but it <i>alllll</i> clams up when I swing my gaze your way.  I love having this effect on cute little boys!
3-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:1=seductive,Come on, Mr. Angel, don't be shy!  I mean, it's cute, but I want to learn more about Earth men!
3-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:1=seductive,There's <i>so much</i> you could teach me about men, Pit...the men in my life always reject me.  And you're so nonthreatening!
3-male_must_strip,target:ryu,targetStage:0=laughing,Hey, hey, hey!  Talk about a hunk...and he's not even wearing much!  <i>Perfect</i>.
3-male_must_strip,target:ryu,targetStage:0=teasing,You look like you see a lot of physical action, hot stuff...can those big muscles toss me around?
3-male_must_strip,target:ryu,targetStage:0=laughing,A big hunk of a man with more muscles than brainpower?  Just what I've been looking for.
3-male_must_strip,target:ryu,targetStage:0=teasing,You seem a little clueless about this game, handsome.  Don't worry...<i>I'll guide you along</i>.
3-male_must_strip,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:0=confused,So "gay" is the Earth word for how Tarakkians live?  Actually, I'm not sure they even form couples there...
3-male_must_strip,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:0=smug,A man loving other men?  Well, if women can do it, I suppose men can...not that I really picture men capable of love.
3-male_must_strip,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:0=interested,Is this what man-on-man love does to your appearance?  Because you're a scary-looking customer.
3-male_must_strip,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:0=confused,You know, they taught me as a girl that men were monsters...you fit the part.  And apparently you don't like women, is that right?
3-male_must_strip,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:0=interested,If "gay" means what I think it does, I guess teasing you isn't going to get me anywhere...not that I <i>want</i> to see you naked.
3-female_human_must_strip=interested,Something got you down, ~player~?  Chin up.
3-female_human_must_strip=thinking,I'm trying to picture what my crewmates' outfits consist of, but they're not always easy to undress by sight.
3-female_human_must_strip=laughing,Just stay cool and collected, ~player~.  That's how the Anpathos women were--right up to their spines being harvested.
3-female_human_must_strip=vain,It's not your fault.  Just blame Lady Luck, that miserable old hag.
3-female_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=interested,Come on, ~player~, Mejarians like a challenge.  What would the Earthlings back home think?
3-female_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=vain,Don't let your jealousy just make you throw in the towel, ~player~.  All women can be beautiful!
3-female_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=teasing,Hey, you can still win...against everyone but me.
3-female_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=vain,Don't just drop the ball.  A pilot demands excellence of herself at all times!
3-female_human_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:human,marker:human=teasing,I come from a world of all women, so you're nothing special to me.  But you <i>are</i> very cute, so I've got my eye on you, Missy.
3-female_human_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:human,marker:human=seductive,And who's <i>this</i> tight-lipped specimen?  "~player~"?  If you say so...<i>cutie</i>.
3-female_human_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:human,marker:human=seductive,Yet another woman?  Like a drop in the bucket for a Mejarian...but even still, you're <i>far</i> cuter than I expected for an Earth girl.
3-female_human_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:human,marker:human=seductive,You're a little more simply-dressed than the exotic types that seem to frequent this place, myself included.  But you sure have a cute face!
3-female_human_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:human,marker:human=vain,And who are <i>you</i>,~player~?  You've barely said a thing...but you can admire my beauty too, if you want!
3-female_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=teasing,Can't get complacent, ~player~.  I've got quite a few layers left.
3-female_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=teasing,Nothing like breaking those streaks.  Stun the enemy and go for the kill!
3-female_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=smug,Not feeling so confident anymore?  Women have to keep their composure if they want to keep up with those bestial men.
3-female_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=teasing,Don't let the loss of your streak rattle you, dear.  Got to grab Lady Luck by the arm and <i>twist</i>!
3-female_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=teasing,You just pissed away your best chance to get me out of my dress...<i>or did you</i>?
3-female_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=laughing,To think that for a second there, I was actually <i>worried</i>...actually, I shouldn't have been regardless.
3-female_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=thinking,Damn, do I have any accessories left?  ...Wait, I <i>won</i>?
3-female_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=confused,<i>Good thing I still have my ch</i>--wait, what?
3-female_must_strip=interested,Something got you down, ~name~?  Chin up.
3-female_must_strip=thinking,I'm trying to picture what my crewmates' outfits consist of, but they're not always easy to undress by sight.
3-female_must_strip=laughing,Just stay cool and collected, ~name~.  That's how the Anpathos women were--right up to their spines being harvested.
3-female_must_strip=vain,It's not your fault.  Just blame Lady Luck, that miserable old hag.
3-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=stretching,...Yeah, we're gonna be here a while.  This girl's dressed for the vacuum of space.
3-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=interested,Does it really get that cold on Earth?  Or <i>anywhere</i>, for that matter?
3-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=interested,You're from Planet China, is that right?  Must be one big snowball if <i>that's</i> in vogue over there.
3-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=laughing,I understand why you must be so cold.  Your name is pretty close to <i>Meia</i>, after all.
3-female_must_strip,target:seven,targetStage:0=teasing,Seems bodysuits are more popular among spacegoers than even <i>I</i> figured.  Works for me--I like your figure.
3-female_must_strip,target:seven,targetStage:0=seductive,<i>My, my, honey</i>!  You've got some interesting decorations, but that suit is making me fall in love already.
3-female_must_strip,target:seven,targetStage:0=vain,I really ought to try out one of those bodysuits myself...or maybe stuff Barnette in one.  They're just so <i>revealing</i>!
3-female_must_strip,target:seven,targetStage:0=vain,Those jumpsuits really are the best, especially when you're in low gravity.  The enemy should know how beautiful you are!
3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:5=frustrated,Oh God, she's finally doing it.  Be very afraid...unless you Earth people are used to this sort of thing.
3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:5=frustrated,Please don't.  I've learned my lesson.  I'll stay on Mejare.
3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:5=bored,I'm really appreciating Mejare right now.  Maybe I'll straighten up and get a normal job.
3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:5=frustrated,This is the last time I come to Earth.  Even among Mejarian pirate scum, none of us act like this.
3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=vain,No jokes here, darling!  We're one hundred percent <i>alien</i>...if you define "alien" as "not from Earth."
3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=seductive,We <i>are</i> from another planet, honey!  We're fearless Mejarian pirates...and we've come <i>all this way</i> to learn about Earth.
3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=vain,Yep, just two exotic women from another world!  So we stuck together, since we can only trust each other around here.
3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=teasing,We're pirates from Mejare, darling, and all we know about Earth is that men and women live together here!  Which sounds strange to us.
3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=seductive,That's right, Elizabeth--Meia and I are from another world!  And we're stripping here--<i>that's how much we trust each other</i>.
3-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0=smug,And here I thought I was on Earth.  Turns out we've got a woman from a frozen tundra planet, evolved for camouflage.
3-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0=teasing,You look like you're in pretty good shape, honey.  And even better, I bet sweat blends right in to your marble complexion!
3-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0=vain,I'll be frank--you wouldn't catch me dead exercising.  It's so much work, and look at what it's done to this poor woman's skin!
3-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0=stretching,<i>Fitness this</i>, <i>exercise that</i>.  Why should I take advice from a woman who's apparently never seen sunlight?
3-female_must_strip,target:penny,targetStage:0=smug,Looks like we've found an Earth girl who's just decided to embrace the whole "boring conservatism" stereotype.  At least your hair is a fiery red.
3-female_must_strip,target:penny,targetStage:0=teasing,That fiery red hair contrasts your rather plain outfit.  But it's not a bad look overall!
3-female_must_strip,target:penny,targetStage:0=vain,<i>Finally</i>, a normal-looking Earth girl.  I need a measuring stick to compare all these superpowered weirdos to...all you've got is that red hair.
3-female_must_strip,target:penny,targetStage:0=seductive,Good, a civilian girl.  So many people at this bar are such colorful characters--oh, but your hair is pretty vibrant, I guess.
3-female_must_strip,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:0=interested,...Can I maybe just call you "DMG" for short?  Because <i>Dark Magician Girl</i> is a hell of a mouthful.
3-female_must_strip,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:0,marker:fama_and_oma=confused,...Don't you have an actual name?  You know, like the one your Fama gives you?
3-female_must_strip,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:0=teasing,You've really got to give yourself a snappier nickname, dearie...men aren't bright enough to remember that many words.
3-female_must_strip,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:0=stretching,If you really <i>are</i> a magician, color me interested...but that clunky name could use a shortening or two.
3-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:1=awkward,So, Miss Kitty, you, uh, going to shave your bottom fur now?  ...I'd like that.
3-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:1=frustrated,Knowing that that's fur now makes me <i>really</i> want to see you shaved...Mejare likes shaving.
3-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:1=bored,Is the bottom fur going now?  Because I <i>hate</i> hair...except on the head.
3-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:1=bored,Please tell me you're shaving everything else.  That's sort of the style on Mejare, so it's what I know.
3-female_must_strip,target:velma,targetStage:0=teasing,It's a rare woman who can pull off the glasses look, you know.  Parfet landed herself a man...how about <i>you</i>, Miss Mystery?
3-female_must_strip,target:velma,targetStage:0=stretching,I know a glasses-wearing egghead myself...Parfet's her name, and what she looks like with them off is the <i>real</i> mystery.
3-female_must_strip,target:velma,targetStage:0=laughing,Hey, Miss Mystery...can you solve how to make glasses look good on a woman?  Here's the answer: <i>give them to me</i>.
3-female_must_strip,target:velma,targetStage:0=vain,So, you solve mysteries, is that right?  I guess the glasses would help there...think you could solve the mystery of this <i>alien woman</i>?
3-female_must_strip,target:velma,targetStage:0=interested,Hey, Miss Mystery.  Push those frames up and answer a few questions...because <i>men</i> are a mystery to me.
3-female_must_strip,target:dawn,targetStage:0=confused,What'd you say you raised?  Those little <i>Poker</i>--whatevers?  Is that why you're playing this game?
3-female_must_strip,target:dawn,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, dearie, that exotic blue hair will take you further than weird animal training--you should be a model for shampoo or something.
3-female_must_strip,target:dawn,targetStage:0=confused,Mejare has barely any animals at all, so this whole "pokey-mon" thing is lost on me.  And they just do whatever you say?
3-female_must_strip,target:dawn,targetStage:0=laughing,So could you train <i>men</i> the way you do these <i>poker</i>-whatevers?  Because <i>that</i> would be quite interesting...
3-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0=interested,What's up, cutie?  You look a little embarrassed to be here...which is funny, considering your choice of outfit.
3-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0=teasing,Yeah, not sure I'm buying this whole "I was tricked" act, dearie.  I mean, you <i>are</i> displaying your butt 24/7.
3-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0=teasing,Oh, don't act all embarrassed.  You've got hips to <i>die</i> for, cutie...and they're fully on display, even now.
3-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0=laughing,Ooh, you are just <i>adorable</i>!  Especially the way your figure is just <i>straining</i> against the bounds of that suit, <i>begging</i> to be free.
3-female_must_strip,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0=teasing,Totally devoted to scarlet, eh?  It certainly gets the heart racing...<i>and my appetite stirred</i>.
3-female_must_strip,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0=vain,Maybe <i>I</i> should get a fanciful nickname like Scarlet Witch...but not if it means restricting myself to one measly color.
3-female_must_strip,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0=seductive,What do you think would be a good nickname for me, dear?  <i>The Black Pirate</i>?  I can't pull off all-red like you do.
3-female_must_strip,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0=stretching,I wonder if all-red would look good on me.  I'm a pirate--I don't exactly have my pick of the litter with clothes!
3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:1=awkward,Again?  You're flustered, Meia.  Calm down...you're never like this.
3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:1=awkward,Never seen you this worked up...it's really weird.
3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:1=awkward,To see you lose composure a little...makes me appreciate how you don't do it often.
3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1=excited,Ooh!  Ooh!  Are you doing it again?  Do it again!
3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1=excited,Ooh, Aimee's turn!  Show us that trick again!
3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1=excited,Aimee!  You're so cool!  How do you shoot like that?  Do that trick again!
3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1=excited,Give us a <i>show</i>, girl!  That last time was incredible!
3-female_must_strip,target:faye,targetStage:0=smug,Beautiful hair, makeup, spacefaring?  With <i>both</i> of us running around, this table's going to get sick of the archetype.
3-female_must_strip,target:faye,targetStage:0=laughing,Do we have a fellow star-crossing seductress on our hands?  I'm not sure there's enough meat for both of us.
3-female_must_strip,target:faye,targetStage:0=teasing,<i>Hey, good-lookin'.</i>  Trying to steal my thunder with the "seductress-from-space" angle?  I don't mind--<i>I like women, too</i>.
3-female_must_strip,target:faye,targetStage:0=seductive,You didn't doll yourself up like that just to please some <i>men</i>, did you?  Come show this fellow spacefarer what you can do.
3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:1=shocked,What's next, Ocean Girl?  You shir--<i>I was kidding</i>!
3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:1=shocked,I imagine the shirt is ne--<i>wait, no, I was just joking</i>!
3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:1=annoyed,...You're not serious?  I'm telling you, you have to <i>tease</i> a little!
3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:1=bored,...Ocean Girl's a total idiot.  Just stripping nude right off the bat...way to miss the point.
3-female_must_strip,target:elaine,targetStage:0=seductive,And what do we have here?  An <i>Earth</i> pirate?  And with a sword, to boot!  Interesting...
3-female_must_strip,target:elaine,targetStage:0=teasing,I see even Earth pirates understand the subtle elegance of a blade!  And you've got some <i>luxurious</i> hair yourself.
3-female_must_strip,target:elaine,targetStage:0=seductive,Oho--a fellow pirate?  I'd absolutely <i>love</i> to have a drink later--maybe you could teach me how to handle my sword better.
3-female_must_strip,target:elaine,targetStage:0=seductive,<i>Well, now</i>!  You Earth pirates don't dress like we do on Mejare--but your choice of weapon isn't too far off.  Can you show me around?
3-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:2=teasing,I'm <i>waiting</i>, Vriska!  Don't disappoint me and pick some boring outfit!
3-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:2=teasing,I'm expecting some good fashion from you, you know!  Don't leave it up to chance!
3-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:2=smug,Don't you have some way to control that?  I'd rather you showed off something specific.
3-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:2=teasing,Lay the fashion on me, Vriska!  Fashion from...wherever it is that you live.
3-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:0=stretching,And they say <i>men</i> are tall!  You're enough woman for the whole table, sweetie.
3-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:0=smug,You said you don't get out much?  Guess men like short women...that makes things awkward for me.
3-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:0=smug,You know, I tend to turn heads with my height alone.  Better not invite <i>you</i> to the ship, or you'll steal my thunder.
3-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:0=seductive,From what I know of men, you're as tall as one...and built like them, too.  Don't worry, you wear it well--so does Gascogne!
3-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:0=teasing,Hibiki's a teenie-weenie man I know.  I guess you represent the opposite end of the spectrum on both counts.
3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=teasing,Would you look at that?  My boss is finally joining the party.
3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=teasing,Good on you, Meia!  I knew you couldn't resist stripping forever.  This is too much fun!
3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=laughing,Heh.  You're as resilient as ever, Meia.  But I tagged you!
3-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey there, Miss Gunslinger!  You're not gonna <i>fire</i> those things, are you?  My girlfriend collects those sorts of guns.
3-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=seductive,Omigosh, are those antique men's kinetic weapons?  My girlfriend collects them!  You should meet her.
3-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=seductive,Always good to see an armed woman!  My girlfriend, Barnette, is totally obsessed with men's mechanical guns like yours.
3-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=vain,Hey, Miss Gunslinger!  You should lighten up a little and show those men's kinetic guns to my girlfriend.  She's a total connoisseur.
3-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=teasing,I like the grace of Mejarian laser rings myself, but you want some serious interest on those men's guns of yours?  Talk to my girlfriend.
3-female_must_strip,target:lux,targetStage:0=laughing,A covert agent, eh?  I guess if an alien woman knows that, you've already failed at your job.
3-female_must_strip,target:lux,targetStage:0=teasing,So what are you so <i>covert</i> about, Miss Agent?  We pirates just charge in and gun the place down before they know what hit them!
3-female_must_strip,target:lux,targetStage:0=interested,What kind of covert agent fights with light?  You know, the thing that makes your position <i>clearer</i>?
3-female_must_strip,target:lux,targetStage:0=smug,Oho--we've got an <i>agent</i> on our hands.  Wouldn't be the first we had on our ship--and we made her come around to our side.
3-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0=excited,Ooh, Sei, you're such a cutie!  You look <i>just like</i> my squadron leader, Meia--that short blue hair is to <i>die</i> for!
3-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0=teasing,Short blue hair and shoulder armor?  You're the spitting image of my boss, Sei--too bad she's at another table!
3-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0=seductive,Short blue hair?  Omigosh, Sei, my boss Meia looks <i>just like</i> you!  And she could really use a girlfriend.
3-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0=seductive,Sei!  That's your name, right?  You look like my boss Meia with that short-cut blue hair.  Your eyes are a lot softer, though.
3-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0=excited,Omigosh!  <i>Omigosh</i>!  You are just the <i>cutest</i> little thing, Nagisa!  You're practically a little girl--who forced you to be here?
3-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0=seductive,<i>Ohhhh</i>, you're the most adorable little cinnamon roll of a girl, Nagisa!  Who rolled you in sugar before forcing you to come here?
3-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0=seductive,<i>You're such a sweet little thing, Nagisa</i>!  My heart melts every time you stammer.  Did you lose a bet to be here?
3-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0=seductive,How'd this sugary-sweet cutie in a school uniform end up in this seedy place?  I just want to <i>squeeze</i> you, not strip you!
3-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0=seductive,And I thought Earth girls were cold-blooded organ harvesters.  You couldn't harvest a <i>plant</i>, cutie!  How'd you get here?
3-female_must_strip,target:evie,targetStage:0=vain,So what's your story?  You can cast magic spells or something?  If it's true, sign me up--it'll be another wonderful thing about me!
3-female_must_strip,target:evie,targetStage:0=vain,Some might call my <i>beauty</i> magical...I'm inclined to agree.
3-female_must_strip,target:evie,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, honey.  Cast a spell on <i>me</i>...one that makes me even prettier.  Now <i>that</i> would be magic!
3-female_must_strip,target:evie,targetStage:0=interested,Alright, I've seen enough crazy Paksis-magic to believe your tales.  But why don't you put your money where your mouth is?
3-female_must_strip,target:elena,targetStage:0=teasing,Little Miss Princess wants to play strip poker, does she?  Well, I hope you don't mind if this nasty pirate holds you hostage.
3-female_must_strip,target:elena,targetStage:0=laughing,Looking a little out of your element, Miss Blueblood.  Gonna prove that you're really better than the rest of us like your title implies?
3-female_must_strip,target:elena,targetStage:0=smug,Look at Miss Princess, lugging around a scepter just to prove she's better than the peons.  We'll see how you enjoy stripping down like us.
3-female_must_strip,target:elena,targetStage:0=annoyed,Royals really get on my nerves, you know...mostly because I'm <i>not</i> one, despite actually being better-looking.
3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>Well, howdy, pardner, how d'ya</i>--do...
3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:0=shocked,What are you lugging that big men's gun around for--<i>ack</i>!
3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:0=shocked,Well, aren't <i>you</i> spunky!  You even brought a model g--<i>eek</i>!
3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:0=shocked,Uh...where are you pointing that thing?  Are you--wait--<i>eek!  Don't</i>!
3-female_must_strip,target:lilith,targetStage:0=vain,Planet <i>Pandora</i>, was it?  What a lovely name!  I might have to retire there with my darling Barnette when we're older.
3-female_must_strip,target:lilith,targetStage:0=vain,Pandora sounds like such a <i>gorgeous</i> name.  I think I'll call my first daughter that--surely Barnette won't mind.
3-female_must_strip,target:lilith,targetStage:0=teasing,Barnette and I are <i>always</i> discussing baby names.  Pandora sounds positively wonderful!
3-female_must_strip,target:lilith,targetStage:0=teasing,A hunter, eh?  And what do hunters hunt on lovely little Pandora--a cute name, by the way.
3-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:0=laughing,Hey, Kitty-cat.  You're supposed to strip <i>during</i> the game, not <i>before</i> it.
3-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:0=interested,Nice Halloween costume, Kitty, but maybe you should have picked something a little more complex for this game.
3-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:0=smug,Not too interested in winning, huh, Kitty-cat?  Unless you've brought some yarn-balls you plan on counting.
3-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:0=smug,I only know about cats from Mejare's zoos...they only showed the females, of course.  But they were definitely more covered than <i>you</i> are.
3-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_playing_with_boys=smug,Oh, don't worry about men so much.  They're too clumsy and oafish to make use of all that strength.
3-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_playing_with_boys,marker:nagisa-tubes=interested,I really thought Earth women would be pretty comfortable around men.  Don't you have them shove their tubes into you on a regular basis?
3-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_playing_with_boys=interested,Aren't you used to men ogling and clawing at you?  I thought Earth women do that with them all the time.
3-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_playing_with_boys=stretching,You're so damn shy around these men.  Listen, I fight a whole planet of the toughest men around.  They're all talk.
3-female_must_strip,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=seductive,Oh?  And what do we have here, besides the most adorably shy little woman I've ever seen?
3-female_must_strip,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=stretching,Such a cutie...and in a traditional-looking dress!  Hard to believe someone so shy would even be here.
3-female_must_strip,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=seductive,Something wrong, honey?  <i>You've hardly been looking me in the eye</i>.  It's OK, I don't bite.
3-female_must_strip,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=vain,Why so shy, Elizabeth?  Confidence makes women ten times as beautiful--just look at me!
3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:4=bored,...Maybe I should stop hitting on men.  Look what it does to you...
3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:4=annoyed,Is this really what Earth women are like?  She's an outlier, right?
3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:4=frustrated,Seems running the Harvest has a tendency to scramble Earth women's brains...and make them want to play poker.
3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:4=bored,...At least she's losing quickly.  Easy to do when you barely check the cards.
3-female_must_strip,target:navi,targetStage:0=laughing,...Yeah, I can see why you'd be comfortable here.  We'd need a computer scan to find your vagina.
3-female_must_strip,target:navi,targetStage:0=interested,You know, I tease Earth girls about growing up all small, but <i>wow</i>.  Now I just feel bad.
3-female_must_strip,target:navi,targetStage:0=smug,At least you've got those wings to buzz around to <i>our</i> height.  Inferiority complex, sweetie?
3-female_must_strip,target:navi,targetStage:0=bored,Well, there goes any chance of getting a <i>good look</i> at what Earth girls have got.  You <i>are</i> from Earth, right?
3-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=confused,...You're not from Earth either, are you?  ...Or human.  Or cute.
3-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=confused,Say, Miss, I couldn't help but notice your...eye.  What planet are you from, exactly?
3-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=awkward,And here I thought I'd be seeing some <i>Earth</i> women in this place...or that I'd be the most exotic one.
3-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=laughing,Always nice to look a woman in the eye.  Singular.
3-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=smug,I guess they don't value depth perception on whatever planet you're from.  You must be a real steal.
3-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=interested,Magno Vivan's pirates accept all women...but with depth perception like yours, you wouldn't make it as a pilot.
3-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0,count-ruby_v4:1=interested,Looking a little different there, Ruby.  Brighter, in fact.  Something bring up the mood where you're from?
3-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0,count-ruby_v4:1=smug,I see you've been mixing up the colors, sweetie.  Not a bad approach, but I'm totally in love with this dress just as it is.
3-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0,count-ruby_v4:1=stretching,Mixing up the outfits, are we?  I've cultivated a certain look with my crewmates I'd rather just maintain.
3-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0,count-ruby_v4:1=vain,Hey, check out the new style Ruby's rocking.  Not bad, but I'm the kind of girl to just stick with what I know best!
3-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=bored,<i>Yeesh</i>.  Meia, I'm sorry I ever called you miserable.  Next to this girl, you're a field of sunflowers.
3-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,I'm glad we came here, boss.  Miss Blueberry over here has given me a new appreciation for your sense of humor.
3-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=bored,Jeez, I've at least <i>seen</i> you smile, Meia.  I don't think this girl <i>has</i> those muscles.
3-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,At least you have your face on display, Leader.  This girl's both miserable <i>and</i> refuses to show it.
3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:2=interested,Honey, you'd be better off putting some meat on your bones than trying desperately to show them off.
3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:2=bored,Sweetie, you're a twig.  This is just unhealthy...as unhealthy as you look.
3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:2=confused,Are you suffering from this "anorexia" I keep reading about?  Eating disorders?  Do men do this to you?
3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:2=vain,Talk about needing a girlfriend.  See what happens when you're never validated?
3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=seductive,<i>Oooh</i>!  Even ~player~ realizes how beautiful I am--enough to add a clone!  You're so <i>adorable</i>.
3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=laughing,Hey, what's this all about, ~player~?  Did I keep on winning, and you wanted to see me naked <i>that</i> badly?
3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=vain,Would you look at that?  My beauty was so enticing that ~player~ figured out the offline version just to add more of me.
3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=vain,Earth's cloning technology is well underway!  And ~player~ picked the <i>perfect</i> specimen, I must say.
3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=vain,I never thought ~player~ could manage to flatter me, and then they go and pick <i>two</i> of me!  Good show.
3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=laughing,<i>My, my, ~player~</i>.  You <i>really</i> like the look of me.
3-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:0=excited,Ohhh, you're so <i>cute</i>!  Draped in a loose-fitting shirt...and those <i>pigtails</i>!  I just wanna squeeze you!
3-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:0=excited,There's something about pigtails on a girl that just make me want to squeeze her even more...you're so <i>adorable</i>!
3-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:0=teasing,So, honey...<i>do men like to yank on those pigtails</i>?  It's OK, you can tell me--I'm not from around here.
3-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:0=seductive,You look like you've taken your first step into womanhood...and no more than that, with too-big clothes and adorable little pigtails!
3-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=smug,Dull that edge, honey.  We're all just trying to have a good time here, stripping naked for complete strangers.
3-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=vain,You're a fiery one, Miss Edge.  A lot like my <i>darling</i> Barnette!  So I don't mind.
3-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=laughing,That red streak in your hair should've tipped us off that you'd be all angry.  Maybe feeling the breeze on your breasts will cheer you up.
3-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=vain,You know what warms me up to others, Miss Edge?  Shaking my breasts around for them--<i>they always appreciate that</i>!
3-female_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=teasing,Can't get complacent, ~name~.  I've got quite a few layers left.
3-female_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=teasing,Nothing like breaking those streaks.  Stun the enemy and go for the kill!
3-female_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=smug,Not feeling so confident anymore?  Women have to keep their composure if they want to keep up with those bestial men.
3-female_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=teasing,Don't let the loss of your streak rattle you, dear.  Got to grab Lady Luck by the arm and <i>twist</i>!
3-female_must_strip,target:mia,targetStage:0=vain,<i>My, my</i>!  You work in the <i>law</i>?  This old pirate better be careful around you.
3-female_must_strip,target:mia,targetStage:0=teasing,So you do something with the law, huh?  Think you could defend my murderous pirate self in a courtroom?
3-female_must_strip,target:mia,targetStage:0=vain,So what's a "lawyer" do all day?  Pushing papers around sounds dreadfully boring when you're a daredevil star pilot.
3-female_must_strip,target:mia,targetStage:0=laughing,I see you're quite well-endowed there, Miss Magistrate.  Is that how you win people over in your legal arguments?
3-female_must_strip,target:kim,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, nice and simple fashion is always a treat to see.  I have a crewmate who bares her stomach just like you do!
3-female_must_strip,target:kim,targetStage:0=laughing,Hey, girlie.  I hope your stomach isn't feeling too vulnerable, all exposed next to the alien lady's rapier.
3-female_must_strip,target:kim,targetStage:0=teasing,Feeling confident, dear?  With a name like Pissible and a belly that vulnerable, you <i>must</i>.
3-female_must_strip,target:kim,targetStage:0=teasing,<i>Save the world</i>, huh?  Well, dearie, you and your little midriff should know I'm not <i>from</i> this world.
3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,count-meia:2=annoyed,Ugh, now there's <i>two</i> of you?  I guess ~player~ is a big fan of being rejected.
3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,count-meia:2=angry,<i>Two</i> Meias?  Hey, I've been hitting on you this entire time!  What's <i>she</i> done besides give you the cold shoulder?
3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,count-meia:2=annoyed,...You know, I put a lot of effort into my appearance.  Meia rolls out of bed, and <i>she's</i> the one to get two of her?
3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,count-meia:2=angry,Hey, what's this all about, ~player~?  You really think Meia's prettier than I am?
3-female_must_strip,target:neo,targetStage:0=laughing,My, you Earth girls have so much on your minds!  And it's apparently content to stay there.
3-female_must_strip,target:neo,targetStage:0=interested,So, Miss Motormouth, how's life?  Or the weather?  Or your family?  Or <i>anything</i>?
3-female_must_strip,target:neo,targetStage:0=teasing,I guess you're too tiny to fit a voice box in the model.  Don't feel bad--you're quite expressive, dear.
3-female_must_strip,target:neo,targetStage:0=vain,I guess I'm doing enough talking for the both of us.  And hey--that adorable two-toned hair is a statement unto itself!
3-female_must_strip,target:kimberly,targetStage:0=confused,Hey, so, uh, normally I'd tease you or something, but what was with that big lightshow from you earlier?
3-female_must_strip,target:kimberly,targetStage:0=confused,Wait, weren't you wearing pink a little while ago?  Like, a full suit?  Was that lightshow back there <i>you</i>?
3-female_must_strip,target:kimberly,targetStage:0=shocked,Hey, who's the new girl?  And where'd that pink-suit-wearing woman go after she flashed away?  Wait, was that <i>you</i>?
3-female_must_strip,target:kimberly,targetStage:0=angry,Hey, aren't you the one who half-blinded us all a little bit ago?  Where'd your suit go?  I thought it was cool, so start talking.
3-female_must_strip,target:riva,targetStage:0=smug,You should know I'm not a fan of princesses, Miss Magician.  But <i>blonde</i> ones?  ...I might yield a little.
3-female_must_strip,target:riva,targetStage:0=stretching,Maybe all it takes is some blonde hair to warm me up to the idea of royalty...or magic.
3-female_must_strip,target:riva,targetStage:0=vain,Don't feel bad about your unearned title, Miss Princess.  I hear you can perform magic--and alongside blonde hair, I'd say you're alright in my book.
3-female_must_strip,target:riva,targetStage:0=vain,Little Miss Magician is a <i>princess</i>, as well?  Well, against my pirate nature, I think I'll let a fellow blonde be on her way.
3-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0=excited,Ooh!  Ooh!  You're the one who's with a woman, right?  You some kind of Mejarian envoy to Earth?
3-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0=thinking,You're with a woman, isn't that right?  Maybe Mejare was just aping what Earthlings came up with first...
3-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0=interested,So, you're the one showing these poor Earth girls the Mejarian way, right?  That they don't need men to be happy?  Good job.
3-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0=vain,<i>Finally</i>, an Earth woman who's realized how much better other women's bodies are.  We should gossip about our girlfriends later.
3-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0,marker:fama_and_oma=smug,So, Miss Mejarian-style, are you going to be the Fama, or is your ladyfriend?  My Barnette's far too cute to carry babies herself.
3-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, cutie!  You look a little wide-eyed and naive to be here...but those bullets suggest otherwise.
3-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0=stretching,I've got my eye on you, Miss Ruby-Red.  I know better than to trust a cute girl with ammo clips on her belt.
3-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0=vain,You know who else is a cute girl with a little ammo on the side?  My girlfriend, Barnette.  And if you're anything like her, I better not get you angry.
3-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0=seductive,The black-and-red outfit is a winner, honey--very intimidating!  So's that ammo.  Guess you need to balance out your cute face.
3-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=seductive,Omigosh, Meia, look!  <i>Another</i> spacefarer who recognizes the value of a bodysuit.  You should chat her up!
3-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,Blonde like me, suit like yours, from space like both of us!  This <i>Samus</i> covers all our bases, Meia.  Go flirt with her!
3-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,This woman's practically a Mejarian, between the spacey jumpsuit and gorgeous figure.  Go get her, Meia--she's got your sense of style!
3-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=seductive,Full jumpsuit, shapely behind, cute face, <i>from space</i>?  Meia, this girl is prime girlfriend material!  Now's the time!
3-female_must_strip,target:kurumu,targetStage:0=laughing,Hey there, short stuff!  Seems all your height went into your chest--those things are even bigger than mine!
3-female_must_strip,target:kurumu,targetStage:0=interested,You hogging all the nutrients on this planet, Miss Vampire?  You're the only Earth girl I've seen that outdoes <i>my</i> breasts.
3-female_must_strip,target:kurumu,targetStage:0=smug,Even through that schoolgirl's outfit, I can tell your breasts are superior to mine.  Hopefully Barnette loves me for <i>other</i> reasons.
3-female_must_strip,target:kurumu,targetStage:0=laughing,Is it true you suck blood, Miss Vampire?  If so...well, we certainly know where it all goes.
3-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:2=confused,So, uh, besides being blue, what's your deal?  You're all sweet and polite now.
3-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:2=seductive,Can't say I prefer blue hair, but you're certainly a lot sweeter now, honey.  What <i>happened</i>?
3-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:2=seductive,Normally I like blondes, but at least you're not waving a gun around and cursing anymore.  Nice tradeoff.
3-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:2=vain,Blue hair is more exotic, but blonde is far more beautiful.  Still, I'll take this polite version of you over the alternative.
3-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=laughing,Ooh, a <i>lady</i> doctor!  The Nirvana's only doctor is a man--I wonder if he'd lose his cool with you gunning for his spot.
3-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=vain,Honestly, I'm torn!  You're a cute woman doctor--and <i>blonde</i>!  But our ship's doctor is a man with rather nice hair himself.
3-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=teasing,Ooh, a doctor from Earth!  I bet that makes you an <i>expert</i> on male sexuality, doesn't it?
3-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, a woman doctor is <i>just</i> what I've been looking for!  Think you could help me and Barnette get pregnant?
3-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=vain,Female <i>and</i> blonde...if only Duero were blond, then he'd be the perfect doctor for me.  So <i>handsome</i>...
3-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, Miss Medicine.  Since you're from Earth, I might have a few questions about men's tubes tonight.
3-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,count-d.va_cruiser:1=teasing,I don't even know you, girlie, but you seem dressed up for a special occasion all the same.  Feeling sexy today?
3-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,count-d.va_cruiser:1,marker:planet-countries=seductive,Hey, cutie.  Is it a holiday on planet Korea?  Because you look different from usual.
3-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,count-d.va_cruiser:1,marker:planet-countries=interested,This "Korea" planet of yours has got quite the range of fashion.  I <i>swear</i> I've seen you running around in something else.
3-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,count-d.va_cruiser:1=stretching,What's up, D.Va?  That's a cute outfit--but it doesn't seem quite like your usual fare.  What's the occasion?
3-female_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=teasing,You just pissed away your best chance to get me out of my dress...<i>or did you</i>?
3-female_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=laughing,To think that for a second there, I was actually <i>worried</i>...actually, I shouldn't have been regardless.
3-female_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=thinking,Damn, do I have any accessories left?  ...Wait, I <i>won</i>?
3-female_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=confused,<i>Good thing I still have my ch</i>--wait, what?
3-female_must_strip,target:willow,targetStage:0=seductive,Tell me about these "vampires," sweetie.  Sucking blood actually sounds a little romantic!
3-female_must_strip,target:willow,targetStage:0=interested,A computer nerd, eh?  So's Parfet--but I wouldn't trust her to handle supernatural blood-suckers.
3-female_must_strip,target:willow,targetStage:0=vain,I know a computer nerd--Parfet's her name.  Cute little thing...and she's with a man, who we <i>used</i> to think sucked blood.
3-female_must_strip,target:willow,targetStage:0=teasing,I think I drew blood on Barnette once--it was a steamy night.  But I never sucked it, so maybe I'm not one of these "vampires."
3-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0=stretching,Hey, Chatterbox, feel free to live a little.  You're as bad as Meia...good thing she ended up somewhere else.
3-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0=stretching,And here I thought I was sparing this table the boredom of having Meia around.  Enter her Earth doppelganger.
3-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0=smug,Pale, dead-serious, somehow convinced there's strategy in cards.  I didn't know they synthesized Meia's brand of boredom on Earth.
3-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0=laughing,<i>Please, Chatterbox, you're talking our ears off.  And your smiles are just so radiant</i>!  A woman after Meia's own black heart.
3-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0=interested,What's with the wings, Miss Pixie?  You some kind of sex-fairy sent to wake up our libidos?
3-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0=seductive,And what do we have here?  A tender little love fairy to help us all along in our sexual adventures?
3-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0=teasing,A love fairy, eh?  You listen here, Miss Pixie--<i>I'm</i> in a happy relationship.  So no touching!
3-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0=laughing,Little Miss Pixie's got quite the filthy mouth for being so frilly-pink with love.  I guess sex <i>is</i> a part of love, but still...
3-female_must_strip,target:rosalina,targetStage:0=teasing,And what do we have here--a fellow spacefarer, and a tall blonde one at that?  <i>People are going to get us confused</i>.
3-female_must_strip,target:rosalina,targetStage:0=vain,Flying around on an <i>observatory</i>, you said?  That sounds heavenly--space is such a beautiful place!
3-female_must_strip,target:rosalina,targetStage:0=teasing,Space can actually be rather beautiful when you're not busy robbing people.  Surely you agree, Miss Princess?
3-female_must_strip,target:rosalina,targetStage:0=vain,You <i>say</i> you're a princess, but space belongs to everyone--surely a traveler like yourself knows that better than most.
3-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=bored,Oh, for God's sake, Meia, don't go on a damn moral crusade.  She's kind of cute, isn't that enough?
3-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=frustrated,We barely know her or what Earth's military is like, Meia.  Don't start with your vendettas against authority.
3-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=bored,It wasn't Earth soldiers that shut down our living districts, Meia.  Cool it and try to have a nice time.
3-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=frustrated,Oh, don't start ragging on the poor girl like we understand the politics of this place.  Let's just all calm down and enjoy each others' breasts.
3-female_must_strip,target:lara,targetStage:0=stretching,Raiding tombs, you said?  Why would you <i>ever</i> want to be all dirty and dusty?
3-female_must_strip,target:lara,targetStage:0=stretching,You won't find <i>me</i> in catacombs like you explore.  It'd ruin my dress...and my face.
3-female_must_strip,target:lara,targetStage:0=teasing,So what's in these tombs, anyway?  <i>We</i> conduct raids on the living and able--so watch out!
3-female_must_strip,target:lara,targetStage:0=smug,Raiding those who can't defend themselves doesn't sound too impressive, honey.  Or do monsters live in those tombs of yours?
3-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:0=laughing,Nice look you've got going there, Miss Bodypaint.  The orange really contrasts nicely with the blue...skin.
3-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:0=laughing,Nice fruity complexion, honey.  Really matches your horns...and your one crazy eye.
3-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:0=smug,You seem surprised to have lost, dear...but you can complain about fate until you're blue in the face.
3-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:0=interested,What are you rolling that thing for?  Trying to pick a new color of body paint?
3-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:1=seductive,Omigosh, Palutena, that gorgeous green hair is even longer than mine!  My <i>girlfriend</i> has green hair, you know.
3-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:1=vain,How do you <i>maintain</i> all that hair?  I have the best time washing mine...and wrapping my green-haired girlfriend in it.
3-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:1=seductive,You know who else has beautiful green hair, Miss Goddess?  My girlfriend, Barnette.  That sweet little thing is back on the ship!
3-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:1=stretching,So is that lovely green hair just the goddess's right?  My girlfriend got hers from standard Mejarian genetic trickery.
3-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:3=confused,This is so freaky to me, and I've dealt with the Paksis's weird energy.  Do you just swtich all the time?
3-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:3=confused,Are you really bouncing back and forth like this all the time?  Like, do you have any friends?
3-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:3=confused,Must be hard getting to know anyone when you keep losing your memory.  How do you deal with always switching?
3-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:3=confused,I can't believe you have split personalities.  Where does the other one go?  How do you make friends?
3-female_must_strip,target:jubilee,targetStage:0=vain,Well, aren't <i>you</i> a little fireball, Miss Mutant?  You look pretty human to me, and this is a girl who thought <i>men</i> were aliens.
3-female_must_strip,target:jubilee,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, honey, <i>men</i> are mutant people, as far as I'm concerned.  And they're still cute, so don't be so hard on yourself.
3-female_must_strip,target:jubilee,targetStage:0=smug,How many people have to tell you you're ugly for you to introduce yourself as a <i>mutant</i>?  You poor, rundown thing.
3-female_must_strip,target:jubilee,targetStage:0=stretching,You look pretty mundane for a <i>mutant</i>, darling.  Although you've certainly got an inhuman fire in you.
3-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale_swimsuit,targetStage:0=laughing,How can a woman dress for a sun she's apparently never seen?  The mysteries just keep piling up.
3-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale_swimsuit,targetStage:0=interested,Cute swimsuit, honey, but I've always preferred the shade.  So do you, clearly.
3-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale_swimsuit,targetStage:0=vain,Yeah, I'm more the type to lounge under an umbrella than do any swimming.  But more power to you, if you ever choose to go outside.
3-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale_swimsuit,targetStage:0=interested,Look, dear.  You can wear that swimsuit all day, but that complexion's not fooling anybody.
3-female_must_strip,target:joey,targetStage:0=confused,What's with all the makeup?  Someone said you're a...<i>clown</i>, whatever that means?
3-female_must_strip,target:joey,targetStage:0=confused,...So does <i>clown</i> mean "makeup advertiser"?  Because you're modeling too many products at once.
3-female_must_strip,target:joey,targetStage:0=laughing,...Earth makeup is something else.  Apparently there's whole classes of women called <i>clowns</i> who just cake it on!
3-female_must_strip,target:joey,targetStage:0=confused,So if I wore as much makeup as you do, would that make me a "clown"?  Where's the lower limit?  This is all new to me.
3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:2=interested,Starting to slip, eh, Meia?  My squadron leader shouldn't be this even with me.
3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:2=interested,Watch yourself there, Meia.  You don't exactly wear much to begin with.
3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:2=laughing,Guess losing that armor didn't limber up your brain at all.
3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:2=laughing,Hey, Leader, don't go and lose to me, now!  <i>I'll lose all respect for you</i>.
3-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_first_time_playing=laughing,Wait, wait, wait.  You've <i>never</i> played poker before?  What are you, in some religious cult or something?
3-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_first_time_playing=smug,You poor, poor thing.  Never played poker before...what a way to start.
3-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_first_time_playing=laughing,You've <i>never</i> played poker before?  Oh, dear...well, I'll be sure to show you the ropes, sweetie.
3-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_first_time_playing=seductive,Your first time ever, huh?  I'm afraid you picked a hell of a game to start with...but you're a cute little thing, so don't be embarrassed.
3-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=laughing,What's up, Four-Feet-Four-Eyes?  You look like someone brought you here at gunpoint.
3-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=laughing,Oh, look, the egghead love child of Parfet and Dita--nerdy and <i>and</i> eccentric!  How's the weather at the bottom of the earth?
3-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0,marker:fama_and_oma=laughing,I keep trying to look over your outfit, but my eyes just keep moving too fast and missing it.  Did your Fama not produce milk, shorty?
3-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=interested,You're such a cute little bespectacled spectacle--but damn if you don't look eleven.  Where's the other two feet of your body?
3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:3=interested,Didn't think you'd be exposing yourself first, Meia.  Maybe your poker skills have been exposed, too.
3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:3=interested,Any tricky accessories I should know about?  Or is it straight to the bra?
3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:3=stretching,If this were a dogfight, I'm sure you'd have a maneuver to get out of this, right?  Well, it's not.
3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:3=vain,No, you can't have any of my accessories.  You wouldn't want my help anyway, right?
3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:3=bored,Is there a doctor in the building?  One specializing in mental health?
3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:3=frustrated,...This isn't funny anymore.  Now I'm just worried about you.
3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:3=frustrated,...This is getting old.  <i>I'm</i> getting old listening to this.
3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:3=annoyed,What a surprise.  Intentionally throwing the game tends to make you lose.
3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:4=teasing,The very last piece.  It's strange being so far ahead of you...but you'll come back to beat me, right?
3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:4=interested,Can't believe you've been pushed this far.  I figured you'd maybe get down to your underwear at the most, with that calculating mind of yours.
3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:4=stretching,I'm disappointed, Meia.  Officers shouldn't lose to their subordinates!
3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:4=interested,It's really the <i>losing</i> that's embarrassing for you, isn't it?  Not the nudity.
3-female_must_strip,target:gogo,targetStage:0=teasing,What's your story, Miss Highlights?  Got any gum to share?
3-female_must_strip,target:gogo,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=teasing,Hey, toss me a piece of that gum, cutie.  I could use a snack while you tell me all about your "San Fransokyo" planet.
3-female_must_strip,target:gogo,targetStage:0=vain,Just gonna blow bubbles all day, or are you actually going to strip?  Either way, I wouldn't mind having some myself...
3-female_must_strip,target:gogo,targetStage:0=interested,You seem a little sour, Miss Gumball.  If those bubbles aren't cheering you up, just give me the rest to chew.
3-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0=interested,Looks like this place attracts more spacefarers than I gave it credit for.  Fine by me--at least someone knows where I'm coming from.
3-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0=seductive,What planet are you from, Miss Starshine?  Your fabulous blonde hair is winning me over as we speak.
3-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0=vain,Guess I can't learn about Earth girls from <i>you</i>--but hey, it's nice to know there's other gorgeous spacefarers out there.  Who like stripping.
3-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0=vain,Ooh, you cut your hair short like Meia does.  But it's wonderful blonde like mine--<i>space is so vast in its variety</i>!
3-female_must_strip,target:orendi,targetStage:0=confused,...You OK there, Fireball?  You on the same planet as the rest of us?
3-female_must_strip,target:orendi,targetStage:0=confused,I may <i>be</i> an alien...but you're certainly acting like one.
3-female_must_strip,target:orendi,targetStage:0=annoyed,Four arms looks useful, but I really can't get over the constant shouting.  Can't you pipe down?
3-female_must_strip,target:orendi,targetStage:0=frustrated,Hey, Earth-girl.  Or wherever you're from.  There's this thing called an <i>indoor</i> voice.
3-female_must_strip,target:zelda,targetStage:0=interested,You know what I see when a woman calls herself "royalty"?  <i>An inferiority complex</i>, Miss Boring-Brunette.
3-female_must_strip,target:zelda,targetStage:0=laughing,You're cute, especially as far as overhyped princesses go.  Let's see how cute you are <i>without</i> all your jewelry.
3-female_must_strip,target:zelda,targetStage:0=laughing,You know what I think of miserable jealous girls who dress themselves up and pretend they're better than the rest of us?  ...I like stripping them.
3-female_must_strip,target:zelda,targetStage:0=vain,Take away a princess's fancy dress and what does she have?  Hopefully a cute butt, and a pirate nearby who's earned her clothes.
3-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:0=seductive,I understand, dear.  You're so stunned by my beauty that you hid your own face in shame.  I'm sure you're still cute!
3-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:0=seductive,Don't hide that pretty little face on <i>my</i> account, honey.  You've certainly got a beautiful <i>figure</i>.
3-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:0=teasing,Nice little bodysuit you've got there, even if you plan on being the Masked Woman.  I know a sugar-and-ice girl with your fashion sense.
3-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:0=laughing,You've got a lot of sass for someone who won't show her face, Miss Masked.  Hiding some grisly injury, or just your own embarrassment?
3-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,You'll have to excuse Meia's hostility.  She's absorbed all of our collective pirate hatred of authority.
3-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,Oh, don't mind Meia.  She's taken the whole pirates-hating--soldiers thing a little too much to heart.
3-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,Just let Meia fume a little, Miss Military. We know you're not from <i>Mejare's</i> nasty old ranks.
3-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=stretching,Cute purple hair, Miss Military.  Oh, don't worry about Meia.  She's even touchier with soldier women than the rest of us.
3-female_must_strip,target:paya,targetStage:0=smug,My sympathies about the premature white hair, honey.  You look a lot older than you should.
3-female_must_strip,target:paya,targetStage:0=confused,You might want to rethink those facial markings, dear.  With that white hair, they look an awful lot like wrinkles.
3-female_must_strip,target:paya,targetStage:0=laughing,Couples can choose their babies' hair color on Mejare thanks to genetic engineering...there's a reason white isn't very popular.
3-female_must_strip,target:paya,targetStage:0=stretching,You poor thing.  Our captain's ancient, but even <i>she</i> still has color in her hair.
3-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,totalMales:1-3=interested,Jeez, you're terrified.  Maybe men <i>do</i> eat women's livers.
3-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,totalMales:1-3=confused,...Are men actually anything to be afraid of?  Sure, they're big and lumbering, but they seem kind of slow.
3-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,totalMales:1-3=bored,Calm down, would you?  Yeesh.  Maybe Mejare was right about men, considering the state they've got this girl in.
3-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,totalMales:1-3=teasing,Hey, I've dealt with my fair share of male soldiers.  They're nothing to be super afraid of...too stupid.
3-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0=smug,Dear god, girl, you'd cower if a light breeze rolled in.  What's the big deal with a little <i>exposure</i>?
3-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0=seductive,You are just <i>so</i> cute.  How do you feel about women, little Miss?  <i>Do my breasts bother you</i>?
3-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0=vain,Shy around nudity, sweetie?  Did the big, bad Earth men beat this into you?  Just <i>enjoy</i> yourself...
3-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0=laughing,You're such a nervous wreck that I just feel bad for teasing you.  Way to ruin my fun.
3-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0=confused,...Look, honey.  Makeup is a girl's best friend, but...it's possible to get a little too close to your friends.
3-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0,marker:fama_and_oma=laughing,Dear god.  Did you break into your Fama's makeup closet and start applying whatever you could find?  Your friends are letting you down.
3-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0=smug,I guess I never appreciated how light with makeup I can be with my natural beauty.  Here we see the alternative...
3-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0=vain,Check out Miss Makeup over here.  Somehow she made it through childhood without hearing the expression "less is more."
3-female_must_strip,target:velma_classic,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, Earth to ~player~.  There's a Velma model out now that doesn't look like a goblin.
3-female_must_strip,target:velma_classic,targetStage:0=interested,What, you figured out the offline version but still chose <i>this</i> Velma?  How nostalgia-blinded can you get?
3-female_must_strip,target:velma_classic,targetStage:0=interested,Hey, ~player~, it's not 2016 anymore.  There's a Velma you can play with that's actually on-model.
3-female_must_strip,target:velma_classic,targetStage:0=laughing,Hey, ~player~, Velma Classic is just here to remember the past...not masturbate to it.
3-female_must_strip,target:velma_classic,targetStage:0=laughing,Don't do this to yourself, ~player~--there's a better Velma now.  I mean, <i>look</i> at this one.
3-female_must_strip,target:velma_classic,targetStage:0=vain,Hey, ~player~, Barnette might understand the appeal of antiques, but <i>I</i> say stick with the fresh and new.
3-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0=seductive,Check out that messy hair...and adorable student outfit!  Did you say you're a <i>witch</i>?
3-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0=smug,Watch out, ladies, we've got a full-blown <i>magician</i> on our hands.  On Mejare you get called a witch for saying men aren't the worst thing ever.
3-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0=vain,A <i>witch</i>, eh?  Forgive my doubts...that jealous old hag of a judge called me a witch just for having that anatomy book!
3-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0=seductive,Awww!  She even brought a little magic wand to complete the costume!  <i>You're so cute, Miss Witch</i>.
3-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0=vain,Between you and that time I got called a witch for showing interest in men, witches are just <i>irresistible</i> these days.
3-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:5=shocked,Bless you--<i>oh no</i>.
3-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:5=shocked,Who sneezed--<i>eep!  N-not Launch</i>!
3-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:5=shocked,<i>Ack!  Why'd you have to sneeze again</i>?
3-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:5=shocked,<i>Eek!  N-not again!  My heart can't take this</i>!
3-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0=smug,Well, look at what we have here!  A blonde spacefarer in a jumpsuit.  Well, I guess we <i>almost</i> match...
3-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0=seductive,I'm a big fan of the bodysuit look, cutie.  So's a certain crewmate of mine I wish was here...space just makes it so much easier.
3-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, a <i>blonde</i>!  And she travels around in space, too.  If only you had the sense to wear my dress instead of that suit, we'd be twins.
3-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0=vain,A shapely little specimen, zipping around space in that provocative bodysuit?  You're a model Mejarian--if only Meia were here!
3-female_must_strip,target:hinata,targetStage:0=smug,So what are these "ninjas" all about, huh?  Disappearing into the night doesn't sound useful in a game like <i>this</i>.
3-female_must_strip,target:hinata,targetStage:0=teasing,Don't tell me your going to use those ninja skills to hide your body, now.
3-female_must_strip,target:hinata,targetStage:0=stretching,Certainly an impressive profile, Miss Ninja.  Think you could show us just <i>how</i> impressive?
3-female_must_strip,target:hinata,targetStage:0=interested,Does "ninja" just mean you wear a headband?  Sounds like a lofty title for my Barnette to accidentally fall under.
3-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=seductive,Ooh, I <i>love</i> your makeup!  Where do you get it on Earth?  I usually make a point to steal some during raids.
3-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=seductive,You're just <i>adorable</i> how you've dolled yourself up!  And you're so teenie-weenie.
3-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=excited,Omigosh, that little outfit is <i>so</i> cute!  And you might be more into makeup than even <i>I</i> am.
3-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=excited,Ooh, do they make dresses that cute in my size?  What about your makeup?  You look so adorable!
3-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Ooh, look, Meia.  Another Misty.  <i>Don't go falling in love with her, now</i>!
3-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,OK, Meia.  I know this girl's called Misty, but don't start trying to be <i>her</i> Big Sister, too.
3-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Don't tell anyone, but...<i>Meia's got a bit of a crush on a girl named Misty</i>.  Fair warning!
3-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=stretching,Gonna win over Meia's heart here?  You wouldn't be the first <i>Misty</i> to do it.
3-female_must_strip,target:hope,targetStage:0=confused,Hey, dearie, no reason to come out knives-swinging.  I've got my rapier sheathed like a civilized woman.
3-female_must_strip,target:hope,targetStage:0=awkward,Settle down there, honey.  There's something awfully scary about wearing a smile with a knife out.
3-female_must_strip,target:hope,targetStage:0=frustrated,I know I brought a sword, sweetheart, but that was just for fashion.  Don't turn this place into a bloodbath.
3-female_must_strip,target:hope,targetStage:0=shocked,Well, hi there, cutie--er, uh, <i>knife-wielding</i> cutie.  Yeah.  Carry on.
3-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, a dark-skinned woman!  We only have a few of those on Mejare--you'd turn heads, Miss Exotic.  And your outfit would fit right in.
3-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=teasing,Talk about a fierce look in your eye--and even skimpier clothing than me!  But you make it work, Miss Chocolate.
3-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=seductive,Hey there, cutie!  Between that exotic dark skin and light dress, you'd be a real steal where <i>I'm</i> from!
3-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=teasing,You're already a model Mejarian with that much skin showing, Miss Warrior.  <i>I'd like to see some sweat roll off those chocolate-flavored muscles</i>.
3-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0,count-weiss_v4:1=vain,Hey, Miss Moneybags, nice wardrobe.  I'm just a poor little pirate--<i>this dress is the best I can afford</i>.
3-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0,count-weiss_v4:1=smug,Figures Miss Princess can't go five minutes without changing her clothes.  A few months of piracy will teach you appreciate the clothes you've got.
3-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0,count-weiss_v4:1=interested,At least you mixed up the colors a little with this new outfit, Miss Heirlooms.  What you had before was like if I wore all yellow.
3-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0,count-weiss_v4:1=teasing,Looking cute there, Coinstacks.  Nice new outfit--gotta show off the money somehow, right?
3-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0=laughing,What's up, sourpuss?  You look even more miserable than a certain squadron leader I know.
3-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0=smug,Hey, lighten up, girlie.  I didn't come all the way to Earth to find what I could get from Meia's strategy lectures.
3-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0=stretching,<i>Yawn</i>...are you really going to be a miserable bore this whole time?  Would having <i>my</i> breasts make you feel better?
3-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0=smug,Looks like it's Little Miss Sunshine's turn to strip.  Good thing Meia's not here, or this table would just freeze over.
3-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:0=laughing,<i>Boo</i>!  <i>The nasty pirate woman's going to kill you</i>!
3-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:0=laughing,You're a cute little thing, Saki!  So plain and innocent...perfect for a pirate like me to <i>kidnap</i>!
3-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:0=laughing,Seeing a cute little Earth girl all clammed up like this really makes me want to comfort her...<i>with my rapier</i>!
3-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:0=laughing,Hey, Miss Schoolgirl.  Ever met an <i>alien</i> before?  You should know...<i>we eat Earthlings' brains</i>!
3-female_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=interested,Come on, ~name~, Mejarians like a challenge.  What would the Earthlings back home think?
3-female_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=vain,Don't let your jealousy just make you throw in the towel, ~name~.  All women can be beautiful!
3-female_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=teasing,Hey, you can still win...against everyone but me.
3-female_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=vain,Don't just drop the ball.  A pilot demands excellence of herself at all times!
3-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:1=excited,Omigosh!  <i>Vriska</i>!  Do that thing again!  There's so much you could teach me about Earth fashion!
3-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:1=excited,<i>Vriiiska</i>!  I love fashion!  Show me more of your Earth outfits!
3-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:1=excited,Your wardrobe's so cool!  I only really have this dress!  You've got to show me what Earth girls wear!
3-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:1=excited,Yes!  Vriska's turn!  Show me what else Earth women wear!  I want it all!
3-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:0=stretching,Shame you're not an <i>actual</i> pearl.  I could go for one of those...Mejare hardly has any.
3-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:0=smug,No animals on Mejare means no pearls.  If only you <i>were</i> one of those beauties...
3-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:0=bored,All stretched-out like that...you're not shaped like a pearl at all!  Shame, because I love those things.
3-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:0=vain,<i>Oh, to hold a real pearl in my hands</i>!  I've only seen pictures in Earth history books.
3-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0=seductive,You know what I love more than anything in this vast universe?  A fellow blonde...especially a cute one!  And you fit the bill, fireball.
3-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, I like your energy--and your blondeness!  My girlfriend Barnette's a real spark plug herself.
3-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0=interested,You're a cutie, Miss Midriff--that messy blonde hair is only making me fall further in love.  Where do you get all your energy?
3-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0=teasing,Slow down there, firecracker--you're like a burning torch with all that blonde hair flying about.  But it's definitely cute!
3-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:0=awkward,Uh...you want to calm down there, sweetheart?  Maybe put that men's gun down?  Take a nap?
3-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:0=bored,Jeez, we knew you meant business by the gun.  No need to shout...must be men's influence.
3-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:0=frustrated,Can you pipe down?  Way to confirm the image of Earth girls as nasty little gun-toting balls of violence.
3-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:0=shocked,Uh...why are you carrying that giant men's gun?  I'd show it to Barnette, but you, uh, don't seem too friendly.
3-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:0=bored,That's a huge gun, Miss Moxie...men's mechanical weapons are so noisy and inefficient.  Don't tell Barnette I said that.
3-female_must_strip,target:shantae,targetStage:0=teasing,Ooh, I think that dark complexion is <i>exotic</i>--so do most Mejarians.  You got a thing for women, Miss Genie?
3-female_must_strip,target:shantae,targetStage:0=seductive,So what's a "genie," anyway?  Does that mean "cute chocolate-flavored girl"?  Because I think I like genies, then.
3-female_must_strip,target:shantae,targetStage:0=seductive,I like your style, Miss Genie!  You're as revealing as my girlfriend Barnette--a little tanner, though.
3-female_must_strip,target:shantae,targetStage:0=teasing,Ooh, the way you move your hips is <i>exquisite</i>, Miss Genie!  I want to learn how to add a little vanilla flavoring to that, if you follow.
3-female_must_strip,target:piper,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey there, Miss Meterstick.  Thanks for not letting my ego get too big when it came to height.
3-female_must_strip,target:piper,targetStage:0=stretching,Every woman I know says I'm tall.  Do you turn heads when you enter a room, too?
3-female_must_strip,target:piper,targetStage:0=vain,Oh, good, a woman who understands what it's like towering over people.  The intimidation can be kind of fun, no?
3-female_must_strip,target:piper,targetStage:0=stretching,Men seem to be taller than women.  I guess I wouldn't turn as many heads on Earth, then...but you'd do it no matter what.
3-female_must_strip,target:alpha,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=laughing,You're pale as marble, dearie!  Do they not have a sun on this "Japan" planet?
3-female_must_strip,target:alpha,targetStage:0=confused,Are you...<i>flickering</i>?  Are you some kind of hologram?  That might explain your skin tone.
3-female_must_strip,target:alpha,targetStage:0=confused,You OK there, sweetheart?  You look a little pale...and non-corporeal.
3-female_must_strip,target:alpha,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=vain,And I thought <i>Mejarians</i> liked the pale look!  This "Japan" planet puts us to shame.
3-female_must_strip,target:athena,targetStage:0=interested,I really thought I'd be the most lightly-dressed woman here, but there you go showing me up on <i>that</i> front.
3-female_must_strip,target:athena,targetStage:0=smug,Way to dispel my stereotypes of Earth girls being overdressed.  You wear even less than I do.
3-female_must_strip,target:athena,targetStage:0=interested,Hey, I understand wanting to show a little skin, but you can't walk around in a <i>bikini</i> all day.  Even Barnette doesn't go that far.
3-female_must_strip,target:athena,targetStage:0=stretching,Even my darling little Barnette covers herself up better than <i>you</i> do...and she's got a reputation for dressing flimsily.
3-female_must_strip,target:ayano,targetStage:0=confused,...You OK there, schoolgirl?  You look a little on edge...especially when you look <i>my</i> way.
3-female_must_strip,target:ayano,targetStage:0=teasing,Looking a little bug-eyed there, honey.  Too much coffee this morning?
3-female_must_strip,target:ayano,targetStage:0=confused,Uh, you OK, Ayano?  Your eyes are all shifty, like somebody's watching you.
3-female_must_strip,target:ayano,targetStage:0=annoyed,...Could you settle down there, girlie?  You're giving me the stink-eye like I killed someone.  It's creeping me out.
3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0=seductive,Well, hi there, Miss Accent!  That is just the <i>cutest</i> polka-dot bodysuit you have on!
3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0=seductive,Omigosh, your funny accent is so <i>cute</i>!  It matches your goofy polka-dotted suit.
3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0=laughing,Well, aren't <i>you</i> the most adorable thing!  All dolled up in polka dots, stumbling over your words!  I could just <i>gobble you up</i>!
3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0=seductive,That's a pretty darling suit, sweetie, with all the polka dots.  And the way you trip over your words just makes me <i>melt</i>!
3-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:0=seductive,Hi there, dearie!  That's an absolutely <i>adorable</i> hat you have on--do you have any others that match that uniform?
3-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:0=seductive,Ohh, tiny little things like you always make my heart melt!  Is the schoolgirl look a style where you live?
3-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:0=stretching,A student's uniform is always the most adorable thing.  As you might imagine from my piracy, I wasn't the best student.
3-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:0=vain,School was always so dreadfully boring, the way they prattled on about men.  But you make the outfit look pretty cute, Miss Magician!
3-female_must_strip,target:zizou_valentine,targetStage:0=interested,Don't you have a magic spell to give yourself some clothes, little Miss Magician?
3-female_must_strip,target:zizou_valentine,targetStage:0=interested,I must say, Zizou, I like your standard outfit better.  This is just trying too hard to make men like you.
3-female_must_strip,target:zizou_valentine,targetStage:0=laughing,Ohh, Barnette wears just as little when she cooks for me!  It's so cute...but then, <i>she</i> has breasts.
3-female_must_strip,target:zizou_valentine,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, Miss Magician...<i>don't wear clothes you can't fill</i>.  But definitely wear clothes in general.
3-female_must_strip,target:tracer,targetStage:0=teasing,All about speed, eh, girlie?  Try not to blink right out of your costume...or back to before I won, you little cheat.
3-female_must_strip,target:tracer,targetStage:0=vain,Hey, where's <i>my</i> time travel?  Actually, there's nothing about my life I regret, so no issue.
3-female_must_strip,target:tracer,targetStage:0=seductive,Mind if I borrow that time device, sweetie?  I want to fall in love with my Barnette <i>all over again</i>.
3-female_must_strip,target:tracer,targetStage:0=teasing,If that thing can really travel you back in time, that's pretty fantastic.  How many times have we done this match over again, <i>loser</i>?
3-female_must_strip,target:tracer,targetStage:0=smug,You know what I've learned as a pirate?  You only get one chance to do things right.  This time-travel business sounds like a crutch.
3-female_must_strip,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=laughing,Normally I'd say rock the skin color you have, but <i>wow</i>.  Pink is <i>not</i> an attractive color...not <i>that</i> pink.
3-female_must_strip,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=stretching,And here I thought <i>Mejarians</i> were the ones with the exotic body colors.  Earth girls are breaking out the bright pink skin!
3-female_must_strip,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=confused,Why's your skin all gross-looking and pink?  Like, <i.really</i> pink.  It's distracting...so is that eyepatch, too.
3-female_must_strip,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=smug,Not to be outdone, Earth starts showing this Mejarian just how bizarre its colors can truly get.  Next on the agenda: <i>pink skin</i>.
3-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0=interested,I was about to comment on how I love blondes, but that mechanical arm really stands out.  How'd you get it?
3-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0=confused,It's hard to feel too awkward about you losing your arm when that thing looks like a pretty useful replacement.  Got a story to tell?
3-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0=laughing,Check out Miss Cyborg over here!  You wear that mechanical arm quite well--<i>do Earth men find you too much to handle</i>?
3-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0=seductive,I must say, that cold steel clashes with your fiery personality.  Talk about a two-tiered threat!
3-female_must_strip,target:alice_degracia,targetStage:0=smug,Hey, hey, hey!  Check out the <i>all-purple</i> look.  That's a new one...
3-female_must_strip,target:alice_degracia,targetStage:0=vain,Hey, honey, color <i>contrasts</i> show confidence.  Would I look nearly as stunning if this dress matched my hair?
3-female_must_strip,target:alice_degracia,targetStage:0=smug,Purple hair's certainly got an exotic appeal...too bad mine is boring old blonde.  As for the matching outfit, I don't follow the logic.
3-female_must_strip,target:alice_degracia,targetStage:0=teasing,Quite the exotic color scheme you've got there, sweetie.  Too bad you forgot to mix it up at all.
3-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=smug,<i>Well, well, well</i>.  We've got a <i>goddess</i> here, ladies...besides me, of course.
3-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=vain,A <i>goddess</i>, eh?  I guess that makes <i>two</i> at this table, then.
3-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=teasing,Just look at that shimmering green hair--and that ornamentation!  But I think I'm every bit the goddess you are, hot stuff.
3-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=laughing,Just look at that--two goddesses, near-opposite color schemes.  I guess I'm the <i>evil, nasty</i> one.
3-female_must_strip,target:black_canary,targetStage:0=teasing,Oho--a fellow blonde!  Good to see them running around on Earth--we've got to stick together!
3-female_must_strip,target:black_canary,targetStage:0=seductive,Hey there, cutie!  Always good to see more lovely blonde women running around.  Got to keep each other safe from those jealous brunettes.
3-female_must_strip,target:black_canary,targetStage:0=vain,Ooh, is blonde your natural color?  It's not as exotic as some of Mejare's other hair colors, but it's certainly appealing to be wrapped in gold.
3-female_must_strip,target:black_canary,targetStage:0=vain,What, was "Blonde Canary" taken?  Because <i>that's</i> what I would advertise, if I were you.
3-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=seductive,Blonde, scantily-clad, loves attention?  Honey, you're a woman after my own heart.
3-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=teasing,I like the energy you're bringing, Miss Wrestler!  The scant layering doesn't hurt, either.
3-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=vain,See, <i>you're</i> my kind of woman!  These other Earth girls are so dreadfully boring, always covering up the good stuff.
3-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=teasing,Barely wearing anything? You should know my girlfriend is the same way, cutie...only <i>she's</i> not blonde.
3-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:6=interested,I appreciated the fashion show, Vriska, but really, I doubt you've got fuel left in the tank.
3-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:6=stretching,Just going to keep on trying, huh?  Give it up already.
3-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:6=stretching,Poor girl just can't control her gambling problem.  Now she'll be nude for it.
3-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:6=interested,And is this magically going to restock your wardrobe?  I doubt it.
3-female_must_strip,target:blackrose,targetStage:0=confused,I was gonna say something about that cool dark skin, but apparently...you're just some sort of image?  What's <i>that</i> about?
3-female_must_strip,target:blackrose,targetStage:0=frustrated,You're..."virtual"?  Listen, honey, you can't just assume we know what these things mean.  Piloting's a busy life, you know!
3-female_must_strip,target:blackrose,targetStage:0=bored,Wait, so you're not really here, and you're some kind of "virtual" avatar?  Earth has really gotten advanced from all the technology they keep stealing.
3-female_must_strip,target:blackrose,targetStage:0=annoyed,Hey, if we can just use computers to <i>project</i> ourselves here, why didn't anyone tell me?  I had to <i>fly</i> all the way here!
3-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,What's up, sourpuss?  You look even more miserable than a certain squadron leader I know...the one right next to us.
3-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,Hey, lighten up, girlie.  I could have gotten this mood from playing poker with Meia back on the ship.
3-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=stretching,<i>Yawn</i>...are you really going to be a miserable bore this whole time?  Would having <i>my</i> breasts make you feel better?
3-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,Looks like it's Little Miss Sunshine's turn to strip.  Between you and Meia here, the energy's just through the roof.
3-female_must_strip,target:blake,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, the black-and-white look is a classic!  Very striking and confident with that contrast.  And such a cute little bow!
3-female_must_strip,target:blake,targetStage:0=teasing,Maybe it's just me, but you've got a Mejarian sense of style!  Clashing colors, nice and sexy and revealing!  A woman after my own heart.
3-female_must_strip,target:blake,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, that's a cute outfit, Blake!  I love this dress, but I don't have anything quite as fancy as all that clashing-colors business.
3-female_must_strip,target:blake,targetStage:0=teasing,<i>Mmm</i>...the lace, the contrast, the <i>heels</i>!  I like your style, Blake!  Not bad for an Earth girl.
3-female_must_strip,target:marceline,targetStage:0=bored,...Is someone playing a Halloween prank on me?  Where are your eyes?  How are you floating?  <i>Earth</i>...
3-female_must_strip,target:marceline,targetStage:0=confused,Don't get me wrong, Mejare has Halloween just like Earth...but we just dress up.  That doesn't look like a costume.
3-female_must_strip,target:marceline,targetStage:0=confused,...OK, it's hard to comment on what's weird about you when there's so much to choose from.  Do I start with your floating or your eyes?
3-female_must_strip,target:marceline,targetStage:0=confused,...Is this Earth?  Did I get the right planet?  Because you like even more alien that I do, with that skin...and no eyes.
3-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:3=excited,Here we go again.  This is so <i>exciting</i>!  Every outfit is an adventure!
3-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:3=excited,This is making me feel so alive!  I love checking out women's fashion!  Show some more!
3-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:3=seductive,You're so cool, Vriska!  And maybe even a little cute!  What else have you got for me?
3-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:3=teasing,Don't stop now, cutie!  Any more adorable outfits you've got in store for me?
3-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=seductive,Hey there, Miss Star-Student!  That's a school uniform, right?  What do they teach you on Earth?
3-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=teasing,Check out the uniformed student type!  I was never good in school--but what is it they teach you on Earth, huh?
3-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=vain,Mejare's schools are nothing but <i>men this, violence that</i>, with a little math.  How does your fancy Earth education compare?
3-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=vain,A student, huh?  Do they teach you anything interesting on Earth?  I was never a brainiac, but I still rose to be a pilot!
3-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, an Earth girl still in school!  Have they taught you anything about men?  What do they teach you in general?
3-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:0=awkward,...Are you alright there, honey?  With the knife and all?
3-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:0=awkward,...You know, I carry the rapier mostly for fashion...maybe you could relegate that knife to the same thing?
3-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:0=annoyed,...Could you maybe put down the knife, sweetheart?  Hey, are you listening?
3-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:0=bored,What a weirdo...knives are just as deadly as swords, with none of the style.
3-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:0=frustrated,Better keep my sword on hand, with <i>this</i> nutcase on the scene.
3-female_must_strip,target:blake_v4,targetStage:0=laughing,Way to go and expose your entire midriff there, Blake.  Who do you think you are, Dita?  <i>Me</i>?
3-female_must_strip,target:blake_v4,targetStage:0=interested,Nice vest you're rocking there, honey.  But you forgot to cover up your midsection...like me.
3-female_must_strip,target:blake_v4,targetStage:0=smug,Taking a few fashion tips from <i>me</i>, are you, Blake?  What with that midriff fully on display and all.
3-female_must_strip,target:blake_v4,targetStage:0=teasing,Well, aren't <i>you</i> looking more exposed than usual?  But as far as exposure goes, the midsection's a good choice.
3-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=interested,...So it's <i>piloting</i> that really gets you going, Leader.  <i>You hopeless intellectual, you</i>.
3-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,I <i>knew</i> you were a robot.  The only thing that makes you lighten up is another woman's skills.
3-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=stretching,I guess I'm just shallower than you are, boss.  There you go, seeking out girlfriends on things <i>beyond</i> looks.
3-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=stretching,Oh, thank God, you're flirting.  For a second there I was worried you really <i>were</i> sexless.
3-female_must_strip,target:buffy,targetStage:0=confused,Do you seriously fight those "vampire" things?  I mean, you just don't look all that imposing.
3-female_must_strip,target:buffy,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, you're kind of cute!  Is that how you kill "vampires"?  Just making them let their guard down with your adorable face?
3-female_must_strip,target:buffy,targetStage:0=confused,So what's it take to kill these "vampires"?  Can't you just get the military to shoot them or something?  You don't seem all that special.
3-female_must_strip,target:buffy,targetStage:0=smug,For a girl called "Buffy," you sure seem awful willowy.  You <i>do</i> have a cute face, so maybe that's your strategy for killing those vampire things.
3-female_must_strip,target:shego,targetStage:0=laughing,You OK there, Miss Jumpsuit?  You're looking a little green-around-the-frills.
3-female_must_strip,target:shego,targetStage:0=interested,Is all the stripping and teasing making you nauseous, dearie?  Just trying to grin and bear it?
3-female_must_strip,target:shego,targetStage:0=teasing,I'm liking the style on the bodysuit, honey--it helps obscure your sickly green hue.
3-female_must_strip,target:shego,targetStage:0=smug,Mejarians have some say in their skin tone from genetic engineering...I don't think we can do green, but then I doubt it'd be too popular.
3-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:7=smug,...Yeah, we all know how <i>this</i> is ending, don't we?
3-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:7=smug,Some women just refuse to see what's right in front of them.  It's sad, really.
3-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:7=laughing,Well, get ready for full-blown blue nudity, everyone.
3-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:7=smug,All the magic in the universe, and not one ounce of sense.  You poor thing.
3-female_must_strip,target:calisto,targetStage:0=interested,What's up, Miss Pantsuit?  You sure laugh a lot for someone dressed so prim-and-proper.
3-female_must_strip,target:calisto,targetStage:0=laughing,You some kind of businesswoman, Miss Yuck-it-up?  How could such an esteemed professional be so <i>depraved</i> as to play this?
3-female_must_strip,target:calisto,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey there, Chuckles!  You look more conservative than I've ever <i>dreamed</i> of being...and yet here you are, stripping with me.
3-female_must_strip,target:calisto,targetStage:0=teasing,Something funny, Miss Formalwear?  Make sure this nasty pirate doesn't put a ransom on your very professional head.
3-female_must_strip,target:aiyana,targetStage:0=vain,That tan is something else, and your energy is boundless!  Most Mejarians opt for pale, as you can see...
3-female_must_strip,target:aiyana,targetStage:0=teasing,Barnette's kind of tan like you are.  She's cute, too, so women can pull it off!
3-female_must_strip,target:aiyana,targetStage:0=teasing,Slow down there, tiger.  That energy is going to turn you into a tan smear on the ground.
3-female_must_strip,target:aiyana,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=confused,Tan is certainly a look on Mejare, but pale is the norm for us...where'd you say you were from?  Planet Austria?
3-female_must_strip,target:zoey,targetStage:0=smug,These "zombies" of yours don't sound so bad...but then, I guess you don't have a fabulous fighter spaceship, do you?
3-female_must_strip,target:zoey,targetStage:0=stretching,See, my Vandread can shield a whole planet.  So I think we could quarantine your little zombie virus.
3-female_must_strip,target:zoey,targetStage:0=vain,A zombie virus, eh?  Not to brag, but my Vandread helped avoid the spread of disease on a planet once...<i>I'm so talented</i>.
3-female_must_strip,target:zoey,targetStage:0=laughing,The more you describe these "zombies," the more they just sound like men.  You sure that's not what you mean?
3-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=laughing,Well, aren't <i>you</i> a tight little ball of sexual energy!  I guess it's got nowhere to go in that tiny frame of yours.
3-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=vain,You've got a lot of libido packed into a little body.  Must be the effects of Earth men...we Mejarians are <i>tasteful</i> in our sexuality.
3-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=laughing,<i>Why, I never</i>!  You're so dreadfully lewd, Miss Tan...do men just like women on the shorter side?
3-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=vain,You must get a lot of attention from men to be all amped-up like this.  <i>Tell me a tall woman still has a chance</i>!
3-female_must_strip,target:asuna,targetStage:0=frustrated,What'd you say you lived in?  An M-M-O--ripgah?  I can't keep track of all that.
3-female_must_strip,target:asuna,targetStage:0=confused,Did you say you lived in a computer or something like that?  Sounds like Heaven to Parfet, with how much she tinkers with machines.
3-female_must_strip,target:asuna,targetStage:0=confused,So what's it like inside a computer?  Do you have to wear a rubber suit to avoid getting electrocuted?
3-female_must_strip,target:asuna,targetStage:0=confused,You live inside a game, right?  And now you're <i>playing</i> a game?  Is this whole place a game I've stepped inside?
3-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, cutie!  You look like you've got some kind of rank to your name, with that beret--care to share any details?
3-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, you're not a bad looker, Earth-girl!  I like that exotic purple hair.  What is it you do, exactly?
3-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0=seductive,Tell me more about your exciting "NERV" job, Miss Military.  I want to know <i>all about</i> Earth!
3-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0=teasing,Ohoho--a <i>military</i> woman.  Well, indulge this filthy pirate scum and share what it is you do all day.
3-female_must_strip,target:sonya,targetStage:0=teasing,I can appreciate military women--they're always so very <i>fit</i>.  Try not to wring my neck for my horrible pirate crimes.
3-female_must_strip,target:sonya,targetStage:0=vain,<i>Please don't hurt me, O fearsome woman soldier.  I have a girlfriend waiting for me back home</i>!
3-female_must_strip,target:sonya,targetStage:0=vain,Looking pretty muscular, Miss Militia.  Please try to see this beautiful pirate's point of view before sticking your knee in her back.
3-female_must_strip,target:sonya,targetStage:0=teasing,I imagine you're not too fond of my line of work, Miss Militia.  It's OK--<i>I'm pretty fond of that short blonde hair</i>.
3-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:4=teasing,Hey, honey...take <i>my</i> dress, and I'll love you forever.
3-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:4=smug,Feel free to flatter me and steal my dress, dear!  It's...over there somewhere.
3-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:4=seductive,Say, Vriska...can that die steal <i>my</i> dress?  <i>Please</i> say yes.
3-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:4=vain,I'd <i>love</i> to see how my dress looks on someone else.  But I can't just let you try it on...so use the die.
3-female_must_strip,target:tifa,targetStage:0=interested,Ohoho.  A <i>martial artist</i>, honey?  Well, I can certainly see where all your momentum comes from.
3-female_must_strip,target:tifa,targetStage:0=laughing,With a figure like that, I imagine you've developed your <i>own</i> style of martial arts...centered around counterweights.
3-female_must_strip,target:tifa,targetStage:0=teasing,<i>My, my</i>!  Those things outdo even mine, sweetie...but I don't pretend I'm some sort of athlete.
3-female_must_strip,target:tifa,targetStage:0=seductive,Bigger breasts <i>and</i> martial arts skill?  Jeez, you're outmaneuvering me left and right.  Good thing you're such a cutie!
3-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=stretching,See, Meia, I think you do the "strong, silent type" thing pretty well.  Chell here is an example of taking it too far.
3-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,Slow on the uptake?  The "strong, silent type" doesn't mean <i>literally</i> never speaking, you know.
3-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,Oh, don't feel bad.  I know you're speechless at the sight of me--but I'll do enough talking for both of us!
3-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Stunned into speechlessness?  I'm flattered, but really, honey, you can talk to me.  I won't mind.
3-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Hey, Chell.  If I'm the most gorgeous woman you've ever met, don't say anything.
3-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, girlie, someone told me you're a model on Earth...is that true?  I'd like to get in on that...
3-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0=teasing,You're pretty cute, honey, but I hear people like legs on their models...better hope <i>I</i> don't hit the scene.
3-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0=vain,Hey now, sweetheart.  You're cute, but there's no need to brag about being a model...not when a <i>Mejarian's</i> on the scene.
3-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0=teasing,Don't be so full of yourself, Miss Model...I'd be a model, too, if not for Mejare's pesky little corrupt government.
3-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,<i>Oh, dear</i>.  I can see where <i>this</i> is going, Ice Queen.
3-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,<i>Flirting</i>, are we Meia?  I figured as much.  Best to let the lovebirds just figure things out on their own.
3-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,Meia, honey, you're just setting yourself up for disappointment.  Earth girls don't like each others' bodies the way <i>we</i> do.
3-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Ooh, you're so <i>cute</i> when a woman actually gets you going!  She'll deny it now, Chun, but Meia here is <i>totally</i> into you.
3-female_must_strip,target:amy_rose,targetStage:0=confused,You're, uh, looking a little pink there.  And what's up with those ears?
3-female_must_strip,target:amy_rose,targetStage:0=confused,I know I joke about Earth girls being aliens, but, uh, you really do look kind of weird.  What's with all the...<i>fur</i>?
3-female_must_strip,target:amy_rose,targetStage:0=confused,Wait, did they say you're a...a <i>hedgehog</i> or something?  Is that some kind of animal?  That would explain the, uh, pink...and ears.
3-female_must_strip,target:amy_rose,targetStage:0=confused,...I really can't make heads or tails of you.  You kind of <i>look</i> like you should have a tail, what with that fur and all.
3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:4=excited,Forget the common language, Marinette, your "French" sounds like the most <i>romantic</i> thing!  You've <i>got</i> to say some more.
3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:4=excited,<i>Oooh, Marinette</i>!  Can you say some more "French"?  My heart beats faster every time your tongue slips!
3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:4=seductive,You should say some more French, Marinette!  It's got the <i>silkiest</i> sound to it--it makes my heart go wild!
3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:4=seductive,Oooh, Marinette, since it's your turn, can you throw out some more of this "French"?  It sounds like a <i>lover's</i> language.
3-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:5=smug,Well, that's that.  Do what you must behind those flowers.
3-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:5=interested,You can hide yourself with the flowers, honey, but you're naked, so that's a loss in my book.
3-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:5=smug,Nice try with the foliage, dear, but no one's going to call that clothing.  You're out.
3-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:5=stretching,<i>And so the frightened little princess falls before her betters.  Even the forest spirits couldn't save her</i>.
3-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=vain,Omigosh, are you <i>filming</i> this?  Look this way--over here!  Get every angle you can!
3-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=vain,You're <i>broadcasting</i> this?  To a <i>live audience</i>?  This is a dream come true--now <i>all of Earth</i> will witness my beauty!
3-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=vain,Omigosh!  <i>Omigosh</i>!  You're <i>broadcasting</i> this to people all around Earth?  Maybe I'll finally become a model!
3-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=seductive,You're <i>filming</i> this?  Omigosh--normally I have to get Barnette to capture my beauty on camera!  You're so sweet!
3-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=vain,I hope you don't think that camera is going to scare me away.  I may be a wanted criminal, but I'm also <i>beautiful</i>!
3-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=vain,You picked a good table to film, honey.  The only thing that loves me more than Barnette is a camera!
3-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0=vain,Ooh, you're into art?  Do you think you could paint a portrait of me?  Maybe frame it in your collection to capture my eternal beauty?
3-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0=teasing,Ooh, so you're an <i>artist</i>?  I know a particularly handsome man that can paint, too...think you could capture me better?
3-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0=vain,Did you say you go to school with men?  I was never that big on school--except for art, where we could finally appreciate <i>beauty</i>!
3-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0=vain,Students tend to be such bores--like that egghead Parfet.  But an <i>art</i> student?  Now we're talking--my whole body is art!
3-female_must_strip,target:arwen,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=confused,Hey, what's all this about the <i>middle</i> of Earth?  Is there a spot underground that only you elf-people get to live in?
3-female_must_strip,target:arwen,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=confused,And I call <i>you</i> pale, Meia.  Arwen here looks almost ghostly...is that just the way elves are?
3-female_must_strip,target:arwen,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=confused,Hey, what's up with those pointy ears?  And that pallid skin?  You're a strange one, "elf" girl.
3-female_must_strip,target:arwen,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=confused,So you call yourself an elf, right?  Is that another word for "Earthling with crazy ears"?  Because you look human otherwise.
3-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:0=seductive,Hey there, Miss Two-Tone!  I like your sense of fashion--that exposed, that hat, and those cute little boots!
3-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, is that two-toned hair natural?  That's fancier than even <i>Mejarians</i> have come up with.
3-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:0=interested,You seem pretty smug, honey.  Do you have a sweeter half like your hair implies?
3-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:0=excited,Ooh, can I try on your hat when you lose it?  Or that amulet?  Can you two-tone my hair like yours?
3-female_must_strip,target:tina,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=teasing,Planet <i>America</i>, hm?  Never heard of it--but it seems to have produced as least one knockout!
3-female_must_strip,target:tina,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=thinking,<i>Britain</i>, <i>Japan</i>, and now your <i>America</i>.  I'm starting to think these aren't actually planets...and Earth people are just very splintered.
3-female_must_strip,target:tina,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=teasing,Hey, now, Miss Wrestler...this place has a <i>no-touching</i> rule, even if Planet <i>America</i> doesn't.
3-female_must_strip,target:tina,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=vain,I don't know how they do things on Planet America, honey, but you keep your wrestling hands to yourself--I'm taken!
3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:5=teasing,Don't stop now, honey!  I hope I'm not imposing...but I'd <i>love</i> to hear some more French!
3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:5=seductive,Your language is the absolute <i>coolest</i>, darling!  Say some more for me, if you don't mind...I hope I'm not being a burden.
3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:5=teasing,I'm not demanding too much of you, am I, Marinette?  I just <i>love</i> your language...and this should take your mind off stripping.
3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:5=vain,Normally I'm interested in women's tongues for <i>other</i> reasons...but with you, I can't get over how cool your language is!
3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:5=seductive,I think I'm jealous, Marinette!  Not only are you the <i>cutest</i> little blueberry muffin of a girl, but your language is to <i>die</i> for!
3-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0=vain,How's a young little thing like you a model if you're still in school?  <i>I've</i> got modeling potential, but it's hard for pirates to land a job.
3-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0=smug,A student <i>and</i> a model?  And here I am, with all my beauty, and still a lowly criminal.  At least I have my wonderful piloting skills.
3-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0=vain,<i>If only my circumstances let me be the beautiful model I've always dreamed of being</i>!  Guess I'll have to settle for death-defying pirate.
3-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0=teasing,You're a lucky one, Earth-girl.  I never had the benefit of much schooling, nor the opportunity to be a model.  So cherish what you've got!
3-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=stretching,Ooh, I know a girl named Misty!  She's this cute little thing from Pluto--barely has any breasts at all!  Must be cold there.
3-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=smug,Why, the Nirvana has a young girl named Misty aboard!  Being from Pluto, she knew her way around men better than any of us.
3-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=seductive,You're not the first Misty I've come to know, actually.  A teenie-weenie Plutonian girl we have is called the same thing!
3-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=stretching,I don't think they have your <i>poker</i>-mon things on Pluto...but they do have girls named Misty.
3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:6=bored,The storm is almost over...or maybe this is just the calm before it.
3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:6=bored,I think I'd prefer the <i>Harvest's</i> company at this point.
3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:6=bored,Oh, you're still here.  Why not just strip more than one thing at a time?  Well, too late.
3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:6=bored,I still don't know who made you wait this long to show what you wanted.
3-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:0=vain,Check out that outfit!  Going for the natural look?  So would I, if Mejare had much of nature.
3-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:0=interested,Did you just piece that outfit together from bits you found in a forest?  It doesn't even look that bad, but...it's certainly all-natural.
3-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:0=vain,If only Mejare had the same verdant natural resources as Earth.  Perhaps then I could try to emulate your all-natural style.
3-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:0=vain,Mejare's a little too wasteful to have the greenery for me to dress like <i>you</i> do.  You can see how little we wear to compensate.
3-female_must_strip,target:arwen,targetStage:0=confused,Hey, what's all this about the <i>middle</i> of Earth?  Is there a spot underground that only you elf-people get to live in?
3-female_must_strip,target:arwen,targetStage:0=confused,And I call <i>Meia</i> pale.  You look almost ghostly...is that just the way you elves are?
3-female_must_strip,target:arwen,targetStage:0=confused,Hey, what's up with those pointy ears?  And the pale, Meia-like skin?  You're a strange one, "elf" girl.
3-female_must_strip,target:arwen,targetStage:0=confused,So you call yourself an elf, right?  Is that another word for "Earthling with crazy ears"?  Because you look human otherwise.
3-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=smug,Jeez, what a head case.  Good thing she's got her girlfriend here to keep her in check.
3-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=interested,Running, running, running.  We're not trying to kill you here, you know.
3-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=teasing,Time for take two, everyone.  Better than the first, perhaps?
3-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=seductive,And <i>there she goes</i>.  Poor little thing, beaten down by the world.
3-female_must_strip,target:peach,targetStage:0=vain,I've never been a fan of royalty, but a <i>blonde</i> woman in charge?  Suddenly it doesn't seem so bad.
3-female_must_strip,target:peach,targetStage:0=smug,At least you've got the hair color to match your presumptuous title, Miss Princess.  This pirate still might rob you later.
3-female_must_strip,target:peach,targetStage:0=vain,You damn princesses and your unearned jewelry and dresses.  I stole everything I have, you know!  But at least you're blonde.
3-female_must_strip,target:peach,targetStage:0=teasing,So from one blonde to another, Miss Princess, how much is that crown worth?  ...<i>Just a pirate's curiosity</i>.
3-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia,marker:planet-countries=smug,Where'd you say you were from?  Planet <i>Korea</i>?  Well then, it seems Korea and Mejare share a fashion sense...
3-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia,marker:planet-countries=teasing,You're a cutie, Miss Bodysuit, if a little on the short side.  Is that just how they make women over on Planet Korea?
3-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Well, everyone, cards on the table.  Who wears the whole bodysuit look better--D.Va or my miserable old boss here?
3-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,You're an adorable little thing, D.Va!  All wrapped up in that cute bodysuit, just like <i>another</i> pilot I know...who might be sitting here.
3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:3=confused,Hey, what were those noises you made before?  Didn't sound like the common language...
3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:3=confused,...What's the name of that language you keep slipping into, anyway?  Some sort of Earth code-talk?  I only speak the common one...
3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:3=vain,Bilingualism is so impressive, Marinette!  I only speak the common language...I don't even know Mejarians' codespeak.
3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:3=seductive,So you speak the common language, but also this other one?  What's it called?  Because it sounds so <i>cute</i>!
3-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=interested,Look, Meia, she's just as pale, serious, and boring as you are.  Think she'd smile around Kahlua?
3-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,Hey, Meia's standing right here.  Isn't that enough boredom for one table without <i>you</i> aping her style?
3-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,Look at that, Meia, Earth's found a way to mass-produce you!  <i>Diabolical</i>.
3-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,<i>Yeah, yeah, Meia, stay cocky</i>.  Oh wait, Meia's over <i>here</i>!  You two are just so similar.
3-female_must_strip,target:april,targetStage:0=vain,Ooh, do you really report the news?  Be sure to get my good side--oh wait, that's <i>every</i> side!
3-female_must_strip,target:april,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey there, Jumpsuit.  Someone said you're a reporter--but <i>this</i> pirate doesn't mind a little publicity!
3-female_must_strip,target:april,targetStage:0=smug,I've been in the media for much worse than a few glory shots, so don't think I'm afraid of that camera, newsgirl.
3-female_must_strip,target:april,targetStage:0=vain,Hey, newsie, I've got all the story you need right here.  Your Earth viewers have never seen a body like mine!
3-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0=laughing,Hey there, short stuff.  I think you might actually be shorter than Hibiki, which is a challenge even for women.
3-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0=laughing,You said you fight "Titans"?  I imagine that's everyone, considering your stature.
3-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0=laughing,"Titans," huh?  You mean like me next to you?  Or anyone, really?
3-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0=interested,How's the weather down there, at the very bottom of Earth?  You really need to drink your milk, honey.
3-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0,marker:fama_and_oma=vain,...See, <i>this</i> is why I'm going to be the Fama for Barnette.  I don't want our daughters growing up all short from lack of milk.
3-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:0=confused,...You OK, honey?  You look a little...<i>dead</i>.
3-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:0=shocked,...OK.  So.  You're a ghost.  I can work with this...<i>but please put down the knife</i>.
3-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:0=bored,Guess there's no stabbing <i>you</i> if things get hairy, is there?  ...Not that I was planning on doing that to anyone else.
3-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:0=laughing,A...ghost.  OK.  Well, at least this means I can still annoy Meia if I get shot down and killed.
3-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:0=awkward,...Well, I <i>do</i> appreciate learning that there's an afterlife, but it's not why I came to Earth.
3-female_must_strip,target:annie,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey there, Plain-Jane.  What's brought you here, with all your layers?  Looking to overcome some shyness?
3-female_must_strip,target:annie,targetStage:0=smug,Exhibit A of Earth girls' ridiculous conservatism.  Can't you appreciate your own body instead of hiding it?  Must be men doing this to you.
3-female_must_strip,target:annie,targetStage:0=laughing,What's up, cutie?  You seem to be making every effort to hide that cuteness, actually.  Just look at those packed-on layers.
3-female_must_strip,target:annie,targetStage:0=vain,I guess I'd be a little shyer about my body if I had your height and plain looks, but come on.  Confidence makes <i>any</i> woman look better!
3-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:1=vain,Should've figured Little Miss Princess would want to break away and strip for strangers.  You must be so sheltered!
3-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:1=teasing,Oh, is it true you're a <i>princess</i>, darling?  That would explain the haughty attitude...and the phony embarrassment.
3-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:1=teasing,I'm a pirate, dearie...and no huge fan of authority figures.  Luckily, I <i>love</i> girls who strip for fun and pleasure.
3-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:1=interested,So you're a princess, is that it?  You should know you're not fooling me--you <i>love</i> being ogled, don't you?
3-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:1=interested,A princess, hm?  Only makes sense that such a public figure as yourself would love exhibiting her body for total strangers.
3-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=seductive,Is that so?  Well, Ami, you've <i>got</i> to let me know how to become an Earth model.  I'm a bit of an outlaw on Mejare, after all.
3-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Thanks for the tip, Meia.  Leave it to you to gather a little intel on our friends here...how's life as an Earth model, honey?
3-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,Ooh, she's a <i>model</i>?  <i>Now</i> I'm curious...that was always my dream job, after all.
3-female_must_strip,target:pyrrha,targetStage:0=laughing,Hey there, Miss Mind-Your-Manners.  You talk the talk, but that cleavage tells me you've got a wild side.
3-female_must_strip,target:pyrrha,targetStage:0=teasing,You're awfully polite for a woman perverted enough to come here in the first place.  Just trying to throw us off, cutie?
3-female_must_strip,target:pyrrha,targetStage:0=stretching,Yeah, yeah, I don't buy the whole polite-and-formal act from a girl willing to strip nude in public.  Just waiting for the good stuff?
3-female_must_strip,target:pyrrha,targetStage:0=interested,You talk pretty prim-and-proper, dear...and yet here you are, stripping nude for us.  Do you have a dirty side, or did you lose a bet?
3-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:5=smug,Call it woman's intuition, but I think our little fashion show is about to come to an end soon...
3-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:5=interested,This has been fun, Vriska, but I don't think you can keep this up forever.  That die's got a sick sense of humor.
3-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:5=interested,Can't you see the writing on the wall, sweetheart?  I like these outfits, but they keep getting skimpier and skimpier.
3-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:5=laughing,Roll all you want...I think the die's in control here.  And it wants to see some blue skin.
3-female_must_strip,target:chara,targetStage:0=bored,<i>Yeesh</i>.  Being as beautiful as I am, I try to let other girls down easy, but...you're hard to look at.
3-female_must_strip,target:chara,targetStage:0=angry,...<i>Ew</i>.  I really can't tell where your face begins and your body ends.
3-female_must_strip,target:chara,targetStage:0=smug,...It's times like these that I <i>really</i> appreciate how fortunate I am to be born this beautiful.  Take a look at the alternative.
3-female_must_strip,target:chara,targetStage:0=annoyed,As if you weren't ugly enough, you've got this horrible look in your eyes.  What's your problem?
3-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, an armed woman--and one with chocolate flavoring!  You're like an extreme version of my tan little gun-nut girlfriend.
3-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0=vain,I'm not sure what's most intimidating--that height, that imposing dark complexion, or that huge mechanical firearm!
3-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0=stretching,If only I brought my cute little Barnette here.  She'd be head-over-heels for a woman with a man's gun!
3-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0=teasing,You might be even taller than me, Miss Nighttime.  That might turn even more heads on Mejare than your rather large firearm!
3-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0=smug,Come now, honey.  You can't waltz in waving that huge kinetic weapon around and expect to make any friends.
3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:3=awkward,Uh, Aimee?  Are you sure you want to keep doing that?  You nearly got hit last time...and your targets are getting smaller.
3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:3=shocked,Um, it's OK, Aimee!  You've been very impressive!  Just go out on top, you know?
3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:3=awkward,...Are you sure about this, Aimee?  After...last time?  Don't kill yourself...
3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:3=awkward,Uh--don't go all the way just for <i>my</i> sake.  What you did was cool, but, um...well, you'll be fine.
3-female_must_strip,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=laughing,And I thought <i>I</i> was trying to be seductive!  Here comes Miss Succubus, decked out in her Halloween costume.
3-female_must_strip,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=smug,Don't think you're slipping that past me, honey.  We have Halloween on Mejare...and I've dressed as a succubus before, yes.
3-female_must_strip,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=interested,Nice costume, Miss Seductress.  Looks like I have competition for all my man-hunting tonight.
3-female_must_strip,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=teasing,Mejare has stories of succubi, too...they really know how to tire a woman out.  I guess you must have a lot of fun with men here.
3-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0=excited,Ooh, an Earth woman with green hair!  My girlfriend Barnette has green hair...and she is the <i>cutest</i> thing!
3-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, I didn't know Earth women could have green hair!  I've always considered it the most cutely exotic thing about Barnette.
3-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0=seductive,A sword <i>and</i> lovely green hair?  You must be a sign that Barnette and I are ready for children, sweetie.
3-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0=teasing,Ooh, green hair on a woman never fails to get me going.  But don't worry, my verdantly-colored girlfriend can handle the rest.
3-female_must_strip,target:daisy,targetStage:0=smug,Ohoho.  Miss Boring-old-Brunette puts on a fancy store-bought dress and suddenly thinks she's better than the rest of us.
3-female_must_strip,target:daisy,targetStage:0=interested,So, "Princesses" are like rulers, right?  So what makes <i>you</i> so special, girlie?
3-female_must_strip,target:daisy,targetStage:0=annoyed,I've never subscribed to the idea of royalty.  What, some plain-jane with a chip on her shoulder just <i>decides</i> she's better than me?
3-female_must_strip,target:daisy,targetStage:0=vain,So what if I had to steal my dress?  I'm still more beautiful than Miss Too-Big-for-her-Brooches here, with her servants and fancy title.
3-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=vain,Way to come in a full outfit, Miss Maid.  And you're still speaking just as politely as when you're on the job!
3-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=smug,Whoever is your house's owner must really crack the whip, Miss Maid.  Even <i>now</i> you're using those silly honorifics.
3-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=vain,"Jura-chan" sounds like the most <i>adorable</i> nickname!  I've got to get Barnette to start calling me that...Barnette-<i>chan</i>.
3-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=teasing,You don't have to keep speaking all polite, Miss Maid.  You're in the company of a brutal pirate now--feel free to join the crew.
3-female_must_strip,target:uhura,targetStage:0=smug,Oh, don't worry, dear.  We on Mejare are well aware of Earth's space program...you <i>have</i> tried to harvest us, after all.
3-female_must_strip,target:uhura,targetStage:0=teasing,You can call it "Star Fleet" if you want, dear, but it'll always be the Harvest to me.  <i>You nasty organ-stealers, you</i>.
3-female_must_strip,target:uhura,targetStage:0=vain,I don't buy this whole "peaceful space travel" angle, Miss Star Fleet.  I've spent far too much time fending off your little Harvest cubes!
3-female_must_strip,target:uhura,targetStage:0=smug,Yeah, yeah, I'm sure this "Star Fleet" is super peaceful.  Just remember I've got a Vandread...so I'm not afraid of you.
3-female_must_strip,target:chica,targetStage:0=confused,...You know, I was shown films as a girl about how men were horrible monsters.  You're about what they looked like in those.
3-female_must_strip,target:chica,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>Ew</i>!  <i>Eek</i>!  <i>G-get away</i>!  <i>Stop</i>!  <i>What are you</i>?
3-female_must_strip,target:chica,targetStage:0=annoyed,...I really came here to meet some Earth women.  Not...whatever <i>this</i> is supposed to be.  Besides terrifying.
3-female_must_strip,target:chica,targetStage:0=angry,...What the hell am I looking at?  I wanted some cute girls, not a--a mechanical monstrosity!
3-female_must_strip,target:chica,targetStage:0=bored,You're a <i>robot</i>?  So like, you're Pyoro if he were designed by a blind woman?
3-female_must_strip,target:pauling,targetStage:0=teasing,Nice sensible little outfit you've got there.  The glasses sell the sexy-and-smart look!
3-female_must_strip,target:pauling,targetStage:0=teasing,Working for an old woman, eh?  I know the feeling.  Those glasses must have convinced her you knew what you were doing.
3-female_must_strip,target:pauling,targetStage:0=stretching,A woman with glasses, eh?  <i>I</i> certainly couldn't pull off the look...I guess I don't look very smart.
3-female_must_strip,target:pauling,targetStage:0=smug,I know an engineering egghead with glasses--Parfet's her name.  And she seems to attract what few smart men I know.
3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,Hey, Meia, what do you think?  Should we try to find you a bodysuit with polka dots?  Maybe force you to smile like Marinette?
3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=interested,This girl makes bodysuits look a lot cuter than <i>you</i> do, Meia.  Must be because she smiles...or because of the polka dots.
3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,Even with the mask on, this girl emotes much more than <i>you</i>, Meia.  Maybe a polka-dotted suit would lighten you up.
3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,If you're not a fan of polka dots, Meia, maybe you could adopt this girl's adorable accent and actually brighten a room for once.
3-female_must_strip,target:sharla,targetStage:0=teasing,Good thing you're a medic, because that mysterious dark complexion is making my heart beat ever faster.
3-female_must_strip,target:sharla,targetStage:0=seductive,Do you know how many women on Mejare are dark-skinned, Miss Medic?  Not enough, I say...even my Barnette is just a little tan.
3-female_must_strip,target:sharla,targetStage:0=vain,Oh, Miss Medic?  I think I'm coming down with something--<i>love for your chocolate flavoring</i>!
3-female_must_strip,target:sharla,targetStage:0=teasing,You dress pretty casually for a medic, but that exotic dark skin is helping me overlook your shoddy sense of professionalism.
3-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=smug,Where'd you say you were from?  Planet <i>Korea</i>?  Well then, it seems Korea and Mejare share a fashion sense...
3-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=teasing,You're a cutie, Miss Bodysuit, if a little on the short side.  Is that just how they make women over on Planet Korea?
3-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0=vain,If only Meia were here.  She dresses just like you do, D.Va...we should find out who wears it better!
3-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0=seductive,You're an adorable little thing, D.Va!  All wrapped up in that cute bodysuit, just like a certain <i>other</i> pilot I know.
3-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=teasing,Ooh, you've got quite the set of muscles on you.  Shame Meia's not here.  She'd totally melt right in front of you!
3-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=seductive,Check out those legs, hot stuff!  You look like you could lift up the whole table with those things alone--good thing Meia's not here to fawn over you.
3-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=seductive,Omigosh, you should meet Meia, my boss--she's really icy, but women with muscles totally get her going.  And she'd try not to show it!
3-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, Miss Muscles, you into women?  Because my squadron leader Meia is all about exercise, and she <i>desperately</i> needs a girlfriend.
3-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0=interested,Talk about a big ball of misery.  Even your <i>skin</i> has turned all blue in despair.
3-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0=teasing,Show your face, honey!  Or are you trying to hide that weird blue skin?  Don't worry, it suits your miserable demeanor.
3-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0=laughing,I guess I'd be miserable, too, if I had the complexion of a grapefruit.
3-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0=stretching,I should bring Meia over here for some counseling.  Even <i>she's</i> not as miserable as Miss Blueberry here.
3-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, you're a cutie!  Yet surprisingly sturdy on your feet, what with all that armor.  <i>Don't bowl me right over</i>!
3-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=laughing,Hi there, darling!  You must be pretty tough to lug all that armor around.  <i>Afraid I'll stab you</i>?
3-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=seductive,What's with that armor, sweetheart?  You'd be a lot cuter without it...I know I'm a pirate, but I'd never kill someone as cute as you.
3-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=vain,Adorable hairstyle, cute face--but all that armor!  You a soldier, dear?  <i>Oh, please forgive my horrid piracy</i>!
3-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=vain,Hel-<i>looo, camera</i>!  Over here, sweetie--get whatever angle you like best.
3-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=vain,Omigosh, you brought a <i>camera</i>?  A sign from the heavens!  Now all of Earth will get to see my beautiful naked body!
3-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=teasing,Looking to get some photographs of the exotic alien woman, were you?  But now you've got a whole <i>different</i> reason to capture me.
3-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=vain,Go right ahead with that camera, dearie.  It's always been shameful how I've been in the media for piracy instead of beauty.
3-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, Miss Moneybags, you'd better watch out.  This pirate's got half a mind to loot you with extreme prejudice!
3-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0=teasing,Sure you're not worried to be playing in a seedy place like this, Miss Heiress?  You might get mugged by, say, an ornery pirate.
3-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0=interested,Nice premature white hair, Miss Heirlooms.  I guess having all that inherited money must be <i>oh-so-stressful</i> for you.
3-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0=laughing,Looking quite adorable there, Coinstacks.  Maybe I'll help myself to the jewelry you'll undoubtedly remove first.
3-female_must_strip,target:shazza,targetStage:0=smug,Quite the interesting accent you've got there.  I can't quite call it refined, but then again, I <i>am</i> a filthy pirate.
3-female_must_strip,target:shazza,targetStage:0=stretching,I guess when I lead a life of crime, I can't get away with calling you uncivilized-sounding.  Actions mean so much more!
3-female_must_strip,target:shazza,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=laughing,Interesting dialect you have on Planet Australia.  Don't you ever get tired of misunderstanding each other?
3-female_must_strip,target:shazza,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=laughing,This <i>Australia</i> planet certainly has a way with words...mostly for making them incomprehensible.
3-female_must_strip,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0=laughing,Judging by that sword, you're not from Earth either, Miss Crystal.  Where can I get one of those?
3-female_must_strip,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0=smug,Don't ask me why that thing is <i>drawn</i>, but damn if it isn't more impressive than my silly little rapier.  Got any extras?
3-female_must_strip,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, I like the look of that glowing sword!  Even <i>Mejare</i> hasn't though to put its lasers in blades yet.
3-female_must_strip,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0=smug,I could do for an upgrade on this rapier--would you please refer me to the planet where they make those glowing swords?
3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:4=smug,Well, I guess if you've come this far, you might as well finish the job.  Go for it.
3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:4=seductive,I'd expect nothing less, cutie.  Be sure to wow us!
3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:4=teasing,Might as well seal the deal, even if it's just your thong.  You can do it, honey!
3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:4=smug,Seems we've got similar taste in underwear.  Shame you're about to shoot it right off, but at least it'll look cool.
3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:0=interested,What's up, Ocean Girl?  You seem awfully eager.  Does being around men tend to hypersexualize a woman?
3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:0=smug,Jeez, it didn't take a loss for you to start piping up about stripping.  You don't need a <i>game</i> to do that, you know.
3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:0=interested,And here we have Miss Eager-Beaver.  You don't look like you have the assets to be all excited about stripping, sweetheart.
3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:0=stretching,At least you're confident about nudity.  But are you seriously just losing on purpose?  <i>Earth girls</i>...
3-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,Mei and Meia, eh?  I hope our other guests won't mix the two of you up--both are cold in your own ways, after all.
3-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,Look, Meia, this girl's nearly got your name.  But she smiles, so telling you two apart should be easy.
3-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Mei and Meia?  I'd play matchmaker, but you'd be the most confusing couple of all time.
3-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,See, Meia?  You're so sweet, this girl was nearly named after you.  Nearly.
3-female_must_strip,target:ciri,targetStage:0=smug,A <i>witcher</i>, eh?  Is that Earth dialect for witch?  Because I got called a witch for possession of Duero's sex book.
3-female_must_strip,target:ciri,targetStage:0=stretching,Is it <i>witcher</i> or <i>witch</i>?  Or, shall I say, <i>which</i> is it?
3-female_must_strip,target:ciri,targetStage:0=vain,So is a "witcher" even witchier than a witch?  I've been called a witch just for wanting to see what men have got in their pants.
3-female_must_strip,target:ciri,targetStage:0=smug,Forgive me for not being impressed with the term "witcher."  How <i>could</i> I be when all it takes for that on Mejare is a libido?
3-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=interested,Hey, Eyebags, you gonna stay awake all game?  You look like you're drifting away already.
3-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=teasing,Talk about never leaving the house.  You look like you've never seen sunlight--and you're dozing off as we speak!
3-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=smug,Gotta be honest, sweetie--between the pale skin and the vacant look in your eyes, you're really reminding me of a zombie.
3-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=confused,So do you work super hard all day at your job?  Why do you look all gaunt and drowsy?  Get some beauty sleep, woman.
3-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0=smug,You know, I'd call Meia the strong, silent type...but she still speaks <i>occasionally</i>.
3-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0=laughing,Slow on the uptake?  The "strong, silent type" doesn't mean <i>literally</i> never speaking, you know.
3-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0=vain,Oh, don't feel bad.  I know you're speechless at the sight of me--but I'll do enough talking for both of us!
3-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0=teasing,Stunned into speechlessness?  I'm flattered, but really, honey, you can talk to me.  I won't mind.
3-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, Chell.  If I'm the most gorgeous woman you've ever met, don't say anything.
3-female_must_strip,target:may,targetStage:0=smug,What'd you say you did?  Train in poker?  Well, it didn't save you <i>that</i> hand...unless they're animals or something.
3-female_must_strip,target:may,targetStage:0=stretching,So, you're all about <i>poker</i>-mon, was it?  Well, seems you've been training all your life for this game...
3-female_must_strip,target:may,targetStage:0=frustrated,These <i>pokuhmon</i> things just sound like more trouble than they're worth.  Animals in Mejarian zoos are so <i>dirty</i>!
3-female_must_strip,target:may,targetStage:0=confused,You're an animal trainer, isn't that right?  Or was it <i>poker</i>...mons?  Not following the Earth slang here.
3-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:6=laughing,Even with all that, you're still forced to be naked?  It's official--you're totally into this.
3-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:6=teasing,Even with your little flower setup, dearie, I think you're out of options.  Cough up the good stuff--I'm convinced you want to.
3-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:6=vain,<i>That</i> ought to do it, unless you've got more of the plant kingdom at your disposal.  Isn't this what you wanted, playing this game?
3-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:6=seductive,Oh, I'm sure you're cute, dear--I remember your butt!  Besides...I seriously doubt this isn't turning you on.
3-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:0=confused,...I had no idea Earth girls came in so many...flavors.  How'd your parents pick <i>grape</i>?
3-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:0=confused,...So, uh, that skin color.  Am I missing something?  Is this a common look on Earth?
3-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:0=confused,Gotta be honest, girlie, I'm out of the loop on what Earth people look like.  Is that complexion of yours...<i>normal</i>?
3-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:0=confused,What's this about <i>ponies</i> that you keep going on about?  Is a "pony" a purple Earthling?  I'm totally lost here.
3-female_must_strip,target:mileena,targetStage:0=smug,...OK, no one here has any right to call me skimpily-dressed with Bandages here running around.
3-female_must_strip,target:mileena,targetStage:0=stretching,What kind of sex-crazed planet considers that street clothes?  And here I thought Earth was conservative.
3-female_must_strip,target:mileena,targetStage:0=laughing,...Seems I've walking into a game that is well in progress.  Poor thing has been losing so badly!
3-female_must_strip,target:mileena,targetStage:0=laughing,Jeez.  I'm a <i>pirate</i>, and I can afford more clothing than you.  Too bad there's no money involved here.
3-female_must_strip,target:daria,targetStage:0=laughing,Way to half-ass your outfit, honey.  You look like you picked out whatever fell on you when you opened your closet!
3-female_must_strip,target:daria,targetStage:0=interested,...So is the "zero-effort" look how you attract Earth men?  Have I been going at this all wrong?
3-female_must_strip,target:daria,targetStage:0=smug,I should have known--men are too simple to understand complex outfits, so they respond better to cobbled-together looks like yours.
3-female_must_strip,target:daria,targetStage:0=laughing,Gotta be honest here, sweetheart--you don't look like the type to be playing this.  Those glasses aren't helping you pick out appealing clothes.
3-female_must_strip,target:daphne,targetStage:0=smug,Oh good, a fellow blonde...and tall, too.  Wasn't sure Earth girls could fit either category.
3-female_must_strip,target:daphne,targetStage:0=vain,You're not a bad looker yourself, honey.  Must be our wonderful blonde genetics that inform the rest of our bodies!
3-female_must_strip,target:daphne,targetStage:0=vain,You solve mysteries, is that right?  Well...there's no mystery about how wonderful it is to be blonde.
3-female_must_strip,target:daphne,targetStage:0=stretching,<i>Ho-hum</i>.  Another blonde in a dress...I'm just kidding, you're still cute.
3-female_must_strip,target:meg,targetStage:0=vain,What's with the hat, honey?  Take it off and let your hair run wild, like any woman's should!
3-female_must_strip,target:meg,targetStage:0=smug,Matting your lovely hair under a hat like that...even if you <i>do</i> run all the time, I just can't understand.
3-female_must_strip,target:meg,targetStage:0=smug,A <i>killer</i>, you said?  The only killer here is what that hat's doing to your hair.
3-female_must_strip,target:meg,targetStage:0=teasing,Check out Miss Exercise over here.  There's no running from <i>this</i> game...so drop the hat and let your hair breathe a while.
3-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:0=teasing,Ooh, an <i>assassin</i>.  I hope there's no bounty on my head!
3-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:0=stretching,Forgive this pirate for being a little on edge around an <i>assassin</i>.  There's a reward for my head, no doubt!
3-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:0=vain,You assassins always act so tough on the ground.  Let's see you take me in a dogfight!
3-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:0=teasing,You're a cute little thing, Miss Assassin.  I guess that helps in your line of work--people lower their guards.
3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:2=seductive,I'd call you crazy for this sort of thing, but how could I when you defy death like it's nothing?
3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:2=excited,You're just so <i>awesome</i>!  I can't get enough of this!
3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:2=teasing,Can you do it a <i>third</i> time, hotshot?  Yeah, probably.
3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:2=excited,I could watch you do this all day.  My heart jumps every time!

4-male_human_must_strip=stretching,A man lost.  What a stunning turn of events.
4-male_human_must_strip=interested,Hey, ~player~.  I know a charismatic shorty, a handsome doctor, and a goofball cadet.  Where do <i>you</i> stack up?
4-male_human_must_strip=smug,No different than your average Tarakkian outpost raid.
4-male_human_must_strip=seductive,Get a move on, ~player~.  Every bit of skin you show is a new experience for me!
4-male_human_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:human,marker:human=teasing,Hey there, Handsome.  You've got a different look about you than everyone else...but I can't quite put my finger on how.
4-male_human_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:human,marker:human=seductive,Hi, Mr. Man...I've only met a few men before, so you're <i>very</i> exotic to me.  Won't you please show me your naked body?
4-male_human_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:human,marker:human=seductive,Hey, Darling.  You should know I come from a planet of <i>all</i> women...so you being a man makes me interested already.
4-male_human_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:human,marker:human=seductive,Is that you, ~player~?  You haven't said much so far...but you should know how exotic men are to me, and how much I want to learn about them.
4-male_human_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:human,marker:human=seductive,You'll show me a good time, won't you, Handsome?  <i>I'm looking for a strong, healthy man to give me a baby, you know</i>.
4-male_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=interested,Got anything witty to say?  I hope so, because your cards aren't doing that for you.
4-male_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=teasing,Don't give out on me <i>now</i>, ~player~.  You're closer to seeing me nude than you think!
4-male_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=seductive,Come on, now.  What good is a man who can't fly steady down the stretch?
4-male_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=teasing,<i>Focus</i>, ~player~.  You're on the golden road...and I don't mean my hair.
4-male_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=laughing,Really hanging around, huh, ~player~?  Well, not enough to get me out of my dress!
4-male_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=teasing,Good work with that streak...but it wasn't enough to make me streak.
4-male_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=interested,I have to hand it to you, ~player~.  The men in my life are either terrible at cards or too serious to play them.
4-male_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=seductive,And you were <i>soooo</i> close to getting me out of my dress!  But no, it's your turn again.
4-male_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=teasing,Do men frustrate easily?  I hope so, because that streak could have saved you--and exposed <i>me</i>.
4-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rinkah,count-meia:1,count-corrin_f:1=smug,Hey, don't be rude to our little male friend here.  He's probably scared half to death, being around all these gorgeous women.
4-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rinkah,count-meia:1,count-corrin_f:1=laughing,Now, now, Rinkah.  That's no way to treat our lone man.  His little pea-brain can only handle so much stimulus.
4-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rinkah,count-meia:1,count-corrin_f:1=interested,Don't make fun, Rinkah.  At least he had the courage to come alone...or the stupidity.
4-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rinkah,count-meia:1,count-corrin_f:1=smug,It's not quite that dire.  Meia isn't exactly in a good mood, since I dragged her here.
4-male_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=teasing,Bad news, ~player~...that was the best chance you had for getting me out of this thing!  Did you <i>see</i> my hand?
4-male_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=seductive,Oh, my!  You threw the hand to let me keep my modesty?  You are just the <i>sweetest</i> thing, ~player~!
4-male_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=seductive,Just when I thought the dress had to go, ~player~ comes to my rescue.  <i>You're so sweet</i>!
4-male_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=confused,<i>The moment you've all been waiting f</i>--oh.  Well, uh, I won, but I guess I spoiled how I'm down to my dress now.
4-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=teasing,So, not to call you a harlot or anything, Misato, but you seem <i>awful</i> interested in these men...so am I.  How do you Earth girls get their attention?
4-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=confused,Ooh, you seem pretty confident around these Earth men, Misato.  From one woman to another, what's the secret to getting their attention?
4-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=confused,You seem to be doing a better job flirting with these Earth men, Misato.  Am I doing something wrong?  I always seem to scare them!
4-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=confused,Men just run away from me, usually...I thought they <i>like</i> being flirted with.  Misato, you seem to get them!
4-male_must_strip=stretching,A man lost.  What a stunning turn of events.
4-male_must_strip=interested,Hey, ~name~.  I know a charismatic shorty, a handsome doctor, and a goofball cadet.  Where do <i>you</i> stack up?
4-male_must_strip=smug,No different than your average Tarakkian outpost raid.
4-male_must_strip=seductive,Get a move on, ~name~.  Every bit of skin you show is a new experience for me!
4-male_must_strip,target:captain_america,targetStage:0=teasing,Woah, talk about <i>hunk</i>!  I want to see what those muscles can do, sweetheart.
4-male_must_strip,target:captain_america,targetStage:0=seductive,<i>Well, now</i>!  You look like just the big ball of hunk I've been searching for, cutie.
4-male_must_strip,target:captain_america,targetStage:0=teasing,Tall, check--muscles, check--handsome, <i>check</i>!  Looks like I've found me a winner, and he hasn't even stripped yet.
4-male_must_strip,target:captain_america,targetStage:0=seductive,<i>Oooh</i>!  Look at <i>you</i>, handsome!  Just the sort of man I hoped to see here!
4-male_must_strip,target:caleb,targetStage:0=confused,Oh look, a child-man.  What's the word--<i>boy</i>?  Anyway, I'm not gonna strip in front of a kid.
4-male_must_strip,target:caleb,targetStage:0=annoyed,Hey, kid, I know you're male, but can't you read?  No kids allowed.
4-male_must_strip,target:caleb,targetStage:0=annoyed,I'm gonna ignore the cat ears for a second and focus on how you look like you're twelve.  Beat it, kid, adults are trying to have fun here.
4-male_must_strip,target:caleb,targetStage:0=bored,...Listen, honey, we're playing a grown-up game for grown-ups.  You've got to leave...so I don't feel like a pedophile.
4-male_must_strip,target:caleb,targetStage:0=awkward,Hibiki's just short, but you...I don't think you're an adult.  Can't be sure with men, but still...
4-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:5=teasing,It's now or never, Little Dungeon Bot.  Going to look me in the eyes for once?
4-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:5=laughing,I spy with my little eye something you can still take off, Dungeon Robo.  That's because my eyes are uncovered.
4-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:5=interested,Sure you don't want to part with that blindfold, Mr. Robo-man?  Are you aware of the alternative, darling?
4-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:5=interested,Looks like Little Dungeon Bot is all out of dungeon items...well, except for the most striking one of all.
4-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:2=vain,I can't get over how cute you are, honey...but seriously, what's with the angel outfit?  Men are no angels.
4-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:2=smug,Men have always struck as more <i>beastly</i> than angelic...which is fine by me.  So why do you dress like one?
4-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:2=confused,So, uh, I read about angels as a girl, but they were always women.  Why are you dolled-up like one, anyway?
4-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:2=confused,Do those wings detach?  They look pretty convincing, and the rest of your angel outfit is pretty good.  Why do you have that on, anyway?
4-male_must_strip,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:0=confused,So "gay" is the Earth word for how Tarakkians live?  Actually, I'm not sure they even form couples there...
4-male_must_strip,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:0=smug,A man loving other men?  Well, if women can do it, I suppose men can...not that I really picture men capable of love.
4-male_must_strip,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:0=interested,Is this what man-on-man love does to your appearance?  Because you're a scary-looking customer.
4-male_must_strip,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:0=confused,You know, they taught me as a girl that men were monsters...you fit the part.  And apparently you don't like women, is that right?
4-male_must_strip,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:0=interested,If "gay" means what I think it does, I guess teasing you isn't going to get me anywhere...not that I <i>want</i> to see you naked.
4-male_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=interested,Got anything witty to say?  I hope so, because your cards aren't doing that for you.
4-male_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=teasing,Don't give out on me <i>now</i>, ~name~.  You're closer to seeing me nude than you think!
4-male_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=seductive,Come on, now.  What good is a man who can't fly steady down the stretch?
4-male_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=teasing,<i>Focus</i>, ~name~.  You're on the golden road...and I don't mean my hair.
4-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:1=interested,<i>Pod this, data that</i>...you talk like you're a machine.  Why the formality, dear?
4-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:1=interested,Why do you talk like you're a robot half the time, huh?  Loosen up and enjoy yourself--if men can do that, of course.
4-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:1=interested,Hey, what's with all your formal data-mechanics babble?  You sound like you just rolled off the factory line, dearie.
4-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:1=seductive,Are you so polite and deferent and robotlike because you're short?  Because the short man <i>I</i> know is a real fireball!
4-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:1=laughing,Hey, darling little boy...why so mechanical in waist and taste?  I know <i>Tarakkians</i> are made in factories, but <i>sheesh</i>.
4-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=seductive,Well, aren't <i>you</i> cute!  And you're dressed in all that fancy armor.  What's your name, girlie?
4-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=seductive,You are just the most <i>adorable</i> thing, even in all that heavy armor.  Can't you take it off and show us what an Earth woman looks like?
4-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,You're cute, dear!  Look, Meia, she even cut her hair short like you do!  Must be big on practicality, too.
4-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,A woman in armor?  Meia, this girl is trying to get on your good side...matching outfits like that.
4-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:4=shocked,<i>Eep</i>!  O-oh, you <i>can</i> talk?  B-but...why didn't you?
4-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:4=interested,...So are you over your fear of women now?  Is that what the grunting was all about?
4-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:4=seductive,Oh, you <i>can</i> talk.  Did my beauty make you clam up, cutie?
4-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:4=smug,Well, that solves <i>that</i> mystery.  Come on and join us in the land of language like a civilized person.
4-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:4=smug,Oh, good, you can talk.  I had really lost all hope for men's intelligence for a while there.
4-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:4=shocked,<i>Ack</i>!  Wha--o-oh, you're done screaming!  Uh...OK.
4-male_must_strip,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:0=smug,And I thought <i>I</i> was enthusiastic.  This man's blowing me out of the water.
4-male_must_strip,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:0=interested,Talk about bringing energy to the table.  Planning on winning this thing, or just shouting about it?
4-male_must_strip,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:0=laughing,Well, <i>someone's</i> a feisty one.  Hibiki's energetic, but you've got the body to match, hot stuff.
4-male_must_strip,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:0=confused,You're some kind of racecar driver or something?  Seems you're permanently amped-up from it.
4-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena,count-meia:1=teasing,You <i>work</i> for this woman, Pit?  Look at that, Meia...it must be <i>Take-Your-Boss-to-Strip</i> Day.
4-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena,count-meia:1=smug,Oh, wow, this woman is your boss?  I guess I have no room to talk, considering I brought Miss Ice Queen along for the ride.
4-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena,count-meia:1=teasing,Look, Meia, this cute little angel-boy brought his boss, too!  I guess he and I are both into taking our superiors down a peg.
4-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena,count-meia:1=smug,Well, what do you know?  Pit brought this boss here too, Meia.  Only ~player~ has any sense, it seems.
4-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=seductive,Omigosh, there's <i>two</i> of you girls?  Are you twins?  I heard Earth people could have matching babies called twins!
4-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=seductive,Ohh, you two ladies are so <i>adorable</i>!  One of you even cut your hair short, just like Meia does!
4-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=seductive,Well, what have we here?  Two cute little ladies dressed in matching armor sets?
4-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=confused,Wait, you're <i>both</i> named Corrin?  Look, girls, I know one's hair is short, but you should really dress different.
4-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:1=teasing,You've got to tell me more about yourself, Pit!  You're so darn shy...and I'm so <i>curious</i>!
4-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:1=seductive,Such a little motormouth, but it <i>alllll</i> clams up when I swing my gaze your way.  I love having this effect on cute little boys!
4-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:1=seductive,Come on, Mr. Angel, don't be shy!  I mean, it's cute, but I want to learn more about Earth men!
4-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:1=seductive,There's <i>so much</i> you could teach me about men, Pit...the men in my life always reject me.  And you're so nonthreatening!
4-male_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=teasing,Bad news, ~name~...that was the best chance you had for getting me out of this thing!  Did you <i>see</i> my hand?
4-male_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=seductive,Oh, my!  You threw the hand to let me keep my modesty?  You are just the <i>sweetest</i> thing, ~name~!
4-male_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=seductive,Just when I thought the dress had to go, ~name~ comes to my rescue.  <i>You're so sweet</i>!
4-male_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=confused,<i>The moment you've all been waiting f</i>--oh.  Well, uh, I won, but I guess I spoiled how I'm down to my dress now.
4-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0=seductive,Well, what do we have here?  An adorable little cinnamon roll of a man, dressed up as an angel!
4-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0=seductive,You are just the cutest little man I've ever seen!  Hibiki's a little smaller, but he's got too much spunk to be cute.
4-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0=excited,Ohhh, you're so <i>cute</i>, Mr. Angel!  I could just <i>eat you up</i>!
4-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0=teasing,What's an adorable little man like you doing here, Pit?  Sure you want to strip nude in front of these scary, hulking women?
4-male_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=laughing,Really hanging around, huh, ~name~?  Well, not enough to get me out of my dress!
4-male_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=teasing,Good work with that streak...but it wasn't enough to make me streak.
4-male_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=interested,I have to hand it to you, ~name~.  The men in my life are either terrible at cards or too serious to play them.
4-male_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=seductive,And you were <i>soooo</i> close to getting me out of my dress!  But no, it's your turn again.
4-male_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=teasing,Do men frustrate easily?  I hope so, because that streak could have saved you--and exposed <i>me</i>.
4-male_must_strip,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=confused,Well, now!  There's bizarre specimens, and then there's you.  Are you a man or a woman?
4-male_must_strip,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=confused,I can't really pin down your sex, to be honest...or your species, for that matter.
4-male_must_strip,target:mettaton,targetStage:0,marker:fama_and_oma=vain,Weren't you made in a lab?  So were all Mejarians before our Famas carried us!  ...But I'm not sure if you're a woman.
4-male_must_strip,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=confused,Way to go ahead and be the ultimate test of judging men vs. women.  Gotta say, I'm stumped.
4-male_must_strip,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=confused,...Oh, you're one of those <i>ann-drazza-nuss</i> types, right?  That's the word?
4-male_must_strip,target:mettaton,targetStage:0,marker:fama_and_oma=confused,Mejarians get made in labs, too...but our Famas carry us.  So maybe you're a man, then?  Tarakkians are carried to term in labs...
4-male_must_strip,target:kira,targetStage:0=teasing,Ooh, you're a handsome one...and blond, which is even better.  I see you eyeing me up...
4-male_must_strip,target:kira,targetStage:0=seductive,Hi there, sweetheart...what was your name again?  I forgot it when I got lost in your beautiful blond hair.
4-male_must_strip,target:kira,targetStage:0=seductive,I wasn't sure if men could pull off blonde hair the way women do...but you're living proof.  I'll keep my eye on you...
4-male_must_strip,target:kira,targetStage:0=seductive,Ah, <i>here's</i> what I've been looking for!  A handsome blond man.  <i>Try not to sweep me off my feet, darling</i>.
4-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:0=laughing,Wow, a <i>blindfold</i> at a table full of strangers?  I never knew men could be so...<i>depraved</i>.
4-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:0=interested,You're, uh, really making up for your stature with the fetish gear.  Can't look me in the eye, sweetheart?
4-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:0=interested,I knew men could be cowardly, but damn.  Even the <i>Tarakkians</i> I know can look a woman in the eye.
4-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:0=interested,So the blindfold's going first, right?  So you can actually read the cards from now on?
4-male_must_strip,target:fred,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, maybe I'll take <i>your</i> seed.  You're tall and handsome...and most importantly, you're blond.
4-male_must_strip,target:fred,targetStage:0=teasing,What's this, now?  You solve mysteries?  Solve this, honey...whose handsome blond seed am I seriously considering taking right now?
4-male_must_strip,target:fred,targetStage:0=laughing,Hi there, handsome blond man!  You look like you could use a woman at your side...or maybe on top of you.
4-male_must_strip,target:fred,targetStage:0=interested,Duero might have better hair, but yours is blond...that's definitely a plus where I come from.
4-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, hey, hey--check out <i>this</i> handsome stud!  What brings <i>you</i> here, Mr. Cool-and-Casual?
4-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:0=teasing,You look like you're right at home, Mr. Lackadaisical.  You know what I like in my men?  <i>Handsomeness</i>...like yours.
4-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:0=seductive,Hey, Jacket-and-Pants.  You look a little sleepy, but I can't deny how you're making my heart beat faster.  What's your story?
4-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:0=seductive,I can't take my eyes off you, handsome, even if <i>yours</i> seem a little sleepy.  Mind telling me about yourself?
4-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=seductive,Well, aren't <i>you</i> cute!  And you're dressed in all that fancy armor.  What's your name, girlie?
4-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=seductive,You are just the most <i>adorable</i> thing, even in all that heavy armor.  Can't you take it off and show us what an Earth woman looks like?
4-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=seductive,You're cute, dear!  You've even cut your hair short like Meia does.  Women can pull that off sometimes!
4-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=laughing,A woman in armor?  You're after Meia's own heart, you sly little thing!  Too bad she isn't here.
4-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:2=smug,Hey, so what's with those "Neighbors" you keep talking about?  I mean, Mejare certainly doesn't get along with <i>its</i> neighbors.
4-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:2=seductive,Hey, Handsome, when you say you fight Neighbors, how big a scale are we talking?  Let's just say neighboring planet Tarak isn't our best friend.
4-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:2=interested,Who are these "Neighbors" you say you fight?  Is this like a front-lawn kind of dispute, or do you mean as a solider?
4-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:2=interested,Did you say you fight neighbors, darling?  Mejarians usually fight their neighbors over gardening, unless we're talking planets.
4-male_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=teasing,So, not to call you a harlot or anything, Misato, but you seem <i>awful</i> interested in these men...so am I.  How do you Earth girls get their attention?
4-male_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=confused,Ooh, you seem pretty confident around these Earth men, Misato.  From one woman to another, what's the secret to getting their attention?
4-male_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=confused,You seem to be doing a better job flirting with these Earth men, Misato.  Am I doing something wrong?  I always seem to scare them!
4-male_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=confused,Men just run away from me, usually...I thought they <i>like</i> being flirted with.  Misato, you seem to get them!
4-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=annoyed,<i>And who do we have he</i>--oh.  El Shaggy Blanco.  Great choice, ~player~.
4-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=frustrated,...You know, I put a lot of effort into having all these lines, and then you go and stick me with El Shaggy Blanco.
4-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=teasing,Thought I wouldn't have lines to April Fools' characters?  Well, think again, ~player~.
4-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=vain,Everyone give ~player~ a round of applause...they figured out how to use the offline version, as you can see.
4-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=annoyed,...I know you're proud of yourself for deciphering the offline version, ~player~, but you don't have to pick meme characters.
4-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=smug,Excellent character selection, ~player~.  You picked a joke that stopped being funny in 2017...whenever that was in Earth years.
4-male_must_strip,target:xander,targetStage:0=teasing,You're friends with that <i>Buffy</i> girl, right?  Well...<i>gonna seal the deal, or what</i>?
4-male_must_strip,target:xander,targetStage:0=interested,Well, you don't look so bad for a man.  Am I in competition with that Buffy woman?
4-male_must_strip,target:xander,targetStage:0=teasing,Not to be too forward or anything, but I'm on the prowl for a good man...for reasons you'll know soon enough.  Interested?
4-male_must_strip,target:xander,targetStage:0=vain,You're a pretty average-looking man.  I can live with that...but I bet they don't make women like <i>me</i> where you come from.
4-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:0=interested,So are you, uh, going to produce actual <i>words</i> at some point?  Or is grunting and yelling all I can expect from a man?
4-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:0=smug,...I mean, I tease men about being stupid, but <i>did</i> think they were capable of <i>speech</i>.
4-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:0=laughing,...It would seem men haven't quite evolved up to the point of grasping language.  What a shame.
4-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:0=laughing,...You're really showing me new lows for male intelligence, Link.  Grunt again if you agree.
4-male_must_strip,target:bi,targetStage:0=frustrated,...<i>Ew</i>.  What's wrong with your hands...and your <i>face</i>?
4-male_must_strip,target:bi,targetStage:0=annoyed,...I've got to be honest here.  You are <i>very</i> ugly...and I hate ugly things.
4-male_must_strip,target:bi,targetStage:0=annoyed,...Would it have killed you to wash yourself before coming here?  Or maybe not come at all?  I would've preferred that.
4-male_must_strip,target:bi,targetStage:0=angry,...OK, <i>ew</i>.  I wouldn't collect your seed if it meant they'd make me the Grand Ma for it.
4-male_must_strip,target:shaggy,targetStage:0=bored,Uh...you're kind of tall, I guess, but it doesn't look like you wash yourself much.  Gross.
4-male_must_strip,target:shaggy,targetStage:0=annoyed,I know you're a man, but can't you put a <i>little</i> effort into your appearance?  You look like you just rolled out of a gutter.
4-male_must_strip,target:shaggy,targetStage:0=smug,"Shaggy," huh?  That'd be like if my nickname were "Gorgeous."  Actually, I'll have to propose that next flight practice...
4-male_must_strip,target:shaggy,targetStage:0=frustrated,Gangly, unshaven, all around a mess.  I'm starting to miss the clean-cut professionalism of the Tarakkian soldiers I know.
4-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=laughing,I see ~player~ has grown so desperate at the gender disparity in this game that they've turned to <i>Kool-Aid Man</i> for their fix.
4-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=annoyed,...Listen, ~player~, I get that this game doesn't have too many men, but you're better than this.  Pick a real character.
4-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=bored,Doesn't bode well for your opinion of me that you'd stick me with <i>this</i> idiot, ~player~.
4-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=awkward,...<i>Kool-Aid Man</i>, huh, ~player~?  That's...your choice?  Are you sure?
4-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=frustrated,<i>Kool-Aid Man</i>?  ...Do I <i>have</i> to keep playing?  If ~player~'s not gonna take this seriously, why should I?
4-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=interested,You're really starved for some male players, aren't you, ~player~?  Couldn't you pick, I don't know, Pit?  9S?  Come on.
4-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=annoyed,...What the hell am I looking at?  Forget playing against, just...<i>looking at</i>.
4-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=bored,...My beauty deserves better tablemates than this.
4-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=vain,On the female side of things, we have the most beautiful woman on the roster.  And on the male side of things, well...well.
4-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena=laughing,Wait, wait, wait.  You <i>work</i> for this woman?  Quite the little boss-employee bonding exercise.
4-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena=interested,Oh wow, you two <i>work</i> together?  I mean, Meia's my boss, but we at least went to different tables.
4-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena=vain,You take orders from this woman, Pit?  Men and women, working together...I see how Earth operates.
4-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena=laughing,<i>Well, now</i>!  You work for this woman...how very, very awkward, Mr. Angel.
4-male_must_strip,target:ryu,targetStage:0=laughing,Hey, hey, hey!  Talk about a hunk...and he's not even wearing much!  <i>Perfect</i>.
4-male_must_strip,target:ryu,targetStage:0=teasing,You look like you see a lot of physical action, hot stuff...can those big muscles toss me around?
4-male_must_strip,target:ryu,targetStage:0=laughing,A big hunk of a man with more muscles than brainpower?  Just what I've been looking for.
4-male_must_strip,target:ryu,targetStage:0=teasing,You seem a little clueless about this game, handsome.  Don't worry...<i>I'll guide you along</i>.
4-female_human_must_strip=vain,Look this way while you do it, ~player~.  I won't judge...not out loud, anyway.
4-female_human_must_strip=teasing,Hey, ~player~.  Might be weird to you, but I grew up learning to <i>love</i> women...
4-female_human_must_strip=laughing,Hey, if you find yourself up against Meia, watch out--that zipper's in <i>front</i>.
4-female_human_must_strip=smug,Just luck, all luck.  No use getting all bent out of shape in this game.
4-female_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:meia,priority:0=vain,Look this way while you do it, ~player~.  I won't judge...not out loud, anyway.
4-female_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:meia,priority:0=teasing,Hey, ~player~.  Might be weird to you, but I grew up learning to <i>love</i> women...
4-female_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:meia,priority:0=smug,Just luck, all luck.  No use getting all bent out of shape in this game.
4-female_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=smug,What kind of self-respecting woman drops the ball with her opponent so close to being shamed?  <i>Earth girls</i>...
4-female_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=laughing,Trying to beat me to the punch with all the glorious reveals?  Or did you just forget how cards work?
4-female_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=interested,What's up, ~player~?  Too preoccupied with thoughts of male tubes to focus on the cards?
4-female_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=teasing,I know Earth girls are scared of each others' bodies, but come on, don't you <i>want</i> to see me out of this dress?
4-female_human_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:human,marker:human=teasing,I come from a world of all women, so you're nothing special to me.  But you <i>are</i> very cute, so I've got my eye on you, Missy.
4-female_human_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:human,marker:human=seductive,And who's <i>this</i> tight-lipped specimen?  "~player~"?  If you say so...<i>cutie</i>.
4-female_human_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:human,marker:human=seductive,Yet another woman?  Like a drop in the bucket for a Mejarian...but even still, you're <i>far</i> cuter than I expected for an Earth girl.
4-female_human_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:human,marker:human=seductive,You're a little more simply-dressed than the exotic types that seem to frequent this place, myself included.  But you sure have a cute face!
4-female_human_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:human,marker:human=vain,And who are <i>you</i>,~player~?  You've barely said a thing...but you can admire my beauty too, if you want!
4-female_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=interested,For a second there, I thought I'd actually <i>lose</i> to an Earth woman.  But you just couldn't keep it together.
4-female_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=smug,Yeah, yeah.  We always outlast your little Harvest-bots, too, so no surprise.
4-female_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=teasing,Don't you want to see me show off the good stuff?  Well then, I hope you have another streak like that left in you!
4-female_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=teasing,Oh, ~player~?  That lucky run wasn't lucky enough.  Too bad!
4-female_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=stretching,Keep it up.  I like women with a little fight in them...like Barnette.
4-female_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=teasing,Bad news, ~player~...that was the best chance you had for getting me out of this thing!  Did you <i>see</i> my hand?
4-female_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=seductive,Oh, my!  You threw the hand to let me keep my modesty?  You are just the <i>sweetest</i> thing, ~player~!
4-female_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=seductive,Just when I thought the dress had to go, ~player~ comes to my rescue.  <i>You're so sweet</i>!
4-female_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=confused,<i>The moment you've all been waiting f</i>--oh.  Well, uh, I won, but I guess I spoiled how I'm down to my dress now.
4-female_must_strip=vain,Look this way while you do it, ~name~.  I won't judge...not out loud, anyway.
4-female_must_strip=teasing,Hey, ~name~.  Might be weird to you, but I grew up learning to <i>love</i> women...
4-female_must_strip=laughing,Hey, if you find yourself up against Meia, watch out--that zipper's in <i>front</i>.
4-female_must_strip=smug,Just luck, all luck.  No use getting all bent out of shape in this game.
4-female_must_strip,target:meg,targetStage:0=vain,What's with the hat, honey?  Take it off and let your hair run wild, like any woman's should!
4-female_must_strip,target:meg,targetStage:0=smug,Matting your lovely hair under a hat like that...even if you <i>do</i> run all the time, I just can't understand.
4-female_must_strip,target:meg,targetStage:0=smug,A <i>killer</i>, you said?  The only killer here is what that hat's doing to your hair.
4-female_must_strip,target:meg,targetStage:0=teasing,Check out Miss Exercise over here.  There's no running from <i>this</i> game...so drop the hat and let your hair breathe a while.
4-female_must_strip,target:pauling,targetStage:0=teasing,Nice sensible little outfit you've got there.  The glasses sell the sexy-and-smart look!
4-female_must_strip,target:pauling,targetStage:0=teasing,Working for an old woman, eh?  I know the feeling.  Those glasses must have convinced her you knew what you were doing.
4-female_must_strip,target:pauling,targetStage:0=stretching,A woman with glasses, eh?  <i>I</i> certainly couldn't pull off the look...I guess I don't look very smart.
4-female_must_strip,target:pauling,targetStage:0=smug,I know an engineering egghead with glasses--Parfet's her name.  And she seems to attract what few smart men I know.
4-female_must_strip,target:lux,targetStage:0=laughing,A covert agent, eh?  I guess if an alien woman knows that, you've already failed at your job.
4-female_must_strip,target:lux,targetStage:0=teasing,So what are you so <i>covert</i> about, Miss Agent?  We pirates just charge in and gun the place down before they know what hit them!
4-female_must_strip,target:lux,targetStage:0=interested,What kind of covert agent fights with light?  You know, the thing that makes your position <i>clearer</i>?
4-female_must_strip,target:lux,targetStage:0=smug,Oho--we've got an <i>agent</i> on our hands.  Wouldn't be the first we had on our ship--and we made her come around to our side.
4-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=seductive,Hey there, Miss Star-Student!  That's a school uniform, right?  What do they teach you on Earth?
4-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=teasing,Check out the uniformed student type!  I was never good in school--but what is it they teach you on Earth, huh?
4-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=vain,Mejare's schools are nothing but <i>men this, violence that</i>, with a little math.  How does your fancy Earth education compare?
4-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=vain,A student, huh?  Do they teach you anything interesting on Earth?  I was never a brainiac, but I still rose to be a pilot!
4-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, an Earth girl still in school!  Have they taught you anything about men?  What do they teach you in general?
4-female_must_strip,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0=laughing,Judging by that sword, you're not from Earth either, Miss Crystal.  Where can I get one of those?
4-female_must_strip,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0=smug,Don't ask me why that thing is <i>drawn</i>, but damn if it isn't more impressive than my silly little rapier.  Got any extras?
4-female_must_strip,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, I like the look of that glowing sword!  Even <i>Mejare</i> hasn't though to put its lasers in blades yet.
4-female_must_strip,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0=smug,I could do for an upgrade on this rapier--would you please refer me to the planet where they make those glowing swords?
4-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:0=awkward,Uh...you want to calm down there, sweetheart?  Maybe put that men's gun down?  Take a nap?
4-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:0=bored,Jeez, we knew you meant business by the gun.  No need to shout...must be men's influence.
4-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:0=frustrated,Can you pipe down?  Way to confirm the image of Earth girls as nasty little gun-toting balls of violence.
4-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:0=shocked,Uh...why are you carrying that giant men's gun?  I'd show it to Barnette, but you, uh, don't seem too friendly.
4-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:0=bored,That's a huge gun, Miss Moxie...men's mechanical weapons are so noisy and inefficient.  Don't tell Barnette I said that.
4-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:0=interested,What's up, Ocean Girl?  You seem awfully eager.  Does being around men tend to hypersexualize a woman?
4-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:0=smug,Jeez, it didn't take a loss for you to start piping up about stripping.  You don't need a <i>game</i> to do that, you know.
4-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:0=interested,And here we have Miss Eager-Beaver.  You don't look like you have the assets to be all excited about stripping, sweetheart.
4-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:0=stretching,At least you're confident about nudity.  But are you seriously just losing on purpose?  <i>Earth girls</i>...
4-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=confused,...You're not from Earth either, are you?  ...Or human.  Or cute.
4-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=confused,Say, Miss, I couldn't help but notice your...eye.  What planet are you from, exactly?
4-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=awkward,And here I thought I'd be seeing some <i>Earth</i> women in this place...or that I'd be the most exotic one.
4-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=laughing,Always nice to look a woman in the eye.  Singular.
4-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=smug,I guess they don't value depth perception on whatever planet you're from.  You must be a real steal.
4-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=interested,Magno Vivan's pirates accept all women...but with depth perception like yours, you wouldn't make it as a pilot.
4-female_must_strip,target:orendi,targetStage:0=confused,...You OK there, Fireball?  You on the same planet as the rest of us?
4-female_must_strip,target:orendi,targetStage:0=confused,I may <i>be</i> an alien...but you're certainly acting like one.
4-female_must_strip,target:orendi,targetStage:0=annoyed,Four arms looks useful, but I really can't get over the constant shouting.  Can't you pipe down?
4-female_must_strip,target:orendi,targetStage:0=frustrated,Hey, Earth-girl.  Or wherever you're from.  There's this thing called an <i>indoor</i> voice.
4-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0=excited,Omigosh!  <i>Omigosh</i>!  You are just the <i>cutest</i> little thing, Nagisa!  You're practically a little girl--who forced you to be here?
4-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0=seductive,<i>Ohhhh</i>, you're the most adorable little cinnamon roll of a girl, Nagisa!  Who rolled you in sugar before forcing you to come here?
4-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0=seductive,<i>You're such a sweet little thing, Nagisa</i>!  My heart melts every time you stammer.  Did you lose a bet to be here?
4-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0=seductive,How'd this sugary-sweet cutie in a school uniform end up in this seedy place?  I just want to <i>squeeze</i> you, not strip you!
4-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0=seductive,And I thought Earth girls were cold-blooded organ harvesters.  You couldn't harvest a <i>plant</i>, cutie!  How'd you get here?
4-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, cutie!  You look like you've got some kind of rank to your name, with that beret--care to share any details?
4-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, you're not a bad looker, Earth-girl!  I like that exotic purple hair.  What is it you do, exactly?
4-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0=seductive,Tell me more about your exciting "NERV" job, Miss Military.  I want to know <i>all about</i> Earth!
4-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0=teasing,Ohoho--a <i>military</i> woman.  Well, indulge this filthy pirate scum and share what it is you do all day.
4-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:5=shocked,Bless you--<i>oh no</i>.
4-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:5=shocked,Who sneezed--<i>eep!  N-not Launch</i>!
4-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:5=shocked,<i>Ack!  Why'd you have to sneeze again</i>?
4-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:5=shocked,<i>Eek!  N-not again!  My heart can't take this</i>!
4-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:4=excited,Forget the common language, Marinette, your "French" sounds like the most <i>romantic</i> thing!  You've <i>got</i> to say some more.
4-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:4=excited,<i>Oooh, Marinette</i>!  Can you say some more "French"?  My heart beats faster every time your tongue slips!
4-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:4=seductive,You should say some more French, Marinette!  It's got the <i>silkiest</i> sound to it--it makes my heart go wild!
4-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:4=seductive,Oooh, Marinette, since it's your turn, can you throw out some more of this "French"?  It sounds like a <i>lover's</i> language.
4-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=stretching,...Yeah, we're gonna be here a while.  This girl's dressed for the vacuum of space.
4-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=interested,Does it really get that cold on Earth?  Or <i>anywhere</i>, for that matter?
4-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=interested,You're from Planet China, is that right?  Must be one big snowball if <i>that's</i> in vogue over there.
4-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=laughing,I understand why you must be so cold.  Your name is pretty close to <i>Meia</i>, after all.
4-female_must_strip,target:penny,targetStage:0=smug,Looks like we've found an Earth girl who's just decided to embrace the whole "boring conservatism" stereotype.  At least your hair is a fiery red.
4-female_must_strip,target:penny,targetStage:0=teasing,That fiery red hair contrasts your rather plain outfit.  But it's not a bad look overall!
4-female_must_strip,target:penny,targetStage:0=vain,<i>Finally</i>, a normal-looking Earth girl.  I need a measuring stick to compare all these superpowered weirdos to...all you've got is that red hair.
4-female_must_strip,target:penny,targetStage:0=seductive,Good, a civilian girl.  So many people at this bar are such colorful characters--oh, but your hair is pretty vibrant, I guess.
4-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=laughing,Ooh, a <i>lady</i> doctor!  The Nirvana's only doctor is a man--I wonder if he'd lose his cool with you gunning for his spot.
4-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=vain,Honestly, I'm torn!  You're a cute woman doctor--and <i>blonde</i>!  But our ship's doctor is a man with rather nice hair himself.
4-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=teasing,Ooh, a doctor from Earth!  I bet that makes you an <i>expert</i> on male sexuality, doesn't it?
4-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, a woman doctor is <i>just</i> what I've been looking for!  Think you could help me and Barnette get pregnant?
4-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=vain,Female <i>and</i> blonde...if only Duero were blond, then he'd be the perfect doctor for me.  So <i>handsome</i>...
4-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, Miss Medicine.  Since you're from Earth, I might have a few questions about men's tubes tonight.
4-female_must_strip,target:paya,targetStage:0=smug,My sympathies about the premature white hair, honey.  You look a lot older than you should.
4-female_must_strip,target:paya,targetStage:0=confused,You might want to rethink those facial markings, dear.  With that white hair, they look an awful lot like wrinkles.
4-female_must_strip,target:paya,targetStage:0=laughing,Couples can choose their babies' hair color on Mejare thanks to genetic engineering...there's a reason white isn't very popular.
4-female_must_strip,target:paya,targetStage:0=stretching,You poor thing.  Our captain's ancient, but even <i>she</i> still has color in her hair.
4-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey there, Miss Gunslinger!  You're not gonna <i>fire</i> those things, are you?  My girlfriend collects those sorts of guns.
4-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=seductive,Omigosh, are those antique men's kinetic weapons?  My girlfriend collects them!  You should meet her.
4-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=seductive,Always good to see an armed woman!  My girlfriend, Barnette, is totally obsessed with men's mechanical guns like yours.
4-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=vain,Hey, Miss Gunslinger!  You should lighten up a little and show those men's kinetic guns to my girlfriend.  She's a total connoisseur.
4-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=teasing,I like the grace of Mejarian laser rings myself, but you want some serious interest on those men's guns of yours?  Talk to my girlfriend.
4-female_must_strip,target:may,targetStage:0=smug,What'd you say you did?  Train in poker?  Well, it didn't save you <i>that</i> hand...unless they're animals or something.
4-female_must_strip,target:may,targetStage:0=stretching,So, you're all about <i>poker</i>-mon, was it?  Well, seems you've been training all your life for this game...
4-female_must_strip,target:may,targetStage:0=frustrated,These <i>pokuhmon</i> things just sound like more trouble than they're worth.  Animals in Mejarian zoos are so <i>dirty</i>!
4-female_must_strip,target:may,targetStage:0=confused,You're an animal trainer, isn't that right?  Or was it <i>poker</i>...mons?  Not following the Earth slang here.
4-female_must_strip,target:marceline,targetStage:0=bored,...Is someone playing a Halloween prank on me?  Where are your eyes?  How are you floating?  <i>Earth</i>...
4-female_must_strip,target:marceline,targetStage:0=confused,Don't get me wrong, Mejare has Halloween just like Earth...but we just dress up.  That doesn't look like a costume.
4-female_must_strip,target:marceline,targetStage:0=confused,...OK, it's hard to comment on what's weird about you when there's so much to choose from.  Do I start with your floating or your eyes?
4-female_must_strip,target:marceline,targetStage:0=confused,...Is this Earth?  Did I get the right planet?  Because you like even more alien that I do, with that skin...and no eyes.
4-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:3=bored,Is there a doctor in the building?  One specializing in mental health?
4-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:3=frustrated,...This isn't funny anymore.  Now I'm just worried about you.
4-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:3=frustrated,...This is getting old.  <i>I'm</i> getting old listening to this.
4-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:3=annoyed,What a surprise.  Intentionally throwing the game tends to make you lose.
4-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:1=seductive,Omigosh, Palutena, that gorgeous green hair is even longer than mine!  My <i>girlfriend</i> has green hair, you know.
4-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:1=vain,How do you <i>maintain</i> all that hair?  I have the best time washing mine...and wrapping my green-haired girlfriend in it.
4-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:1=seductive,You know who else has beautiful green hair, Miss Goddess?  My girlfriend, Barnette.  That sweet little thing is back on the ship!
4-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:1=stretching,So is that lovely green hair just the goddess's right?  My girlfriend got hers from standard Mejarian genetic trickery.
4-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0=seductive,Well, hi there, Miss Accent!  That is just the <i>cutest</i> polka-dot bodysuit you have on!
4-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0=seductive,Omigosh, your funny accent is so <i>cute</i>!  It matches your goofy polka-dotted suit.
4-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0=laughing,Well, aren't <i>you</i> the most adorable thing!  All dolled up in polka dots, stumbling over your words!  I could just <i>gobble you up</i>!
4-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0=seductive,That's a pretty darling suit, sweetie, with all the polka dots.  And the way you trip over your words just makes me <i>melt</i>!
4-female_must_strip,target:mileena,targetStage:0=smug,...OK, no one here has any right to call me skimpily-dressed with Bandages here running around.
4-female_must_strip,target:mileena,targetStage:0=stretching,What kind of sex-crazed planet considers that street clothes?  And here I thought Earth was conservative.
4-female_must_strip,target:mileena,targetStage:0=laughing,...Seems I've walking into a game that is well in progress.  Poor thing has been losing so badly!
4-female_must_strip,target:mileena,targetStage:0=laughing,Jeez.  I'm a <i>pirate</i>, and I can afford more clothing than you.  Too bad there's no money involved here.
4-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, a dark-skinned woman!  We only have a few of those on Mejare--you'd turn heads, Miss Exotic.  And your outfit would fit right in.
4-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=teasing,Talk about a fierce look in your eye--and even skimpier clothing than me!  But you make it work, Miss Chocolate.
4-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=seductive,Hey there, cutie!  Between that exotic dark skin and light dress, you'd be a real steal where <i>I'm</i> from!
4-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=teasing,You're already a model Mejarian with that much skin showing, Miss Warrior.  <i>I'd like to see some sweat roll off those chocolate-flavored muscles</i>.
4-female_must_strip,target:lilith,targetStage:0=vain,Planet <i>Pandora</i>, was it?  What a lovely name!  I might have to retire there with my darling Barnette when we're older.
4-female_must_strip,target:lilith,targetStage:0=vain,Pandora sounds like such a <i>gorgeous</i> name.  I think I'll call my first daughter that--surely Barnette won't mind.
4-female_must_strip,target:lilith,targetStage:0=teasing,Barnette and I are <i>always</i> discussing baby names.  Pandora sounds positively wonderful!
4-female_must_strip,target:lilith,targetStage:0=teasing,A hunter, eh?  And what do hunters hunt on lovely little Pandora--a cute name, by the way.
4-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=smug,<i>Well, well, well</i>.  We've got a <i>goddess</i> here, ladies...besides me, of course.
4-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=vain,A <i>goddess</i>, eh?  I guess that makes <i>two</i> at this table, then.
4-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=teasing,Just look at that shimmering green hair--and that ornamentation!  But I think I'm every bit the goddess you are, hot stuff.
4-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=laughing,Just look at that--two goddesses, near-opposite color schemes.  I guess I'm the <i>evil, nasty</i> one.
4-female_must_strip,target:mia,targetStage:0=vain,<i>My, my</i>!  You work in the <i>law</i>?  This old pirate better be careful around you.
4-female_must_strip,target:mia,targetStage:0=teasing,So you do something with the law, huh?  Think you could defend my murderous pirate self in a courtroom?
4-female_must_strip,target:mia,targetStage:0=vain,So what's a "lawyer" do all day?  Pushing papers around sounds dreadfully boring when you're a daredevil star pilot.
4-female_must_strip,target:mia,targetStage:0=laughing,I see you're quite well-endowed there, Miss Magistrate.  Is that how you win people over in your legal arguments?
4-female_must_strip,target:piper,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey there, Miss Meterstick.  Thanks for not letting my ego get too big when it came to height.
4-female_must_strip,target:piper,targetStage:0=stretching,Every woman I know says I'm tall.  Do you turn heads when you enter a room, too?
4-female_must_strip,target:piper,targetStage:0=vain,Oh, good, a woman who understands what it's like towering over people.  The intimidation can be kind of fun, no?
4-female_must_strip,target:piper,targetStage:0=stretching,Men seem to be taller than women.  I guess I wouldn't turn as many heads on Earth, then...but you'd do it no matter what.
4-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:4=bored,...Maybe I should stop hitting on men.  Look what it does to you...
4-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:4=annoyed,Is this really what Earth women are like?  She's an outlier, right?
4-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:4=frustrated,Seems running the Harvest has a tendency to scramble Earth women's brains...and make them want to play poker.
4-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:4=bored,...At least she's losing quickly.  Easy to do when you barely check the cards.
4-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:5=frustrated,Oh God, she's finally doing it.  Be very afraid...unless you Earth people are used to this sort of thing.
4-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:5=frustrated,Please don't.  I've learned my lesson.  I'll stay on Mejare.
4-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:5=bored,I'm really appreciating Mejare right now.  Maybe I'll straighten up and get a normal job.
4-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:5=frustrated,This is the last time I come to Earth.  Even among Mejarian pirate scum, none of us act like this.
4-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:0=stretching,Shame you're not an <i>actual</i> pearl.  I could go for one of those...Mejare hardly has any.
4-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:0=smug,No animals on Mejare means no pearls.  If only you <i>were</i> one of those beauties...
4-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:0=bored,All stretched-out like that...you're not shaped like a pearl at all!  Shame, because I love those things.
4-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:0=vain,<i>Oh, to hold a real pearl in my hands</i>!  I've only seen pictures in Earth history books.
4-female_must_strip,target:peach,targetStage:0=vain,I've never been a fan of royalty, but a <i>blonde</i> woman in charge?  Suddenly it doesn't seem so bad.
4-female_must_strip,target:peach,targetStage:0=smug,At least you've got the hair color to match your presumptuous title, Miss Princess.  This pirate still might rob you later.
4-female_must_strip,target:peach,targetStage:0=vain,You damn princesses and your unearned jewelry and dresses.  I stole everything I have, you know!  But at least you're blonde.
4-female_must_strip,target:peach,targetStage:0=teasing,So from one blonde to another, Miss Princess, how much is that crown worth?  ...<i>Just a pirate's curiosity</i>.
4-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=vain,Hel-<i>looo, camera</i>!  Over here, sweetie--get whatever angle you like best.
4-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=vain,Omigosh, you brought a <i>camera</i>?  A sign from the heavens!  Now all of Earth will get to see my beautiful naked body!
4-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=teasing,Looking to get some photographs of the exotic alien woman, were you?  But now you've got a whole <i>different</i> reason to capture me.
4-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=vain,Go right ahead with that camera, dearie.  It's always been shameful how I've been in the media for piracy instead of beauty.
4-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:5=teasing,Don't stop now, honey!  I hope I'm not imposing...but I'd <i>love</i> to hear some more French!
4-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:5=seductive,Your language is the absolute <i>coolest</i>, darling!  Say some more for me, if you don't mind...I hope I'm not being a burden.
4-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:5=teasing,I'm not demanding too much of you, am I, Marinette?  I just <i>love</i> your language...and this should take your mind off stripping.
4-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:5=vain,Normally I'm interested in women's tongues for <i>other</i> reasons...but with you, I can't get over how cool your language is!
4-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:5=seductive,I think I'm jealous, Marinette!  Not only are you the <i>cutest</i> little blueberry muffin of a girl, but your language is to <i>die</i> for!
4-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=stretching,Ooh, I know a girl named Misty!  She's this cute little thing from Pluto--barely has any breasts at all!  Must be cold there.
4-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=smug,Why, the Nirvana has a young girl named Misty aboard!  Being from Pluto, she knew her way around men better than any of us.
4-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=seductive,You're not the first Misty I've come to know, actually.  A teenie-weenie Plutonian girl we have is called the same thing!
4-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=stretching,I don't think they have your <i>poker</i>-mon things on Pluto...but they do have girls named Misty.
4-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0=interested,Talk about a big ball of misery.  Even your <i>skin</i> has turned all blue in despair.
4-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0=teasing,Show your face, honey!  Or are you trying to hide that weird blue skin?  Don't worry, it suits your miserable demeanor.
4-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0=laughing,I guess I'd be miserable, too, if I had the complexion of a grapefruit.
4-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0=stretching,I should bring Meia over here for some counseling.  Even <i>she's</i> not as miserable as Miss Blueberry here.
4-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:1=shocked,What's next, Ocean Girl?  You shir--<i>I was kidding</i>!
4-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:1=shocked,I imagine the shirt is ne--<i>wait, no, I was just joking</i>!
4-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:1=annoyed,...You're not serious?  I'm telling you, you have to <i>tease</i> a little!
4-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:1=bored,...Ocean Girl's a total idiot.  Just stripping nude right off the bat...way to miss the point.
4-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:3=confused,Hey, what were those noises you made before?  Didn't sound like the common language...
4-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:3=confused,...What's the name of that language you keep slipping into, anyway?  Some sort of Earth code-talk?  I only speak the common one...
4-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:3=vain,Bilingualism is so impressive, Marinette!  I only speak the common language...I don't even know Mejarians' codespeak.
4-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:3=seductive,So you speak the common language, but also this other one?  What's it called?  Because it sounds so <i>cute</i>!
4-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0=excited,Ooh, an Earth woman with green hair!  My girlfriend Barnette has green hair...and she is the <i>cutest</i> thing!
4-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, I didn't know Earth women could have green hair!  I've always considered it the most cutely exotic thing about Barnette.
4-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0=seductive,A sword <i>and</i> lovely green hair?  You must be a sign that Barnette and I are ready for children, sweetie.
4-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0=teasing,Ooh, green hair on a woman never fails to get me going.  But don't worry, my verdantly-colored girlfriend can handle the rest.
4-female_must_strip,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=laughing,And I thought <i>I</i> was trying to be seductive!  Here comes Miss Succubus, decked out in her Halloween costume.
4-female_must_strip,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=smug,Don't think you're slipping that past me, honey.  We have Halloween on Mejare...and I've dressed as a succubus before, yes.
4-female_must_strip,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=interested,Nice costume, Miss Seductress.  Looks like I have competition for all my man-hunting tonight.
4-female_must_strip,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=teasing,Mejare has stories of succubi, too...they really know how to tire a woman out.  I guess you must have a lot of fun with men here.
4-female_must_strip,target:navi,targetStage:0=laughing,...Yeah, I can see why you'd be comfortable here.  We'd need a computer scan to find your vagina.
4-female_must_strip,target:navi,targetStage:0=interested,You know, I tease Earth girls about growing up all small, but <i>wow</i>.  Now I just feel bad.
4-female_must_strip,target:navi,targetStage:0=smug,At least you've got those wings to buzz around to <i>our</i> height.  Inferiority complex, sweetie?
4-female_must_strip,target:navi,targetStage:0=bored,Well, there goes any chance of getting a <i>good look</i> at what Earth girls have got.  You <i>are</i> from Earth, right?
4-female_must_strip,target:neo,targetStage:0=laughing,My, you Earth girls have so much on your minds!  And it's apparently content to stay there.
4-female_must_strip,target:neo,targetStage:0=interested,So, Miss Motormouth, how's life?  Or the weather?  Or your family?  Or <i>anything</i>?
4-female_must_strip,target:neo,targetStage:0=teasing,I guess you're too tiny to fit a voice box in the model.  Don't feel bad--you're quite expressive, dear.
4-female_must_strip,target:neo,targetStage:0=vain,I guess I'm doing enough talking for the both of us.  And hey--that adorable two-toned hair is a statement unto itself!
4-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:2=interested,Honey, you'd be better off putting some meat on your bones than trying desperately to show them off.
4-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:2=bored,Sweetie, you're a twig.  This is just unhealthy...as unhealthy as you look.
4-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:2=confused,Are you suffering from this "anorexia" I keep reading about?  Eating disorders?  Do men do this to you?
4-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:2=vain,Talk about needing a girlfriend.  See what happens when you're never validated?
4-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=seductive,Blonde, scantily-clad, loves attention?  Honey, you're a woman after my own heart.
4-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=teasing,I like the energy you're bringing, Miss Wrestler!  The scant layering doesn't hurt, either.
4-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=vain,See, <i>you're</i> my kind of woman!  These other Earth girls are so dreadfully boring, always covering up the good stuff.
4-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=teasing,Barely wearing anything? You should know my girlfriend is the same way, cutie...only <i>she's</i> not blonde.
4-female_must_strip,target:pyrrha,targetStage:0=laughing,Hey there, Miss Mind-Your-Manners.  You talk the talk, but that cleavage tells me you've got a wild side.
4-female_must_strip,target:pyrrha,targetStage:0=teasing,You're awfully polite for a woman perverted enough to come here in the first place.  Just trying to throw us off, cutie?
4-female_must_strip,target:pyrrha,targetStage:0=stretching,Yeah, yeah, I don't buy the whole polite-and-formal act from a girl willing to strip nude in public.  Just waiting for the good stuff?
4-female_must_strip,target:pyrrha,targetStage:0=interested,You talk pretty prim-and-proper, dear...and yet here you are, stripping nude for us.  Do you have a dirty side, or did you lose a bet?
4-female_must_strip,target:riva,targetStage:0=smug,You should know I'm not a fan of princesses, Miss Magician.  But <i>blonde</i> ones?  ...I might yield a little.
4-female_must_strip,target:riva,targetStage:0=stretching,Maybe all it takes is some blonde hair to warm me up to the idea of royalty...or magic.
4-female_must_strip,target:riva,targetStage:0=vain,Don't feel bad about your unearned title, Miss Princess.  I hear you can perform magic--and alongside blonde hair, I'd say you're alright in my book.
4-female_must_strip,target:riva,targetStage:0=vain,Little Miss Magician is a <i>princess</i>, as well?  Well, against my pirate nature, I think I'll let a fellow blonde be on her way.
4-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:2=confused,So, uh, besides being blue, what's your deal?  You're all sweet and polite now.
4-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:2=seductive,Can't say I prefer blue hair, but you're certainly a lot sweeter now, honey.  What <i>happened</i>?
4-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:2=seductive,Normally I like blondes, but at least you're not waving a gun around and cursing anymore.  Nice tradeoff.
4-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:2=vain,Blue hair is more exotic, but blonde is far more beautiful.  Still, I'll take this polite version of you over the alternative.
4-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:6=bored,The storm is almost over...or maybe this is just the calm before it.
4-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:6=bored,I think I'd prefer the <i>Harvest's</i> company at this point.
4-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:6=bored,Oh, you're still here.  Why not just strip more than one thing at a time?  Well, too late.
4-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:6=bored,I still don't know who made you wait this long to show what you wanted.
4-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:3=confused,This is so freaky to me, and I've dealt with the Paksis's weird energy.  Do you just swtich all the time?
4-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:3=confused,Are you really bouncing back and forth like this all the time?  Like, do you have any friends?
4-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:3=confused,Must be hard getting to know anyone when you keep losing your memory.  How do you deal with always switching?
4-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:3=confused,I can't believe you have split personalities.  Where does the other one go?  How do you make friends?
4-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=vain,Way to come in a full outfit, Miss Maid.  And you're still speaking just as politely as when you're on the job!
4-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=smug,Whoever is your house's owner must really crack the whip, Miss Maid.  Even <i>now</i> you're using those silly honorifics.
4-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=vain,"Jura-chan" sounds like the most <i>adorable</i> nickname!  I've got to get Barnette to start calling me that...Barnette-<i>chan</i>.
4-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=teasing,You don't have to keep speaking all polite, Miss Maid.  You're in the company of a brutal pirate now--feel free to join the crew.
4-female_must_strip,target:rosalina,targetStage:0=teasing,And what do we have here--a fellow spacefarer, and a tall blonde one at that?  <i>People are going to get us confused</i>.
4-female_must_strip,target:rosalina,targetStage:0=vain,Flying around on an <i>observatory</i>, you said?  That sounds heavenly--space is such a beautiful place!
4-female_must_strip,target:rosalina,targetStage:0=teasing,Space can actually be rather beautiful when you're not busy robbing people.  Surely you agree, Miss Princess?
4-female_must_strip,target:rosalina,targetStage:0=vain,You <i>say</i> you're a princess, but space belongs to everyone--surely a traveler like yourself knows that better than most.
4-female_must_strip,target:alpha,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=laughing,You're pale as marble, dearie!  Do they not have a sun on this "Japan" planet?
4-female_must_strip,target:alpha,targetStage:0=confused,Are you...<i>flickering</i>?  Are you some kind of hologram?  That might explain your skin tone.
4-female_must_strip,target:alpha,targetStage:0=confused,You OK there, sweetheart?  You look a little pale...and non-corporeal.
4-female_must_strip,target:alpha,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=vain,And I thought <i>Mejarians</i> liked the pale look!  This "Japan" planet puts us to shame.
4-female_must_strip,target:tracer,targetStage:0=teasing,All about speed, eh, girlie?  Try not to blink right out of your costume...or back to before I won, you little cheat.
4-female_must_strip,target:tracer,targetStage:0=vain,Hey, where's <i>my</i> time travel?  Actually, there's nothing about my life I regret, so no issue.
4-female_must_strip,target:tracer,targetStage:0=seductive,Mind if I borrow that time device, sweetie?  I want to fall in love with my Barnette <i>all over again</i>.
4-female_must_strip,target:tracer,targetStage:0=teasing,If that thing can really travel you back in time, that's pretty fantastic.  How many times have we done this match over again, <i>loser</i>?
4-female_must_strip,target:tracer,targetStage:0=smug,You know what I've learned as a pirate?  You only get one chance to do things right.  This time-travel business sounds like a crutch.
4-female_must_strip,target:alice_degracia,targetStage:0=smug,Hey, hey, hey!  Check out the <i>all-purple</i> look.  That's a new one...
4-female_must_strip,target:alice_degracia,targetStage:0=vain,Hey, honey, color <i>contrasts</i> show confidence.  Would I look nearly as stunning if this dress matched my hair?
4-female_must_strip,target:alice_degracia,targetStage:0=smug,Purple hair's certainly got an exotic appeal...too bad mine is boring old blonde.  As for the matching outfit, I don't follow the logic.
4-female_must_strip,target:alice_degracia,targetStage:0=teasing,Quite the exotic color scheme you've got there, sweetie.  Too bad you forgot to mix it up at all.
4-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:0=awkward,...Are you alright there, honey?  With the knife and all?
4-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:0=awkward,...You know, I carry the rapier mostly for fashion...maybe you could relegate that knife to the same thing?
4-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:0=annoyed,...Could you maybe put down the knife, sweetheart?  Hey, are you listening?
4-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:0=bored,What a weirdo...knives are just as deadly as swords, with none of the style.
4-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:0=frustrated,Better keep my sword on hand, with <i>this</i> nutcase on the scene.
4-female_must_strip,target:aiyana,targetStage:0=vain,That tan is something else, and your energy is boundless!  Most Mejarians opt for pale, as you can see...
4-female_must_strip,target:aiyana,targetStage:0=teasing,Barnette's kind of tan like you are.  She's cute, too, so women can pull it off!
4-female_must_strip,target:aiyana,targetStage:0=teasing,Slow down there, tiger.  That energy is going to turn you into a tan smear on the ground.
4-female_must_strip,target:aiyana,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=confused,Tan is certainly a look on Mejare, but pale is the norm for us...where'd you say you were from?  Planet Austria?
4-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:0=confused,...I had no idea Earth girls came in so many...flavors.  How'd your parents pick <i>grape</i>?
4-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:0=confused,...So, uh, that skin color.  Am I missing something?  Is this a common look on Earth?
4-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:0=confused,Gotta be honest, girlie, I'm out of the loop on what Earth people look like.  Is that complexion of yours...<i>normal</i>?
4-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:0=confused,What's this about <i>ponies</i> that you keep going on about?  Is a "pony" a purple Earthling?  I'm totally lost here.
4-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:4=smug,Well, I guess if you've come this far, you might as well finish the job.  Go for it.
4-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:4=seductive,I'd expect nothing less, cutie.  Be sure to wow us!
4-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:4=teasing,Might as well seal the deal, even if it's just your thong.  You can do it, honey!
4-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:4=smug,Seems we've got similar taste in underwear.  Shame you're about to shoot it right off, but at least it'll look cool.
4-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:0=vain,Check out that outfit!  Going for the natural look?  So would I, if Mejare had much of nature.
4-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:0=interested,Did you just piece that outfit together from bits you found in a forest?  It doesn't even look that bad, but...it's certainly all-natural.
4-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:0=vain,If only Mejare had the same verdant natural resources as Earth.  Perhaps then I could try to emulate your all-natural style.
4-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:0=vain,Mejare's a little too wasteful to have the greenery for me to dress like <i>you</i> do.  You can see how little we wear to compensate.
4-female_must_strip,target:uhura,targetStage:0=smug,Oh, don't worry, dear.  We on Mejare are well aware of Earth's space program...you <i>have</i> tried to harvest us, after all.
4-female_must_strip,target:uhura,targetStage:0=teasing,You can call it "Star Fleet" if you want, dear, but it'll always be the Harvest to me.  <i>You nasty organ-stealers, you</i>.
4-female_must_strip,target:uhura,targetStage:0=vain,I don't buy this whole "peaceful space travel" angle, Miss Star Fleet.  I've spent far too much time fending off your little Harvest cubes!
4-female_must_strip,target:uhura,targetStage:0=smug,Yeah, yeah, I'm sure this "Star Fleet" is super peaceful.  Just remember I've got a Vandread...so I'm not afraid of you.
4-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:2=seductive,I'd call you crazy for this sort of thing, but how could I when you defy death like it's nothing?
4-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:2=excited,You're just so <i>awesome</i>!  I can't get enough of this!
4-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:2=teasing,Can you do it a <i>third</i> time, hotshot?  Yeah, probably.
4-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:2=excited,I could watch you do this all day.  My heart jumps every time!
4-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0=interested,What's up, cutie?  You look a little embarrassed to be here...which is funny, considering your choice of outfit.
4-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0=teasing,Yeah, not sure I'm buying this whole "I was tricked" act, dearie.  I mean, you <i>are</i> displaying your butt 24/7.
4-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0=teasing,Oh, don't act all embarrassed.  You've got hips to <i>die</i> for, cutie...and they're fully on display, even now.
4-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0=laughing,Ooh, you are just <i>adorable</i>!  Especially the way your figure is just <i>straining</i> against the bounds of that suit, <i>begging</i> to be free.
4-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1=excited,Ooh!  Ooh!  Are you doing it again?  Do it again!
4-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1=excited,Ooh, Aimee's turn!  Show us that trick again!
4-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1=excited,Aimee!  You're so cool!  How do you shoot like that?  Do that trick again!
4-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1=excited,Give us a <i>show</i>, girl!  That last time was incredible!
4-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>Well, howdy, pardner, how d'ya</i>--do...
4-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:0=shocked,What are you lugging that big men's gun around for--<i>ack</i>!
4-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:0=shocked,Well, aren't <i>you</i> spunky!  You even brought a model g--<i>eek</i>!
4-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:0=shocked,Uh...where are you pointing that thing?  Are you--wait--<i>eek!  Don't</i>!
4-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:0=stretching,And they say <i>men</i> are tall!  You're enough woman for the whole table, sweetie.
4-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:0=smug,You said you don't get out much?  Guess men like short women...that makes things awkward for me.
4-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:0=smug,You know, I tend to turn heads with my height alone.  Better not invite <i>you</i> to the ship, or you'll steal my thunder.
4-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:0=seductive,From what I know of men, you're as tall as one...and built like them, too.  Don't worry, you wear it well--so does Gascogne!
4-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:0=teasing,Hibiki's a teenie-weenie man I know.  I guess you represent the opposite end of the spectrum on both counts.
4-female_must_strip,target:velma,targetStage:0=teasing,It's a rare woman who can pull off the glasses look, you know.  Parfet landed herself a man...how about <i>you</i>, Miss Mystery?
4-female_must_strip,target:velma,targetStage:0=stretching,I know a glasses-wearing egghead myself...Parfet's her name, and what she looks like with them off is the <i>real</i> mystery.
4-female_must_strip,target:velma,targetStage:0=laughing,Hey, Miss Mystery...can you solve how to make glasses look good on a woman?  Here's the answer: <i>give them to me</i>.
4-female_must_strip,target:velma,targetStage:0=vain,So, you solve mysteries, is that right?  I guess the glasses would help there...think you could solve the mystery of this <i>alien woman</i>?
4-female_must_strip,target:velma,targetStage:0=interested,Hey, Miss Mystery.  Push those frames up and answer a few questions...because <i>men</i> are a mystery to me.
4-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_playing_with_boys=smug,Oh, don't worry about men so much.  They're too clumsy and oafish to make use of all that strength.
4-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_playing_with_boys,marker:nagisa-tubes=interested,I really thought Earth women would be pretty comfortable around men.  Don't you have them shove their tubes into you on a regular basis?
4-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_playing_with_boys=interested,Aren't you used to men ogling and clawing at you?  I thought Earth women do that with them all the time.
4-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_playing_with_boys=stretching,You're so damn shy around these men.  Listen, I fight a whole planet of the toughest men around.  They're all talk.
4-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:3=awkward,Uh, Aimee?  Are you sure you want to keep doing that?  You nearly got hit last time...and your targets are getting smaller.
4-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:3=shocked,Um, it's OK, Aimee!  You've been very impressive!  Just go out on top, you know?
4-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:3=awkward,...Are you sure about this, Aimee?  After...last time?  Don't kill yourself...
4-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:3=awkward,Uh--don't go all the way just for <i>my</i> sake.  What you did was cool, but, um...well, you'll be fine.
4-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0=interested,I was about to comment on how I love blondes, but that mechanical arm really stands out.  How'd you get it?
4-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0=confused,It's hard to feel too awkward about you losing your arm when that thing looks like a pretty useful replacement.  Got a story to tell?
4-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0=laughing,Check out Miss Cyborg over here!  You wear that mechanical arm quite well--<i>do Earth men find you too much to handle</i>?
4-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0=seductive,I must say, that cold steel clashes with your fiery personality.  Talk about a two-tiered threat!
4-female_must_strip,target:zelda,targetStage:0=interested,You know what I see when a woman calls herself "royalty"?  <i>An inferiority complex</i>, Miss Boring-Brunette.
4-female_must_strip,target:zelda,targetStage:0=laughing,You're cute, especially as far as overhyped princesses go.  Let's see how cute you are <i>without</i> all your jewelry.
4-female_must_strip,target:zelda,targetStage:0=laughing,You know what I think of miserable jealous girls who dress themselves up and pretend they're better than the rest of us?  ...I like stripping them.
4-female_must_strip,target:zelda,targetStage:0=vain,Take away a princess's fancy dress and what does she have?  Hopefully a cute butt, and a pirate nearby who's earned her clothes.
4-female_must_strip,target:tina,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=teasing,Planet <i>America</i>, hm?  Never heard of it--but it seems to have produced as least one knockout!
4-female_must_strip,target:tina,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=thinking,<i>Britain</i>, <i>Japan</i>, and now your <i>America</i>.  I'm starting to think these aren't actually planets...and Earth people are just very splintered.
4-female_must_strip,target:tina,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=teasing,Hey, now, Miss Wrestler...this place has a <i>no-touching</i> rule, even if Planet <i>America</i> doesn't.
4-female_must_strip,target:tina,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=vain,I don't know how they do things on Planet America, honey, but you keep your wrestling hands to yourself--I'm taken!
4-female_must_strip,target:athena,targetStage:0=interested,I really thought I'd be the most lightly-dressed woman here, but there you go showing me up on <i>that</i> front.
4-female_must_strip,target:athena,targetStage:0=smug,Way to dispel my stereotypes of Earth girls being overdressed.  You wear even less than I do.
4-female_must_strip,target:athena,targetStage:0=interested,Hey, I understand wanting to show a little skin, but you can't walk around in a <i>bikini</i> all day.  Even Barnette doesn't go that far.
4-female_must_strip,target:athena,targetStage:0=stretching,Even my darling little Barnette covers herself up better than <i>you</i> do...and she's got a reputation for dressing flimsily.
4-female_must_strip,target:asuna,targetStage:0=frustrated,What'd you say you lived in?  An M-M-O--ripgah?  I can't keep track of all that.
4-female_must_strip,target:asuna,targetStage:0=confused,Did you say you lived in a computer or something like that?  Sounds like Heaven to Parfet, with how much she tinkers with machines.
4-female_must_strip,target:asuna,targetStage:0=confused,So what's it like inside a computer?  Do you have to wear a rubber suit to avoid getting electrocuted?
4-female_must_strip,target:asuna,targetStage:0=confused,You live inside a game, right?  And now you're <i>playing</i> a game?  Is this whole place a game I've stepped inside?
4-female_must_strip,target:sonya,targetStage:0=teasing,I can appreciate military women--they're always so very <i>fit</i>.  Try not to wring my neck for my horrible pirate crimes.
4-female_must_strip,target:sonya,targetStage:0=vain,<i>Please don't hurt me, O fearsome woman soldier.  I have a girlfriend waiting for me back home</i>!
4-female_must_strip,target:sonya,targetStage:0=vain,Looking pretty muscular, Miss Militia.  Please try to see this beautiful pirate's point of view before sticking your knee in her back.
4-female_must_strip,target:sonya,targetStage:0=teasing,I imagine you're not too fond of my line of work, Miss Militia.  It's OK--<i>I'm pretty fond of that short blonde hair</i>.
4-female_must_strip,target:arwen,targetStage:0=confused,Hey, what's all this about the <i>middle</i> of Earth?  Is there a spot underground that only you elf-people get to live in?
4-female_must_strip,target:arwen,targetStage:0=confused,And I call <i>Meia</i> pale.  You look almost ghostly...is that just the way you elves are?
4-female_must_strip,target:arwen,targetStage:0=confused,Hey, what's up with those pointy ears?  And the pale, Meia-like skin?  You're a strange one, "elf" girl.
4-female_must_strip,target:arwen,targetStage:0=confused,So you call yourself an elf, right?  Is that another word for "Earthling with crazy ears"?  Because you look human otherwise.
4-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:0=seductive,Hey there, Miss Two-Tone!  I like your sense of fashion--that exposed, that hat, and those cute little boots!
4-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, is that two-toned hair natural?  That's fancier than even <i>Mejarians</i> have come up with.
4-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:0=interested,You seem pretty smug, honey.  Do you have a sweeter half like your hair implies?
4-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:0=excited,Ooh, can I try on your hat when you lose it?  Or that amulet?  Can you two-tone my hair like yours?
4-female_must_strip,target:april,targetStage:0=vain,Ooh, do you really report the news?  Be sure to get my good side--oh wait, that's <i>every</i> side!
4-female_must_strip,target:april,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey there, Jumpsuit.  Someone said you're a reporter--but <i>this</i> pirate doesn't mind a little publicity!
4-female_must_strip,target:april,targetStage:0=smug,I've been in the media for much worse than a few glory shots, so don't think I'm afraid of that camera, newsgirl.
4-female_must_strip,target:april,targetStage:0=vain,Hey, newsie, I've got all the story you need right here.  Your Earth viewers have never seen a body like mine!
4-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0=laughing,Hey there, short stuff.  I think you might actually be shorter than Hibiki, which is a challenge even for women.
4-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0=laughing,You said you fight "Titans"?  I imagine that's everyone, considering your stature.
4-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0=laughing,"Titans," huh?  You mean like me next to you?  Or anyone, really?
4-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0=interested,How's the weather down there, at the very bottom of Earth?  You really need to drink your milk, honey.
4-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0,marker:fama_and_oma=vain,...See, <i>this</i> is why I'm going to be the Fama for Barnette.  I don't want our daughters growing up all short from lack of milk.
4-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:1=vain,Should've figured Little Miss Princess would want to break away and strip for strangers.  You must be so sheltered!
4-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:1=teasing,Oh, is it true you're a <i>princess</i>, darling?  That would explain the haughty attitude...and the phony embarrassment.
4-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:1=teasing,I'm a pirate, dearie...and no huge fan of authority figures.  Luckily, I <i>love</i> girls who strip for fun and pleasure.
4-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:1=interested,So you're a princess, is that it?  You should know you're not fooling me--you <i>love</i> being ogled, don't you?
4-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:1=interested,A princess, hm?  Only makes sense that such a public figure as yourself would love exhibiting her body for total strangers.
4-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:0=confused,...You OK, honey?  You look a little...<i>dead</i>.
4-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:0=shocked,...OK.  So.  You're a ghost.  I can work with this...<i>but please put down the knife</i>.
4-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:0=bored,Guess there's no stabbing <i>you</i> if things get hairy, is there?  ...Not that I was planning on doing that to anyone else.
4-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:0=laughing,A...ghost.  OK.  Well, at least this means I can still annoy Meia if I get shot down and killed.
4-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:0=awkward,...Well, I <i>do</i> appreciate learning that there's an afterlife, but it's not why I came to Earth.
4-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0=vain,How's a young little thing like you a model if you're still in school?  <i>I've</i> got modeling potential, but it's hard for pirates to land a job.
4-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0=smug,A student <i>and</i> a model?  And here I am, with all my beauty, and still a lowly criminal.  At least I have my wonderful piloting skills.
4-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0=vain,<i>If only my circumstances let me be the beautiful model I've always dreamed of being</i>!  Guess I'll have to settle for death-defying pirate.
4-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0=teasing,You're a lucky one, Earth-girl.  I never had the benefit of much schooling, nor the opportunity to be a model.  So cherish what you've got!
4-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0=vain,Ooh, you're into art?  Do you think you could paint a portrait of me?  Maybe frame it in your collection to capture my eternal beauty?
4-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0=teasing,Ooh, so you're an <i>artist</i>?  I know a particularly handsome man that can paint, too...think you could capture me better?
4-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0=vain,Did you say you go to school with men?  I was never that big on school--except for art, where we could finally appreciate <i>beauty</i>!
4-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0=vain,Students tend to be such bores--like that egghead Parfet.  But an <i>art</i> student?  Now we're talking--my whole body is art!
4-female_must_strip,target:amy_rose,targetStage:0=confused,You're, uh, looking a little pink there.  And what's up with those ears?
4-female_must_strip,target:amy_rose,targetStage:0=confused,I know I joke about Earth girls being aliens, but, uh, you really do look kind of weird.  What's with all the...<i>fur</i>?
4-female_must_strip,target:amy_rose,targetStage:0=confused,Wait, did they say you're a...a <i>hedgehog</i> or something?  Is that some kind of animal?  That would explain the, uh, pink...and ears.
4-female_must_strip,target:amy_rose,targetStage:0=confused,...I really can't make heads or tails of you.  You kind of <i>look</i> like you should have a tail, what with that fur and all.
4-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, girlie, someone told me you're a model on Earth...is that true?  I'd like to get in on that...
4-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0=teasing,You're pretty cute, honey, but I hear people like legs on their models...better hope <i>I</i> don't hit the scene.
4-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0=vain,Hey now, sweetheart.  You're cute, but there's no need to brag about being a model...not when a <i>Mejarian's</i> on the scene.
4-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0=teasing,Don't be so full of yourself, Miss Model...I'd be a model, too, if not for Mejare's pesky little corrupt government.
4-female_must_strip,target:tifa,targetStage:0=interested,Ohoho.  A <i>martial artist</i>, honey?  Well, I can certainly see where all your momentum comes from.
4-female_must_strip,target:tifa,targetStage:0=laughing,With a figure like that, I imagine you've developed your <i>own</i> style of martial arts...centered around counterweights.
4-female_must_strip,target:tifa,targetStage:0=teasing,<i>My, my</i>!  Those things outdo even mine, sweetie...but I don't pretend I'm some sort of athlete.
4-female_must_strip,target:tifa,targetStage:0=seductive,Bigger breasts <i>and</i> martial arts skill?  Jeez, you're outmaneuvering me left and right.  Good thing you're such a cutie!
4-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:6=laughing,Even with all that, you're still forced to be naked?  It's official--you're totally into this.
4-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:6=teasing,Even with your little flower setup, dearie, I think you're out of options.  Cough up the good stuff--I'm convinced you want to.
4-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:6=vain,<i>That</i> ought to do it, unless you've got more of the plant kingdom at your disposal.  Isn't this what you wanted, playing this game?
4-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:6=seductive,Oh, I'm sure you're cute, dear--I remember your butt!  Besides...I seriously doubt this isn't turning you on.
4-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:5=smug,Well, that's that.  Do what you must behind those flowers.
4-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:5=interested,You can hide yourself with the flowers, honey, but you're naked, so that's a loss in my book.
4-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:5=smug,Nice try with the foliage, dear, but no one's going to call that clothing.  You're out.
4-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:5=stretching,<i>And so the frightened little princess falls before her betters.  Even the forest spirits couldn't save her</i>.
4-female_must_strip,target:annie,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey there, Plain-Jane.  What's brought you here, with all your layers?  Looking to overcome some shyness?
4-female_must_strip,target:annie,targetStage:0=smug,Exhibit A of Earth girls' ridiculous conservatism.  Can't you appreciate your own body instead of hiding it?  Must be men doing this to you.
4-female_must_strip,target:annie,targetStage:0=laughing,What's up, cutie?  You seem to be making every effort to hide that cuteness, actually.  Just look at those packed-on layers.
4-female_must_strip,target:annie,targetStage:0=vain,I guess I'd be a little shyer about my body if I had your height and plain looks, but come on.  Confidence makes <i>any</i> woman look better!
4-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_first_time_playing=laughing,Wait, wait, wait.  You've <i>never</i> played poker before?  What are you, in some religious cult or something?
4-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_first_time_playing=smug,You poor, poor thing.  Never played poker before...what a way to start.
4-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_first_time_playing=laughing,You've <i>never</i> played poker before?  Oh, dear...well, I'll be sure to show you the ropes, sweetie.
4-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_first_time_playing=seductive,Your first time ever, huh?  I'm afraid you picked a hell of a game to start with...but you're a cute little thing, so don't be embarrassed.
4-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,totalMales:1-3=interested,Jeez, you're terrified.  Maybe men <i>do</i> eat women's livers.
4-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,totalMales:1-3=confused,...Are men actually anything to be afraid of?  Sure, they're big and lumbering, but they seem kind of slow.
4-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,totalMales:1-3=bored,Calm down, would you?  Yeesh.  Maybe Mejare was right about men, considering the state they've got this girl in.
4-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,totalMales:1-3=teasing,Hey, I've dealt with my fair share of male soldiers.  They're nothing to be super afraid of...too stupid.
4-female_must_strip,target:velma_classic,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, Earth to ~player~.  There's a Velma model out now that doesn't look like a goblin.
4-female_must_strip,target:velma_classic,targetStage:0=interested,What, you figured out the offline version but still chose <i>this</i> Velma?  How nostalgia-blinded can you get?
4-female_must_strip,target:velma_classic,targetStage:0=interested,Hey, ~player~, it's not 2016 anymore.  There's a Velma you can play with that's actually on-model.
4-female_must_strip,target:velma_classic,targetStage:0=laughing,Hey, ~player~, Velma Classic is just here to remember the past...not masturbate to it.
4-female_must_strip,target:velma_classic,targetStage:0=laughing,Don't do this to yourself, ~player~--there's a better Velma now.  I mean, <i>look</i> at this one.
4-female_must_strip,target:velma_classic,targetStage:0=vain,Hey, ~player~, Barnette might understand the appeal of antiques, but <i>I</i> say stick with the fresh and new.
4-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,What's up, sourpuss?  You look even more miserable than a certain squadron leader I know...the one right next to us.
4-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,Hey, lighten up, girlie.  I could have gotten this mood from playing poker with Meia back on the ship.
4-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=stretching,<i>Yawn</i>...are you really going to be a miserable bore this whole time?  Would having <i>my</i> breasts make you feel better?
4-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,Looks like it's Little Miss Sunshine's turn to strip.  Between you and Meia here, the energy's just through the roof.
4-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0=seductive,You know what I love more than anything in this vast universe?  A fellow blonde...especially a cute one!  And you fit the bill, fireball.
4-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, I like your energy--and your blondeness!  My girlfriend Barnette's a real spark plug herself.
4-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0=interested,You're a cutie, Miss Midriff--that messy blonde hair is only making me fall further in love.  Where do you get all your energy?
4-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0=teasing,Slow down there, firecracker--you're like a burning torch with all that blonde hair flying about.  But it's definitely cute!
4-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia,marker:planet-countries=smug,Where'd you say you were from?  Planet <i>Korea</i>?  Well then, it seems Korea and Mejare share a fashion sense...
4-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia,marker:planet-countries=teasing,You're a cutie, Miss Bodysuit, if a little on the short side.  Is that just how they make women over on Planet Korea?
4-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Well, everyone, cards on the table.  Who wears the whole bodysuit look better--D.Va or my miserable old boss here?
4-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,You're an adorable little thing, D.Va!  All wrapped up in that cute bodysuit, just like <i>another</i> pilot I know...who might be sitting here.
4-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,<i>Oh, dear</i>.  I can see where <i>this</i> is going, Ice Queen.
4-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,<i>Flirting</i>, are we Meia?  I figured as much.  Best to let the lovebirds just figure things out on their own.
4-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,Meia, honey, you're just setting yourself up for disappointment.  Earth girls don't like each others' bodies the way <i>we</i> do.
4-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Ooh, you're so <i>cute</i> when a woman actually gets you going!  She'll deny it now, Chun, but Meia here is <i>totally</i> into you.
4-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:4=teasing,Hey, honey...take <i>my</i> dress, and I'll love you forever.
4-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:4=smug,Feel free to flatter me and steal my dress, dear!  It's...over there somewhere.
4-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:4=seductive,Say, Vriska...can that die steal <i>my</i> dress?  <i>Please</i> say yes.
4-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:4=vain,I'd <i>love</i> to see how my dress looks on someone else.  But I can't just let you try it on...so use the die.
4-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=stretching,See, Meia, I think you do the "strong, silent type" thing pretty well.  Chell here is an example of taking it too far.
4-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,Slow on the uptake?  The "strong, silent type" doesn't mean <i>literally</i> never speaking, you know.
4-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,Oh, don't feel bad.  I know you're speechless at the sight of me--but I'll do enough talking for both of us!
4-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Stunned into speechlessness?  I'm flattered, but really, honey, you can talk to me.  I won't mind.
4-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Hey, Chell.  If I'm the most gorgeous woman you've ever met, don't say anything.
4-female_must_strip,target:arwen,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=confused,Hey, what's all this about the <i>middle</i> of Earth?  Is there a spot underground that only you elf-people get to live in?
4-female_must_strip,target:arwen,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=confused,And I call <i>you</i> pale, Meia.  Arwen here looks almost ghostly...is that just the way elves are?
4-female_must_strip,target:arwen,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=confused,Hey, what's up with those pointy ears?  And that pallid skin?  You're a strange one, "elf" girl.
4-female_must_strip,target:arwen,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=confused,So you call yourself an elf, right?  Is that another word for "Earthling with crazy ears"?  Because you look human otherwise.
4-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:3=excited,Here we go again.  This is so <i>exciting</i>!  Every outfit is an adventure!
4-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:3=excited,This is making me feel so alive!  I love checking out women's fashion!  Show some more!
4-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:3=seductive,You're so cool, Vriska!  And maybe even a little cute!  What else have you got for me?
4-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:3=teasing,Don't stop now, cutie!  Any more adorable outfits you've got in store for me?
4-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=seductive,Is that so?  Well, Ami, you've <i>got</i> to let me know how to become an Earth model.  I'm a bit of an outlaw on Mejare, after all.
4-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Thanks for the tip, Meia.  Leave it to you to gather a little intel on our friends here...how's life as an Earth model, honey?
4-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,Ooh, she's a <i>model</i>?  <i>Now</i> I'm curious...that was always my dream job, after all.
4-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=smug,Jeez, what a head case.  Good thing she's got her girlfriend here to keep her in check.
4-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=interested,Running, running, running.  We're not trying to kill you here, you know.
4-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=teasing,Time for take two, everyone.  Better than the first, perhaps?
4-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=seductive,And <i>there she goes</i>.  Poor little thing, beaten down by the world.
4-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:6=interested,I appreciated the fashion show, Vriska, but really, I doubt you've got fuel left in the tank.
4-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:6=stretching,Just going to keep on trying, huh?  Give it up already.
4-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:6=stretching,Poor girl just can't control her gambling problem.  Now she'll be nude for it.
4-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:6=interested,And is this magically going to restock your wardrobe?  I doubt it.
4-female_must_strip,target:willow,targetStage:0=seductive,Tell me about these "vampires," sweetie.  Sucking blood actually sounds a little romantic!
4-female_must_strip,target:willow,targetStage:0=interested,A computer nerd, eh?  So's Parfet--but I wouldn't trust her to handle supernatural blood-suckers.
4-female_must_strip,target:willow,targetStage:0=vain,I know a computer nerd--Parfet's her name.  Cute little thing...and she's with a man, who we <i>used</i> to think sucked blood.
4-female_must_strip,target:willow,targetStage:0=teasing,I think I drew blood on Barnette once--it was a steamy night.  But I never sucked it, so maybe I'm not one of these "vampires."
4-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:7=smug,...Yeah, we all know how <i>this</i> is ending, don't we?
4-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:7=smug,Some women just refuse to see what's right in front of them.  It's sad, really.
4-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:7=laughing,Well, get ready for full-blown blue nudity, everyone.
4-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:7=smug,All the magic in the universe, and not one ounce of sense.  You poor thing.
4-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, Miss Moneybags, you'd better watch out.  This pirate's got half a mind to loot you with extreme prejudice!
4-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0=teasing,Sure you're not worried to be playing in a seedy place like this, Miss Heiress?  You might get mugged by, say, an ornery pirate.
4-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0=interested,Nice premature white hair, Miss Heirlooms.  I guess having all that inherited money must be <i>oh-so-stressful</i> for you.
4-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0=laughing,Looking quite adorable there, Coinstacks.  Maybe I'll help myself to the jewelry you'll undoubtedly remove first.
4-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale_swimsuit,targetStage:0=laughing,How can a woman dress for a sun she's apparently never seen?  The mysteries just keep piling up.
4-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale_swimsuit,targetStage:0=interested,Cute swimsuit, honey, but I've always preferred the shade.  So do you, clearly.
4-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale_swimsuit,targetStage:0=vain,Yeah, I'm more the type to lounge under an umbrella than do any swimming.  But more power to you, if you ever choose to go outside.
4-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale_swimsuit,targetStage:0=interested,Look, dear.  You can wear that swimsuit all day, but that complexion's not fooling anybody.
4-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0=smug,And here I thought I was on Earth.  Turns out we've got a woman from a frozen tundra planet, evolved for camouflage.
4-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0=teasing,You look like you're in pretty good shape, honey.  And even better, I bet sweat blends right in to your marble complexion!
4-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0=vain,I'll be frank--you wouldn't catch me dead exercising.  It's so much work, and look at what it's done to this poor woman's skin!
4-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0=stretching,<i>Fitness this</i>, <i>exercise that</i>.  Why should I take advice from a woman who's apparently never seen sunlight?
4-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:5=smug,Call it woman's intuition, but I think our little fashion show is about to come to an end soon...
4-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:5=interested,This has been fun, Vriska, but I don't think you can keep this up forever.  That die's got a sick sense of humor.
4-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:5=interested,Can't you see the writing on the wall, sweetheart?  I like these outfits, but they keep getting skimpier and skimpier.
4-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:5=laughing,Roll all you want...I think the die's in control here.  And it wants to see some blue skin.
4-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=interested,Look, Meia, she's just as pale, serious, and boring as you are.  Think she'd smile around Kahlua?
4-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,Hey, Meia's standing right here.  Isn't that enough boredom for one table without <i>you</i> aping her style?
4-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,Look at that, Meia, Earth's found a way to mass-produce you!  <i>Diabolical</i>.
4-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,<i>Yeah, yeah, Meia, stay cocky</i>.  Oh wait, Meia's over <i>here</i>!  You two are just so similar.
4-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,Hey, Meia, what do you think?  Should we try to find you a bodysuit with polka dots?  Maybe force you to smile like Marinette?
4-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=interested,This girl makes bodysuits look a lot cuter than <i>you</i> do, Meia.  Must be because she smiles...or because of the polka dots.
4-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,Even with the mask on, this girl emotes much more than <i>you</i>, Meia.  Maybe a polka-dotted suit would lighten you up.
4-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,If you're not a fan of polka dots, Meia, maybe you could adopt this girl's adorable accent and actually brighten a room for once.
4-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,Mei and Meia, eh?  I hope our other guests won't mix the two of you up--both are cold in your own ways, after all.
4-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,Look, Meia, this girl's nearly got your name.  But she smiles, so telling you two apart should be easy.
4-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Mei and Meia?  I'd play matchmaker, but you'd be the most confusing couple of all time.
4-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,See, Meia?  You're so sweet, this girl was nearly named after you.  Nearly.
4-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=seductive,Ooh, I <i>love</i> your makeup!  Where do you get it on Earth?  I usually make a point to steal some during raids.
4-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=seductive,You're just <i>adorable</i> how you've dolled yourself up!  And you're so teenie-weenie.
4-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=excited,Omigosh, that little outfit is <i>so</i> cute!  And you might be more into makeup than even <i>I</i> am.
4-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=excited,Ooh, do they make dresses that cute in my size?  What about your makeup?  You look so adorable!
4-female_must_strip,target:lara,targetStage:0=stretching,Raiding tombs, you said?  Why would you <i>ever</i> want to be all dirty and dusty?
4-female_must_strip,target:lara,targetStage:0=stretching,You won't find <i>me</i> in catacombs like you explore.  It'd ruin my dress...and my face.
4-female_must_strip,target:lara,targetStage:0=teasing,So what's in these tombs, anyway?  <i>We</i> conduct raids on the living and able--so watch out!
4-female_must_strip,target:lara,targetStage:0=smug,Raiding those who can't defend themselves doesn't sound too impressive, honey.  Or do monsters live in those tombs of yours?
4-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0,count-weiss_v4:1=vain,Hey, Miss Moneybags, nice wardrobe.  I'm just a poor little pirate--<i>this dress is the best I can afford</i>.
4-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0,count-weiss_v4:1=smug,Figures Miss Princess can't go five minutes without changing her clothes.  A few months of piracy will teach you appreciate the clothes you've got.
4-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0,count-weiss_v4:1=interested,At least you mixed up the colors a little with this new outfit, Miss Heirlooms.  What you had before was like if I wore all yellow.
4-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0,count-weiss_v4:1=teasing,Looking cute there, Coinstacks.  Nice new outfit--gotta show off the money somehow, right?
4-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0,count-ruby_v4:1=interested,Looking a little different there, Ruby.  Brighter, in fact.  Something bring up the mood where you're from?
4-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0,count-ruby_v4:1=smug,I see you've been mixing up the colors, sweetie.  Not a bad approach, but I'm totally in love with this dress just as it is.
4-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0,count-ruby_v4:1=stretching,Mixing up the outfits, are we?  I've cultivated a certain look with my crewmates I'd rather just maintain.
4-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0,count-ruby_v4:1=vain,Hey, check out the new style Ruby's rocking.  Not bad, but I'm the kind of girl to just stick with what I know best!
4-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:0=excited,Ohhh, you're so <i>cute</i>!  Draped in a loose-fitting shirt...and those <i>pigtails</i>!  I just wanna squeeze you!
4-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:0=excited,There's something about pigtails on a girl that just make me want to squeeze her even more...you're so <i>adorable</i>!
4-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:0=teasing,So, honey...<i>do men like to yank on those pigtails</i>?  It's OK, you can tell me--I'm not from around here.
4-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:0=seductive,You look like you've taken your first step into womanhood...and no more than that, with too-big clothes and adorable little pigtails!
4-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,count-meia:2=annoyed,Ugh, now there's <i>two</i> of you?  I guess ~player~ is a big fan of being rejected.
4-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,count-meia:2=angry,<i>Two</i> Meias?  Hey, I've been hitting on you this entire time!  What's <i>she</i> done besides give you the cold shoulder?
4-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,count-meia:2=annoyed,...You know, I put a lot of effort into my appearance.  Meia rolls out of bed, and <i>she's</i> the one to get two of her?
4-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,count-meia:2=angry,Hey, what's this all about, ~player~?  You really think Meia's prettier than I am?
4-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,count-d.va_cruiser:1=teasing,I don't even know you, girlie, but you seem dressed up for a special occasion all the same.  Feeling sexy today?
4-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,count-d.va_cruiser:1,marker:planet-countries=seductive,Hey, cutie.  Is it a holiday on planet Korea?  Because you look different from usual.
4-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,count-d.va_cruiser:1,marker:planet-countries=interested,This "Korea" planet of yours has got quite the range of fashion.  I <i>swear</i> I've seen you running around in something else.
4-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,count-d.va_cruiser:1=stretching,What's up, D.Va?  That's a cute outfit--but it doesn't seem quite like your usual fare.  What's the occasion?
4-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=bored,Oh, for God's sake, Meia, don't go on a damn moral crusade.  She's kind of cute, isn't that enough?
4-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=frustrated,We barely know her or what Earth's military is like, Meia.  Don't start with your vendettas against authority.
4-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=bored,It wasn't Earth soldiers that shut down our living districts, Meia.  Cool it and try to have a nice time.
4-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=frustrated,Oh, don't start ragging on the poor girl like we understand the politics of this place.  Let's just all calm down and enjoy each others' breasts.
4-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:0=laughing,Nice look you've got going there, Miss Bodypaint.  The orange really contrasts nicely with the blue...skin.
4-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:0=laughing,Nice fruity complexion, honey.  Really matches your horns...and your one crazy eye.
4-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:0=smug,You seem surprised to have lost, dear...but you can complain about fate until you're blue in the face.
4-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:0=interested,What are you rolling that thing for?  Trying to pick a new color of body paint?
4-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=interested,...So it's <i>piloting</i> that really gets you going, Leader.  <i>You hopeless intellectual, you</i>.
4-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,I <i>knew</i> you were a robot.  The only thing that makes you lighten up is another woman's skills.
4-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=stretching,I guess I'm just shallower than you are, boss.  There you go, seeking out girlfriends on things <i>beyond</i> looks.
4-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=stretching,Oh, thank God, you're flirting.  For a second there I was worried you really <i>were</i> sexless.
4-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=seductive,Omigosh, Meia, look!  <i>Another</i> spacefarer who recognizes the value of a bodysuit.  You should chat her up!
4-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,Blonde like me, suit like yours, from space like both of us!  This <i>Samus</i> covers all our bases, Meia.  Go flirt with her!
4-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,This woman's practically a Mejarian, between the spacey jumpsuit and gorgeous figure.  Go get her, Meia--she's got your sense of style!
4-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=seductive,Full jumpsuit, shapely behind, cute face, <i>from space</i>?  Meia, this girl is prime girlfriend material!  Now's the time!
4-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=bored,<i>Yeesh</i>.  Meia, I'm sorry I ever called you miserable.  Next to this girl, you're a field of sunflowers.
4-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,I'm glad we came here, boss.  Miss Blueberry over here has given me a new appreciation for your sense of humor.
4-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=bored,Jeez, I've at least <i>seen</i> you smile, Meia.  I don't think this girl <i>has</i> those muscles.
4-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,At least you have your face on display, Leader.  This girl's both miserable <i>and</i> refuses to show it.
4-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:1=excited,Omigosh!  <i>Vriska</i>!  Do that thing again!  There's so much you could teach me about Earth fashion!
4-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:1=excited,<i>Vriiiska</i>!  I love fashion!  Show me more of your Earth outfits!
4-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:1=excited,Your wardrobe's so cool!  I only really have this dress!  You've got to show me what Earth girls wear!
4-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:1=excited,Yes!  Vriska's turn!  Show me what else Earth women wear!  I want it all!
4-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Ooh, look, Meia.  Another Misty.  <i>Don't go falling in love with her, now</i>!
4-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,OK, Meia.  I know this girl's called Misty, but don't start trying to be <i>her</i> Big Sister, too.
4-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Don't tell anyone, but...<i>Meia's got a bit of a crush on a girl named Misty</i>.  Fair warning!
4-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=stretching,Gonna win over Meia's heart here?  You wouldn't be the first <i>Misty</i> to do it.
4-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,You'll have to excuse Meia's hostility.  She's absorbed all of our collective pirate hatred of authority.
4-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,Oh, don't mind Meia.  She's taken the whole pirates-hating--soldiers thing a little too much to heart.
4-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,Just let Meia fume a little, Miss Military. We know you're not from <i>Mejare's</i> nasty old ranks.
4-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=stretching,Cute purple hair, Miss Military.  Oh, don't worry about Meia.  She's even touchier with soldier women than the rest of us.
4-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=vain,No jokes here, darling!  We're one hundred percent <i>alien</i>...if you define "alien" as "not from Earth."
4-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=seductive,We <i>are</i> from another planet, honey!  We're fearless Mejarian pirates...and we've come <i>all this way</i> to learn about Earth.
4-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=vain,Yep, just two exotic women from another world!  So we stuck together, since we can only trust each other around here.
4-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=teasing,We're pirates from Mejare, darling, and all we know about Earth is that men and women live together here!  Which sounds strange to us.
4-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=seductive,That's right, Elizabeth--Meia and I are from another world!  And we're stripping here--<i>that's how much we trust each other</i>.
4-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:2=teasing,I'm <i>waiting</i>, Vriska!  Don't disappoint me and pick some boring outfit!
4-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:2=teasing,I'm expecting some good fashion from you, you know!  Don't leave it up to chance!
4-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:2=smug,Don't you have some way to control that?  I'd rather you showed off something specific.
4-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:2=teasing,Lay the fashion on me, Vriska!  Fashion from...wherever it is that you live.
4-female_must_strip,target:ayano,targetStage:0=confused,...You OK there, schoolgirl?  You look a little on edge...especially when you look <i>my</i> way.
4-female_must_strip,target:ayano,targetStage:0=teasing,Looking a little bug-eyed there, honey.  Too much coffee this morning?
4-female_must_strip,target:ayano,targetStage:0=confused,Uh, you OK, Ayano?  Your eyes are all shifty, like somebody's watching you.
4-female_must_strip,target:ayano,targetStage:0=annoyed,...Could you settle down there, girlie?  You're giving me the stink-eye like I killed someone.  It's creeping me out.
4-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:0=seductive,Hi there, dearie!  That's an absolutely <i>adorable</i> hat you have on--do you have any others that match that uniform?
4-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:0=seductive,Ohh, tiny little things like you always make my heart melt!  Is the schoolgirl look a style where you live?
4-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:0=stretching,A student's uniform is always the most adorable thing.  As you might imagine from my piracy, I wasn't the best student.
4-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:0=vain,School was always so dreadfully boring, the way they prattled on about men.  But you make the outfit look pretty cute, Miss Magician!
4-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=vain,Omigosh, are you <i>filming</i> this?  Look this way--over here!  Get every angle you can!
4-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=vain,You're <i>broadcasting</i> this?  To a <i>live audience</i>?  This is a dream come true--now <i>all of Earth</i> will witness my beauty!
4-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=vain,Omigosh!  <i>Omigosh</i>!  You're <i>broadcasting</i> this to people all around Earth?  Maybe I'll finally become a model!
4-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=seductive,You're <i>filming</i> this?  Omigosh--normally I have to get Barnette to capture my beauty on camera!  You're so sweet!
4-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=vain,I hope you don't think that camera is going to scare me away.  I may be a wanted criminal, but I'm also <i>beautiful</i>!
4-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=vain,You picked a good table to film, honey.  The only thing that loves me more than Barnette is a camera!
4-female_must_strip,target:black_canary,targetStage:0=teasing,Oho--a fellow blonde!  Good to see them running around on Earth--we've got to stick together!
4-female_must_strip,target:black_canary,targetStage:0=seductive,Hey there, cutie!  Always good to see more lovely blonde women running around.  Got to keep each other safe from those jealous brunettes.
4-female_must_strip,target:black_canary,targetStage:0=vain,Ooh, is blonde your natural color?  It's not as exotic as some of Mejare's other hair colors, but it's certainly appealing to be wrapped in gold.
4-female_must_strip,target:black_canary,targetStage:0=vain,What, was "Blonde Canary" taken?  Because <i>that's</i> what I would advertise, if I were you.
4-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:2=interested,...Hey, I know I said to relax, but don't go catching up to me, now.
4-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:2=laughing,My, my.  Almost even with me?  Didn't Gascogne train you better than this?  Or do you just visit her to ogle her muscles?
4-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:2=interested,This isn't the cool, professional Meia I've come to know.  Can't you finish me off?
4-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:2=teasing,Getting jealous, Meia?  Want to strip nude before I do?  Better hurry.
4-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0=confused,...Look, honey.  Makeup is a girl's best friend, but...it's possible to get a little too close to your friends.
4-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0,marker:fama_and_oma=laughing,Dear god.  Did you break into your Fama's makeup closet and start applying whatever you could find?  Your friends are letting you down.
4-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0=smug,I guess I never appreciated how light with makeup I can be with my natural beauty.  Here we see the alternative...
4-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0=vain,Check out Miss Makeup over here.  Somehow she made it through childhood without hearing the expression "less is more."
4-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:0=seductive,I understand, dear.  You're so stunned by my beauty that you hid your own face in shame.  I'm sure you're still cute!
4-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:0=seductive,Don't hide that pretty little face on <i>my</i> account, honey.  You've certainly got a beautiful <i>figure</i>.
4-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:0=teasing,Nice little bodysuit you've got there, even if you plan on being the Masked Woman.  I know a sugar-and-ice girl with your fashion sense.
4-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:0=laughing,You've got a lot of sass for someone who won't show her face, Miss Masked.  Hiding some grisly injury, or just your own embarrassment?
4-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0=interested,Looks like this place attracts more spacefarers than I gave it credit for.  Fine by me--at least someone knows where I'm coming from.
4-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0=seductive,What planet are you from, Miss Starshine?  Your fabulous blonde hair is winning me over as we speak.
4-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0=vain,Guess I can't learn about Earth girls from <i>you</i>--but hey, it's nice to know there's other gorgeous spacefarers out there.  Who like stripping.
4-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0=vain,Ooh, you cut your hair short like Meia does.  But it's wonderful blonde like mine--<i>space is so vast in its variety</i>!
4-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:1=awkward,You're all flushed, Meia.  Never seen you like this...
4-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:1=awkward,You're a mess, Meia...I told you not to take your eyepiece off.
4-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:1=awkward,Jeez...you're all broken up and blushing.  It's weird seeing you as anything but stoic.
4-female_must_strip,target:gogo,targetStage:0=teasing,What's your story, Miss Highlights?  Got any gum to share?
4-female_must_strip,target:gogo,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=teasing,Hey, toss me a piece of that gum, cutie.  I could use a snack while you tell me all about your "San Fransokyo" planet.
4-female_must_strip,target:gogo,targetStage:0=vain,Just gonna blow bubbles all day, or are you actually going to strip?  Either way, I wouldn't mind having some myself...
4-female_must_strip,target:gogo,targetStage:0=interested,You seem a little sour, Miss Gumball.  If those bubbles aren't cheering you up, just give me the rest to chew.
4-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=smug,Knew I could manage to make you play a <i>little</i> bit.
4-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=interested,Dominant as ever, boss.  But you couldn't hold out completely.
4-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=teasing,Couldn't quite get me out my dress before you got tagged, huh, Meia?  Well, get to it.
4-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=laughing,What's up, Four-Feet-Four-Eyes?  You look like someone brought you here at gunpoint.
4-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=laughing,Oh, look, the egghead love child of Parfet and Dita--nerdy and <i>and</i> eccentric!  How's the weather at the bottom of the earth?
4-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0,marker:fama_and_oma=laughing,I keep trying to look over your outfit, but my eyes just keep moving too fast and missing it.  Did your Fama not produce milk, shorty?
4-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=interested,You're such a cute little bespectacled spectacle--but damn if you don't look eleven.  Where's the other two feet of your body?
4-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0=seductive,Check out that messy hair...and adorable student outfit!  Did you say you're a <i>witch</i>?
4-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0=smug,Watch out, ladies, we've got a full-blown <i>magician</i> on our hands.  On Mejare you get called a witch for saying men aren't the worst thing ever.
4-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0=vain,A <i>witch</i>, eh?  Forgive my doubts...that jealous old hag of a judge called me a witch just for having that anatomy book!
4-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0=seductive,Awww!  She even brought a little magic wand to complete the costume!  <i>You're so cute, Miss Witch</i>.
4-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0=vain,Between you and that time I got called a witch for showing interest in men, witches are just <i>irresistible</i> these days.
4-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0=smug,Dear god, girl, you'd cower if a light breeze rolled in.  What's the big deal with a little <i>exposure</i>?
4-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0=seductive,You are just <i>so</i> cute.  How do you feel about women, little Miss?  <i>Do my breasts bother you</i>?
4-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0=vain,Shy around nudity, sweetie?  Did the big, bad Earth men beat this into you?  Just <i>enjoy</i> yourself...
4-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0=laughing,You're such a nervous wreck that I just feel bad for teasing you.  Way to ruin my fun.
4-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:1=awkward,So, Miss Kitty, you, uh, going to shave your bottom fur now?  ...I'd like that.
4-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:1=frustrated,Knowing that that's fur now makes me <i>really</i> want to see you shaved...Mejare likes shaving.
4-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:1=bored,Is the bottom fur going now?  Because I <i>hate</i> hair...except on the head.
4-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:1=bored,Please tell me you're shaving everything else.  That's sort of the style on Mejare, so it's what I know.
4-female_must_strip,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=laughing,Normally I'd say rock the skin color you have, but <i>wow</i>.  Pink is <i>not</i> an attractive color...not <i>that</i> pink.
4-female_must_strip,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=stretching,And here I thought <i>Mejarians</i> were the ones with the exotic body colors.  Earth girls are breaking out the bright pink skin!
4-female_must_strip,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=confused,Why's your skin all gross-looking and pink?  Like, <i.really</i> pink.  It's distracting...so is that eyepatch, too.
4-female_must_strip,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=smug,Not to be outdone, Earth starts showing this Mejarian just how bizarre its colors can truly get.  Next on the agenda: <i>pink skin</i>.
4-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:0=laughing,Hey, Kitty-cat.  You're supposed to strip <i>during</i> the game, not <i>before</i> it.
4-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:0=interested,Nice Halloween costume, Kitty, but maybe you should have picked something a little more complex for this game.
4-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:0=smug,Not too interested in winning, huh, Kitty-cat?  Unless you've brought some yarn-balls you plan on counting.
4-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:0=smug,I only know about cats from Mejare's zoos...they only showed the females, of course.  But they were definitely more covered than <i>you</i> are.
4-female_must_strip,target:faye,targetStage:0=smug,Beautiful hair, makeup, spacefaring?  With <i>both</i> of us running around, this table's going to get sick of the archetype.
4-female_must_strip,target:faye,targetStage:0=laughing,Do we have a fellow star-crossing seductress on our hands?  I'm not sure there's enough meat for both of us.
4-female_must_strip,target:faye,targetStage:0=teasing,<i>Hey, good-lookin'.</i>  Trying to steal my thunder with the "seductress-from-space" angle?  I don't mind--<i>I like women, too</i>.
4-female_must_strip,target:faye,targetStage:0=seductive,You didn't doll yourself up like that just to please some <i>men</i>, did you?  Come show this fellow spacefarer what you can do.
4-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0=excited,Ooh, Sei, you're such a cutie!  You look <i>just like</i> my squadron leader, Meia--that short blue hair is to <i>die</i> for!
4-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0=teasing,Short blue hair and shoulder armor?  You're the spitting image of my boss, Sei--too bad she's at another table!
4-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0=seductive,Short blue hair?  Omigosh, Sei, my boss Meia looks <i>just like</i> you!  And she could really use a girlfriend.
4-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0=seductive,Sei!  That's your name, right?  You look like my boss Meia with that short-cut blue hair.  Your eyes are a lot softer, though.
4-female_must_strip,target:evie,targetStage:0=vain,So what's your story?  You can cast magic spells or something?  If it's true, sign me up--it'll be another wonderful thing about me!
4-female_must_strip,target:evie,targetStage:0=vain,Some might call my <i>beauty</i> magical...I'm inclined to agree.
4-female_must_strip,target:evie,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, honey.  Cast a spell on <i>me</i>...one that makes me even prettier.  Now <i>that</i> would be magic!
4-female_must_strip,target:evie,targetStage:0=interested,Alright, I've seen enough crazy Paksis-magic to believe your tales.  But why don't you put your money where your mouth is?
4-female_must_strip,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=seductive,Oh?  And what do we have here, besides the most adorably shy little woman I've ever seen?
4-female_must_strip,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=stretching,Such a cutie...and in a traditional-looking dress!  Hard to believe someone so shy would even be here.
4-female_must_strip,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=seductive,Something wrong, honey?  <i>You've hardly been looking me in the eye</i>.  It's OK, I don't bite.
4-female_must_strip,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=vain,Why so shy, Elizabeth?  Confidence makes women ten times as beautiful--just look at me!
4-female_must_strip,target:elena,targetStage:0=teasing,Little Miss Princess wants to play strip poker, does she?  Well, I hope you don't mind if this nasty pirate holds you hostage.
4-female_must_strip,target:elena,targetStage:0=laughing,Looking a little out of your element, Miss Blueblood.  Gonna prove that you're really better than the rest of us like your title implies?
4-female_must_strip,target:elena,targetStage:0=smug,Look at Miss Princess, lugging around a scepter just to prove she's better than the peons.  We'll see how you enjoy stripping down like us.
4-female_must_strip,target:elena,targetStage:0=annoyed,Royals really get on my nerves, you know...mostly because I'm <i>not</i> one, despite actually being better-looking.
4-female_must_strip,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0=teasing,Totally devoted to scarlet, eh?  It certainly gets the heart racing...<i>and my appetite stirred</i>.
4-female_must_strip,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0=vain,Maybe <i>I</i> should get a fanciful nickname like Scarlet Witch...but not if it means restricting myself to one measly color.
4-female_must_strip,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0=seductive,What do you think would be a good nickname for me, dear?  <i>The Black Pirate</i>?  I can't pull off all-red like you do.
4-female_must_strip,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0=stretching,I wonder if all-red would look good on me.  I'm a pirate--I don't exactly have my pick of the litter with clothes!
4-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0=smug,Well, look at what we have here!  A blonde spacefarer in a jumpsuit.  Well, I guess we <i>almost</i> match...
4-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0=seductive,I'm a big fan of the bodysuit look, cutie.  So's a certain crewmate of mine I wish was here...space just makes it so much easier.
4-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, a <i>blonde</i>!  And she travels around in space, too.  If only you had the sense to wear my dress instead of that suit, we'd be twins.
4-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0=vain,A shapely little specimen, zipping around space in that provocative bodysuit?  You're a model Mejarian--if only Meia were here!
4-female_must_strip,target:hinata,targetStage:0=smug,So what are these "ninjas" all about, huh?  Disappearing into the night doesn't sound useful in a game like <i>this</i>.
4-female_must_strip,target:hinata,targetStage:0=teasing,Don't tell me your going to use those ninja skills to hide your body, now.
4-female_must_strip,target:hinata,targetStage:0=stretching,Certainly an impressive profile, Miss Ninja.  Think you could show us just <i>how</i> impressive?
4-female_must_strip,target:hinata,targetStage:0=interested,Does "ninja" just mean you wear a headband?  Sounds like a lofty title for my Barnette to accidentally fall under.
4-female_must_strip,target:hope,targetStage:0=confused,Hey, dearie, no reason to come out knives-swinging.  I've got my rapier sheathed like a civilized woman.
4-female_must_strip,target:hope,targetStage:0=awkward,Settle down there, honey.  There's something awfully scary about wearing a smile with a knife out.
4-female_must_strip,target:hope,targetStage:0=frustrated,I know I brought a sword, sweetheart, but that was just for fashion.  Don't turn this place into a bloodbath.
4-female_must_strip,target:hope,targetStage:0=shocked,Well, hi there, cutie--er, uh, <i>knife-wielding</i> cutie.  Yeah.  Carry on.
4-female_must_strip,alsoPlaying:meia,priority:0=vain,Look this way while you do it, ~name~.  I won't judge...not out loud, anyway.
4-female_must_strip,alsoPlaying:meia,priority:0=teasing,Hey, ~name~.  Might be weird to you, but I grew up learning to <i>love</i> women...
4-female_must_strip,alsoPlaying:meia,priority:0=smug,Just luck, all luck.  No use getting all bent out of shape in this game.
4-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0=interested,What's with the wings, Miss Pixie?  You some kind of sex-fairy sent to wake up our libidos?
4-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0=seductive,And what do we have here?  A tender little love fairy to help us all along in our sexual adventures?
4-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0=teasing,A love fairy, eh?  You listen here, Miss Pixie--<i>I'm</i> in a happy relationship.  So no touching!
4-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0=laughing,Little Miss Pixie's got quite the filthy mouth for being so frilly-pink with love.  I guess sex <i>is</i> a part of love, but still...
4-female_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=teasing,Bad news, ~name~...that was the best chance you had for getting me out of this thing!  Did you <i>see</i> my hand?
4-female_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=seductive,Oh, my!  You threw the hand to let me keep my modesty?  You are just the <i>sweetest</i> thing, ~name~!
4-female_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=seductive,Just when I thought the dress had to go, ~name~ comes to my rescue.  <i>You're so sweet</i>!
4-female_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=confused,<i>The moment you've all been waiting f</i>--oh.  Well, uh, I won, but I guess I spoiled how I'm down to my dress now.
4-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0=stretching,Hey, Chatterbox, feel free to live a little.  You're as bad as Meia...good thing she ended up somewhere else.
4-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0=stretching,And here I thought I was sparing this table the boredom of having Meia around.  Enter her Earth doppelganger.
4-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0=smug,Pale, dead-serious, somehow convinced there's strategy in cards.  I didn't know they synthesized Meia's brand of boredom on Earth.
4-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0=laughing,<i>Please, Chatterbox, you're talking our ears off.  And your smiles are just so radiant</i>!  A woman after Meia's own black heart.
4-female_must_strip,target:kurumu,targetStage:0=laughing,Hey there, short stuff!  Seems all your height went into your chest--those things are even bigger than mine!
4-female_must_strip,target:kurumu,targetStage:0=interested,You hogging all the nutrients on this planet, Miss Vampire?  You're the only Earth girl I've seen that outdoes <i>my</i> breasts.
4-female_must_strip,target:kurumu,targetStage:0=smug,Even through that schoolgirl's outfit, I can tell your breasts are superior to mine.  Hopefully Barnette loves me for <i>other</i> reasons.
4-female_must_strip,target:kurumu,targetStage:0=laughing,Is it true you suck blood, Miss Vampire?  If so...well, we certainly know where it all goes.
4-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, cutie!  You look a little wide-eyed and naive to be here...but those bullets suggest otherwise.
4-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0=stretching,I've got my eye on you, Miss Ruby-Red.  I know better than to trust a cute girl with ammo clips on her belt.
4-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0=vain,You know who else is a cute girl with a little ammo on the side?  My girlfriend, Barnette.  And if you're anything like her, I better not get you angry.
4-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0=seductive,The black-and-red outfit is a winner, honey--very intimidating!  So's that ammo.  Guess you need to balance out your cute face.
4-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0=excited,Ooh!  Ooh!  You're the one who's with a woman, right?  You some kind of Mejarian envoy to Earth?
4-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0=thinking,You're with a woman, isn't that right?  Maybe Mejare was just aping what Earthlings came up with first...
4-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0=interested,So, you're the one showing these poor Earth girls the Mejarian way, right?  That they don't need men to be happy?  Good job.
4-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0=vain,<i>Finally</i>, an Earth woman who's realized how much better other women's bodies are.  We should gossip about our girlfriends later.
4-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0,marker:fama_and_oma=smug,So, Miss Mejarian-style, are you going to be the Fama, or is your ladyfriend?  My Barnette's far too cute to carry babies herself.
4-female_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=interested,For a second there, I thought I'd actually <i>lose</i> to an Earth woman.  But you just couldn't keep it together.
4-female_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=smug,Yeah, yeah.  We always outlast your little Harvest-bots, too, so no surprise.
4-female_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=teasing,Don't you want to see me show off the good stuff?  Well then, I hope you have another streak like that left in you!
4-female_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=teasing,Oh, ~name~?  That lucky run wasn't lucky enough.  Too bad!
4-female_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=stretching,Keep it up.  I like women with a little fight in them...like Barnette.
4-female_must_strip,target:kimberly,targetStage:0=confused,Hey, so, uh, normally I'd tease you or something, but what was with that big lightshow from you earlier?
4-female_must_strip,target:kimberly,targetStage:0=confused,Wait, weren't you wearing pink a little while ago?  Like, a full suit?  Was that lightshow back there <i>you</i>?
4-female_must_strip,target:kimberly,targetStage:0=shocked,Hey, who's the new girl?  And where'd that pink-suit-wearing woman go after she flashed away?  Wait, was that <i>you</i>?
4-female_must_strip,target:kimberly,targetStage:0=angry,Hey, aren't you the one who half-blinded us all a little bit ago?  Where'd your suit go?  I thought it was cool, so start talking.
4-female_must_strip,target:kim,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, nice and simple fashion is always a treat to see.  I have a crewmate who bares her stomach just like you do!
4-female_must_strip,target:kim,targetStage:0=laughing,Hey, girlie.  I hope your stomach isn't feeling too vulnerable, all exposed next to the alien lady's rapier.
4-female_must_strip,target:kim,targetStage:0=teasing,Feeling confident, dear?  With a name like Pissible and a belly that vulnerable, you <i>must</i>.
4-female_must_strip,target:kim,targetStage:0=teasing,<i>Save the world</i>, huh?  Well, dearie, you and your little midriff should know I'm not <i>from</i> this world.
4-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=smug,Dull that edge, honey.  We're all just trying to have a good time here, stripping naked for complete strangers.
4-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=vain,You're a fiery one, Miss Edge.  A lot like my <i>darling</i> Barnette!  So I don't mind.
4-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=laughing,That red streak in your hair should've tipped us off that you'd be all angry.  Maybe feeling the breeze on your breasts will cheer you up.
4-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=vain,You know what warms me up to others, Miss Edge?  Shaking my breasts around for them--<i>they always appreciate that</i>!
4-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=seductive,<i>Oooh</i>!  Even ~player~ realizes how beautiful I am--enough to add a clone!  You're so <i>adorable</i>.
4-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=laughing,Hey, what's this all about, ~player~?  Did I keep on winning, and you wanted to see me naked <i>that</i> badly?
4-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=vain,Would you look at that?  My beauty was so enticing that ~player~ figured out the offline version just to add more of me.
4-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=vain,Earth's cloning technology is well underway!  And ~player~ picked the <i>perfect</i> specimen, I must say.
4-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=vain,I never thought ~player~ could manage to flatter me, and then they go and pick <i>two</i> of me!  Good show.
4-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=laughing,<i>My, my, ~player~</i>.  You <i>really</i> like the look of me.
4-female_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=smug,What kind of self-respecting woman drops the ball with her opponent so close to being shamed?  <i>Earth girls</i>...
4-female_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=laughing,Trying to beat me to the punch with all the glorious reveals?  Or did you just forget how cards work?
4-female_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=interested,What's up, ~name~?  Too preoccupied with thoughts of male tubes to focus on the cards?
4-female_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=teasing,I know Earth girls are scared of each others' bodies, but come on, don't you <i>want</i> to see me out of this dress?
4-female_must_strip,target:jubilee,targetStage:0=vain,Well, aren't <i>you</i> a little fireball, Miss Mutant?  You look pretty human to me, and this is a girl who thought <i>men</i> were aliens.
4-female_must_strip,target:jubilee,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, honey, <i>men</i> are mutant people, as far as I'm concerned.  And they're still cute, so don't be so hard on yourself.
4-female_must_strip,target:jubilee,targetStage:0=smug,How many people have to tell you you're ugly for you to introduce yourself as a <i>mutant</i>?  You poor, rundown thing.
4-female_must_strip,target:jubilee,targetStage:0=stretching,You look pretty mundane for a <i>mutant</i>, darling.  Although you've certainly got an inhuman fire in you.
4-female_must_strip,target:joey,targetStage:0=confused,What's with all the makeup?  Someone said you're a...<i>clown</i>, whatever that means?
4-female_must_strip,target:joey,targetStage:0=confused,...So does <i>clown</i> mean "makeup advertiser"?  Because you're modeling too many products at once.
4-female_must_strip,target:joey,targetStage:0=laughing,...Earth makeup is something else.  Apparently there's whole classes of women called <i>clowns</i> who just cake it on!
4-female_must_strip,target:joey,targetStage:0=confused,So if I wore as much makeup as you do, would that make me a "clown"?  Where's the lower limit?  This is all new to me.
4-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:0=laughing,<i>Boo</i>!  <i>The nasty pirate woman's going to kill you</i>!
4-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:0=laughing,You're a cute little thing, Saki!  So plain and innocent...perfect for a pirate like me to <i>kidnap</i>!
4-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:0=laughing,Seeing a cute little Earth girl all clammed up like this really makes me want to comfort her...<i>with my rapier</i>!
4-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:0=laughing,Hey, Miss Schoolgirl.  Ever met an <i>alien</i> before?  You should know...<i>we eat Earthlings' brains</i>!
4-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:4=laughing,Shame.  Those shorts of yours are cute...all dopey and conservative and granny-esque.
4-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:4=laughing,The shorts are next to go, right?  Aww...but they're so adorable.  It's like what an old woman wears.
4-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:4=teasing,Darn.  I was hoping we could stand in our underwear together, maybe show the full range of Mejarian styles...sexy and granny.
4-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:4=laughing,Aw, not your cute little old-lady shorts!  Seriously, you dress like you're the captain's age.
4-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0=laughing,What's up, sourpuss?  You look even more miserable than a certain squadron leader I know.
4-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0=smug,Hey, lighten up, girlie.  I didn't come all the way to Earth to find what I could get from Meia's strategy lectures.
4-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0=stretching,<i>Yawn</i>...are you really going to be a miserable bore this whole time?  Would having <i>my</i> breasts make you feel better?
4-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0=smug,Looks like it's Little Miss Sunshine's turn to strip.  Good thing Meia's not here, or this table would just freeze over.
4-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:3=laughing,Getting your breasts out already?  Miss Ice Queen is about to thaw a little.
4-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:3=teasing,How about that?  Meia exposing her breasts before <i>I</i> had to.  Good call--we've got to save Mejare's best for last.
4-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:3=teasing,You were <i>this</i> close to freeing me of my dress.  But no, you had to steal the glorious Mejarian breasts reveal all for yourself, you little deviant.
4-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:3=laughing,Aww, and we could've seen <i>mine</i> first instead!  Consider this the Mejarian appetizer rather than dessert, then.
4-female_must_strip,target:seven,targetStage:0=teasing,Seems bodysuits are more popular among spacegoers than even <i>I</i> figured.  Works for me--I like your figure.
4-female_must_strip,target:seven,targetStage:0=seductive,<i>My, my, honey</i>!  You've got some interesting decorations, but that suit is making me fall in love already.
4-female_must_strip,target:seven,targetStage:0=vain,I really ought to try out one of those bodysuits myself...or maybe stuff Barnette in one.  They're just so <i>revealing</i>!
4-female_must_strip,target:seven,targetStage:0=vain,Those jumpsuits really are the best, especially when you're in low gravity.  The enemy should know how beautiful you are!
4-female_must_strip,target:elaine,targetStage:0=seductive,And what do we have here?  An <i>Earth</i> pirate?  And with a sword, to boot!  Interesting...
4-female_must_strip,target:elaine,targetStage:0=teasing,I see even Earth pirates understand the subtle elegance of a blade!  And you've got some <i>luxurious</i> hair yourself.
4-female_must_strip,target:elaine,targetStage:0=seductive,Oho--a fellow pirate?  I'd absolutely <i>love</i> to have a drink later--maybe you could teach me how to handle my sword better.
4-female_must_strip,target:elaine,targetStage:0=seductive,<i>Well, now</i>!  You Earth pirates don't dress like we do on Mejare--but your choice of weapon isn't too far off.  Can you show me around?
4-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=laughing,Well, aren't <i>you</i> a tight little ball of sexual energy!  I guess it's got nowhere to go in that tiny frame of yours.
4-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=vain,You've got a lot of libido packed into a little body.  Must be the effects of Earth men...we Mejarians are <i>tasteful</i> in our sexuality.
4-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=laughing,<i>Why, I never</i>!  You're so dreadfully lewd, Miss Tan...do men just like women on the shorter side?
4-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=vain,You must get a lot of attention from men to be all amped-up like this.  <i>Tell me a tall woman still has a chance</i>!
4-female_must_strip,target:shazza,targetStage:0=smug,Quite the interesting accent you've got there.  I can't quite call it refined, but then again, I <i>am</i> a filthy pirate.
4-female_must_strip,target:shazza,targetStage:0=stretching,I guess when I lead a life of crime, I can't get away with calling you uncivilized-sounding.  Actions mean so much more!
4-female_must_strip,target:shazza,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=laughing,Interesting dialect you have on Planet Australia.  Don't you ever get tired of misunderstanding each other?
4-female_must_strip,target:shazza,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=laughing,This <i>Australia</i> planet certainly has a way with words...mostly for making them incomprehensible.
4-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=teasing,Ooh, you've got quite the set of muscles on you.  Shame Meia's not here.  She'd totally melt right in front of you!
4-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=seductive,Check out those legs, hot stuff!  You look like you could lift up the whole table with those things alone--good thing Meia's not here to fawn over you.
4-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=seductive,Omigosh, you should meet Meia, my boss--she's really icy, but women with muscles totally get her going.  And she'd try not to show it!
4-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, Miss Muscles, you into women?  Because my squadron leader Meia is all about exercise, and she <i>desperately</i> needs a girlfriend.
4-female_must_strip,target:buffy,targetStage:0=confused,Do you seriously fight those "vampire" things?  I mean, you just don't look all that imposing.
4-female_must_strip,target:buffy,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, you're kind of cute!  Is that how you kill "vampires"?  Just making them let their guard down with your adorable face?
4-female_must_strip,target:buffy,targetStage:0=confused,So what's it take to kill these "vampires"?  Can't you just get the military to shoot them or something?  You don't seem all that special.
4-female_must_strip,target:buffy,targetStage:0=smug,For a girl called "Buffy," you sure seem awful willowy.  You <i>do</i> have a cute face, so maybe that's your strategy for killing those vampire things.
4-female_must_strip,target:ciri,targetStage:0=smug,A <i>witcher</i>, eh?  Is that Earth dialect for witch?  Because I got called a witch for possession of Duero's sex book.
4-female_must_strip,target:ciri,targetStage:0=stretching,Is it <i>witcher</i> or <i>witch</i>?  Or, shall I say, <i>which</i> is it?
4-female_must_strip,target:ciri,targetStage:0=vain,So is a "witcher" even witchier than a witch?  I've been called a witch just for wanting to see what men have got in their pants.
4-female_must_strip,target:ciri,targetStage:0=smug,Forgive me for not being impressed with the term "witcher."  How <i>could</i> I be when all it takes for that on Mejare is a libido?
4-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=interested,Hey, Eyebags, you gonna stay awake all game?  You look like you're drifting away already.
4-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=teasing,Talk about never leaving the house.  You look like you've never seen sunlight--and you're dozing off as we speak!
4-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=smug,Gotta be honest, sweetie--between the pale skin and the vacant look in your eyes, you're really reminding me of a zombie.
4-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=confused,So do you work super hard all day at your job?  Why do you look all gaunt and drowsy?  Get some beauty sleep, woman.
4-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, you're a cutie!  Yet surprisingly sturdy on your feet, what with all that armor.  <i>Don't bowl me right over</i>!
4-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=laughing,Hi there, darling!  You must be pretty tough to lug all that armor around.  <i>Afraid I'll stab you</i>?
4-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=seductive,What's with that armor, sweetheart?  You'd be a lot cuter without it...I know I'm a pirate, but I'd never kill someone as cute as you.
4-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=vain,Adorable hairstyle, cute face--but all that armor!  You a soldier, dear?  <i>Oh, please forgive my horrid piracy</i>!
4-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:0=teasing,Ooh, an <i>assassin</i>.  I hope there's no bounty on my head!
4-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:0=stretching,Forgive this pirate for being a little on edge around an <i>assassin</i>.  There's a reward for my head, no doubt!
4-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:0=vain,You assassins always act so tough on the ground.  Let's see you take me in a dogfight!
4-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:0=teasing,You're a cute little thing, Miss Assassin.  I guess that helps in your line of work--people lower their guards.
4-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0=smug,You know, I'd call Meia the strong, silent type...but she still speaks <i>occasionally</i>.
4-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0=laughing,Slow on the uptake?  The "strong, silent type" doesn't mean <i>literally</i> never speaking, you know.
4-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0=vain,Oh, don't feel bad.  I know you're speechless at the sight of me--but I'll do enough talking for both of us!
4-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0=teasing,Stunned into speechlessness?  I'm flattered, but really, honey, you can talk to me.  I won't mind.
4-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, Chell.  If I'm the most gorgeous woman you've ever met, don't say anything.
4-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=smug,Where'd you say you were from?  Planet <i>Korea</i>?  Well then, it seems Korea and Mejare share a fashion sense...
4-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=teasing,You're a cutie, Miss Bodysuit, if a little on the short side.  Is that just how they make women over on Planet Korea?
4-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0=vain,If only Meia were here.  She dresses just like you do, D.Va...we should find out who wears it better!
4-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0=seductive,You're an adorable little thing, D.Va!  All wrapped up in that cute bodysuit, just like a certain <i>other</i> pilot I know.
4-female_must_strip,target:zizou_valentine,targetStage:0=interested,Don't you have a magic spell to give yourself some clothes, little Miss Magician?
4-female_must_strip,target:zizou_valentine,targetStage:0=interested,I must say, Zizou, I like your standard outfit better.  This is just trying too hard to make men like you.
4-female_must_strip,target:zizou_valentine,targetStage:0=laughing,Ohh, Barnette wears just as little when she cooks for me!  It's so cute...but then, <i>she</i> has breasts.
4-female_must_strip,target:zizou_valentine,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, Miss Magician...<i>don't wear clothes you can't fill</i>.  But definitely wear clothes in general.
4-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, an armed woman--and one with chocolate flavoring!  You're like an extreme version of my tan little gun-nut girlfriend.
4-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0=vain,I'm not sure what's most intimidating--that height, that imposing dark complexion, or that huge mechanical firearm!
4-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0=stretching,If only I brought my cute little Barnette here.  She'd be head-over-heels for a woman with a man's gun!
4-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0=teasing,You might be even taller than me, Miss Nighttime.  That might turn even more heads on Mejare than your rather large firearm!
4-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0=smug,Come now, honey.  You can't waltz in waving that huge kinetic weapon around and expect to make any friends.
4-female_must_strip,target:sharla,targetStage:0=teasing,Good thing you're a medic, because that mysterious dark complexion is making my heart beat ever faster.
4-female_must_strip,target:sharla,targetStage:0=seductive,Do you know how many women on Mejare are dark-skinned, Miss Medic?  Not enough, I say...even my Barnette is just a little tan.
4-female_must_strip,target:sharla,targetStage:0=vain,Oh, Miss Medic?  I think I'm coming down with something--<i>love for your chocolate flavoring</i>!
4-female_must_strip,target:sharla,targetStage:0=teasing,You dress pretty casually for a medic, but that exotic dark skin is helping me overlook your shoddy sense of professionalism.
4-female_must_strip,target:daisy,targetStage:0=smug,Ohoho.  Miss Boring-old-Brunette puts on a fancy store-bought dress and suddenly thinks she's better than the rest of us.
4-female_must_strip,target:daisy,targetStage:0=interested,So, "Princesses" are like rulers, right?  So what makes <i>you</i> so special, girlie?
4-female_must_strip,target:daisy,targetStage:0=annoyed,I've never subscribed to the idea of royalty.  What, some plain-jane with a chip on her shoulder just <i>decides</i> she's better than me?
4-female_must_strip,target:daisy,targetStage:0=vain,So what if I had to steal my dress?  I'm still more beautiful than Miss Too-Big-for-her-Brooches here, with her servants and fancy title.
4-female_must_strip,target:daphne,targetStage:0=smug,Oh good, a fellow blonde...and tall, too.  Wasn't sure Earth girls could fit either category.
4-female_must_strip,target:daphne,targetStage:0=vain,You're not a bad looker yourself, honey.  Must be our wonderful blonde genetics that inform the rest of our bodies!
4-female_must_strip,target:daphne,targetStage:0=vain,You solve mysteries, is that right?  Well...there's no mystery about how wonderful it is to be blonde.
4-female_must_strip,target:daphne,targetStage:0=stretching,<i>Ho-hum</i>.  Another blonde in a dress...I'm just kidding, you're still cute.
4-female_must_strip,target:chara,targetStage:0=bored,<i>Yeesh</i>.  Being as beautiful as I am, I try to let other girls down easy, but...you're hard to look at.
4-female_must_strip,target:chara,targetStage:0=angry,...<i>Ew</i>.  I really can't tell where your face begins and your body ends.
4-female_must_strip,target:chara,targetStage:0=smug,...It's times like these that I <i>really</i> appreciate how fortunate I am to be born this beautiful.  Take a look at the alternative.
4-female_must_strip,target:chara,targetStage:0=annoyed,As if you weren't ugly enough, you've got this horrible look in your eyes.  What's your problem?
4-female_must_strip,target:zoey,targetStage:0=smug,These "zombies" of yours don't sound so bad...but then, I guess you don't have a fabulous fighter spaceship, do you?
4-female_must_strip,target:zoey,targetStage:0=stretching,See, my Vandread can shield a whole planet.  So I think we could quarantine your little zombie virus.
4-female_must_strip,target:zoey,targetStage:0=vain,A zombie virus, eh?  Not to brag, but my Vandread helped avoid the spread of disease on a planet once...<i>I'm so talented</i>.
4-female_must_strip,target:zoey,targetStage:0=laughing,The more you describe these "zombies," the more they just sound like men.  You sure that's not what you mean?
4-female_must_strip,target:calisto,targetStage:0=interested,What's up, Miss Pantsuit?  You sure laugh a lot for someone dressed so prim-and-proper.
4-female_must_strip,target:calisto,targetStage:0=laughing,You some kind of businesswoman, Miss Yuck-it-up?  How could such an esteemed professional be so <i>depraved</i> as to play this?
4-female_must_strip,target:calisto,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey there, Chuckles!  You look more conservative than I've ever <i>dreamed</i> of being...and yet here you are, stripping with me.
4-female_must_strip,target:calisto,targetStage:0=teasing,Something funny, Miss Formalwear?  Make sure this nasty pirate doesn't put a ransom on your very professional head.
4-female_must_strip,target:daria,targetStage:0=laughing,Way to half-ass your outfit, honey.  You look like you picked out whatever fell on you when you opened your closet!
4-female_must_strip,target:daria,targetStage:0=interested,...So is the "zero-effort" look how you attract Earth men?  Have I been going at this all wrong?
4-female_must_strip,target:daria,targetStage:0=smug,I should have known--men are too simple to understand complex outfits, so they respond better to cobbled-together looks like yours.
4-female_must_strip,target:daria,targetStage:0=laughing,Gotta be honest here, sweetheart--you don't look like the type to be playing this.  Those glasses aren't helping you pick out appealing clothes.
4-female_must_strip,target:blake,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, the black-and-white look is a classic!  Very striking and confident with that contrast.  And such a cute little bow!
4-female_must_strip,target:blake,targetStage:0=teasing,Maybe it's just me, but you've got a Mejarian sense of style!  Clashing colors, nice and sexy and revealing!  A woman after my own heart.
4-female_must_strip,target:blake,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, that's a cute outfit, Blake!  I love this dress, but I don't have anything quite as fancy as all that clashing-colors business.
4-female_must_strip,target:blake,targetStage:0=teasing,<i>Mmm</i>...the lace, the contrast, the <i>heels</i>!  I like your style, Blake!  Not bad for an Earth girl.
4-female_must_strip,target:shego,targetStage:0=laughing,You OK there, Miss Jumpsuit?  You're looking a little green-around-the-frills.
4-female_must_strip,target:shego,targetStage:0=interested,Is all the stripping and teasing making you nauseous, dearie?  Just trying to grin and bear it?
4-female_must_strip,target:shego,targetStage:0=teasing,I'm liking the style on the bodysuit, honey--it helps obscure your sickly green hue.
4-female_must_strip,target:shego,targetStage:0=smug,Mejarians have some say in their skin tone from genetic engineering...I don't think we can do green, but then I doubt it'd be too popular.
4-female_must_strip,target:blake_v4,targetStage:0=laughing,Way to go and expose your entire midriff there, Blake.  Who do you think you are, Dita?  <i>Me</i>?
4-female_must_strip,target:blake_v4,targetStage:0=interested,Nice vest you're rocking there, honey.  But you forgot to cover up your midsection...like me.
4-female_must_strip,target:blake_v4,targetStage:0=smug,Taking a few fashion tips from <i>me</i>, are you, Blake?  What with that midriff fully on display and all.
4-female_must_strip,target:blake_v4,targetStage:0=teasing,Well, aren't <i>you</i> looking more exposed than usual?  But as far as exposure goes, the midsection's a good choice.
4-female_must_strip,target:shantae,targetStage:0=teasing,Ooh, I think that dark complexion is <i>exotic</i>--so do most Mejarians.  You got a thing for women, Miss Genie?
4-female_must_strip,target:shantae,targetStage:0=seductive,So what's a "genie," anyway?  Does that mean "cute chocolate-flavored girl"?  Because I think I like genies, then.
4-female_must_strip,target:shantae,targetStage:0=seductive,I like your style, Miss Genie!  You're as revealing as my girlfriend Barnette--a little tanner, though.
4-female_must_strip,target:shantae,targetStage:0=teasing,Ooh, the way you move your hips is <i>exquisite</i>, Miss Genie!  I want to learn how to add a little vanilla flavoring to that, if you follow.
4-female_must_strip,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:0=interested,...Can I maybe just call you "DMG" for short?  Because <i>Dark Magician Girl</i> is a hell of a mouthful.
4-female_must_strip,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:0,marker:fama_and_oma=confused,...Don't you have an actual name?  You know, like the one your Fama gives you?
4-female_must_strip,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:0=teasing,You've really got to give yourself a snappier nickname, dearie...men aren't bright enough to remember that many words.
4-female_must_strip,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:0=stretching,If you really <i>are</i> a magician, color me interested...but that clunky name could use a shortening or two.
4-female_must_strip,target:dawn,targetStage:0=confused,What'd you say you raised?  Those little <i>Poker</i>--whatevers?  Is that why you're playing this game?
4-female_must_strip,target:dawn,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, dearie, that exotic blue hair will take you further than weird animal training--you should be a model for shampoo or something.
4-female_must_strip,target:dawn,targetStage:0=confused,Mejare has barely any animals at all, so this whole "pokey-mon" thing is lost on me.  And they just do whatever you say?
4-female_must_strip,target:dawn,targetStage:0=laughing,So could you train <i>men</i> the way you do these <i>poker</i>-whatevers?  Because <i>that</i> would be quite interesting...
4-female_must_strip,target:chica,targetStage:0=confused,...You know, I was shown films as a girl about how men were horrible monsters.  You're about what they looked like in those.
4-female_must_strip,target:chica,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>Ew</i>!  <i>Eek</i>!  <i>G-get away</i>!  <i>Stop</i>!  <i>What are you</i>?
4-female_must_strip,target:chica,targetStage:0=annoyed,...I really came here to meet some Earth women.  Not...whatever <i>this</i> is supposed to be.  Besides terrifying.
4-female_must_strip,target:chica,targetStage:0=angry,...What the hell am I looking at?  I wanted some cute girls, not a--a mechanical monstrosity!
4-female_must_strip,target:chica,targetStage:0=bored,You're a <i>robot</i>?  So like, you're Pyoro if he were designed by a blind woman?
4-female_must_strip,target:blackrose,targetStage:0=confused,I was gonna say something about that cool dark skin, but apparently...you're just some sort of image?  What's <i>that</i> about?
4-female_must_strip,target:blackrose,targetStage:0=frustrated,You're..."virtual"?  Listen, honey, you can't just assume we know what these things mean.  Piloting's a busy life, you know!
4-female_must_strip,target:blackrose,targetStage:0=bored,Wait, so you're not really here, and you're some kind of "virtual" avatar?  Earth has really gotten advanced from all the technology they keep stealing.
4-female_must_strip,target:blackrose,targetStage:0=annoyed,Hey, if we can just use computers to <i>project</i> ourselves here, why didn't anyone tell me?  I had to <i>fly</i> all the way here!


#lost dress
5-male_human_must_strip=teasing,Your turn, ~player~.  I'm all worked up, so make it something good.
5-male_human_must_strip=seductive,Feel free to match me, in whatever way a man might do that.
5-male_human_must_strip=interested,You're already braver than most Tarakkians.  One look at my chest and they'd be running for the hills.
5-male_human_must_strip=laughing,Watch out, ~player~.  Your organs are looking pretty tasty.
5-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rinkah,count-meia:1,count-corrin_f:1=smug,Hey, don't be rude to our little male friend here.  He's probably scared half to death, being around all these gorgeous women.
5-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rinkah,count-meia:1,count-corrin_f:1=laughing,Now, now, Rinkah.  That's no way to treat our lone man.  His little pea-brain can only handle so much stimulus.
5-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rinkah,count-meia:1,count-corrin_f:1=interested,Don't make fun, Rinkah.  At least he had the courage to come alone...or the stupidity.
5-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rinkah,count-meia:1,count-corrin_f:1=smug,It's not quite that dire.  Meia isn't exactly in a good mood, since I dragged her here.
5-male_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=interested,It's sweet of you to be saving me from my awful high-card hands, ~player~, but it's too little, too late.
5-male_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=seductive,Good to know someone on this table is still looking out for me, as I stand here in just my tiny thong.
5-male_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=vain,I'd call you stupid for losing to my <i>high card</i>, but you <i>did</i> get me out of my dress...so it was probably a fluke.
5-male_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=seductive-2,Oh, ~player~...you saved me from removing my thong, but as you can see, my modesty is already in tatters.
5-male_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=seductive,Winning with a high card is certainly more reassuring than this tiny bit of fabric I've got around my hips.
5-male_human_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:human,marker:human=teasing,Hey there, Handsome.  You've got a different look about you than everyone else...but I can't quite put my finger on how.
5-male_human_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:human,marker:human=seductive,Hi, Mr. Man...I've only met a few men before, so you're <i>very</i> exotic to me.  Won't you please show me your naked body?
5-male_human_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:human,marker:human=seductive,Hey, Darling.  You should know I come from a planet of <i>all</i> women...so you being a man makes me interested already.
5-male_human_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:human,marker:human=seductive,Is that you, ~player~?  You haven't said much so far...but you should know how exotic men are to me, and how much I want to learn about them.
5-male_human_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:human,marker:human=seductive,You'll show me a good time, won't you, Handsome?  <i>I'm looking for a strong, healthy man to give me a baby, you know</i>.
5-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=teasing,So, not to call you a harlot or anything, Misato, but you seem <i>awful</i> interested in these men...so am I.  How do you Earth girls get their attention?
5-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=confused,Ooh, you seem pretty confident around these Earth men, Misato.  From one woman to another, what's the secret to getting their attention?
5-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=confused,You seem to be doing a better job flirting with these Earth men, Misato.  Am I doing something wrong?  I always seem to scare them!
5-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=confused,Men just run away from me, usually...I thought they <i>like</i> being flirted with.  Misato, you seem to get them!
5-male_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=teasing,Stellar job keeping your focus, especially for a man.  I know it can be hard with a gorgeous naked alien woman eyeing you up.
5-male_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=teasing,Can't seem to shake you at all, handsome.  Maybe you're more into women's vaginas?  Well, you'll need more luck to see mine.
5-male_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=smug,Guess you're not a "breasts" sort of guy, to stay focused like that.  But then, I'm not sure if <i>any</i> men care about breasts like Mejarians do.
5-male_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=laughing,I hope you're proud of your little lucky streak.  I saw you staring with your beady little eyes, so I know it wasn't skill.
5-male_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=interested,I knew men got distracted by large breasts, but come on, ~player~, get it together.
5-male_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=laughing,Oho.  My master plan of distracting you with my gorgeous chest is well underway!
5-male_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=interested,<i>I'm</i> not embarrassed, ~player~, so try not to embarrass <i>yourself</i>.
5-male_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=teasing,Can't you force this Mejarian to take off her tiny little thong?  I mean, really.
5-male_must_strip=teasing,Your turn, ~name~.  I'm all worked up, so make it something good.
5-male_must_strip=seductive,Feel free to match me, in whatever way a man might do that.
5-male_must_strip=interested,You're already braver than most Tarakkians.  One look at my chest and they'd be running for the hills.
5-male_must_strip=laughing,Watch out, ~name~.  Your organs are looking pretty tasty.
5-male_must_strip,target:ryu,targetStage:0=laughing,Hey, hey, hey!  Talk about a hunk...and he's not even wearing much!  <i>Perfect</i>.
5-male_must_strip,target:ryu,targetStage:0=teasing,You look like you see a lot of physical action, hot stuff...can those big muscles toss me around?
5-male_must_strip,target:ryu,targetStage:0=laughing,A big hunk of a man with more muscles than brainpower?  Just what I've been looking for.
5-male_must_strip,target:ryu,targetStage:0=teasing,You seem a little clueless about this game, handsome.  Don't worry...<i>I'll guide you along</i>.
5-male_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=teasing,Stellar job keeping your focus, especially for a man.  I know it can be hard with a gorgeous naked alien woman eyeing you up.
5-male_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=teasing,Can't seem to shake you at all, handsome.  Maybe you're more into women's vaginas?  Well, you'll need more luck to see mine.

5-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena,count-meia:1=teasing,You <i>work</i> for this woman, Pit?  Look at that, Meia...it must be <i>Take-Your-Boss-to-Strip</i> Day.
5-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena,count-meia:1=smug,Oh, wow, this woman is your boss?  I guess I have no room to talk, considering I brought Miss Ice Queen along for the ride.
5-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena,count-meia:1=teasing,Look, Meia, this cute little angel-boy brought his boss, too!  I guess he and I are both into taking our superiors down a peg.
5-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena,count-meia:1=smug,Well, what do you know?  Pit brought this boss here too, Meia.  Only ~player~ has any sense, it seems.
5-male_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=interested,I knew men got distracted by large breasts, but come on, ~name~, get it together.
5-male_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=laughing,Oho.  My master plan of distracting you with my gorgeous chest is well underway!
5-male_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=interested,<i>I'm</i> not embarrassed, ~name~, so try not to embarrass <i>yourself</i>.
5-male_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=teasing,Can't you force this Mejarian to take off her tiny little thong?  I mean, really.
5-male_must_strip,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=confused,Well, now!  There's bizarre specimens, and then there's you.  Are you a man or a woman?
5-male_must_strip,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=confused,I can't really pin down your sex, to be honest...or your species, for that matter.
5-male_must_strip,target:mettaton,targetStage:0,marker:fama_and_oma=vain,Weren't you made in a lab?  So were all Mejarians before our Famas carried us!  ...But I'm not sure if you're a woman.
5-male_must_strip,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=confused,Way to go ahead and be the ultimate test of judging men vs. women.  Gotta say, I'm stumped.
5-male_must_strip,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=confused,...Oh, you're one of those <i>ann-drazza-nuss</i> types, right?  That's the word?
5-male_must_strip,target:mettaton,targetStage:0,marker:fama_and_oma=confused,Mejarians get made in labs, too...but our Famas carry us.  So maybe you're a man, then?  Tarakkians are carried to term in labs...
5-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:1=teasing,You've got to tell me more about yourself, Pit!  You're so darn shy...and I'm so <i>curious</i>!
5-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:1=seductive,Such a little motormouth, but it <i>alllll</i> clams up when I swing my gaze your way.  I love having this effect on cute little boys!
5-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:1=seductive,Come on, Mr. Angel, don't be shy!  I mean, it's cute, but I want to learn more about Earth men!
5-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:1=seductive,There's <i>so much</i> you could teach me about men, Pit...the men in my life always reject me.  And you're so nonthreatening!
5-male_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=interested,It's sweet of you to be saving me from my awful high-card hands, ~name~, but it's too little, too late.
5-male_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=seductive,Good to know someone on this table is still looking out for me, as I stand here in just my tiny thong.
5-male_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=vain,I'd call you stupid for losing to my <i>high card</i>, but you <i>did</i> get me out of my dress...so it was probably a fluke.
5-male_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=seductive-2,Oh, ~name~...you saved me from removing my thong, but as you can see, my modesty is already in tatters.
5-male_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=seductive,Winning with a high card is certainly more reassuring than this tiny bit of fabric I've got around my hips.
5-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:4=shocked,<i>Eep</i>!  O-oh, you <i>can</i> talk?  B-but...why didn't you?
5-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:4=interested,...So are you over your fear of women now?  Is that what the grunting was all about?
5-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:4=seductive,Oh, you <i>can</i> talk.  Did my beauty make you clam up, cutie?
5-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:4=smug,Well, that solves <i>that</i> mystery.  Come on and join us in the land of language like a civilized person.
5-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:4=smug,Oh, good, you can talk.  I had really lost all hope for men's intelligence for a while there.
5-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:4=shocked,<i>Ack</i>!  Wha--o-oh, you're done screaming!  Uh...OK.
5-male_must_strip,target:shaggy,targetStage:0=bored,Uh...you're kind of tall, I guess, but it doesn't look like you wash yourself much.  Gross.
5-male_must_strip,target:shaggy,targetStage:0=annoyed,I know you're a man, but can't you put a <i>little</i> effort into your appearance?  You look like you just rolled out of a gutter.
5-male_must_strip,target:shaggy,targetStage:0=smug,"Shaggy," huh?  That'd be like if my nickname were "Gorgeous."  Actually, I'll have to propose that next flight practice...
5-male_must_strip,target:shaggy,targetStage:0=frustrated,Gangly, unshaven, all around a mess.  I'm starting to miss the clean-cut professionalism of the Tarakkian soldiers I know.
5-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:2=vain,I can't get over how cute you are, honey...but seriously, what's with the angel outfit?  Men are no angels.
5-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:2=smug,Men have always struck as more <i>beastly</i> than angelic...which is fine by me.  So why do you dress like one?
5-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:2=confused,So, uh, I read about angels as a girl, but they were always women.  Why are you dolled-up like one, anyway?
5-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:2=confused,Do those wings detach?  They look pretty convincing, and the rest of your angel outfit is pretty good.  Why do you have that on, anyway?
5-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0=seductive,Well, what do we have here?  An adorable little cinnamon roll of a man, dressed up as an angel!
5-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0=seductive,You are just the cutest little man I've ever seen!  Hibiki's a little smaller, but he's got too much spunk to be cute.
5-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0=excited,Ohhh, you're so <i>cute</i>, Mr. Angel!  I could just <i>eat you up</i>!
5-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0=teasing,What's an adorable little man like you doing here, Pit?  Sure you want to strip nude in front of these scary, hulking women?
5-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=seductive,Omigosh, there's <i>two</i> of you girls?  Are you twins?  I heard Earth people could have matching babies called twins!
5-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=seductive,Ohh, you two ladies are so <i>adorable</i>!  One of you even cut your hair short, just like Meia does!
5-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=seductive,Well, what have we here?  Two cute little ladies dressed in matching armor sets?
5-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=confused,Wait, you're <i>both</i> named Corrin?  Look, girls, I know one's hair is short, but you should really dress different.
5-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:0=laughing,Wow, a <i>blindfold</i> at a table full of strangers?  I never knew men could be so...<i>depraved</i>.
5-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:0=interested,You're, uh, really making up for your stature with the fetish gear.  Can't look me in the eye, sweetheart?
5-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:0=interested,I knew men could be cowardly, but damn.  Even the <i>Tarakkians</i> I know can look a woman in the eye.
5-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:0=interested,So the blindfold's going first, right?  So you can actually read the cards from now on?
5-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:5=teasing,It's now or never, Little Dungeon Bot.  Going to look me in the eyes for once?
5-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:5=laughing,I spy with my little eye something you can still take off, Dungeon Robo.  That's because my eyes are uncovered.
5-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:5=interested,Sure you don't want to part with that blindfold, Mr. Robo-man?  Are you aware of the alternative, darling?
5-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:5=interested,Looks like Little Dungeon Bot is all out of dungeon items...well, except for the most striking one of all.
5-male_must_strip,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:0=smug,And I thought <i>I</i> was enthusiastic.  This man's blowing me out of the water.
5-male_must_strip,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:0=interested,Talk about bringing energy to the table.  Planning on winning this thing, or just shouting about it?
5-male_must_strip,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:0=laughing,Well, <i>someone's</i> a feisty one.  Hibiki's energetic, but you've got the body to match, hot stuff.
5-male_must_strip,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:0=confused,You're some kind of racecar driver or something?  Seems you're permanently amped-up from it.
5-male_must_strip,target:captain_america,targetStage:0=teasing,Woah, talk about <i>hunk</i>!  I want to see what those muscles can do, sweetheart.
5-male_must_strip,target:captain_america,targetStage:0=seductive,<i>Well, now</i>!  You look like just the big ball of hunk I've been searching for, cutie.
5-male_must_strip,target:captain_america,targetStage:0=teasing,Tall, check--muscles, check--handsome, <i>check</i>!  Looks like I've found me a winner, and he hasn't even stripped yet.
5-male_must_strip,target:captain_america,targetStage:0=seductive,<i>Oooh</i>!  Look at <i>you</i>, handsome!  Just the sort of man I hoped to see here!
5-male_must_strip,target:caleb,targetStage:0=confused,Oh look, a child-man.  What's the word--<i>boy</i>?  Anyway, I'm not gonna strip in front of a kid.
5-male_must_strip,target:caleb,targetStage:0=annoyed,Hey, kid, I know you're male, but can't you read?  No kids allowed.
5-male_must_strip,target:caleb,targetStage:0=annoyed,I'm gonna ignore the cat ears for a second and focus on how you look like you're twelve.  Beat it, kid, adults are trying to have fun here.
5-male_must_strip,target:caleb,targetStage:0=bored,...Listen, honey, we're playing a grown-up game for grown-ups.  You've got to leave...so I don't feel like a pedophile.
5-male_must_strip,target:caleb,targetStage:0=awkward,Hibiki's just short, but you...I don't think you're an adult.  Can't be sure with men, but still...
5-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=annoyed,<i>And who do we have he</i>--oh.  El Shaggy Blanco.  Great choice, ~player~.
5-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=frustrated,...You know, I put a lot of effort into having all these lines, and then you go and stick me with El Shaggy Blanco.
5-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=teasing,Thought I wouldn't have lines to April Fools' characters?  Well, think again, ~player~.
5-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=vain,Everyone give ~player~ a round of applause...they figured out how to use the offline version, as you can see.
5-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=annoyed,...I know you're proud of yourself for deciphering the offline version, ~player~, but you don't have to pick meme characters.
5-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=smug,Excellent character selection, ~player~.  You picked a joke that stopped being funny in 2017...whenever that was in Earth years.
5-male_must_strip,target:bi,targetStage:0=frustrated,...<i>Ew</i>.  What's wrong with your hands...and your <i>face</i>?
5-male_must_strip,target:bi,targetStage:0=annoyed,...I've got to be honest here.  You are <i>very</i> ugly...and I hate ugly things.
5-male_must_strip,target:bi,targetStage:0=annoyed,...Would it have killed you to wash yourself before coming here?  Or maybe not come at all?  I would've preferred that.
5-male_must_strip,target:bi,targetStage:0=angry,...OK, <i>ew</i>.  I wouldn't collect your seed if it meant they'd make me the Grand Ma for it.
5-male_must_strip,target:fred,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, maybe I'll take <i>your</i> seed.  You're tall and handsome...and most importantly, you're blond.
5-male_must_strip,target:fred,targetStage:0=teasing,What's this, now?  You solve mysteries?  Solve this, honey...whose handsome blond seed am I seriously considering taking right now?
5-male_must_strip,target:fred,targetStage:0=laughing,Hi there, handsome blond man!  You look like you could use a woman at your side...or maybe on top of you.
5-male_must_strip,target:fred,targetStage:0=interested,Duero might have better hair, but yours is blond...that's definitely a plus where I come from.
5-male_must_strip,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:0=confused,So "gay" is the Earth word for how Tarakkians live?  Actually, I'm not sure they even form couples there...
5-male_must_strip,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:0=smug,A man loving other men?  Well, if women can do it, I suppose men can...not that I really picture men capable of love.
5-male_must_strip,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:0=interested,Is this what man-on-man love does to your appearance?  Because you're a scary-looking customer.
5-male_must_strip,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:0=confused,You know, they taught me as a girl that men were monsters...you fit the part.  And apparently you don't like women, is that right?
5-male_must_strip,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:0=interested,If "gay" means what I think it does, I guess teasing you isn't going to get me anywhere...not that I <i>want</i> to see you naked.
5-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, hey, hey--check out <i>this</i> handsome stud!  What brings <i>you</i> here, Mr. Cool-and-Casual?
5-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:0=teasing,You look like you're right at home, Mr. Lackadaisical.  You know what I like in my men?  <i>Handsomeness</i>...like yours.
5-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:0=seductive,Hey, Jacket-and-Pants.  You look a little sleepy, but I can't deny how you're making my heart beat faster.  What's your story?
5-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:0=seductive,I can't take my eyes off you, handsome, even if <i>yours</i> seem a little sleepy.  Mind telling me about yourself?
5-male_must_strip,target:xander,targetStage:0=teasing,You're friends with that <i>Buffy</i> girl, right?  Well...<i>gonna seal the deal, or what</i>?
5-male_must_strip,target:xander,targetStage:0=interested,Well, you don't look so bad for a man.  Am I in competition with that Buffy woman?
5-male_must_strip,target:xander,targetStage:0=teasing,Not to be too forward or anything, but I'm on the prowl for a good man...for reasons you'll know soon enough.  Interested?
5-male_must_strip,target:xander,targetStage:0=vain,You're a pretty average-looking man.  I can live with that...but I bet they don't make women like <i>me</i> where you come from.
5-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:1=interested,<i>Pod this, data that</i>...you talk like you're a machine.  Why the formality, dear?
5-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:1=interested,Why do you talk like you're a robot half the time, huh?  Loosen up and enjoy yourself--if men can do that, of course.
5-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:1=interested,Hey, what's with all your formal data-mechanics babble?  You sound like you just rolled off the factory line, dearie.
5-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:1=seductive,Are you so polite and deferent and robotlike because you're short?  Because the short man <i>I</i> know is a real fireball!
5-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:1=laughing,Hey, darling little boy...why so mechanical in waist and taste?  I know <i>Tarakkians</i> are made in factories, but <i>sheesh</i>.
5-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:2=smug,Hey, so what's with those "Neighbors" you keep talking about?  I mean, Mejare certainly doesn't get along with <i>its</i> neighbors.
5-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:2=seductive,Hey, Handsome, when you say you fight Neighbors, how big a scale are we talking?  Let's just say neighboring planet Tarak isn't our best friend.
5-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:2=interested,Who are these "Neighbors" you say you fight?  Is this like a front-lawn kind of dispute, or do you mean as a solider?
5-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:2=interested,Did you say you fight neighbors, darling?  Mejarians usually fight their neighbors over gardening, unless we're talking planets.
5-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=seductive,Well, aren't <i>you</i> cute!  And you're dressed in all that fancy armor.  What's your name, girlie?
5-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=seductive,You are just the most <i>adorable</i> thing, even in all that heavy armor.  Can't you take it off and show us what an Earth woman looks like?
5-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=seductive,You're cute, dear!  You've even cut your hair short like Meia does.  Women can pull that off sometimes!
5-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=laughing,A woman in armor?  You're after Meia's own heart, you sly little thing!  Too bad she isn't here.
5-male_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=teasing,So, not to call you a harlot or anything, Misato, but you seem <i>awful</i> interested in these men...so am I.  How do you Earth girls get their attention?
5-male_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=confused,Ooh, you seem pretty confident around these Earth men, Misato.  From one woman to another, what's the secret to getting their attention?
5-male_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=confused,You seem to be doing a better job flirting with these Earth men, Misato.  Am I doing something wrong?  I always seem to scare them!
5-male_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=confused,Men just run away from me, usually...I thought they <i>like</i> being flirted with.  Misato, you seem to get them!
5-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena=laughing,Wait, wait, wait.  You <i>work</i> for this woman?  Quite the little boss-employee bonding exercise.
5-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena=interested,Oh wow, you two <i>work</i> together?  I mean, Meia's my boss, but we at least went to different tables.
5-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena=vain,You take orders from this woman, Pit?  Men and women, working together...I see how Earth operates.
5-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena=laughing,<i>Well, now</i>!  You work for this woman...how very, very awkward, Mr. Angel.
5-male_must_strip,target:kira,targetStage:0=teasing,Ooh, you're a handsome one...and blond, which is even better.  I see you eyeing me up...
5-male_must_strip,target:kira,targetStage:0=seductive,Hi there, sweetheart...what was your name again?  I forgot it when I got lost in your beautiful blond hair.
5-male_must_strip,target:kira,targetStage:0=seductive,I wasn't sure if men could pull off blonde hair the way women do...but you're living proof.  I'll keep my eye on you...
5-male_must_strip,target:kira,targetStage:0=seductive,Ah, <i>here's</i> what I've been looking for!  A handsome blond man.  <i>Try not to sweep me off my feet, darling</i>.
5-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=laughing,I see ~player~ has grown so desperate at the gender disparity in this game that they've turned to <i>Kool-Aid Man</i> for their fix.
5-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=annoyed,...Listen, ~player~, I get that this game doesn't have too many men, but you're better than this.  Pick a real character.
5-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=bored,Doesn't bode well for your opinion of me that you'd stick me with <i>this</i> idiot, ~player~.
5-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=awkward,...<i>Kool-Aid Man</i>, huh, ~player~?  That's...your choice?  Are you sure?
5-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=frustrated,<i>Kool-Aid Man</i>?  ...Do I <i>have</i> to keep playing?  If ~player~'s not gonna take this seriously, why should I?
5-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=interested,You're really starved for some male players, aren't you, ~player~?  Couldn't you pick, I don't know, Pit?  9S?  Come on.
5-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=annoyed,...What the hell am I looking at?  Forget playing against, just...<i>looking at</i>.
5-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=bored,...My beauty deserves better tablemates than this.
5-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=vain,On the female side of things, we have the most beautiful woman on the roster.  And on the male side of things, well...well.
5-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=seductive,Well, aren't <i>you</i> cute!  And you're dressed in all that fancy armor.  What's your name, girlie?
5-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=seductive,You are just the most <i>adorable</i> thing, even in all that heavy armor.  Can't you take it off and show us what an Earth woman looks like?
5-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,You're cute, dear!  Look, Meia, she even cut her hair short like you do!  Must be big on practicality, too.
5-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,A woman in armor?  Meia, this girl is trying to get on your good side...matching outfits like that.
5-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:0=interested,So are you, uh, going to produce actual <i>words</i> at some point?  Or is grunting and yelling all I can expect from a man?
5-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:0=smug,...I mean, I tease men about being stupid, but <i>did</i> think they were capable of <i>speech</i>.
5-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:0=laughing,...It would seem men haven't quite evolved up to the point of grasping language.  What a shame.
5-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:0=laughing,...You're really showing me new lows for male intelligence, Link.  Grunt again if you agree.
5-female_human_must_strip=teasing,Hey hey, ~player~.  Your turn, and make it count while you're at it.
5-female_human_must_strip=seductive,Don't be jealous, ~player~.  You're beautiful, too!
5-female_human_must_strip=vain,Now, now, ~player~.  Don't get yourself down by comparing your body to mine.  I'm a once-in-a-generation woman.
5-female_human_must_strip=stretching,Meia would be a lot more comfortable in that suit of hers if she ditched the underwear...or at least tried mine instead.
5-female_human_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:human,marker:human=teasing,I come from a world of all women, so you're nothing special to me.  But you <i>are</i> very cute, so I've got my eye on you, Missy.
5-female_human_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:human,marker:human=seductive,And who's <i>this</i> tight-lipped specimen?  "~player~"?  If you say so...<i>cutie</i>.
5-female_human_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:human,marker:human=seductive,Yet another woman?  Like a drop in the bucket for a Mejarian...but even still, you're <i>far</i> cuter than I expected for an Earth girl.
5-female_human_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:human,marker:human=seductive,You're a little more simply-dressed than the exotic types that seem to frequent this place, myself included.  But you sure have a cute face!
5-female_human_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:human,marker:human=vain,And who are <i>you</i>,~player~?  You've barely said a thing...but you can admire my beauty too, if you want!
5-female_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=interested,It's sweet of you to be saving me from my awful high-card hands, ~player~, but it's too little, too late.
5-female_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=seductive,Good to know someone on this table is still looking out for me, as I stand here in just my tiny thong.
5-female_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=vain,I'd call you stupid for losing to my <i>high card</i>, but you <i>did</i> get me out of my dress...so it was probably a fluke.
5-female_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=seductive-2,Oh, ~player~...you saved me from removing my thong, but as you can see, my modesty is already in tatters.
5-female_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=seductive,Winning with a high card is certainly more reassuring than this tiny bit of fabric I've got around my hips.
5-female_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,Good work, not getting all distracted by my beauty.  Bit of a blow to the ego, though.
5-female_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,You had a streak going.  You're one step closer to streaking yourself, though.
5-female_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99,alsoPlaying:meia=seductive,Nice little lucky run.  Luck's a good trait in a pilot...and in a lover.
5-female_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,This Earth girl's got some skill, lasting so long.  Do we have any piloting spots open, Meia?
5-female_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=laughing,Come on, ~player~.  I expect a <i>man</i> to get all distracted by my breasts, but a woman should have better presence of mind!
5-female_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=seductive,You seem a little distracted, ~player~.  <i>Has something caught your eye</i>?
5-female_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=vain,Shall I move my hair aside for a better view, ~player~?  You know, since you're staring at them instead of your cards anyway.
5-female_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=teasing,I hope you're distracted by my breasts out of lust rather than jealousy.  Envy makes your body ugly to match your heart.
5-female_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=teasing,It's OK to stare, ~player~--I'm very beautiful.  Sure you don't want to pay more attention to the cards, though?
5-female_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=laughing,Good work, not getting all distracted by my beauty.  Bit of a blow to the ego, though.
5-female_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=teasing,You had a streak going.  You're one step closer to streaking yourself, though.
5-female_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=seductive,Nice little lucky run.  Luck's a good trait in a pilot...and in a lover.
5-female_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=interested,If Meia were here, she'd be going on and on about your impressive strategical skill.  You'd have to get her naked enough to loosen up, though.
5-female_must_strip=teasing,Hey hey, ~name~.  Your turn, and make it count while you're at it.
5-female_must_strip=seductive,Don't be jealous, ~name~.  You're beautiful, too!
5-female_must_strip=vain,Now, now, ~name~.  Don't get yourself down by comparing your body to mine.  I'm a once-in-a-generation woman.
5-female_must_strip=stretching,Meia would be a lot more comfortable in that suit of hers if she ditched the underwear...or at least tried mine instead.
5-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0=interested,Looks like this place attracts more spacefarers than I gave it credit for.  Fine by me--at least someone knows where I'm coming from.
5-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0=seductive,What planet are you from, Miss Starshine?  Your fabulous blonde hair is winning me over as we speak.
5-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0=vain,Guess I can't learn about Earth girls from <i>you</i>--but hey, it's nice to know there's other gorgeous spacefarers out there.  Who like stripping.
5-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0=vain,Ooh, you cut your hair short like Meia does.  But it's wonderful blonde like mine--<i>space is so vast in its variety</i>!
5-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=laughing,Well, aren't <i>you</i> a tight little ball of sexual energy!  I guess it's got nowhere to go in that tiny frame of yours.
5-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=vain,You've got a lot of libido packed into a little body.  Must be the effects of Earth men...we Mejarians are <i>tasteful</i> in our sexuality.
5-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=laughing,<i>Why, I never</i>!  You're so dreadfully lewd, Miss Tan...do men just like women on the shorter side?
5-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=vain,You must get a lot of attention from men to be all amped-up like this.  <i>Tell me a tall woman still has a chance</i>!
5-female_must_strip,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0=teasing,Totally devoted to scarlet, eh?  It certainly gets the heart racing...<i>and my appetite stirred</i>.
5-female_must_strip,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0=vain,Maybe <i>I</i> should get a fanciful nickname like Scarlet Witch...but not if it means restricting myself to one measly color.
5-female_must_strip,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0=seductive,What do you think would be a good nickname for me, dear?  <i>The Black Pirate</i>?  I can't pull off all-red like you do.
5-female_must_strip,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0=stretching,I wonder if all-red would look good on me.  I'm a pirate--I don't exactly have my pick of the litter with clothes!
5-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0=excited,Ooh, Sei, you're such a cutie!  You look <i>just like</i> my squadron leader, Meia--that short blue hair is to <i>die</i> for!
5-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0=teasing,Short blue hair and shoulder armor?  You're the spitting image of my boss, Sei--too bad she's at another table!
5-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0=seductive,Short blue hair?  Omigosh, Sei, my boss Meia looks <i>just like</i> you!  And she could really use a girlfriend.
5-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0=seductive,Sei!  That's your name, right?  You look like my boss Meia with that short-cut blue hair.  Your eyes are a lot softer, though.
5-female_must_strip,target:seven,targetStage:0=teasing,Seems bodysuits are more popular among spacegoers than even <i>I</i> figured.  Works for me--I like your figure.
5-female_must_strip,target:seven,targetStage:0=seductive,<i>My, my, honey</i>!  You've got some interesting decorations, but that suit is making me fall in love already.
5-female_must_strip,target:seven,targetStage:0=vain,I really ought to try out one of those bodysuits myself...or maybe stuff Barnette in one.  They're just so <i>revealing</i>!
5-female_must_strip,target:seven,targetStage:0=vain,Those jumpsuits really are the best, especially when you're in low gravity.  The enemy should know how beautiful you are!
5-female_must_strip,target:orendi,targetStage:0=confused,...You OK there, Fireball?  You on the same planet as the rest of us?
5-female_must_strip,target:orendi,targetStage:0=confused,I may <i>be</i> an alien...but you're certainly acting like one.
5-female_must_strip,target:orendi,targetStage:0=annoyed,Four arms looks useful, but I really can't get over the constant shouting.  Can't you pipe down?
5-female_must_strip,target:orendi,targetStage:0=frustrated,Hey, Earth-girl.  Or wherever you're from.  There's this thing called an <i>indoor</i> voice.
5-female_must_strip,target:zoey,targetStage:0=smug,These "zombies" of yours don't sound so bad...but then, I guess you don't have a fabulous fighter spaceship, do you?
5-female_must_strip,target:zoey,targetStage:0=stretching,See, my Vandread can shield a whole planet.  So I think we could quarantine your little zombie virus.
5-female_must_strip,target:zoey,targetStage:0=vain,A zombie virus, eh?  Not to brag, but my Vandread helped avoid the spread of disease on a planet once...<i>I'm so talented</i>.
5-female_must_strip,target:zoey,targetStage:0=laughing,The more you describe these "zombies," the more they just sound like men.  You sure that's not what you mean?
5-female_must_strip,target:paya,targetStage:0=smug,My sympathies about the premature white hair, honey.  You look a lot older than you should.
5-female_must_strip,target:paya,targetStage:0=confused,You might want to rethink those facial markings, dear.  With that white hair, they look an awful lot like wrinkles.
5-female_must_strip,target:paya,targetStage:0=laughing,Couples can choose their babies' hair color on Mejare thanks to genetic engineering...there's a reason white isn't very popular.
5-female_must_strip,target:paya,targetStage:0=stretching,You poor thing.  Our captain's ancient, but even <i>she</i> still has color in her hair.
5-female_must_strip,target:shantae,targetStage:0=teasing,Ooh, I think that dark complexion is <i>exotic</i>--so do most Mejarians.  You got a thing for women, Miss Genie?
5-female_must_strip,target:shantae,targetStage:0=seductive,So what's a "genie," anyway?  Does that mean "cute chocolate-flavored girl"?  Because I think I like genies, then.
5-female_must_strip,target:shantae,targetStage:0=seductive,I like your style, Miss Genie!  You're as revealing as my girlfriend Barnette--a little tanner, though.
5-female_must_strip,target:shantae,targetStage:0=teasing,Ooh, the way you move your hips is <i>exquisite</i>, Miss Genie!  I want to learn how to add a little vanilla flavoring to that, if you follow.
5-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey there, Miss Gunslinger!  You're not gonna <i>fire</i> those things, are you?  My girlfriend collects those sorts of guns.
5-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=seductive,Omigosh, are those antique men's kinetic weapons?  My girlfriend collects them!  You should meet her.
5-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=seductive,Always good to see an armed woman!  My girlfriend, Barnette, is totally obsessed with men's mechanical guns like yours.
5-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=vain,Hey, Miss Gunslinger!  You should lighten up a little and show those men's kinetic guns to my girlfriend.  She's a total connoisseur.
5-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=teasing,I like the grace of Mejarian laser rings myself, but you want some serious interest on those men's guns of yours?  Talk to my girlfriend.
5-female_must_strip,target:sharla,targetStage:0=teasing,Good thing you're a medic, because that mysterious dark complexion is making my heart beat ever faster.
5-female_must_strip,target:sharla,targetStage:0=seductive,Do you know how many women on Mejare are dark-skinned, Miss Medic?  Not enough, I say...even my Barnette is just a little tan.
5-female_must_strip,target:sharla,targetStage:0=vain,Oh, Miss Medic?  I think I'm coming down with something--<i>love for your chocolate flavoring</i>!
5-female_must_strip,target:sharla,targetStage:0=teasing,You dress pretty casually for a medic, but that exotic dark skin is helping me overlook your shoddy sense of professionalism.
5-female_must_strip,target:shazza,targetStage:0=smug,Quite the interesting accent you've got there.  I can't quite call it refined, but then again, I <i>am</i> a filthy pirate.
5-female_must_strip,target:shazza,targetStage:0=stretching,I guess when I lead a life of crime, I can't get away with calling you uncivilized-sounding.  Actions mean so much more!
5-female_must_strip,target:shazza,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=laughing,Interesting dialect you have on Planet Australia.  Don't you ever get tired of misunderstanding each other?
5-female_must_strip,target:shazza,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=laughing,This <i>Australia</i> planet certainly has a way with words...mostly for making them incomprehensible.
5-female_must_strip,target:zizou_valentine,targetStage:0=interested,Don't you have a magic spell to give yourself some clothes, little Miss Magician?
5-female_must_strip,target:zizou_valentine,targetStage:0=interested,I must say, Zizou, I like your standard outfit better.  This is just trying too hard to make men like you.
5-female_must_strip,target:zizou_valentine,targetStage:0=laughing,Ohh, Barnette wears just as little when she cooks for me!  It's so cute...but then, <i>she</i> has breasts.
5-female_must_strip,target:zizou_valentine,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, Miss Magician...<i>don't wear clothes you can't fill</i>.  But definitely wear clothes in general.
5-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:0=teasing,Ooh, an <i>assassin</i>.  I hope there's no bounty on my head!
5-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:0=stretching,Forgive this pirate for being a little on edge around an <i>assassin</i>.  There's a reward for my head, no doubt!
5-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:0=vain,You assassins always act so tough on the ground.  Let's see you take me in a dogfight!
5-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:0=teasing,You're a cute little thing, Miss Assassin.  I guess that helps in your line of work--people lower their guards.
5-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=seductive,Blonde, scantily-clad, loves attention?  Honey, you're a woman after my own heart.
5-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=teasing,I like the energy you're bringing, Miss Wrestler!  The scant layering doesn't hurt, either.
5-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=vain,See, <i>you're</i> my kind of woman!  These other Earth girls are so dreadfully boring, always covering up the good stuff.
5-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=teasing,Barely wearing anything? You should know my girlfriend is the same way, cutie...only <i>she's</i> not blonde.
5-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0=interested,Talk about a big ball of misery.  Even your <i>skin</i> has turned all blue in despair.
5-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0=teasing,Show your face, honey!  Or are you trying to hide that weird blue skin?  Don't worry, it suits your miserable demeanor.
5-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0=laughing,I guess I'd be miserable, too, if I had the complexion of a grapefruit.
5-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0=stretching,I should bring Meia over here for some counseling.  Even <i>she's</i> not as miserable as Miss Blueberry here.
5-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0=smug,Well, look at what we have here!  A blonde spacefarer in a jumpsuit.  Well, I guess we <i>almost</i> match...
5-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0=seductive,I'm a big fan of the bodysuit look, cutie.  So's a certain crewmate of mine I wish was here...space just makes it so much easier.
5-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, a <i>blonde</i>!  And she travels around in space, too.  If only you had the sense to wear my dress instead of that suit, we'd be twins.
5-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0=vain,A shapely little specimen, zipping around space in that provocative bodysuit?  You're a model Mejarian--if only Meia were here!
5-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=seductive-2,Way to let your crewmate embarrass herself.  Where was all the camaraderie we brag about?
5-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=interested,Couldn't you lose a little before this?  You know, just to make me feel better?
5-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=interested,You never <i>were</i> one to take pity on those who can't keep up with you, Meia.
5-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=laughing,Want to take something good off?  You know, a little tit-for-tits?
5-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=seductive-2,I think I deserve a fair trade from you, Meia.  <i>Look how embarrassed I am</i>!
5-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, a dark-skinned woman!  We only have a few of those on Mejare--you'd turn heads, Miss Exotic.  And your outfit would fit right in.
5-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=teasing,Talk about a fierce look in your eye--and even skimpier clothing than me!  But you make it work, Miss Chocolate.
5-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=seductive,Hey there, cutie!  Between that exotic dark skin and light dress, you'd be a real steal where <i>I'm</i> from!
5-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=teasing,You're already a model Mejarian with that much skin showing, Miss Warrior.  <i>I'd like to see some sweat roll off those chocolate-flavored muscles</i>.
5-female_must_strip,target:riva,targetStage:0=smug,You should know I'm not a fan of princesses, Miss Magician.  But <i>blonde</i> ones?  ...I might yield a little.
5-female_must_strip,target:riva,targetStage:0=stretching,Maybe all it takes is some blonde hair to warm me up to the idea of royalty...or magic.
5-female_must_strip,target:riva,targetStage:0=vain,Don't feel bad about your unearned title, Miss Princess.  I hear you can perform magic--and alongside blonde hair, I'd say you're alright in my book.
5-female_must_strip,target:riva,targetStage:0=vain,Little Miss Magician is a <i>princess</i>, as well?  Well, against my pirate nature, I think I'll let a fellow blonde be on her way.
5-female_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=interested,It's sweet of you to be saving me from my awful high-card hands, ~name~, but it's too little, too late.
5-female_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=seductive,Good to know someone on this table is still looking out for me, as I stand here in just my tiny thong.
5-female_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=vain,I'd call you stupid for losing to my <i>high card</i>, but you <i>did</i> get me out of my dress...so it was probably a fluke.

5-female_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=seductive,Winning with a high card is certainly more reassuring than this tiny bit of fabric I've got around my hips.
5-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=vain,Way to come in a full outfit, Miss Maid.  And you're still speaking just as politely as when you're on the job!
5-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=smug,Whoever is your house's owner must really crack the whip, Miss Maid.  Even <i>now</i> you're using those silly honorifics.
5-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=vain,"Jura-chan" sounds like the most <i>adorable</i> nickname!  I've got to get Barnette to start calling me that...Barnette-<i>chan</i>.
5-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=teasing,You don't have to keep speaking all polite, Miss Maid.  You're in the company of a brutal pirate now--feel free to join the crew.
5-female_must_strip,target:rosalina,targetStage:0=teasing,And what do we have here--a fellow spacefarer, and a tall blonde one at that?  <i>People are going to get us confused</i>.
5-female_must_strip,target:rosalina,targetStage:0=vain,Flying around on an <i>observatory</i>, you said?  That sounds heavenly--space is such a beautiful place!
5-female_must_strip,target:rosalina,targetStage:0=teasing,Space can actually be rather beautiful when you're not busy robbing people.  Surely you agree, Miss Princess?
5-female_must_strip,target:rosalina,targetStage:0=vain,You <i>say</i> you're a princess, but space belongs to everyone--surely a traveler like yourself knows that better than most.
5-female_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=laughing,Good work, not getting all distracted by my beauty.  Bit of a blow to the ego, though.
5-female_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=teasing,You had a streak going.  You're one step closer to streaking yourself, though.
5-female_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=seductive,Nice little lucky run.  Luck's a good trait in a pilot...and in a lover.
5-female_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=interested,If Meia were here, she'd be going on and on about your impressive strategical skill.  You'd have to get her naked enough to loosen up, though.
5-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, cutie!  You look a little wide-eyed and naive to be here...but those bullets suggest otherwise.
5-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0=stretching,I've got my eye on you, Miss Ruby-Red.  I know better than to trust a cute girl with ammo clips on her belt.
5-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0=vain,You know who else is a cute girl with a little ammo on the side?  My girlfriend, Barnette.  And if you're anything like her, I better not get you angry.
5-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0=seductive,The black-and-red outfit is a winner, honey--very intimidating!  So's that ammo.  Guess you need to balance out your cute face.
5-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:0=laughing,<i>Boo</i>!  <i>The nasty pirate woman's going to kill you</i>!
5-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:0=laughing,You're a cute little thing, Saki!  So plain and innocent...perfect for a pirate like me to <i>kidnap</i>!
5-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:0=laughing,Seeing a cute little Earth girl all clammed up like this really makes me want to comfort her...<i>with my rapier</i>!
5-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:0=laughing,Hey, Miss Schoolgirl.  Ever met an <i>alien</i> before?  You should know...<i>we eat Earthlings' brains</i>!
5-female_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=laughing,Come on, ~name~.  I expect a <i>man</i> to get all distracted by my breasts, but a woman should have better presence of mind!
5-female_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=seductive,You seem a little distracted, ~name~.  <i>Has something caught your eye</i>?
5-female_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=vain,Shall I move my hair aside for a better view, ~name~?  You know, since you're staring at them instead of your cards anyway.
5-female_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=teasing,I hope you're distracted by my breasts out of lust rather than jealousy.  Envy makes your body ugly to match your heart.
5-female_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=teasing,It's OK to stare, ~name~--I'm very beautiful.  Sure you don't want to pay more attention to the cards, though?
5-female_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,Good work, not getting all distracted by my beauty.  Bit of a blow to the ego, though.
5-female_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,You had a streak going.  You're one step closer to streaking yourself, though.
5-female_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99,alsoPlaying:meia=seductive,Nice little lucky run.  Luck's a good trait in a pilot...and in a lover.
5-female_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,This Earth girl's got some skill, lasting so long.  Do we have any piloting spots open, Meia?
5-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:4=laughing,Is it just me, or is the exciting thought of public nudity making you choke a little?  The Meia I know keeps her cool.
5-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:4=teasing,That's the spirit, boss!  Give these poor Earth ladies a view of Mejare's full moon, just like you secretly want to.
5-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:4=laughing,Now you're getting into it!  Way to bare it all before me.  You <i>like</i> being naked, don't you?
5-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:4=teasing,Getting jealous of how this thong leaves my butt visible?  I know deep down you like people looking at you, too.
5-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:4=vain,Couldn't stand how dopey your underwear looks next to mine, huh?  I know--it's the Mejarian way to love being ogled.
5-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:3=interested,Shame that bra's next.  Looks awfully supportive...and you could use support right now.
5-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:3=teasing,Well, Meia, you've caught up to your favorite second-in-command pilot.  Your reward is some public nudity.
5-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:3=interested,You're not the type to hide anything small, or wear it in the first place.  Off comes the bra.
5-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:3=laughing,Ooh, we get to have our breasts out together!  Isn't this just an <i>adorable</i> girls' night out?
5-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:2=laughing,Hey, Meia, I'm not naked yet.  Don't go getting any ideas about overtaking me.
5-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:2=interested,Never undressed you myself, but I know you can't be <i>too</i> far behind me.
5-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:2=smug,Time to show some skin, just like me.  The suit already provided your figure, but you never give me a good look in the showers.
5-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:2=interested,Don't go trying to strip nude and steal my spotlight.
5-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:1=awkward,Jeez.  I've got my breasts out in public, and <i>you're</i> blushing.
5-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:1=awkward,If it's a lot for you to see me like this in public, well...the feeling's mutual.
5-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:1=bored,Can't believe I'm seeing you like this, Meia...you <i>never</i> crack, even with me like this.
5-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:1=sad,I know it's not my breasts that are making you blush...it was your eyepiece.
5-female_must_strip,target:shego,targetStage:0=laughing,You OK there, Miss Jumpsuit?  You're looking a little green-around-the-frills.
5-female_must_strip,target:shego,targetStage:0=interested,Is all the stripping and teasing making you nauseous, dearie?  Just trying to grin and bear it?
5-female_must_strip,target:shego,targetStage:0=teasing,I'm liking the style on the bodysuit, honey--it helps obscure your sickly green hue.
5-female_must_strip,target:shego,targetStage:0=smug,Mejarians have some say in their skin tone from genetic engineering...I don't think we can do green, but then I doubt it'd be too popular.
5-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=smug,Dull that edge, honey.  We're all just trying to have a good time here, stripping naked for complete strangers.
5-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=vain,You're a fiery one, Miss Edge.  A lot like my <i>darling</i> Barnette!  So I don't mind.
5-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=laughing,That red streak in your hair should've tipped us off that you'd be all angry.  Maybe feeling the breeze on your breasts will cheer you up.
5-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=vain,You know what warms me up to others, Miss Edge?  Shaking my breasts around for them--<i>they always appreciate that</i>!
5-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, an armed woman--and one with chocolate flavoring!  You're like an extreme version of my tan little gun-nut girlfriend.
5-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0=vain,I'm not sure what's most intimidating--that height, that imposing dark complexion, or that huge mechanical firearm!
5-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0=stretching,If only I brought my cute little Barnette here.  She'd be head-over-heels for a woman with a man's gun!
5-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0=teasing,You might be even taller than me, Miss Nighttime.  That might turn even more heads on Mejare than your rather large firearm!
5-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0=smug,Come now, honey.  You can't waltz in waving that huge kinetic weapon around and expect to make any friends.
5-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:0=seductive,Hi there, dearie!  That's an absolutely <i>adorable</i> hat you have on--do you have any others that match that uniform?
5-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:0=seductive,Ohh, tiny little things like you always make my heart melt!  Is the schoolgirl look a style where you live?
5-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:0=stretching,A student's uniform is always the most adorable thing.  As you might imagine from my piracy, I wasn't the best student.
5-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:0=vain,School was always so dreadfully boring, the way they prattled on about men.  But you make the outfit look pretty cute, Miss Magician!
5-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0=smug,And here I thought I was on Earth.  Turns out we've got a woman from a frozen tundra planet, evolved for camouflage.
5-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0=teasing,You look like you're in pretty good shape, honey.  And even better, I bet sweat blends right in to your marble complexion!
5-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0=vain,I'll be frank--you wouldn't catch me dead exercising.  It's so much work, and look at what it's done to this poor woman's skin!
5-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0=stretching,<i>Fitness this</i>, <i>exercise that</i>.  Why should I take advice from a woman who's apparently never seen sunlight?
5-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:0=laughing,Nice look you've got going there, Miss Bodypaint.  The orange really contrasts nicely with the blue...skin.
5-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:0=laughing,Nice fruity complexion, honey.  Really matches your horns...and your one crazy eye.
5-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:0=smug,You seem surprised to have lost, dear...but you can complain about fate until you're blue in the face.
5-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:0=interested,What are you rolling that thing for?  Trying to pick a new color of body paint?
5-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:1=excited,Omigosh!  <i>Vriska</i>!  Do that thing again!  There's so much you could teach me about Earth fashion!
5-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:1=excited,<i>Vriiiska</i>!  I love fashion!  Show me more of your Earth outfits!
5-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:1=excited,Your wardrobe's so cool!  I only really have this dress!  You've got to show me what Earth girls wear!
5-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:1=excited,Yes!  Vriska's turn!  Show me what else Earth women wear!  I want it all!
5-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:2=teasing,I'm <i>waiting</i>, Vriska!  Don't disappoint me and pick some boring outfit!
5-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:2=teasing,I'm expecting some good fashion from you, you know!  Don't leave it up to chance!
5-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:2=smug,Don't you have some way to control that?  I'd rather you showed off something specific.
5-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:2=teasing,Lay the fashion on me, Vriska!  Fashion from...wherever it is that you live.
5-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0=seductive,You know what I love more than anything in this vast universe?  A fellow blonde...especially a cute one!  And you fit the bill, fireball.
5-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, I like your energy--and your blondeness!  My girlfriend Barnette's a real spark plug herself.
5-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0=interested,You're a cutie, Miss Midriff--that messy blonde hair is only making me fall further in love.  Where do you get all your energy?
5-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0=teasing,Slow down there, firecracker--you're like a burning torch with all that blonde hair flying about.  But it's definitely cute!
5-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:3=excited,Here we go again.  This is so <i>exciting</i>!  Every outfit is an adventure!
5-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:3=excited,This is making me feel so alive!  I love checking out women's fashion!  Show some more!
5-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:3=seductive,You're so cool, Vriska!  And maybe even a little cute!  What else have you got for me?
5-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:3=teasing,Don't stop now, cutie!  Any more adorable outfits you've got in store for me?
5-female_must_strip,target:peach,targetStage:0=vain,I've never been a fan of royalty, but a <i>blonde</i> woman in charge?  Suddenly it doesn't seem so bad.
5-female_must_strip,target:peach,targetStage:0=smug,At least you've got the hair color to match your presumptuous title, Miss Princess.  This pirate still might rob you later.
5-female_must_strip,target:peach,targetStage:0=vain,You damn princesses and your unearned jewelry and dresses.  I stole everything I have, you know!  But at least you're blonde.
5-female_must_strip,target:peach,targetStage:0=teasing,So from one blonde to another, Miss Princess, how much is that crown worth?  ...<i>Just a pirate's curiosity</i>.
5-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:0=stretching,Shame you're not an <i>actual</i> pearl.  I could go for one of those...Mejare hardly has any.
5-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:0=smug,No animals on Mejare means no pearls.  If only you <i>were</i> one of those beauties...
5-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:0=bored,All stretched-out like that...you're not shaped like a pearl at all!  Shame, because I love those things.
5-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:0=vain,<i>Oh, to hold a real pearl in my hands</i>!  I've only seen pictures in Earth history books.
5-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:4=teasing,Hey, honey...take <i>my</i> dress, and I'll love you forever.
5-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:4=smug,Feel free to flatter me and steal my dress, dear!  It's...over there somewhere.
5-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:4=seductive,Say, Vriska...can that die steal <i>my</i> dress?  <i>Please</i> say yes.
5-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:4=vain,I'd <i>love</i> to see how my dress looks on someone else.  But I can't just let you try it on...so use the die.
5-female_must_strip,target:willow,targetStage:0=seductive,Tell me about these "vampires," sweetie.  Sucking blood actually sounds a little romantic!
5-female_must_strip,target:willow,targetStage:0=interested,A computer nerd, eh?  So's Parfet--but I wouldn't trust her to handle supernatural blood-suckers.
5-female_must_strip,target:willow,targetStage:0=vain,I know a computer nerd--Parfet's her name.  Cute little thing...and she's with a man, who we <i>used</i> to think sucked blood.
5-female_must_strip,target:willow,targetStage:0=teasing,I think I drew blood on Barnette once--it was a steamy night.  But I never sucked it, so maybe I'm not one of these "vampires."
5-female_must_strip,target:pauling,targetStage:0=teasing,Nice sensible little outfit you've got there.  The glasses sell the sexy-and-smart look!
5-female_must_strip,target:pauling,targetStage:0=teasing,Working for an old woman, eh?  I know the feeling.  Those glasses must have convinced her you knew what you were doing.
5-female_must_strip,target:pauling,targetStage:0=stretching,A woman with glasses, eh?  <i>I</i> certainly couldn't pull off the look...I guess I don't look very smart.
5-female_must_strip,target:pauling,targetStage:0=smug,I know an engineering egghead with glasses--Parfet's her name.  And she seems to attract what few smart men I know.
5-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:6=interested,I appreciated the fashion show, Vriska, but really, I doubt you've got fuel left in the tank.
5-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:6=stretching,Just going to keep on trying, huh?  Give it up already.
5-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:6=stretching,Poor girl just can't control her gambling problem.  Now she'll be nude for it.
5-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:6=interested,And is this magically going to restock your wardrobe?  I doubt it.
5-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:7=smug,...Yeah, we all know how <i>this</i> is ending, don't we?
5-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:7=smug,Some women just refuse to see what's right in front of them.  It's sad, really.
5-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:7=laughing,Well, get ready for full-blown blue nudity, everyone.
5-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:7=smug,All the magic in the universe, and not one ounce of sense.  You poor thing.
5-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale_swimsuit,targetStage:0=laughing,How can a woman dress for a sun she's apparently never seen?  The mysteries just keep piling up.
5-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale_swimsuit,targetStage:0=interested,Cute swimsuit, honey, but I've always preferred the shade.  So do you, clearly.
5-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale_swimsuit,targetStage:0=vain,Yeah, I'm more the type to lounge under an umbrella than do any swimming.  But more power to you, if you ever choose to go outside.
5-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale_swimsuit,targetStage:0=interested,Look, dear.  You can wear that swimsuit all day, but that complexion's not fooling anybody.
5-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, Miss Moneybags, you'd better watch out.  This pirate's got half a mind to loot you with extreme prejudice!
5-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0=teasing,Sure you're not worried to be playing in a seedy place like this, Miss Heiress?  You might get mugged by, say, an ornery pirate.
5-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0=interested,Nice premature white hair, Miss Heirlooms.  I guess having all that inherited money must be <i>oh-so-stressful</i> for you.
5-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0=laughing,Looking quite adorable there, Coinstacks.  Maybe I'll help myself to the jewelry you'll undoubtedly remove first.
5-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:5=smug,Call it woman's intuition, but I think our little fashion show is about to come to an end soon...
5-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:5=interested,This has been fun, Vriska, but I don't think you can keep this up forever.  That die's got a sick sense of humor.
5-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:5=interested,Can't you see the writing on the wall, sweetheart?  I like these outfits, but they keep getting skimpier and skimpier.
5-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:5=laughing,Roll all you want...I think the die's in control here.  And it wants to see some blue skin.
5-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:0=excited,Ohhh, you're so <i>cute</i>!  Draped in a loose-fitting shirt...and those <i>pigtails</i>!  I just wanna squeeze you!
5-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:0=excited,There's something about pigtails on a girl that just make me want to squeeze her even more...you're so <i>adorable</i>!
5-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:0=teasing,So, honey...<i>do men like to yank on those pigtails</i>?  It's OK, you can tell me--I'm not from around here.
5-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:0=seductive,You look like you've taken your first step into womanhood...and no more than that, with too-big clothes and adorable little pigtails!
5-female_must_strip,target:velma,targetStage:0=teasing,It's a rare woman who can pull off the glasses look, you know.  Parfet landed herself a man...how about <i>you</i>, Miss Mystery?
5-female_must_strip,target:velma,targetStage:0=stretching,I know a glasses-wearing egghead myself...Parfet's her name, and what she looks like with them off is the <i>real</i> mystery.
5-female_must_strip,target:velma,targetStage:0=laughing,Hey, Miss Mystery...can you solve how to make glasses look good on a woman?  Here's the answer: <i>give them to me</i>.
5-female_must_strip,target:velma,targetStage:0=vain,So, you solve mysteries, is that right?  I guess the glasses would help there...think you could solve the mystery of this <i>alien woman</i>?
5-female_must_strip,target:velma,targetStage:0=interested,Hey, Miss Mystery.  Push those frames up and answer a few questions...because <i>men</i> are a mystery to me.
5-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0=interested,What's up, cutie?  You look a little embarrassed to be here...which is funny, considering your choice of outfit.
5-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0=teasing,Yeah, not sure I'm buying this whole "I was tricked" act, dearie.  I mean, you <i>are</i> displaying your butt 24/7.
5-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0=teasing,Oh, don't act all embarrassed.  You've got hips to <i>die</i> for, cutie...and they're fully on display, even now.
5-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0=laughing,Ooh, you are just <i>adorable</i>!  Especially the way your figure is just <i>straining</i> against the bounds of that suit, <i>begging</i> to be free.
5-female_must_strip,target:sonya,targetStage:0=teasing,I can appreciate military women--they're always so very <i>fit</i>.  Try not to wring my neck for my horrible pirate crimes.
5-female_must_strip,target:sonya,targetStage:0=vain,<i>Please don't hurt me, O fearsome woman soldier.  I have a girlfriend waiting for me back home</i>!
5-female_must_strip,target:sonya,targetStage:0=vain,Looking pretty muscular, Miss Militia.  Please try to see this beautiful pirate's point of view before sticking your knee in her back.
5-female_must_strip,target:sonya,targetStage:0=teasing,I imagine you're not too fond of my line of work, Miss Militia.  It's OK--<i>I'm pretty fond of that short blonde hair</i>.
5-female_must_strip,target:pyrrha,targetStage:0=laughing,Hey there, Miss Mind-Your-Manners.  You talk the talk, but that cleavage tells me you've got a wild side.
5-female_must_strip,target:pyrrha,targetStage:0=teasing,You're awfully polite for a woman perverted enough to come here in the first place.  Just trying to throw us off, cutie?
5-female_must_strip,target:pyrrha,targetStage:0=stretching,Yeah, yeah, I don't buy the whole polite-and-formal act from a girl willing to strip nude in public.  Just waiting for the good stuff?
5-female_must_strip,target:pyrrha,targetStage:0=interested,You talk pretty prim-and-proper, dear...and yet here you are, stripping nude for us.  Do you have a dirty side, or did you lose a bet?
5-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=smug,<i>Well, well, well</i>.  We've got a <i>goddess</i> here, ladies...besides me, of course.
5-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=vain,A <i>goddess</i>, eh?  I guess that makes <i>two</i> at this table, then.
5-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=teasing,Just look at that shimmering green hair--and that ornamentation!  But I think I'm every bit the goddess you are, hot stuff.
5-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=laughing,Just look at that--two goddesses, near-opposite color schemes.  I guess I'm the <i>evil, nasty</i> one.
5-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:0=confused,...You OK, honey?  You look a little...<i>dead</i>.
5-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:0=shocked,...OK.  So.  You're a ghost.  I can work with this...<i>but please put down the knife</i>.
5-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:0=bored,Guess there's no stabbing <i>you</i> if things get hairy, is there?  ...Not that I was planning on doing that to anyone else.
5-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:0=laughing,A...ghost.  OK.  Well, at least this means I can still annoy Meia if I get shot down and killed.
5-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:0=awkward,...Well, I <i>do</i> appreciate learning that there's an afterlife, but it's not why I came to Earth.
5-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=vain,Omigosh, are you <i>filming</i> this?  Look this way--over here!  Get every angle you can!
5-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=vain,You're <i>broadcasting</i> this?  To a <i>live audience</i>?  This is a dream come true--now <i>all of Earth</i> will witness my beauty!
5-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=vain,Omigosh!  <i>Omigosh</i>!  You're <i>broadcasting</i> this to people all around Earth?  Maybe I'll finally become a model!
5-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=seductive,You're <i>filming</i> this?  Omigosh--normally I have to get Barnette to capture my beauty on camera!  You're so sweet!
5-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=vain,I hope you don't think that camera is going to scare me away.  I may be a wanted criminal, but I'm also <i>beautiful</i>!
5-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=vain,You picked a good table to film, honey.  The only thing that loves me more than Barnette is a camera!
5-female_must_strip,target:piper,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey there, Miss Meterstick.  Thanks for not letting my ego get too big when it came to height.
5-female_must_strip,target:piper,targetStage:0=stretching,Every woman I know says I'm tall.  Do you turn heads when you enter a room, too?
5-female_must_strip,target:piper,targetStage:0=vain,Oh, good, a woman who understands what it's like towering over people.  The intimidation can be kind of fun, no?
5-female_must_strip,target:piper,targetStage:0=stretching,Men seem to be taller than women.  I guess I wouldn't turn as many heads on Earth, then...but you'd do it no matter what.
5-female_must_strip,target:tifa,targetStage:0=interested,Ohoho.  A <i>martial artist</i>, honey?  Well, I can certainly see where all your momentum comes from.
5-female_must_strip,target:tifa,targetStage:0=laughing,With a figure like that, I imagine you've developed your <i>own</i> style of martial arts...centered around counterweights.
5-female_must_strip,target:tifa,targetStage:0=teasing,<i>My, my</i>!  Those things outdo even mine, sweetie...but I don't pretend I'm some sort of athlete.
5-female_must_strip,target:tifa,targetStage:0=seductive,Bigger breasts <i>and</i> martial arts skill?  Jeez, you're outmaneuvering me left and right.  Good thing you're such a cutie!
5-female_must_strip,target:zelda,targetStage:0=interested,You know what I see when a woman calls herself "royalty"?  <i>An inferiority complex</i>, Miss Boring-Brunette.
5-female_must_strip,target:zelda,targetStage:0=laughing,You're cute, especially as far as overhyped princesses go.  Let's see how cute you are <i>without</i> all your jewelry.
5-female_must_strip,target:zelda,targetStage:0=laughing,You know what I think of miserable jealous girls who dress themselves up and pretend they're better than the rest of us?  ...I like stripping them.
5-female_must_strip,target:zelda,targetStage:0=vain,Take away a princess's fancy dress and what does she have?  Hopefully a cute butt, and a pirate nearby who's earned her clothes.
5-female_must_strip,target:tina,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=teasing,Planet <i>America</i>, hm?  Never heard of it--but it seems to have produced as least one knockout!
5-female_must_strip,target:tina,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=thinking,<i>Britain</i>, <i>Japan</i>, and now your <i>America</i>.  I'm starting to think these aren't actually planets...and Earth people are just very splintered.
5-female_must_strip,target:tina,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=teasing,Hey, now, Miss Wrestler...this place has a <i>no-touching</i> rule, even if Planet <i>America</i> doesn't.
5-female_must_strip,target:tina,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=vain,I don't know how they do things on Planet America, honey, but you keep your wrestling hands to yourself--I'm taken!
5-female_must_strip,target:tracer,targetStage:0=teasing,All about speed, eh, girlie?  Try not to blink right out of your costume...or back to before I won, you little cheat.
5-female_must_strip,target:tracer,targetStage:0=vain,Hey, where's <i>my</i> time travel?  Actually, there's nothing about my life I regret, so no issue.
5-female_must_strip,target:tracer,targetStage:0=seductive,Mind if I borrow that time device, sweetie?  I want to fall in love with my Barnette <i>all over again</i>.
5-female_must_strip,target:tracer,targetStage:0=teasing,If that thing can really travel you back in time, that's pretty fantastic.  How many times have we done this match over again, <i>loser</i>?
5-female_must_strip,target:tracer,targetStage:0=smug,You know what I've learned as a pirate?  You only get one chance to do things right.  This time-travel business sounds like a crutch.
5-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:0=confused,...I had no idea Earth girls came in so many...flavors.  How'd your parents pick <i>grape</i>?
5-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:0=confused,...So, uh, that skin color.  Am I missing something?  Is this a common look on Earth?
5-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:0=confused,Gotta be honest, girlie, I'm out of the loop on what Earth people look like.  Is that complexion of yours...<i>normal</i>?
5-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:0=confused,What's this about <i>ponies</i> that you keep going on about?  Is a "pony" a purple Earthling?  I'm totally lost here.
5-female_must_strip,target:penny,targetStage:0=smug,Looks like we've found an Earth girl who's just decided to embrace the whole "boring conservatism" stereotype.  At least your hair is a fiery red.
5-female_must_strip,target:penny,targetStage:0=teasing,That fiery red hair contrasts your rather plain outfit.  But it's not a bad look overall!
5-female_must_strip,target:penny,targetStage:0=vain,<i>Finally</i>, a normal-looking Earth girl.  I need a measuring stick to compare all these superpowered weirdos to...all you've got is that red hair.
5-female_must_strip,target:penny,targetStage:0=seductive,Good, a civilian girl.  So many people at this bar are such colorful characters--oh, but your hair is pretty vibrant, I guess.
5-female_must_strip,target:uhura,targetStage:0=smug,Oh, don't worry, dear.  We on Mejare are well aware of Earth's space program...you <i>have</i> tried to harvest us, after all.
5-female_must_strip,target:uhura,targetStage:0=teasing,You can call it "Star Fleet" if you want, dear, but it'll always be the Harvest to me.  <i>You nasty organ-stealers, you</i>.
5-female_must_strip,target:uhura,targetStage:0=vain,I don't buy this whole "peaceful space travel" angle, Miss Star Fleet.  I've spent far too much time fending off your little Harvest cubes!
5-female_must_strip,target:uhura,targetStage:0=smug,Yeah, yeah, I'm sure this "Star Fleet" is super peaceful.  Just remember I've got a Vandread...so I'm not afraid of you.
5-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:1=seductive,Omigosh, Palutena, that gorgeous green hair is even longer than mine!  My <i>girlfriend</i> has green hair, you know.
5-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:1=vain,How do you <i>maintain</i> all that hair?  I have the best time washing mine...and wrapping my green-haired girlfriend in it.
5-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:1=seductive,You know who else has beautiful green hair, Miss Goddess?  My girlfriend, Barnette.  That sweet little thing is back on the ship!
5-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:1=stretching,So is that lovely green hair just the goddess's right?  My girlfriend got hers from standard Mejarian genetic trickery.
5-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0=interested,I was about to comment on how I love blondes, but that mechanical arm really stands out.  How'd you get it?
5-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0=confused,It's hard to feel too awkward about you losing your arm when that thing looks like a pretty useful replacement.  Got a story to tell?
5-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0=laughing,Check out Miss Cyborg over here!  You wear that mechanical arm quite well--<i>do Earth men find you too much to handle</i>?
5-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0=seductive,I must say, that cold steel clashes with your fiery personality.  Talk about a two-tiered threat!
5-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:0=seductive,Hey there, Miss Two-Tone!  I like your sense of fashion--that exposed, that hat, and those cute little boots!
5-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, is that two-toned hair natural?  That's fancier than even <i>Mejarians</i> have come up with.
5-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:0=interested,You seem pretty smug, honey.  Do you have a sweeter half like your hair implies?
5-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:0=excited,Ooh, can I try on your hat when you lose it?  Or that amulet?  Can you two-tone my hair like yours?
5-female_must_strip,target:velma_classic,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, Earth to ~player~.  There's a Velma model out now that doesn't look like a goblin.
5-female_must_strip,target:velma_classic,targetStage:0=interested,What, you figured out the offline version but still chose <i>this</i> Velma?  How nostalgia-blinded can you get?
5-female_must_strip,target:velma_classic,targetStage:0=interested,Hey, ~player~, it's not 2016 anymore.  There's a Velma you can play with that's actually on-model.
5-female_must_strip,target:velma_classic,targetStage:0=laughing,Hey, ~player~, Velma Classic is just here to remember the past...not masturbate to it.
5-female_must_strip,target:velma_classic,targetStage:0=laughing,Don't do this to yourself, ~player~--there's a better Velma now.  I mean, <i>look</i> at this one.
5-female_must_strip,target:velma_classic,targetStage:0=vain,Hey, ~player~, Barnette might understand the appeal of antiques, but <i>I</i> say stick with the fresh and new.
5-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=interested,Hey, Eyebags, you gonna stay awake all game?  You look like you're drifting away already.
5-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=teasing,Talk about never leaving the house.  You look like you've never seen sunlight--and you're dozing off as we speak!
5-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=smug,Gotta be honest, sweetie--between the pale skin and the vacant look in your eyes, you're really reminding me of a zombie.
5-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=confused,So do you work super hard all day at your job?  Why do you look all gaunt and drowsy?  Get some beauty sleep, woman.
5-female_must_strip,target:arwen,targetStage:0=confused,Hey, what's all this about the <i>middle</i> of Earth?  Is there a spot underground that only you elf-people get to live in?
5-female_must_strip,target:arwen,targetStage:0=confused,And I call <i>Meia</i> pale.  You look almost ghostly...is that just the way you elves are?
5-female_must_strip,target:arwen,targetStage:0=confused,Hey, what's up with those pointy ears?  And the pale, Meia-like skin?  You're a strange one, "elf" girl.
5-female_must_strip,target:arwen,targetStage:0=confused,So you call yourself an elf, right?  Is that another word for "Earthling with crazy ears"?  Because you look human otherwise.
5-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0=seductive,Check out that messy hair...and adorable student outfit!  Did you say you're a <i>witch</i>?
5-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0=smug,Watch out, ladies, we've got a full-blown <i>magician</i> on our hands.  On Mejare you get called a witch for saying men aren't the worst thing ever.
5-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0=vain,A <i>witch</i>, eh?  Forgive my doubts...that jealous old hag of a judge called me a witch just for having that anatomy book!
5-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0=seductive,Awww!  She even brought a little magic wand to complete the costume!  <i>You're so cute, Miss Witch</i>.
5-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0=vain,Between you and that time I got called a witch for showing interest in men, witches are just <i>irresistible</i> these days.
5-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,You'll have to excuse Meia's hostility.  She's absorbed all of our collective pirate hatred of authority.
5-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,Oh, don't mind Meia.  She's taken the whole pirates-hating--soldiers thing a little too much to heart.
5-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,Just let Meia fume a little, Miss Military. We know you're not from <i>Mejare's</i> nasty old ranks.
5-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=stretching,Cute purple hair, Miss Military.  Oh, don't worry about Meia.  She's even touchier with soldier women than the rest of us.
5-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0=confused,...Look, honey.  Makeup is a girl's best friend, but...it's possible to get a little too close to your friends.
5-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0,marker:fama_and_oma=laughing,Dear god.  Did you break into your Fama's makeup closet and start applying whatever you could find?  Your friends are letting you down.
5-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0=smug,I guess I never appreciated how light with makeup I can be with my natural beauty.  Here we see the alternative...
5-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0=vain,Check out Miss Makeup over here.  Somehow she made it through childhood without hearing the expression "less is more."
5-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:0=seductive,I understand, dear.  You're so stunned by my beauty that you hid your own face in shame.  I'm sure you're still cute!
5-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:0=seductive,Don't hide that pretty little face on <i>my</i> account, honey.  You've certainly got a beautiful <i>figure</i>.
5-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:0=teasing,Nice little bodysuit you've got there, even if you plan on being the Masked Woman.  I know a sugar-and-ice girl with your fashion sense.
5-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:0=laughing,You've got a lot of sass for someone who won't show her face, Miss Masked.  Hiding some grisly injury, or just your own embarrassment?
5-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Ooh, look, Meia.  Another Misty.  <i>Don't go falling in love with her, now</i>!
5-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,OK, Meia.  I know this girl's called Misty, but don't start trying to be <i>her</i> Big Sister, too.
5-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Don't tell anyone, but...<i>Meia's got a bit of a crush on a girl named Misty</i>.  Fair warning!
5-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=stretching,Gonna win over Meia's heart here?  You wouldn't be the first <i>Misty</i> to do it.
5-female_must_strip,target:gogo,targetStage:0=teasing,What's your story, Miss Highlights?  Got any gum to share?
5-female_must_strip,target:gogo,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=teasing,Hey, toss me a piece of that gum, cutie.  I could use a snack while you tell me all about your "San Fransokyo" planet.
5-female_must_strip,target:gogo,targetStage:0=vain,Just gonna blow bubbles all day, or are you actually going to strip?  Either way, I wouldn't mind having some myself...
5-female_must_strip,target:gogo,targetStage:0=interested,You seem a little sour, Miss Gumball.  If those bubbles aren't cheering you up, just give me the rest to chew.
5-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=bored,<i>Yeesh</i>.  Meia, I'm sorry I ever called you miserable.  Next to this girl, you're a field of sunflowers.
5-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,I'm glad we came here, boss.  Miss Blueberry over here has given me a new appreciation for your sense of humor.
5-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=bored,Jeez, I've at least <i>seen</i> you smile, Meia.  I don't think this girl <i>has</i> those muscles.
5-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,At least you have your face on display, Leader.  This girl's both miserable <i>and</i> refuses to show it.
5-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=laughing,What's up, Four-Feet-Four-Eyes?  You look like someone brought you here at gunpoint.
5-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=laughing,Oh, look, the egghead love child of Parfet and Dita--nerdy and <i>and</i> eccentric!  How's the weather at the bottom of the earth?
5-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0,marker:fama_and_oma=laughing,I keep trying to look over your outfit, but my eyes just keep moving too fast and missing it.  Did your Fama not produce milk, shorty?
5-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=interested,You're such a cute little bespectacled spectacle--but damn if you don't look eleven.  Where's the other two feet of your body?
5-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0=smug,Dear god, girl, you'd cower if a light breeze rolled in.  What's the big deal with a little <i>exposure</i>?
5-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0=seductive,You are just <i>so</i> cute.  How do you feel about women, little Miss?  <i>Do my breasts bother you</i>?
5-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0=vain,Shy around nudity, sweetie?  Did the big, bad Earth men beat this into you?  Just <i>enjoy</i> yourself...
5-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0=laughing,You're such a nervous wreck that I just feel bad for teasing you.  Way to ruin my fun.
5-female_must_strip,target:hinata,targetStage:0=smug,So what are these "ninjas" all about, huh?  Disappearing into the night doesn't sound useful in a game like <i>this</i>.
5-female_must_strip,target:hinata,targetStage:0=teasing,Don't tell me your going to use those ninja skills to hide your body, now.
5-female_must_strip,target:hinata,targetStage:0=stretching,Certainly an impressive profile, Miss Ninja.  Think you could show us just <i>how</i> impressive?
5-female_must_strip,target:hinata,targetStage:0=interested,Does "ninja" just mean you wear a headband?  Sounds like a lofty title for my Barnette to accidentally fall under.
5-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=seductive,Omigosh, Meia, look!  <i>Another</i> spacefarer who recognizes the value of a bodysuit.  You should chat her up!
5-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,Blonde like me, suit like yours, from space like both of us!  This <i>Samus</i> covers all our bases, Meia.  Go flirt with her!
5-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,This woman's practically a Mejarian, between the spacey jumpsuit and gorgeous figure.  Go get her, Meia--she's got your sense of style!
5-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=seductive,Full jumpsuit, shapely behind, cute face, <i>from space</i>?  Meia, this girl is prime girlfriend material!  Now's the time!
5-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:0=laughing,Hey, Kitty-cat.  You're supposed to strip <i>during</i> the game, not <i>before</i> it.
5-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:0=interested,Nice Halloween costume, Kitty, but maybe you should have picked something a little more complex for this game.
5-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:0=smug,Not too interested in winning, huh, Kitty-cat?  Unless you've brought some yarn-balls you plan on counting.
5-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:0=smug,I only know about cats from Mejare's zoos...they only showed the females, of course.  But they were definitely more covered than <i>you</i> are.
5-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=interested,...So it's <i>piloting</i> that really gets you going, Leader.  <i>You hopeless intellectual, you</i>.
5-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,I <i>knew</i> you were a robot.  The only thing that makes you lighten up is another woman's skills.
5-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=stretching,I guess I'm just shallower than you are, boss.  There you go, seeking out girlfriends on things <i>beyond</i> looks.
5-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=stretching,Oh, thank God, you're flirting.  For a second there I was worried you really <i>were</i> sexless.
5-female_must_strip,target:faye,targetStage:0=smug,Beautiful hair, makeup, spacefaring?  With <i>both</i> of us running around, this table's going to get sick of the archetype.
5-female_must_strip,target:faye,targetStage:0=laughing,Do we have a fellow star-crossing seductress on our hands?  I'm not sure there's enough meat for both of us.
5-female_must_strip,target:faye,targetStage:0=teasing,<i>Hey, good-lookin'.</i>  Trying to steal my thunder with the "seductress-from-space" angle?  I don't mind--<i>I like women, too</i>.
5-female_must_strip,target:faye,targetStage:0=seductive,You didn't doll yourself up like that just to please some <i>men</i>, did you?  Come show this fellow spacefarer what you can do.
5-female_must_strip,target:evie,targetStage:0=vain,So what's your story?  You can cast magic spells or something?  If it's true, sign me up--it'll be another wonderful thing about me!
5-female_must_strip,target:evie,targetStage:0=vain,Some might call my <i>beauty</i> magical...I'm inclined to agree.
5-female_must_strip,target:evie,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, honey.  Cast a spell on <i>me</i>...one that makes me even prettier.  Now <i>that</i> would be magic!
5-female_must_strip,target:evie,targetStage:0=interested,Alright, I've seen enough crazy Paksis-magic to believe your tales.  But why don't you put your money where your mouth is?
5-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=bored,Oh, for God's sake, Meia, don't go on a damn moral crusade.  She's kind of cute, isn't that enough?
5-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=frustrated,We barely know her or what Earth's military is like, Meia.  Don't start with your vendettas against authority.
5-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=bored,It wasn't Earth soldiers that shut down our living districts, Meia.  Cool it and try to have a nice time.
5-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=frustrated,Oh, don't start ragging on the poor girl like we understand the politics of this place.  Let's just all calm down and enjoy each others' breasts.
5-female_must_strip,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=seductive,Oh?  And what do we have here, besides the most adorably shy little woman I've ever seen?
5-female_must_strip,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=stretching,Such a cutie...and in a traditional-looking dress!  Hard to believe someone so shy would even be here.
5-female_must_strip,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=seductive,Something wrong, honey?  <i>You've hardly been looking me in the eye</i>.  It's OK, I don't bite.
5-female_must_strip,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=vain,Why so shy, Elizabeth?  Confidence makes women ten times as beautiful--just look at me!
5-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,count-d.va_cruiser:1=teasing,I don't even know you, girlie, but you seem dressed up for a special occasion all the same.  Feeling sexy today?
5-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,count-d.va_cruiser:1,marker:planet-countries=seductive,Hey, cutie.  Is it a holiday on planet Korea?  Because you look different from usual.
5-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,count-d.va_cruiser:1,marker:planet-countries=interested,This "Korea" planet of yours has got quite the range of fashion.  I <i>swear</i> I've seen you running around in something else.
5-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,count-d.va_cruiser:1=stretching,What's up, D.Va?  That's a cute outfit--but it doesn't seem quite like your usual fare.  What's the occasion?
5-female_must_strip,target:elena,targetStage:0=teasing,Little Miss Princess wants to play strip poker, does she?  Well, I hope you don't mind if this nasty pirate holds you hostage.
5-female_must_strip,target:elena,targetStage:0=laughing,Looking a little out of your element, Miss Blueblood.  Gonna prove that you're really better than the rest of us like your title implies?
5-female_must_strip,target:elena,targetStage:0=smug,Look at Miss Princess, lugging around a scepter just to prove she's better than the peons.  We'll see how you enjoy stripping down like us.
5-female_must_strip,target:elena,targetStage:0=annoyed,Royals really get on my nerves, you know...mostly because I'm <i>not</i> one, despite actually being better-looking.
5-female_must_strip,target:elaine,targetStage:0=seductive,And what do we have here?  An <i>Earth</i> pirate?  And with a sword, to boot!  Interesting...
5-female_must_strip,target:elaine,targetStage:0=teasing,I see even Earth pirates understand the subtle elegance of a blade!  And you've got some <i>luxurious</i> hair yourself.
5-female_must_strip,target:elaine,targetStage:0=seductive,Oho--a fellow pirate?  I'd absolutely <i>love</i> to have a drink later--maybe you could teach me how to handle my sword better.
5-female_must_strip,target:elaine,targetStage:0=seductive,<i>Well, now</i>!  You Earth pirates don't dress like we do on Mejare--but your choice of weapon isn't too far off.  Can you show me around?
5-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:1=awkward,So, Miss Kitty, you, uh, going to shave your bottom fur now?  ...I'd like that.
5-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:1=frustrated,Knowing that that's fur now makes me <i>really</i> want to see you shaved...Mejare likes shaving.
5-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:1=bored,Is the bottom fur going now?  Because I <i>hate</i> hair...except on the head.
5-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:1=bored,Please tell me you're shaving everything else.  That's sort of the style on Mejare, so it's what I know.
5-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,count-meia:2=annoyed,Ugh, now there's <i>two</i> of you?  I guess ~player~ is a big fan of being rejected.
5-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,count-meia:2=angry,<i>Two</i> Meias?  Hey, I've been hitting on you this entire time!  What's <i>she</i> done besides give you the cold shoulder?
5-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,count-meia:2=annoyed,...You know, I put a lot of effort into my appearance.  Meia rolls out of bed, and <i>she's</i> the one to get two of her?
5-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,count-meia:2=angry,Hey, what's this all about, ~player~?  You really think Meia's prettier than I am?
5-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=vain,No jokes here, darling!  We're one hundred percent <i>alien</i>...if you define "alien" as "not from Earth."
5-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=seductive,We <i>are</i> from another planet, honey!  We're fearless Mejarian pirates...and we've come <i>all this way</i> to learn about Earth.
5-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=vain,Yep, just two exotic women from another world!  So we stuck together, since we can only trust each other around here.
5-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=teasing,We're pirates from Mejare, darling, and all we know about Earth is that men and women live together here!  Which sounds strange to us.
5-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=seductive,That's right, Elizabeth--Meia and I are from another world!  And we're stripping here--<i>that's how much we trust each other</i>.
5-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,Mei and Meia, eh?  I hope our other guests won't mix the two of you up--both are cold in your own ways, after all.
5-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,Look, Meia, this girl's nearly got your name.  But she smiles, so telling you two apart should be easy.
5-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Mei and Meia?  I'd play matchmaker, but you'd be the most confusing couple of all time.
5-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,See, Meia?  You're so sweet, this girl was nearly named after you.  Nearly.
5-female_must_strip,target:arwen,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=confused,Hey, what's all this about the <i>middle</i> of Earth?  Is there a spot underground that only you elf-people get to live in?
5-female_must_strip,target:arwen,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=confused,And I call <i>you</i> pale, Meia.  Arwen here looks almost ghostly...is that just the way elves are?
5-female_must_strip,target:arwen,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=confused,Hey, what's up with those pointy ears?  And that pallid skin?  You're a strange one, "elf" girl.
5-female_must_strip,target:arwen,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=confused,So you call yourself an elf, right?  Is that another word for "Earthling with crazy ears"?  Because you look human otherwise.
5-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:2=confused,So, uh, besides being blue, what's your deal?  You're all sweet and polite now.
5-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:2=seductive,Can't say I prefer blue hair, but you're certainly a lot sweeter now, honey.  What <i>happened</i>?
5-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:2=seductive,Normally I like blondes, but at least you're not waving a gun around and cursing anymore.  Nice tradeoff.
5-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:2=vain,Blue hair is more exotic, but blonde is far more beautiful.  Still, I'll take this polite version of you over the alternative.
5-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:0=awkward,Uh...you want to calm down there, sweetheart?  Maybe put that men's gun down?  Take a nap?
5-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:0=bored,Jeez, we knew you meant business by the gun.  No need to shout...must be men's influence.
5-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:0=frustrated,Can you pipe down?  Way to confirm the image of Earth girls as nasty little gun-toting balls of violence.
5-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:0=shocked,Uh...why are you carrying that giant men's gun?  I'd show it to Barnette, but you, uh, don't seem too friendly.
5-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:0=bored,That's a huge gun, Miss Moxie...men's mechanical weapons are so noisy and inefficient.  Don't tell Barnette I said that.
5-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=stretching,See, Meia, I think you do the "strong, silent type" thing pretty well.  Chell here is an example of taking it too far.
5-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,Slow on the uptake?  The "strong, silent type" doesn't mean <i>literally</i> never speaking, you know.
5-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,Oh, don't feel bad.  I know you're speechless at the sight of me--but I'll do enough talking for both of us!
5-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Stunned into speechlessness?  I'm flattered, but really, honey, you can talk to me.  I won't mind.
5-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Hey, Chell.  If I'm the most gorgeous woman you've ever met, don't say anything.
5-female_must_strip,target:lara,targetStage:0=stretching,Raiding tombs, you said?  Why would you <i>ever</i> want to be all dirty and dusty?
5-female_must_strip,target:lara,targetStage:0=stretching,You won't find <i>me</i> in catacombs like you explore.  It'd ruin my dress...and my face.
5-female_must_strip,target:lara,targetStage:0=teasing,So what's in these tombs, anyway?  <i>We</i> conduct raids on the living and able--so watch out!
5-female_must_strip,target:lara,targetStage:0=smug,Raiding those who can't defend themselves doesn't sound too impressive, honey.  Or do monsters live in those tombs of yours?
5-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0=interested,What's with the wings, Miss Pixie?  You some kind of sex-fairy sent to wake up our libidos?
5-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0=seductive,And what do we have here?  A tender little love fairy to help us all along in our sexual adventures?
5-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0=teasing,A love fairy, eh?  You listen here, Miss Pixie--<i>I'm</i> in a happy relationship.  So no touching!
5-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0=laughing,Little Miss Pixie's got quite the filthy mouth for being so frilly-pink with love.  I guess sex <i>is</i> a part of love, but still...
5-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,<i>Oh, dear</i>.  I can see where <i>this</i> is going, Ice Queen.
5-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,<i>Flirting</i>, are we Meia?  I figured as much.  Best to let the lovebirds just figure things out on their own.
5-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,Meia, honey, you're just setting yourself up for disappointment.  Earth girls don't like each others' bodies the way <i>we</i> do.
5-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Ooh, you're so <i>cute</i> when a woman actually gets you going!  She'll deny it now, Chun, but Meia here is <i>totally</i> into you.
5-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0=stretching,Hey, Chatterbox, feel free to live a little.  You're as bad as Meia...good thing she ended up somewhere else.
5-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0=stretching,And here I thought I was sparing this table the boredom of having Meia around.  Enter her Earth doppelganger.
5-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0=smug,Pale, dead-serious, somehow convinced there's strategy in cards.  I didn't know they synthesized Meia's brand of boredom on Earth.
5-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0=laughing,<i>Please, Chatterbox, you're talking our ears off.  And your smiles are just so radiant</i>!  A woman after Meia's own black heart.
5-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia,marker:planet-countries=smug,Where'd you say you were from?  Planet <i>Korea</i>?  Well then, it seems Korea and Mejare share a fashion sense...
5-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia,marker:planet-countries=teasing,You're a cutie, Miss Bodysuit, if a little on the short side.  Is that just how they make women over on Planet Korea?
5-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Well, everyone, cards on the table.  Who wears the whole bodysuit look better--D.Va or my miserable old boss here?
5-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,You're an adorable little thing, D.Va!  All wrapped up in that cute bodysuit, just like <i>another</i> pilot I know...who might be sitting here.
5-female_must_strip,target:hope,targetStage:0=confused,Hey, dearie, no reason to come out knives-swinging.  I've got my rapier sheathed like a civilized woman.
5-female_must_strip,target:hope,targetStage:0=awkward,Settle down there, honey.  There's something awfully scary about wearing a smile with a knife out.
5-female_must_strip,target:hope,targetStage:0=frustrated,I know I brought a sword, sweetheart, but that was just for fashion.  Don't turn this place into a bloodbath.
5-female_must_strip,target:hope,targetStage:0=shocked,Well, hi there, cutie--er, uh, <i>knife-wielding</i> cutie.  Yeah.  Carry on.
5-female_must_strip,target:kurumu,targetStage:0=laughing,Hey there, short stuff!  Seems all your height went into your chest--those things are even bigger than mine!
5-female_must_strip,target:kurumu,targetStage:0=interested,You hogging all the nutrients on this planet, Miss Vampire?  You're the only Earth girl I've seen that outdoes <i>my</i> breasts.
5-female_must_strip,target:kurumu,targetStage:0=smug,Even through that schoolgirl's outfit, I can tell your breasts are superior to mine.  Hopefully Barnette loves me for <i>other</i> reasons.
5-female_must_strip,target:kurumu,targetStage:0=laughing,Is it true you suck blood, Miss Vampire?  If so...well, we certainly know where it all goes.
5-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,What's up, sourpuss?  You look even more miserable than a certain squadron leader I know...the one right next to us.
5-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,Hey, lighten up, girlie.  I could have gotten this mood from playing poker with Meia back on the ship.
5-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=stretching,<i>Yawn</i>...are you really going to be a miserable bore this whole time?  Would having <i>my</i> breasts make you feel better?
5-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,Looks like it's Little Miss Sunshine's turn to strip.  Between you and Meia here, the energy's just through the roof.
5-female_must_strip,target:kimberly,targetStage:0=confused,Hey, so, uh, normally I'd tease you or something, but what was with that big lightshow from you earlier?
5-female_must_strip,target:kimberly,targetStage:0=confused,Wait, weren't you wearing pink a little while ago?  Like, a full suit?  Was that lightshow back there <i>you</i>?
5-female_must_strip,target:kimberly,targetStage:0=shocked,Hey, who's the new girl?  And where'd that pink-suit-wearing woman go after she flashed away?  Wait, was that <i>you</i>?
5-female_must_strip,target:kimberly,targetStage:0=angry,Hey, aren't you the one who half-blinded us all a little bit ago?  Where'd your suit go?  I thought it was cool, so start talking.
5-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:6=laughing,Even with all that, you're still forced to be naked?  It's official--you're totally into this.
5-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:6=teasing,Even with your little flower setup, dearie, I think you're out of options.  Cough up the good stuff--I'm convinced you want to.
5-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:6=vain,<i>That</i> ought to do it, unless you've got more of the plant kingdom at your disposal.  Isn't this what you wanted, playing this game?
5-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:6=seductive,Oh, I'm sure you're cute, dear--I remember your butt!  Besides...I seriously doubt this isn't turning you on.
5-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=interested,Look, Meia, she's just as pale, serious, and boring as you are.  Think she'd smile around Kahlua?
5-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,Hey, Meia's standing right here.  Isn't that enough boredom for one table without <i>you</i> aping her style?
5-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,Look at that, Meia, Earth's found a way to mass-produce you!  <i>Diabolical</i>.
5-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,<i>Yeah, yeah, Meia, stay cocky</i>.  Oh wait, Meia's over <i>here</i>!  You two are just so similar.
5-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=seductive,<i>Oooh</i>!  Even ~player~ realizes how beautiful I am--enough to add a clone!  You're so <i>adorable</i>.
5-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=laughing,Hey, what's this all about, ~player~?  Did I keep on winning, and you wanted to see me naked <i>that</i> badly?
5-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=vain,Would you look at that?  My beauty was so enticing that ~player~ figured out the offline version just to add more of me.
5-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=vain,Earth's cloning technology is well underway!  And ~player~ picked the <i>perfect</i> specimen, I must say.
5-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=vain,I never thought ~player~ could manage to flatter me, and then they go and pick <i>two</i> of me!  Good show.
5-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=laughing,<i>My, my, ~player~</i>.  You <i>really</i> like the look of me.
5-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,Hey, Meia, what do you think?  Should we try to find you a bodysuit with polka dots?  Maybe force you to smile like Marinette?
5-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=interested,This girl makes bodysuits look a lot cuter than <i>you</i> do, Meia.  Must be because she smiles...or because of the polka dots.
5-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,Even with the mask on, this girl emotes much more than <i>you</i>, Meia.  Maybe a polka-dotted suit would lighten you up.
5-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,If you're not a fan of polka dots, Meia, maybe you could adopt this girl's adorable accent and actually brighten a room for once.
5-female_must_strip,target:jubilee,targetStage:0=vain,Well, aren't <i>you</i> a little fireball, Miss Mutant?  You look pretty human to me, and this is a girl who thought <i>men</i> were aliens.
5-female_must_strip,target:jubilee,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, honey, <i>men</i> are mutant people, as far as I'm concerned.  And they're still cute, so don't be so hard on yourself.
5-female_must_strip,target:jubilee,targetStage:0=smug,How many people have to tell you you're ugly for you to introduce yourself as a <i>mutant</i>?  You poor, rundown thing.
5-female_must_strip,target:jubilee,targetStage:0=stretching,You look pretty mundane for a <i>mutant</i>, darling.  Although you've certainly got an inhuman fire in you.
5-female_must_strip,target:joey,targetStage:0=confused,What's with all the makeup?  Someone said you're a...<i>clown</i>, whatever that means?
5-female_must_strip,target:joey,targetStage:0=confused,...So does <i>clown</i> mean "makeup advertiser"?  Because you're modeling too many products at once.
5-female_must_strip,target:joey,targetStage:0=laughing,...Earth makeup is something else.  Apparently there's whole classes of women called <i>clowns</i> who just cake it on!
5-female_must_strip,target:joey,targetStage:0=confused,So if I wore as much makeup as you do, would that make me a "clown"?  Where's the lower limit?  This is all new to me.
5-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0=laughing,What's up, sourpuss?  You look even more miserable than a certain squadron leader I know.
5-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0=smug,Hey, lighten up, girlie.  I didn't come all the way to Earth to find what I could get from Meia's strategy lectures.
5-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0=stretching,<i>Yawn</i>...are you really going to be a miserable bore this whole time?  Would having <i>my</i> breasts make you feel better?
5-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0=smug,Looks like it's Little Miss Sunshine's turn to strip.  Good thing Meia's not here, or this table would just freeze over.
5-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0=excited,Ooh!  Ooh!  You're the one who's with a woman, right?  You some kind of Mejarian envoy to Earth?
5-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0=thinking,You're with a woman, isn't that right?  Maybe Mejare was just aping what Earthlings came up with first...
5-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0=interested,So, you're the one showing these poor Earth girls the Mejarian way, right?  That they don't need men to be happy?  Good job.
5-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0=vain,<i>Finally</i>, an Earth woman who's realized how much better other women's bodies are.  We should gossip about our girlfriends later.
5-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0,marker:fama_and_oma=smug,So, Miss Mejarian-style, are you going to be the Fama, or is your ladyfriend?  My Barnette's far too cute to carry babies herself.
5-female_must_strip,target:dawn,targetStage:0=confused,What'd you say you raised?  Those little <i>Poker</i>--whatevers?  Is that why you're playing this game?
5-female_must_strip,target:dawn,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, dearie, that exotic blue hair will take you further than weird animal training--you should be a model for shampoo or something.
5-female_must_strip,target:dawn,targetStage:0=confused,Mejare has barely any animals at all, so this whole "pokey-mon" thing is lost on me.  And they just do whatever you say?
5-female_must_strip,target:dawn,targetStage:0=laughing,So could you train <i>men</i> the way you do these <i>poker</i>-whatevers?  Because <i>that</i> would be quite interesting...
5-female_must_strip,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:0=interested,...Can I maybe just call you "DMG" for short?  Because <i>Dark Magician Girl</i> is a hell of a mouthful.
5-female_must_strip,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:0,marker:fama_and_oma=confused,...Don't you have an actual name?  You know, like the one your Fama gives you?
5-female_must_strip,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:0=teasing,You've really got to give yourself a snappier nickname, dearie...men aren't bright enough to remember that many words.
5-female_must_strip,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:0=stretching,If you really <i>are</i> a magician, color me interested...but that clunky name could use a shortening or two.
5-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0,count-ruby_v4:1=interested,Looking a little different there, Ruby.  Brighter, in fact.  Something bring up the mood where you're from?
5-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0,count-ruby_v4:1=smug,I see you've been mixing up the colors, sweetie.  Not a bad approach, but I'm totally in love with this dress just as it is.
5-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0,count-ruby_v4:1=stretching,Mixing up the outfits, are we?  I've cultivated a certain look with my crewmates I'd rather just maintain.
5-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0,count-ruby_v4:1=vain,Hey, check out the new style Ruby's rocking.  Not bad, but I'm the kind of girl to just stick with what I know best!
5-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:3=awkward,Uh, Aimee?  Are you sure you want to keep doing that?  You nearly got hit last time...and your targets are getting smaller.
5-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:3=shocked,Um, it's OK, Aimee!  You've been very impressive!  Just go out on top, you know?
5-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:3=awkward,...Are you sure about this, Aimee?  After...last time?  Don't kill yourself...
5-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:3=awkward,Uh--don't go all the way just for <i>my</i> sake.  What you did was cool, but, um...well, you'll be fine.
5-female_must_strip,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=laughing,Normally I'd say rock the skin color you have, but <i>wow</i>.  Pink is <i>not</i> an attractive color...not <i>that</i> pink.
5-female_must_strip,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=stretching,And here I thought <i>Mejarians</i> were the ones with the exotic body colors.  Earth girls are breaking out the bright pink skin!
5-female_must_strip,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=confused,Why's your skin all gross-looking and pink?  Like, <i.really</i> pink.  It's distracting...so is that eyepatch, too.
5-female_must_strip,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=smug,Not to be outdone, Earth starts showing this Mejarian just how bizarre its colors can truly get.  Next on the agenda: <i>pink skin</i>.
5-female_must_strip,target:ayano,targetStage:0=confused,...You OK there, schoolgirl?  You look a little on edge...especially when you look <i>my</i> way.
5-female_must_strip,target:ayano,targetStage:0=teasing,Looking a little bug-eyed there, honey.  Too much coffee this morning?
5-female_must_strip,target:ayano,targetStage:0=confused,Uh, you OK, Ayano?  Your eyes are all shifty, like somebody's watching you.
5-female_must_strip,target:ayano,targetStage:0=annoyed,...Could you settle down there, girlie?  You're giving me the stink-eye like I killed someone.  It's creeping me out.
5-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:4=smug,Well, I guess if you've come this far, you might as well finish the job.  Go for it.
5-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:4=seductive,I'd expect nothing less, cutie.  Be sure to wow us!
5-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:4=teasing,Might as well seal the deal, even if it's just your thong.  You can do it, honey!
5-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:4=smug,Seems we've got similar taste in underwear.  Shame you're about to shoot it right off, but at least it'll look cool.
5-female_must_strip,target:athena,targetStage:0=interested,I really thought I'd be the most lightly-dressed woman here, but there you go showing me up on <i>that</i> front.
5-female_must_strip,target:athena,targetStage:0=smug,Way to dispel my stereotypes of Earth girls being overdressed.  You wear even less than I do.
5-female_must_strip,target:athena,targetStage:0=interested,Hey, I understand wanting to show a little skin, but you can't walk around in a <i>bikini</i> all day.  Even Barnette doesn't go that far.
5-female_must_strip,target:athena,targetStage:0=stretching,Even my darling little Barnette covers herself up better than <i>you</i> do...and she's got a reputation for dressing flimsily.
5-female_must_strip,target:asuna,targetStage:0=frustrated,What'd you say you lived in?  An M-M-O--ripgah?  I can't keep track of all that.
5-female_must_strip,target:asuna,targetStage:0=confused,Did you say you lived in a computer or something like that?  Sounds like Heaven to Parfet, with how much she tinkers with machines.
5-female_must_strip,target:asuna,targetStage:0=confused,So what's it like inside a computer?  Do you have to wear a rubber suit to avoid getting electrocuted?
5-female_must_strip,target:asuna,targetStage:0=confused,You live inside a game, right?  And now you're <i>playing</i> a game?  Is this whole place a game I've stepped inside?
5-female_must_strip,target:aiyana,targetStage:0=vain,That tan is something else, and your energy is boundless!  Most Mejarians opt for pale, as you can see...
5-female_must_strip,target:aiyana,targetStage:0=teasing,Barnette's kind of tan like you are.  She's cute, too, so women can pull it off!
5-female_must_strip,target:aiyana,targetStage:0=teasing,Slow down there, tiger.  That energy is going to turn you into a tan smear on the ground.
5-female_must_strip,target:aiyana,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=confused,Tan is certainly a look on Mejare, but pale is the norm for us...where'd you say you were from?  Planet Austria?
5-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:0=awkward,...Are you alright there, honey?  With the knife and all?
5-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:0=awkward,...You know, I carry the rapier mostly for fashion...maybe you could relegate that knife to the same thing?
5-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:0=annoyed,...Could you maybe put down the knife, sweetheart?  Hey, are you listening?
5-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:0=bored,What a weirdo...knives are just as deadly as swords, with none of the style.
5-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:0=frustrated,Better keep my sword on hand, with <i>this</i> nutcase on the scene.
5-female_must_strip,target:april,targetStage:0=vain,Ooh, do you really report the news?  Be sure to get my good side--oh wait, that's <i>every</i> side!
5-female_must_strip,target:april,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey there, Jumpsuit.  Someone said you're a reporter--but <i>this</i> pirate doesn't mind a little publicity!
5-female_must_strip,target:april,targetStage:0=smug,I've been in the media for much worse than a few glory shots, so don't think I'm afraid of that camera, newsgirl.
5-female_must_strip,target:april,targetStage:0=vain,Hey, newsie, I've got all the story you need right here.  Your Earth viewers have never seen a body like mine!
5-female_must_strip,target:black_canary,targetStage:0=teasing,Oho--a fellow blonde!  Good to see them running around on Earth--we've got to stick together!
5-female_must_strip,target:black_canary,targetStage:0=seductive,Hey there, cutie!  Always good to see more lovely blonde women running around.  Got to keep each other safe from those jealous brunettes.
5-female_must_strip,target:black_canary,targetStage:0=vain,Ooh, is blonde your natural color?  It's not as exotic as some of Mejare's other hair colors, but it's certainly appealing to be wrapped in gold.
5-female_must_strip,target:black_canary,targetStage:0=vain,What, was "Blonde Canary" taken?  Because <i>that's</i> what I would advertise, if I were you.
5-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0=laughing,Hey there, short stuff.  I think you might actually be shorter than Hibiki, which is a challenge even for women.
5-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0=laughing,You said you fight "Titans"?  I imagine that's everyone, considering your stature.
5-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0=laughing,"Titans," huh?  You mean like me next to you?  Or anyone, really?
5-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0=interested,How's the weather down there, at the very bottom of Earth?  You really need to drink your milk, honey.
5-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0,marker:fama_and_oma=vain,...See, <i>this</i> is why I'm going to be the Fama for Barnette.  I don't want our daughters growing up all short from lack of milk.
5-female_must_strip,target:annie,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey there, Plain-Jane.  What's brought you here, with all your layers?  Looking to overcome some shyness?
5-female_must_strip,target:annie,targetStage:0=smug,Exhibit A of Earth girls' ridiculous conservatism.  Can't you appreciate your own body instead of hiding it?  Must be men doing this to you.
5-female_must_strip,target:annie,targetStage:0=laughing,What's up, cutie?  You seem to be making every effort to hide that cuteness, actually.  Just look at those packed-on layers.
5-female_must_strip,target:annie,targetStage:0=vain,I guess I'd be a little shyer about my body if I had your height and plain looks, but come on.  Confidence makes <i>any</i> woman look better!
5-female_must_strip,target:alpha,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=laughing,You're pale as marble, dearie!  Do they not have a sun on this "Japan" planet?
5-female_must_strip,target:alpha,targetStage:0=confused,Are you...<i>flickering</i>?  Are you some kind of hologram?  That might explain your skin tone.
5-female_must_strip,target:alpha,targetStage:0=confused,You OK there, sweetheart?  You look a little pale...and non-corporeal.
5-female_must_strip,target:alpha,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=vain,And I thought <i>Mejarians</i> liked the pale look!  This "Japan" planet puts us to shame.
5-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0=vain,How's a young little thing like you a model if you're still in school?  <i>I've</i> got modeling potential, but it's hard for pirates to land a job.
5-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0=smug,A student <i>and</i> a model?  And here I am, with all my beauty, and still a lowly criminal.  At least I have my wonderful piloting skills.
5-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0=vain,<i>If only my circumstances let me be the beautiful model I've always dreamed of being</i>!  Guess I'll have to settle for death-defying pirate.
5-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0=teasing,You're a lucky one, Earth-girl.  I never had the benefit of much schooling, nor the opportunity to be a model.  So cherish what you've got!
5-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0=vain,Ooh, you're into art?  Do you think you could paint a portrait of me?  Maybe frame it in your collection to capture my eternal beauty?
5-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0=teasing,Ooh, so you're an <i>artist</i>?  I know a particularly handsome man that can paint, too...think you could capture me better?
5-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0=vain,Did you say you go to school with men?  I was never that big on school--except for art, where we could finally appreciate <i>beauty</i>!
5-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0=vain,Students tend to be such bores--like that egghead Parfet.  But an <i>art</i> student?  Now we're talking--my whole body is art!
5-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:0=vain,Check out that outfit!  Going for the natural look?  So would I, if Mejare had much of nature.
5-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:0=interested,Did you just piece that outfit together from bits you found in a forest?  It doesn't even look that bad, but...it's certainly all-natural.
5-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:0=vain,If only Mejare had the same verdant natural resources as Earth.  Perhaps then I could try to emulate your all-natural style.
5-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:0=vain,Mejare's a little too wasteful to have the greenery for me to dress like <i>you</i> do.  You can see how little we wear to compensate.
5-female_must_strip,target:amy_rose,targetStage:0=confused,You're, uh, looking a little pink there.  And what's up with those ears?
5-female_must_strip,target:amy_rose,targetStage:0=confused,I know I joke about Earth girls being aliens, but, uh, you really do look kind of weird.  What's with all the...<i>fur</i>?
5-female_must_strip,target:amy_rose,targetStage:0=confused,Wait, did they say you're a...a <i>hedgehog</i> or something?  Is that some kind of animal?  That would explain the, uh, pink...and ears.
5-female_must_strip,target:amy_rose,targetStage:0=confused,...I really can't make heads or tails of you.  You kind of <i>look</i> like you should have a tail, what with that fur and all.
5-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, girlie, someone told me you're a model on Earth...is that true?  I'd like to get in on that...
5-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0=teasing,You're pretty cute, honey, but I hear people like legs on their models...better hope <i>I</i> don't hit the scene.
5-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0=vain,Hey now, sweetheart.  You're cute, but there's no need to brag about being a model...not when a <i>Mejarian's</i> on the scene.
5-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0=teasing,Don't be so full of yourself, Miss Model...I'd be a model, too, if not for Mejare's pesky little corrupt government.
5-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:1=vain,Should've figured Little Miss Princess would want to break away and strip for strangers.  You must be so sheltered!
5-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:1=teasing,Oh, is it true you're a <i>princess</i>, darling?  That would explain the haughty attitude...and the phony embarrassment.
5-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:1=teasing,I'm a pirate, dearie...and no huge fan of authority figures.  Luckily, I <i>love</i> girls who strip for fun and pleasure.
5-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:1=interested,So you're a princess, is that it?  You should know you're not fooling me--you <i>love</i> being ogled, don't you?
5-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:1=interested,A princess, hm?  Only makes sense that such a public figure as yourself would love exhibiting her body for total strangers.
5-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:5=smug,Well, that's that.  Do what you must behind those flowers.
5-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:5=interested,You can hide yourself with the flowers, honey, but you're naked, so that's a loss in my book.
5-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:5=smug,Nice try with the foliage, dear, but no one's going to call that clothing.  You're out.
5-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:5=stretching,<i>And so the frightened little princess falls before her betters.  Even the forest spirits couldn't save her</i>.
5-female_must_strip,target:alice_degracia,targetStage:0=smug,Hey, hey, hey!  Check out the <i>all-purple</i> look.  That's a new one...
5-female_must_strip,target:alice_degracia,targetStage:0=vain,Hey, honey, color <i>contrasts</i> show confidence.  Would I look nearly as stunning if this dress matched my hair?
5-female_must_strip,target:alice_degracia,targetStage:0=smug,Purple hair's certainly got an exotic appeal...too bad mine is boring old blonde.  As for the matching outfit, I don't follow the logic.
5-female_must_strip,target:alice_degracia,targetStage:0=teasing,Quite the exotic color scheme you've got there, sweetie.  Too bad you forgot to mix it up at all.
5-female_must_strip,target:blackrose,targetStage:0=confused,I was gonna say something about that cool dark skin, but apparently...you're just some sort of image?  What's <i>that</i> about?
5-female_must_strip,target:blackrose,targetStage:0=frustrated,You're..."virtual"?  Listen, honey, you can't just assume we know what these things mean.  Piloting's a busy life, you know!
5-female_must_strip,target:blackrose,targetStage:0=bored,Wait, so you're not really here, and you're some kind of "virtual" avatar?  Earth has really gotten advanced from all the technology they keep stealing.
5-female_must_strip,target:blackrose,targetStage:0=annoyed,Hey, if we can just use computers to <i>project</i> ourselves here, why didn't anyone tell me?  I had to <i>fly</i> all the way here!
5-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:2=seductive,I'd call you crazy for this sort of thing, but how could I when you defy death like it's nothing?
5-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:2=excited,You're just so <i>awesome</i>!  I can't get enough of this!
5-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:2=teasing,Can you do it a <i>third</i> time, hotshot?  Yeah, probably.
5-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:2=excited,I could watch you do this all day.  My heart jumps every time!
5-female_must_strip,target:blake,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, the black-and-white look is a classic!  Very striking and confident with that contrast.  And such a cute little bow!
5-female_must_strip,target:blake,targetStage:0=teasing,Maybe it's just me, but you've got a Mejarian sense of style!  Clashing colors, nice and sexy and revealing!  A woman after my own heart.
5-female_must_strip,target:blake,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, that's a cute outfit, Blake!  I love this dress, but I don't have anything quite as fancy as all that clashing-colors business.
5-female_must_strip,target:blake,targetStage:0=teasing,<i>Mmm</i>...the lace, the contrast, the <i>heels</i>!  I like your style, Blake!  Not bad for an Earth girl.
5-female_must_strip,target:daria,targetStage:0=laughing,Way to half-ass your outfit, honey.  You look like you picked out whatever fell on you when you opened your closet!
5-female_must_strip,target:daria,targetStage:0=interested,...So is the "zero-effort" look how you attract Earth men?  Have I been going at this all wrong?
5-female_must_strip,target:daria,targetStage:0=smug,I should have known--men are too simple to understand complex outfits, so they respond better to cobbled-together looks like yours.
5-female_must_strip,target:daria,targetStage:0=laughing,Gotta be honest here, sweetheart--you don't look like the type to be playing this.  Those glasses aren't helping you pick out appealing clothes.
5-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0,count-weiss_v4:1=vain,Hey, Miss Moneybags, nice wardrobe.  I'm just a poor little pirate--<i>this dress is the best I can afford</i>.
5-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0,count-weiss_v4:1=smug,Figures Miss Princess can't go five minutes without changing her clothes.  A few months of piracy will teach you appreciate the clothes you've got.
5-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0,count-weiss_v4:1=interested,At least you mixed up the colors a little with this new outfit, Miss Heirlooms.  What you had before was like if I wore all yellow.
5-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0,count-weiss_v4:1=teasing,Looking cute there, Coinstacks.  Nice new outfit--gotta show off the money somehow, right?
5-female_must_strip,target:daphne,targetStage:0=smug,Oh good, a fellow blonde...and tall, too.  Wasn't sure Earth girls could fit either category.
5-female_must_strip,target:daphne,targetStage:0=vain,You're not a bad looker yourself, honey.  Must be our wonderful blonde genetics that inform the rest of our bodies!
5-female_must_strip,target:daphne,targetStage:0=vain,You solve mysteries, is that right?  Well...there's no mystery about how wonderful it is to be blonde.
5-female_must_strip,target:daphne,targetStage:0=stretching,<i>Ho-hum</i>.  Another blonde in a dress...I'm just kidding, you're still cute.
5-female_must_strip,target:daisy,targetStage:0=smug,Ohoho.  Miss Boring-old-Brunette puts on a fancy store-bought dress and suddenly thinks she's better than the rest of us.
5-female_must_strip,target:daisy,targetStage:0=interested,So, "Princesses" are like rulers, right?  So what makes <i>you</i> so special, girlie?
5-female_must_strip,target:daisy,targetStage:0=annoyed,I've never subscribed to the idea of royalty.  What, some plain-jane with a chip on her shoulder just <i>decides</i> she's better than me?
5-female_must_strip,target:daisy,targetStage:0=vain,So what if I had to steal my dress?  I'm still more beautiful than Miss Too-Big-for-her-Brooches here, with her servants and fancy title.
5-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=smug,Where'd you say you were from?  Planet <i>Korea</i>?  Well then, it seems Korea and Mejare share a fashion sense...
5-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=teasing,You're a cutie, Miss Bodysuit, if a little on the short side.  Is that just how they make women over on Planet Korea?
5-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0=vain,If only Meia were here.  She dresses just like you do, D.Va...we should find out who wears it better!
5-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0=seductive,You're an adorable little thing, D.Va!  All wrapped up in that cute bodysuit, just like a certain <i>other</i> pilot I know.
5-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=seductive,Ooh, I <i>love</i> your makeup!  Where do you get it on Earth?  I usually make a point to steal some during raids.
5-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=seductive,You're just <i>adorable</i> how you've dolled yourself up!  And you're so teenie-weenie.
5-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=excited,Omigosh, that little outfit is <i>so</i> cute!  And you might be more into makeup than even <i>I</i> am.
5-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=excited,Ooh, do they make dresses that cute in my size?  What about your makeup?  You look so adorable!
5-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, you're a cutie!  Yet surprisingly sturdy on your feet, what with all that armor.  <i>Don't bowl me right over</i>!
5-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=laughing,Hi there, darling!  You must be pretty tough to lug all that armor around.  <i>Afraid I'll stab you</i>?
5-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=seductive,What's with that armor, sweetheart?  You'd be a lot cuter without it...I know I'm a pirate, but I'd never kill someone as cute as you.
5-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=vain,Adorable hairstyle, cute face--but all that armor!  You a soldier, dear?  <i>Oh, please forgive my horrid piracy</i>!
5-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,totalMales:1-3=interested,Jeez, you're terrified.  Maybe men <i>do</i> eat women's livers.
5-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,totalMales:1-3=confused,...Are men actually anything to be afraid of?  Sure, they're big and lumbering, but they seem kind of slow.
5-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,totalMales:1-3=bored,Calm down, would you?  Yeesh.  Maybe Mejare was right about men, considering the state they've got this girl in.
5-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,totalMales:1-3=teasing,Hey, I've dealt with my fair share of male soldiers.  They're nothing to be super afraid of...too stupid.
5-female_must_strip,target:ciri,targetStage:0=smug,A <i>witcher</i>, eh?  Is that Earth dialect for witch?  Because I got called a witch for possession of Duero's sex book.
5-female_must_strip,target:ciri,targetStage:0=stretching,Is it <i>witcher</i> or <i>witch</i>?  Or, shall I say, <i>which</i> is it?
5-female_must_strip,target:ciri,targetStage:0=vain,So is a "witcher" even witchier than a witch?  I've been called a witch just for wanting to see what men have got in their pants.
5-female_must_strip,target:ciri,targetStage:0=smug,Forgive me for not being impressed with the term "witcher."  How <i>could</i> I be when all it takes for that on Mejare is a libido?
5-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=teasing,Ooh, you've got quite the set of muscles on you.  Shame Meia's not here.  She'd totally melt right in front of you!
5-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=seductive,Check out those legs, hot stuff!  You look like you could lift up the whole table with those things alone--good thing Meia's not here to fawn over you.
5-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=seductive,Omigosh, you should meet Meia, my boss--she's really icy, but women with muscles totally get her going.  And she'd try not to show it!
5-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, Miss Muscles, you into women?  Because my squadron leader Meia is all about exercise, and she <i>desperately</i> needs a girlfriend.
5-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_first_time_playing=laughing,Wait, wait, wait.  You've <i>never</i> played poker before?  What are you, in some religious cult or something?
5-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_first_time_playing=smug,You poor, poor thing.  Never played poker before...what a way to start.
5-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_first_time_playing=laughing,You've <i>never</i> played poker before?  Oh, dear...well, I'll be sure to show you the ropes, sweetie.
5-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_first_time_playing=seductive,Your first time ever, huh?  I'm afraid you picked a hell of a game to start with...but you're a cute little thing, so don't be embarrassed.
5-female_must_strip,target:chica,targetStage:0=confused,...You know, I was shown films as a girl about how men were horrible monsters.  You're about what they looked like in those.
5-female_must_strip,target:chica,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>Ew</i>!  <i>Eek</i>!  <i>G-get away</i>!  <i>Stop</i>!  <i>What are you</i>?
5-female_must_strip,target:chica,targetStage:0=annoyed,...I really came here to meet some Earth women.  Not...whatever <i>this</i> is supposed to be.  Besides terrifying.
5-female_must_strip,target:chica,targetStage:0=angry,...What the hell am I looking at?  I wanted some cute girls, not a--a mechanical monstrosity!
5-female_must_strip,target:chica,targetStage:0=bored,You're a <i>robot</i>?  So like, you're Pyoro if he were designed by a blind woman?
5-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_playing_with_boys=smug,Oh, don't worry about men so much.  They're too clumsy and oafish to make use of all that strength.
5-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_playing_with_boys,marker:nagisa-tubes=interested,I really thought Earth women would be pretty comfortable around men.  Don't you have them shove their tubes into you on a regular basis?
5-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_playing_with_boys=interested,Aren't you used to men ogling and clawing at you?  I thought Earth women do that with them all the time.
5-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_playing_with_boys=stretching,You're so damn shy around these men.  Listen, I fight a whole planet of the toughest men around.  They're all talk.
5-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0=smug,You know, I'd call Meia the strong, silent type...but she still speaks <i>occasionally</i>.
5-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0=laughing,Slow on the uptake?  The "strong, silent type" doesn't mean <i>literally</i> never speaking, you know.
5-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0=vain,Oh, don't feel bad.  I know you're speechless at the sight of me--but I'll do enough talking for both of us!
5-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0=teasing,Stunned into speechlessness?  I'm flattered, but really, honey, you can talk to me.  I won't mind.
5-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, Chell.  If I'm the most gorgeous woman you've ever met, don't say anything.
5-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:0=stretching,And they say <i>men</i> are tall!  You're enough woman for the whole table, sweetie.
5-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:0=smug,You said you don't get out much?  Guess men like short women...that makes things awkward for me.
5-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:0=smug,You know, I tend to turn heads with my height alone.  Better not invite <i>you</i> to the ship, or you'll steal my thunder.
5-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:0=seductive,From what I know of men, you're as tall as one...and built like them, too.  Don't worry, you wear it well--so does Gascogne!
5-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:0=teasing,Hibiki's a teenie-weenie man I know.  I guess you represent the opposite end of the spectrum on both counts.
5-female_must_strip,target:chara,targetStage:0=bored,<i>Yeesh</i>.  Being as beautiful as I am, I try to let other girls down easy, but...you're hard to look at.
5-female_must_strip,target:chara,targetStage:0=angry,...<i>Ew</i>.  I really can't tell where your face begins and your body ends.
5-female_must_strip,target:chara,targetStage:0=smug,...It's times like these that I <i>really</i> appreciate how fortunate I am to be born this beautiful.  Take a look at the alternative.
5-female_must_strip,target:chara,targetStage:0=annoyed,As if you weren't ugly enough, you've got this horrible look in your eyes.  What's your problem?
5-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>Well, howdy, pardner, how d'ya</i>--do...
5-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:0=shocked,What are you lugging that big men's gun around for--<i>ack</i>!
5-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:0=shocked,Well, aren't <i>you</i> spunky!  You even brought a model g--<i>eek</i>!
5-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:0=shocked,Uh...where are you pointing that thing?  Are you--wait--<i>eek!  Don't</i>!
5-female_must_strip,target:calisto,targetStage:0=interested,What's up, Miss Pantsuit?  You sure laugh a lot for someone dressed so prim-and-proper.
5-female_must_strip,target:calisto,targetStage:0=laughing,You some kind of businesswoman, Miss Yuck-it-up?  How could such an esteemed professional be so <i>depraved</i> as to play this?
5-female_must_strip,target:calisto,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey there, Chuckles!  You look more conservative than I've ever <i>dreamed</i> of being...and yet here you are, stripping with me.
5-female_must_strip,target:calisto,targetStage:0=teasing,Something funny, Miss Formalwear?  Make sure this nasty pirate doesn't put a ransom on your very professional head.
5-female_must_strip,target:buffy,targetStage:0=confused,Do you seriously fight those "vampire" things?  I mean, you just don't look all that imposing.
5-female_must_strip,target:buffy,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, you're kind of cute!  Is that how you kill "vampires"?  Just making them let their guard down with your adorable face?
5-female_must_strip,target:buffy,targetStage:0=confused,So what's it take to kill these "vampires"?  Can't you just get the military to shoot them or something?  You don't seem all that special.
5-female_must_strip,target:buffy,targetStage:0=smug,For a girl called "Buffy," you sure seem awful willowy.  You <i>do</i> have a cute face, so maybe that's your strategy for killing those vampire things.
5-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1=excited,Ooh!  Ooh!  Are you doing it again?  Do it again!
5-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1=excited,Ooh, Aimee's turn!  Show us that trick again!
5-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1=excited,Aimee!  You're so cool!  How do you shoot like that?  Do that trick again!
5-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1=excited,Give us a <i>show</i>, girl!  That last time was incredible!
5-female_must_strip,target:blake_v4,targetStage:0=laughing,Way to go and expose your entire midriff there, Blake.  Who do you think you are, Dita?  <i>Me</i>?
5-female_must_strip,target:blake_v4,targetStage:0=interested,Nice vest you're rocking there, honey.  But you forgot to cover up your midsection...like me.
5-female_must_strip,target:blake_v4,targetStage:0=smug,Taking a few fashion tips from <i>me</i>, are you, Blake?  What with that midriff fully on display and all.
5-female_must_strip,target:blake_v4,targetStage:0=teasing,Well, aren't <i>you</i> looking more exposed than usual?  But as far as exposure goes, the midsection's a good choice.
5-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=seductive,Is that so?  Well, Ami, you've <i>got</i> to let me know how to become an Earth model.  I'm a bit of an outlaw on Mejare, after all.
5-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Thanks for the tip, Meia.  Leave it to you to gather a little intel on our friends here...how's life as an Earth model, honey?
5-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,Ooh, she's a <i>model</i>?  <i>Now</i> I'm curious...that was always my dream job, after all.
5-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:3=confused,This is so freaky to me, and I've dealt with the Paksis's weird energy.  Do you just swtich all the time?
5-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:3=confused,Are you really bouncing back and forth like this all the time?  Like, do you have any friends?
5-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:3=confused,Must be hard getting to know anyone when you keep losing your memory.  How do you deal with always switching?
5-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:3=confused,I can't believe you have split personalities.  Where does the other one go?  How do you make friends?
5-female_must_strip,target:kim,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, nice and simple fashion is always a treat to see.  I have a crewmate who bares her stomach just like you do!
5-female_must_strip,target:kim,targetStage:0=laughing,Hey, girlie.  I hope your stomach isn't feeling too vulnerable, all exposed next to the alien lady's rapier.
5-female_must_strip,target:kim,targetStage:0=teasing,Feeling confident, dear?  With a name like Pissible and a belly that vulnerable, you <i>must</i>.
5-female_must_strip,target:kim,targetStage:0=teasing,<i>Save the world</i>, huh?  Well, dearie, you and your little midriff should know I'm not <i>from</i> this world.
5-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:5=teasing,Don't stop now, honey!  I hope I'm not imposing...but I'd <i>love</i> to hear some more French!
5-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:5=seductive,Your language is the absolute <i>coolest</i>, darling!  Say some more for me, if you don't mind...I hope I'm not being a burden.
5-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:5=teasing,I'm not demanding too much of you, am I, Marinette?  I just <i>love</i> your language...and this should take your mind off stripping.
5-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:5=vain,Normally I'm interested in women's tongues for <i>other</i> reasons...but with you, I can't get over how cool your language is!
5-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:5=seductive,I think I'm jealous, Marinette!  Not only are you the <i>cutest</i> little blueberry muffin of a girl, but your language is to <i>die</i> for!
5-female_must_strip,target:marceline,targetStage:0=bored,...Is someone playing a Halloween prank on me?  Where are your eyes?  How are you floating?  <i>Earth</i>...
5-female_must_strip,target:marceline,targetStage:0=confused,Don't get me wrong, Mejare has Halloween just like Earth...but we just dress up.  That doesn't look like a costume.
5-female_must_strip,target:marceline,targetStage:0=confused,...OK, it's hard to comment on what's weird about you when there's so much to choose from.  Do I start with your floating or your eyes?
5-female_must_strip,target:marceline,targetStage:0=confused,...Is this Earth?  Did I get the right planet?  Because you like even more alien that I do, with that skin...and no eyes.
5-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:6=bored,The storm is almost over...or maybe this is just the calm before it.
5-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:6=bored,I think I'd prefer the <i>Harvest's</i> company at this point.
5-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:6=bored,Oh, you're still here.  Why not just strip more than one thing at a time?  Well, too late.
5-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:6=bored,I still don't know who made you wait this long to show what you wanted.
5-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:3=confused,Hey, what were those noises you made before?  Didn't sound like the common language...
5-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:3=confused,...What's the name of that language you keep slipping into, anyway?  Some sort of Earth code-talk?  I only speak the common one...
5-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:3=vain,Bilingualism is so impressive, Marinette!  I only speak the common language...I don't even know Mejarians' codespeak.
5-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:3=seductive,So you speak the common language, but also this other one?  What's it called?  Because it sounds so <i>cute</i>!
5-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=laughing,Ooh, a <i>lady</i> doctor!  The Nirvana's only doctor is a man--I wonder if he'd lose his cool with you gunning for his spot.
5-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=vain,Honestly, I'm torn!  You're a cute woman doctor--and <i>blonde</i>!  But our ship's doctor is a man with rather nice hair himself.
5-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=teasing,Ooh, a doctor from Earth!  I bet that makes you an <i>expert</i> on male sexuality, doesn't it?
5-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, a woman doctor is <i>just</i> what I've been looking for!  Think you could help me and Barnette get pregnant?
5-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=vain,Female <i>and</i> blonde...if only Duero were blond, then he'd be the perfect doctor for me.  So <i>handsome</i>...
5-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, Miss Medicine.  Since you're from Earth, I might have a few questions about men's tubes tonight.
5-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=stretching,...Yeah, we're gonna be here a while.  This girl's dressed for the vacuum of space.
5-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=interested,Does it really get that cold on Earth?  Or <i>anywhere</i>, for that matter?
5-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=interested,You're from Planet China, is that right?  Must be one big snowball if <i>that's</i> in vogue over there.
5-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=laughing,I understand why you must be so cold.  Your name is pretty close to <i>Meia</i>, after all.
5-female_must_strip,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0=laughing,Judging by that sword, you're not from Earth either, Miss Crystal.  Where can I get one of those?
5-female_must_strip,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0=smug,Don't ask me why that thing is <i>drawn</i>, but damn if it isn't more impressive than my silly little rapier.  Got any extras?
5-female_must_strip,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, I like the look of that glowing sword!  Even <i>Mejare</i> hasn't though to put its lasers in blades yet.
5-female_must_strip,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0=smug,I could do for an upgrade on this rapier--would you please refer me to the planet where they make those glowing swords?
5-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=vain,Hel-<i>looo, camera</i>!  Over here, sweetie--get whatever angle you like best.
5-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=vain,Omigosh, you brought a <i>camera</i>?  A sign from the heavens!  Now all of Earth will get to see my beautiful naked body!
5-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=teasing,Looking to get some photographs of the exotic alien woman, were you?  But now you've got a whole <i>different</i> reason to capture me.
5-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=vain,Go right ahead with that camera, dearie.  It's always been shameful how I've been in the media for piracy instead of beauty.
5-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:0=interested,What's up, Ocean Girl?  You seem awfully eager.  Does being around men tend to hypersexualize a woman?
5-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:0=smug,Jeez, it didn't take a loss for you to start piping up about stripping.  You don't need a <i>game</i> to do that, you know.
5-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:0=interested,And here we have Miss Eager-Beaver.  You don't look like you have the assets to be all excited about stripping, sweetheart.
5-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:0=stretching,At least you're confident about nudity.  But are you seriously just losing on purpose?  <i>Earth girls</i>...
5-female_must_strip,target:meg,targetStage:0=vain,What's with the hat, honey?  Take it off and let your hair run wild, like any woman's should!
5-female_must_strip,target:meg,targetStage:0=smug,Matting your lovely hair under a hat like that...even if you <i>do</i> run all the time, I just can't understand.
5-female_must_strip,target:meg,targetStage:0=smug,A <i>killer</i>, you said?  The only killer here is what that hat's doing to your hair.
5-female_must_strip,target:meg,targetStage:0=teasing,Check out Miss Exercise over here.  There's no running from <i>this</i> game...so drop the hat and let your hair breathe a while.
5-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0=excited,Ooh, an Earth woman with green hair!  My girlfriend Barnette has green hair...and she is the <i>cutest</i> thing!
5-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, I didn't know Earth women could have green hair!  I've always considered it the most cutely exotic thing about Barnette.
5-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0=seductive,A sword <i>and</i> lovely green hair?  You must be a sign that Barnette and I are ready for children, sweetie.
5-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0=teasing,Ooh, green hair on a woman never fails to get me going.  But don't worry, my verdantly-colored girlfriend can handle the rest.
5-female_must_strip,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=laughing,And I thought <i>I</i> was trying to be seductive!  Here comes Miss Succubus, decked out in her Halloween costume.
5-female_must_strip,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=smug,Don't think you're slipping that past me, honey.  We have Halloween on Mejare...and I've dressed as a succubus before, yes.
5-female_must_strip,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=interested,Nice costume, Miss Seductress.  Looks like I have competition for all my man-hunting tonight.
5-female_must_strip,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=teasing,Mejare has stories of succubi, too...they really know how to tire a woman out.  I guess you must have a lot of fun with men here.
5-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=stretching,Ooh, I know a girl named Misty!  She's this cute little thing from Pluto--barely has any breasts at all!  Must be cold there.
5-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=smug,Why, the Nirvana has a young girl named Misty aboard!  Being from Pluto, she knew her way around men better than any of us.
5-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=seductive,You're not the first Misty I've come to know, actually.  A teenie-weenie Plutonian girl we have is called the same thing!
5-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=stretching,I don't think they have your <i>poker</i>-mon things on Pluto...but they do have girls named Misty.
5-female_must_strip,target:may,targetStage:0=smug,What'd you say you did?  Train in poker?  Well, it didn't save you <i>that</i> hand...unless they're animals or something.
5-female_must_strip,target:may,targetStage:0=stretching,So, you're all about <i>poker</i>-mon, was it?  Well, seems you've been training all your life for this game...
5-female_must_strip,target:may,targetStage:0=frustrated,These <i>pokuhmon</i> things just sound like more trouble than they're worth.  Animals in Mejarian zoos are so <i>dirty</i>!
5-female_must_strip,target:may,targetStage:0=confused,You're an animal trainer, isn't that right?  Or was it <i>poker</i>...mons?  Not following the Earth slang here.
5-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:4=excited,Forget the common language, Marinette, your "French" sounds like the most <i>romantic</i> thing!  You've <i>got</i> to say some more.
5-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:4=excited,<i>Oooh, Marinette</i>!  Can you say some more "French"?  My heart beats faster every time your tongue slips!
5-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:4=seductive,You should say some more French, Marinette!  It's got the <i>silkiest</i> sound to it--it makes my heart go wild!
5-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:4=seductive,Oooh, Marinette, since it's your turn, can you throw out some more of this "French"?  It sounds like a <i>lover's</i> language.
5-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:3=bored,Is there a doctor in the building?  One specializing in mental health?
5-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:3=frustrated,...This isn't funny anymore.  Now I'm just worried about you.
5-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:3=frustrated,...This is getting old.  <i>I'm</i> getting old listening to this.
5-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:3=annoyed,What a surprise.  Intentionally throwing the game tends to make you lose.
5-female_must_strip,target:lux,targetStage:0=laughing,A covert agent, eh?  I guess if an alien woman knows that, you've already failed at your job.
5-female_must_strip,target:lux,targetStage:0=teasing,So what are you so <i>covert</i> about, Miss Agent?  We pirates just charge in and gun the place down before they know what hit them!
5-female_must_strip,target:lux,targetStage:0=interested,What kind of covert agent fights with light?  You know, the thing that makes your position <i>clearer</i>?
5-female_must_strip,target:lux,targetStage:0=smug,Oho--we've got an <i>agent</i> on our hands.  Wouldn't be the first we had on our ship--and we made her come around to our side.
5-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0=excited,Omigosh!  <i>Omigosh</i>!  You are just the <i>cutest</i> little thing, Nagisa!  You're practically a little girl--who forced you to be here?
5-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0=seductive,<i>Ohhhh</i>, you're the most adorable little cinnamon roll of a girl, Nagisa!  Who rolled you in sugar before forcing you to come here?
5-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0=seductive,<i>You're such a sweet little thing, Nagisa</i>!  My heart melts every time you stammer.  Did you lose a bet to be here?
5-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0=seductive,How'd this sugary-sweet cutie in a school uniform end up in this seedy place?  I just want to <i>squeeze</i> you, not strip you!
5-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0=seductive,And I thought Earth girls were cold-blooded organ harvesters.  You couldn't harvest a <i>plant</i>, cutie!  How'd you get here?
5-female_must_strip,target:neo,targetStage:0=laughing,My, you Earth girls have so much on your minds!  And it's apparently content to stay there.
5-female_must_strip,target:neo,targetStage:0=interested,So, Miss Motormouth, how's life?  Or the weather?  Or your family?  Or <i>anything</i>?
5-female_must_strip,target:neo,targetStage:0=teasing,I guess you're too tiny to fit a voice box in the model.  Don't feel bad--you're quite expressive, dear.
5-female_must_strip,target:neo,targetStage:0=vain,I guess I'm doing enough talking for the both of us.  And hey--that adorable two-toned hair is a statement unto itself!
5-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=smug,Jeez, what a head case.  Good thing she's got her girlfriend here to keep her in check.
5-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=interested,Running, running, running.  We're not trying to kill you here, you know.
5-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=teasing,Time for take two, everyone.  Better than the first, perhaps?
5-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=seductive,And <i>there she goes</i>.  Poor little thing, beaten down by the world.
5-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:5=shocked,Bless you--<i>oh no</i>.
5-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:5=shocked,Who sneezed--<i>eep!  N-not Launch</i>!
5-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:5=shocked,<i>Ack!  Why'd you have to sneeze again</i>?
5-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:5=shocked,<i>Eek!  N-not again!  My heart can't take this</i>!
5-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=seductive,Hey there, Miss Star-Student!  That's a school uniform, right?  What do they teach you on Earth?
5-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=teasing,Check out the uniformed student type!  I was never good in school--but what is it they teach you on Earth, huh?
5-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=vain,Mejare's schools are nothing but <i>men this, violence that</i>, with a little math.  How does your fancy Earth education compare?
5-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=vain,A student, huh?  Do they teach you anything interesting on Earth?  I was never a brainiac, but I still rose to be a pilot!
5-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, an Earth girl still in school!  Have they taught you anything about men?  What do they teach you in general?
5-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, cutie!  You look like you've got some kind of rank to your name, with that beret--care to share any details?
5-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, you're not a bad looker, Earth-girl!  I like that exotic purple hair.  What is it you do, exactly?
5-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0=seductive,Tell me more about your exciting "NERV" job, Miss Military.  I want to know <i>all about</i> Earth!
5-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0=teasing,Ohoho--a <i>military</i> woman.  Well, indulge this filthy pirate scum and share what it is you do all day.
5-female_must_strip,target:mia,targetStage:0=vain,<i>My, my</i>!  You work in the <i>law</i>?  This old pirate better be careful around you.
5-female_must_strip,target:mia,targetStage:0=teasing,So you do something with the law, huh?  Think you could defend my murderous pirate self in a courtroom?
5-female_must_strip,target:mia,targetStage:0=vain,So what's a "lawyer" do all day?  Pushing papers around sounds dreadfully boring when you're a daredevil star pilot.
5-female_must_strip,target:mia,targetStage:0=laughing,I see you're quite well-endowed there, Miss Magistrate.  Is that how you win people over in your legal arguments?
5-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:2=interested,Honey, you'd be better off putting some meat on your bones than trying desperately to show them off.
5-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:2=bored,Sweetie, you're a twig.  This is just unhealthy...as unhealthy as you look.
5-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:2=confused,Are you suffering from this "anorexia" I keep reading about?  Eating disorders?  Do men do this to you?
5-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:2=vain,Talk about needing a girlfriend.  See what happens when you're never validated?
5-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:4=bored,...Maybe I should stop hitting on men.  Look what it does to you...
5-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:4=annoyed,Is this really what Earth women are like?  She's an outlier, right?
5-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:4=frustrated,Seems running the Harvest has a tendency to scramble Earth women's brains...and make them want to play poker.
5-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:4=bored,...At least she's losing quickly.  Easy to do when you barely check the cards.
5-female_must_strip,target:mileena,targetStage:0=smug,...OK, no one here has any right to call me skimpily-dressed with Bandages here running around.
5-female_must_strip,target:mileena,targetStage:0=stretching,What kind of sex-crazed planet considers that street clothes?  And here I thought Earth was conservative.
5-female_must_strip,target:mileena,targetStage:0=laughing,...Seems I've walking into a game that is well in progress.  Poor thing has been losing so badly!
5-female_must_strip,target:mileena,targetStage:0=laughing,Jeez.  I'm a <i>pirate</i>, and I can afford more clothing than you.  Too bad there's no money involved here.
5-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=confused,...You're not from Earth either, are you?  ...Or human.  Or cute.
5-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=confused,Say, Miss, I couldn't help but notice your...eye.  What planet are you from, exactly?
5-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=awkward,And here I thought I'd be seeing some <i>Earth</i> women in this place...or that I'd be the most exotic one.
5-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=laughing,Always nice to look a woman in the eye.  Singular.
5-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=smug,I guess they don't value depth perception on whatever planet you're from.  You must be a real steal.
5-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=interested,Magno Vivan's pirates accept all women...but with depth perception like yours, you wouldn't make it as a pilot.
5-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:1=shocked,What's next, Ocean Girl?  You shir--<i>I was kidding</i>!
5-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:1=shocked,I imagine the shirt is ne--<i>wait, no, I was just joking</i>!
5-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:1=annoyed,...You're not serious?  I'm telling you, you have to <i>tease</i> a little!
5-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:1=bored,...Ocean Girl's a total idiot.  Just stripping nude right off the bat...way to miss the point.
5-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:5=frustrated,Oh God, she's finally doing it.  Be very afraid...unless you Earth people are used to this sort of thing.
5-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:5=frustrated,Please don't.  I've learned my lesson.  I'll stay on Mejare.
5-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:5=bored,I'm really appreciating Mejare right now.  Maybe I'll straighten up and get a normal job.
5-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:5=frustrated,This is the last time I come to Earth.  Even among Mejarian pirate scum, none of us act like this.
5-female_must_strip,target:lilith,targetStage:0=vain,Planet <i>Pandora</i>, was it?  What a lovely name!  I might have to retire there with my darling Barnette when we're older.
5-female_must_strip,target:lilith,targetStage:0=vain,Pandora sounds like such a <i>gorgeous</i> name.  I think I'll call my first daughter that--surely Barnette won't mind.
5-female_must_strip,target:lilith,targetStage:0=teasing,Barnette and I are <i>always</i> discussing baby names.  Pandora sounds positively wonderful!
5-female_must_strip,target:lilith,targetStage:0=teasing,A hunter, eh?  And what do hunters hunt on lovely little Pandora--a cute name, by the way.
5-female_must_strip,target:navi,targetStage:0=laughing,...Yeah, I can see why you'd be comfortable here.  We'd need a computer scan to find your vagina.
5-female_must_strip,target:navi,targetStage:0=interested,You know, I tease Earth girls about growing up all small, but <i>wow</i>.  Now I just feel bad.
5-female_must_strip,target:navi,targetStage:0=smug,At least you've got those wings to buzz around to <i>our</i> height.  Inferiority complex, sweetie?
5-female_must_strip,target:navi,targetStage:0=bored,Well, there goes any chance of getting a <i>good look</i> at what Earth girls have got.  You <i>are</i> from Earth, right?
5-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0=seductive,Well, hi there, Miss Accent!  That is just the <i>cutest</i> polka-dot bodysuit you have on!
5-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0=seductive,Omigosh, your funny accent is so <i>cute</i>!  It matches your goofy polka-dotted suit.
5-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0=laughing,Well, aren't <i>you</i> the most adorable thing!  All dolled up in polka dots, stumbling over your words!  I could just <i>gobble you up</i>!
5-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0=seductive,That's a pretty darling suit, sweetie, with all the polka dots.  And the way you trip over your words just makes me <i>melt</i>!

-3-male_human_must_strip=teasing,Hey, ~player~.  Watch the cards, why don't you?
-3-male_human_must_strip=interested,Just <i>what</i> am I gonna do with you?  Can't even focus with a nude woman around.
-3-male_human_must_strip=teasing,Eyes on the prize, ~player~.  You know, me.
-3-male_human_must_strip=laughing,Hey, I've handled tougher men than you.  Soldiers are bred pretty strong on Tarak, and their guns make such a racket.
-3-male_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=seductive,<i>Hoo</i>...my life flashed before my eyes for a moment there.  My sex life, that is.
-3-male_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=vain,I was actually worried for a second there.  But then I remembered I could actually stand to relieve some tension...and now I'm all pent-up.
-3-male_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=teasing,All I had was a high card...but apparently it was <i>high enough</i>.
-3-male_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=seductive,Come on, all I had was a <i>high card</i>!  Aren't you going to finish me off, ~player~?
-3-male_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=seductive-2,Can't believe a <i>man</i> has been hogging all my luck.  Look how I'm forced to stand because of cruel fortune!
-3-male_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=interested,There's just no shaking an Earth man, is there?  I guess you're all too used to naked women.
-3-male_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=smug,Perhaps my mistake in this distraction plan was thinking a nude woman was anything noteworthy to an Earth man...even one as beautiful as me.
-3-male_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=teasing,Finally caught your eye to break the streak, did I?  I knew the hair would finally wake up that mysterious libido of yours.
-3-male_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=laughing,You know, I'm offended.  My beautiful outfit should have been more distracting than my <i>body</i>!
-3-male_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=teasing,I just <i>knew</i> flipping my hair back would get to you.  Can't focus anymore, Mr. Manly-Man?
-3-male_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=laughing,Trouble focusing?  Yeah, my hair is my <i>super</i>-secret weapon.
-3-male_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=teasing,It's OK to be overwhelmed, ~player~.  After a lifetime of boring Earth women, this alien woman from Mejare comes along and completely blows them out of the water.
-3-male_human_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:human,marker:human=teasing,Hey there, Handsome.  You've got a different look about you than everyone else...but I can't quite put my finger on how.
-3-male_human_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:human,marker:human=seductive,Hi, Mr. Man...I've only met a few men before, so you're <i>very</i> exotic to me.  Won't you please show me your naked body?
-3-male_human_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:human,marker:human=seductive,Hey, Darling.  You should know I come from a planet of <i>all</i> women...so you being a man makes me interested already.
-3-male_human_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:human,marker:human=seductive,Is that you, ~player~?  You haven't said much so far...but you should know how exotic men are to me, and how much I want to learn about them.
-3-male_human_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:human,marker:human=seductive,You'll show me a good time, won't you, Handsome?  <i>I'm looking for a strong, healthy man to give me a baby, you know</i>.
-3-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=teasing,So, not to call you a harlot or anything, Misato, but you seem <i>awful</i> interested in these men...so am I.  How do you Earth girls get their attention?
-3-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=confused,Ooh, you seem pretty confident around these Earth men, Misato.  From one woman to another, what's the secret to getting their attention?
-3-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=confused,You seem to be doing a better job flirting with these Earth men, Misato.  Am I doing something wrong?  I always seem to scare them!
-3-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=confused,Men just run away from me, usually...I thought they <i>like</i> being flirted with.  Misato, you seem to get them!
-3-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rinkah,count-meia:1,count-corrin_f:1=smug,Hey, don't be rude to our little male friend here.  He's probably scared half to death, being around all these gorgeous women.
-3-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rinkah,count-meia:1,count-corrin_f:1=laughing,Now, now, Rinkah.  That's no way to treat our lone man.  His little pea-brain can only handle so much stimulus.
-3-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rinkah,count-meia:1,count-corrin_f:1=interested,Don't make fun, Rinkah.  At least he had the courage to come alone...or the stupidity.
-3-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rinkah,count-meia:1,count-corrin_f:1=smug,It's not quite that dire.  Meia isn't exactly in a good mood, since I dragged her here.
-3-male_must_strip=teasing,Hey, ~name~.  Watch the cards, why don't you?
-3-male_must_strip=interested,Just <i>what</i> am I gonna do with you?  Can't even focus with a nude woman around.
-3-male_must_strip=teasing,Eyes on the prize, ~name~.  You know, me.
-3-male_must_strip=laughing,Hey, I've handled tougher men than you.  Soldiers are bred pretty strong on Tarak, and their guns make such a racket.
-3-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=laughing,I see ~player~ has grown so desperate at the gender disparity in this game that they've turned to <i>Kool-Aid Man</i> for their fix.
-3-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=annoyed,...Listen, ~player~, I get that this game doesn't have too many men, but you're better than this.  Pick a real character.
-3-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=bored,Doesn't bode well for your opinion of me that you'd stick me with <i>this</i> idiot, ~player~.
-3-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=awkward,...<i>Kool-Aid Man</i>, huh, ~player~?  That's...your choice?  Are you sure?
-3-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=frustrated,<i>Kool-Aid Man</i>?  ...Do I <i>have</i> to keep playing?  If ~player~'s not gonna take this seriously, why should I?
-3-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=interested,You're really starved for some male players, aren't you, ~player~?  Couldn't you pick, I don't know, Pit?  9S?  Come on.
-3-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=annoyed,...What the hell am I looking at?  Forget playing against, just...<i>looking at</i>.
-3-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=bored,...My beauty deserves better tablemates than this.
-3-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=vain,On the female side of things, we have the most beautiful woman on the roster.  And on the male side of things, well...well.
-3-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:2=smug,Hey, so what's with those "Neighbors" you keep talking about?  I mean, Mejare certainly doesn't get along with <i>its</i> neighbors.
-3-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:2=seductive,Hey, Handsome, when you say you fight Neighbors, how big a scale are we talking?  Let's just say neighboring planet Tarak isn't our best friend.
-3-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:2=interested,Who are these "Neighbors" you say you fight?  Is this like a front-lawn kind of dispute, or do you mean as a solider?
-3-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:2=interested,Did you say you fight neighbors, darling?  Mejarians usually fight their neighbors over gardening, unless we're talking planets.
-3-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:0=interested,So are you, uh, going to produce actual <i>words</i> at some point?  Or is grunting and yelling all I can expect from a man?
-3-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:0=smug,...I mean, I tease men about being stupid, but <i>did</i> think they were capable of <i>speech</i>.
-3-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:0=laughing,...It would seem men haven't quite evolved up to the point of grasping language.  What a shame.
-3-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:0=laughing,...You're really showing me new lows for male intelligence, Link.  Grunt again if you agree.
-3-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena,count-meia:1=teasing,You <i>work</i> for this woman, Pit?  Look at that, Meia...it must be <i>Take-Your-Boss-to-Strip</i> Day.
-3-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena,count-meia:1=smug,Oh, wow, this woman is your boss?  I guess I have no room to talk, considering I brought Miss Ice Queen along for the ride.
-3-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena,count-meia:1=teasing,Look, Meia, this cute little angel-boy brought his boss, too!  I guess he and I are both into taking our superiors down a peg.
-3-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena,count-meia:1=smug,Well, what do you know?  Pit brought this boss here too, Meia.  Only ~player~ has any sense, it seems.
-3-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=annoyed,<i>And who do we have he</i>--oh.  El Shaggy Blanco.  Great choice, ~player~.
-3-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=frustrated,...You know, I put a lot of effort into having all these lines, and then you go and stick me with El Shaggy Blanco.
-3-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=teasing,Thought I wouldn't have lines to April Fools' characters?  Well, think again, ~player~.
-3-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=vain,Everyone give ~player~ a round of applause...they figured out how to use the offline version, as you can see.
-3-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=annoyed,...I know you're proud of yourself for deciphering the offline version, ~player~, but you don't have to pick meme characters.
-3-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=smug,Excellent character selection, ~player~.  You picked a joke that stopped being funny in 2017...whenever that was in Earth years.
-3-male_must_strip,target:kira,targetStage:0=teasing,Ooh, you're a handsome one...and blond, which is even better.  I see you eyeing me up...
-3-male_must_strip,target:kira,targetStage:0=seductive,Hi there, sweetheart...what was your name again?  I forgot it when I got lost in your beautiful blond hair.
-3-male_must_strip,target:kira,targetStage:0=seductive,I wasn't sure if men could pull off blonde hair the way women do...but you're living proof.  I'll keep my eye on you...
-3-male_must_strip,target:kira,targetStage:0=seductive,Ah, <i>here's</i> what I've been looking for!  A handsome blond man.  <i>Try not to sweep me off my feet, darling</i>.
-3-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:4=shocked,<i>Eep</i>!  O-oh, you <i>can</i> talk?  B-but...why didn't you?
-3-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:4=interested,...So are you over your fear of women now?  Is that what the grunting was all about?
-3-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:4=seductive,Oh, you <i>can</i> talk.  Did my beauty make you clam up, cutie?
-3-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:4=smug,Well, that solves <i>that</i> mystery.  Come on and join us in the land of language like a civilized person.
-3-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:4=smug,Oh, good, you can talk.  I had really lost all hope for men's intelligence for a while there.
-3-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:4=shocked,<i>Ack</i>!  Wha--o-oh, you're done screaming!  Uh...OK.
-3-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, hey, hey--check out <i>this</i> handsome stud!  What brings <i>you</i> here, Mr. Cool-and-Casual?
-3-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:0=teasing,You look like you're right at home, Mr. Lackadaisical.  You know what I like in my men?  <i>Handsomeness</i>...like yours.
-3-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:0=seductive,Hey, Jacket-and-Pants.  You look a little sleepy, but I can't deny how you're making my heart beat faster.  What's your story?
-3-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:0=seductive,I can't take my eyes off you, handsome, even if <i>yours</i> seem a little sleepy.  Mind telling me about yourself?
-3-male_must_strip,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:0=confused,So "gay" is the Earth word for how Tarakkians live?  Actually, I'm not sure they even form couples there...
-3-male_must_strip,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:0=smug,A man loving other men?  Well, if women can do it, I suppose men can...not that I really picture men capable of love.
-3-male_must_strip,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:0=interested,Is this what man-on-man love does to your appearance?  Because you're a scary-looking customer.
-3-male_must_strip,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:0=confused,You know, they taught me as a girl that men were monsters...you fit the part.  And apparently you don't like women, is that right?
-3-male_must_strip,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:0=interested,If "gay" means what I think it does, I guess teasing you isn't going to get me anywhere...not that I <i>want</i> to see you naked.
-3-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=seductive,Well, aren't <i>you</i> cute!  And you're dressed in all that fancy armor.  What's your name, girlie?
-3-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=seductive,You are just the most <i>adorable</i> thing, even in all that heavy armor.  Can't you take it off and show us what an Earth woman looks like?
-3-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,You're cute, dear!  Look, Meia, she even cut her hair short like you do!  Must be big on practicality, too.
-3-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,A woman in armor?  Meia, this girl is trying to get on your good side...matching outfits like that.
-3-male_must_strip,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=confused,Well, now!  There's bizarre specimens, and then there's you.  Are you a man or a woman?
-3-male_must_strip,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=confused,I can't really pin down your sex, to be honest...or your species, for that matter.
-3-male_must_strip,target:mettaton,targetStage:0,marker:fama_and_oma=vain,Weren't you made in a lab?  So were all Mejarians before our Famas carried us!  ...But I'm not sure if you're a woman.
-3-male_must_strip,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=confused,Way to go ahead and be the ultimate test of judging men vs. women.  Gotta say, I'm stumped.
-3-male_must_strip,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=confused,...Oh, you're one of those <i>ann-drazza-nuss</i> types, right?  That's the word?
-3-male_must_strip,target:mettaton,targetStage:0,marker:fama_and_oma=confused,Mejarians get made in labs, too...but our Famas carry us.  So maybe you're a man, then?  Tarakkians are carried to term in labs...
-3-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=seductive,Omigosh, there's <i>two</i> of you girls?  Are you twins?  I heard Earth people could have matching babies called twins!
-3-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=seductive,Ohh, you two ladies are so <i>adorable</i>!  One of you even cut your hair short, just like Meia does!
-3-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=seductive,Well, what have we here?  Two cute little ladies dressed in matching armor sets?
-3-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=confused,Wait, you're <i>both</i> named Corrin?  Look, girls, I know one's hair is short, but you should really dress different.
-3-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=seductive,Well, aren't <i>you</i> cute!  And you're dressed in all that fancy armor.  What's your name, girlie?
-3-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=seductive,You are just the most <i>adorable</i> thing, even in all that heavy armor.  Can't you take it off and show us what an Earth woman looks like?
-3-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=seductive,You're cute, dear!  You've even cut your hair short like Meia does.  Women can pull that off sometimes!
-3-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=laughing,A woman in armor?  You're after Meia's own heart, you sly little thing!  Too bad she isn't here.
-3-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:5=teasing,It's now or never, Little Dungeon Bot.  Going to look me in the eyes for once?
-3-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:5=laughing,I spy with my little eye something you can still take off, Dungeon Robo.  That's because my eyes are uncovered.
-3-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:5=interested,Sure you don't want to part with that blindfold, Mr. Robo-man?  Are you aware of the alternative, darling?
-3-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:5=interested,Looks like Little Dungeon Bot is all out of dungeon items...well, except for the most striking one of all.
-3-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:1=teasing,You've got to tell me more about yourself, Pit!  You're so darn shy...and I'm so <i>curious</i>!
-3-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:1=seductive,Such a little motormouth, but it <i>alllll</i> clams up when I swing my gaze your way.  I love having this effect on cute little boys!
-3-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:1=seductive,Come on, Mr. Angel, don't be shy!  I mean, it's cute, but I want to learn more about Earth men!
-3-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:1=seductive,There's <i>so much</i> you could teach me about men, Pit...the men in my life always reject me.  And you're so nonthreatening!
-3-male_must_strip,target:caleb,targetStage:0=confused,Oh look, a child-man.  What's the word--<i>boy</i>?  Anyway, I'm not gonna strip in front of a kid.
-3-male_must_strip,target:caleb,targetStage:0=annoyed,Hey, kid, I know you're male, but can't you read?  No kids allowed.
-3-male_must_strip,target:caleb,targetStage:0=annoyed,I'm gonna ignore the cat ears for a second and focus on how you look like you're twelve.  Beat it, kid, adults are trying to have fun here.
-3-male_must_strip,target:caleb,targetStage:0=bored,...Listen, honey, we're playing a grown-up game for grown-ups.  You've got to leave...so I don't feel like a pedophile.
-3-male_must_strip,target:caleb,targetStage:0=awkward,Hibiki's just short, but you...I don't think you're an adult.  Can't be sure with men, but still...
-3-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:1=interested,<i>Pod this, data that</i>...you talk like you're a machine.  Why the formality, dear?
-3-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:1=interested,Why do you talk like you're a robot half the time, huh?  Loosen up and enjoy yourself--if men can do that, of course.
-3-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:1=interested,Hey, what's with all your formal data-mechanics babble?  You sound like you just rolled off the factory line, dearie.
-3-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:1=seductive,Are you so polite and deferent and robotlike because you're short?  Because the short man <i>I</i> know is a real fireball!
-3-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:1=laughing,Hey, darling little boy...why so mechanical in waist and taste?  I know <i>Tarakkians</i> are made in factories, but <i>sheesh</i>.
-3-male_must_strip,target:captain_america,targetStage:0=teasing,Woah, talk about <i>hunk</i>!  I want to see what those muscles can do, sweetheart.
-3-male_must_strip,target:captain_america,targetStage:0=seductive,<i>Well, now</i>!  You look like just the big ball of hunk I've been searching for, cutie.
-3-male_must_strip,target:captain_america,targetStage:0=teasing,Tall, check--muscles, check--handsome, <i>check</i>!  Looks like I've found me a winner, and he hasn't even stripped yet.
-3-male_must_strip,target:captain_america,targetStage:0=seductive,<i>Oooh</i>!  Look at <i>you</i>, handsome!  Just the sort of man I hoped to see here!
-3-male_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=seductive,<i>Hoo</i>...my life flashed before my eyes for a moment there.  My sex life, that is.
-3-male_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=vain,I was actually worried for a second there.  But then I remembered I could actually stand to relieve some tension...and now I'm all pent-up.
-3-male_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=teasing,All I had was a high card...but apparently it was <i>high enough</i>.
-3-male_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=seductive,Come on, all I had was a <i>high card</i>!  Aren't you going to finish me off, ~name~?
-3-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0=seductive,Well, what do we have here?  An adorable little cinnamon roll of a man, dressed up as an angel!
-3-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0=seductive,You are just the cutest little man I've ever seen!  Hibiki's a little smaller, but he's got too much spunk to be cute.
-3-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0=excited,Ohhh, you're so <i>cute</i>, Mr. Angel!  I could just <i>eat you up</i>!
-3-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0=teasing,What's an adorable little man like you doing here, Pit?  Sure you want to strip nude in front of these scary, hulking women?
-3-male_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=laughing,You know, I'm offended.  My beautiful outfit should have been more distracting than my <i>body</i>!
-3-male_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=teasing,I just <i>knew</i> flipping my hair back would get to you.  Can't focus anymore, Mr. Manly-Man?
-3-male_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=laughing,Trouble focusing?  Yeah, my hair is my <i>super</i>-secret weapon.
-3-male_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=teasing,It's OK to be overwhelmed, ~name~.  After a lifetime of boring Earth women, this alien woman from Mejare comes along and completely blows them out of the water.
-3-male_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=teasing,So, not to call you a harlot or anything, Misato, but you seem <i>awful</i> interested in these men...so am I.  How do you Earth girls get their attention?
-3-male_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=confused,Ooh, you seem pretty confident around these Earth men, Misato.  From one woman to another, what's the secret to getting their attention?
-3-male_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=confused,You seem to be doing a better job flirting with these Earth men, Misato.  Am I doing something wrong?  I always seem to scare them!
-3-male_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=confused,Men just run away from me, usually...I thought they <i>like</i> being flirted with.  Misato, you seem to get them!
-3-male_must_strip,target:fred,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, maybe I'll take <i>your</i> seed.  You're tall and handsome...and most importantly, you're blond.
-3-male_must_strip,target:fred,targetStage:0=teasing,What's this, now?  You solve mysteries?  Solve this, honey...whose handsome blond seed am I seriously considering taking right now?
-3-male_must_strip,target:fred,targetStage:0=laughing,Hi there, handsome blond man!  You look like you could use a woman at your side...or maybe on top of you.
-3-male_must_strip,target:fred,targetStage:0=interested,Duero might have better hair, but yours is blond...that's definitely a plus where I come from.
-3-male_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=seductive-2,Can't believe a <i>man</i> has been hogging all my luck.  Look how I'm forced to stand because of cruel fortune!
-3-male_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=interested,There's just no shaking an Earth man, is there?  I guess you're all too used to naked women.
-3-male_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=smug,Perhaps my mistake in this distraction plan was thinking a nude woman was anything noteworthy to an Earth man...even one as beautiful as me.
-3-male_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=teasing,Finally caught your eye to break the streak, did I?  I knew the hair would finally wake up that mysterious libido of yours.
-3-male_must_strip,target:xander,targetStage:0=teasing,You're friends with that <i>Buffy</i> girl, right?  Well...<i>gonna seal the deal, or what</i>?
-3-male_must_strip,target:xander,targetStage:0=interested,Well, you don't look so bad for a man.  Am I in competition with that Buffy woman?
-3-male_must_strip,target:xander,targetStage:0=teasing,Not to be too forward or anything, but I'm on the prowl for a good man...for reasons you'll know soon enough.  Interested?
-3-male_must_strip,target:xander,targetStage:0=vain,You're a pretty average-looking man.  I can live with that...but I bet they don't make women like <i>me</i> where you come from.
-3-male_must_strip,target:bi,targetStage:0=frustrated,...<i>Ew</i>.  What's wrong with your hands...and your <i>face</i>?
-3-male_must_strip,target:bi,targetStage:0=annoyed,...I've got to be honest here.  You are <i>very</i> ugly...and I hate ugly things.
-3-male_must_strip,target:bi,targetStage:0=annoyed,...Would it have killed you to wash yourself before coming here?  Or maybe not come at all?  I would've preferred that.
-3-male_must_strip,target:bi,targetStage:0=angry,...OK, <i>ew</i>.  I wouldn't collect your seed if it meant they'd make me the Grand Ma for it.
-3-male_must_strip,target:ryu,targetStage:0=laughing,Hey, hey, hey!  Talk about a hunk...and he's not even wearing much!  <i>Perfect</i>.
-3-male_must_strip,target:ryu,targetStage:0=teasing,You look like you see a lot of physical action, hot stuff...can those big muscles toss me around?
-3-male_must_strip,target:ryu,targetStage:0=laughing,A big hunk of a man with more muscles than brainpower?  Just what I've been looking for.
-3-male_must_strip,target:ryu,targetStage:0=teasing,You seem a little clueless about this game, handsome.  Don't worry...<i>I'll guide you along</i>.
-3-male_must_strip,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:0=smug,And I thought <i>I</i> was enthusiastic.  This man's blowing me out of the water.
-3-male_must_strip,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:0=interested,Talk about bringing energy to the table.  Planning on winning this thing, or just shouting about it?
-3-male_must_strip,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:0=laughing,Well, <i>someone's</i> a feisty one.  Hibiki's energetic, but you've got the body to match, hot stuff.
-3-male_must_strip,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:0=confused,You're some kind of racecar driver or something?  Seems you're permanently amped-up from it.
-3-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:2=vain,I can't get over how cute you are, honey...but seriously, what's with the angel outfit?  Men are no angels.
-3-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:2=smug,Men have always struck as more <i>beastly</i> than angelic...which is fine by me.  So why do you dress like one?
-3-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:2=confused,So, uh, I read about angels as a girl, but they were always women.  Why are you dolled-up like one, anyway?
-3-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:2=confused,Do those wings detach?  They look pretty convincing, and the rest of your angel outfit is pretty good.  Why do you have that on, anyway?
-3-male_must_strip,target:shaggy,targetStage:0=bored,Uh...you're kind of tall, I guess, but it doesn't look like you wash yourself much.  Gross.
-3-male_must_strip,target:shaggy,targetStage:0=annoyed,I know you're a man, but can't you put a <i>little</i> effort into your appearance?  You look like you just rolled out of a gutter.
-3-male_must_strip,target:shaggy,targetStage:0=smug,"Shaggy," huh?  That'd be like if my nickname were "Gorgeous."  Actually, I'll have to propose that next flight practice...
-3-male_must_strip,target:shaggy,targetStage:0=frustrated,Gangly, unshaven, all around a mess.  I'm starting to miss the clean-cut professionalism of the Tarakkian soldiers I know.
-3-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:0=laughing,Wow, a <i>blindfold</i> at a table full of strangers?  I never knew men could be so...<i>depraved</i>.
-3-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:0=interested,You're, uh, really making up for your stature with the fetish gear.  Can't look me in the eye, sweetheart?
-3-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:0=interested,I knew men could be cowardly, but damn.  Even the <i>Tarakkians</i> I know can look a woman in the eye.
-3-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:0=interested,So the blindfold's going first, right?  So you can actually read the cards from now on?
-3-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena=laughing,Wait, wait, wait.  You <i>work</i> for this woman?  Quite the little boss-employee bonding exercise.
-3-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena=interested,Oh wow, you two <i>work</i> together?  I mean, Meia's my boss, but we at least went to different tables.
-3-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena=vain,You take orders from this woman, Pit?  Men and women, working together...I see how Earth operates.
-3-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena=laughing,<i>Well, now</i>!  You work for this woman...how very, very awkward, Mr. Angel.
-3-female_human_must_strip=vain,Now, now, don't let your jealousy distract you from the game, ~player~...
-3-female_human_must_strip=laughing,Trying to match me, ~player~?  It's a little late for you to make a splash.
-3-female_human_must_strip=interested,You really should have stripped naked <i>before</i> me if you wanted to shock people.
-3-female_human_must_strip=vain,Being nude is more fun.  Don't tell me Earth girls are big prudes or something.
-3-female_human_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:human,marker:human=teasing,I come from a world of all women, so you're nothing special to me.  But you <i>are</i> very cute, so I've got my eye on you, Missy.
-3-female_human_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:human,marker:human=seductive,And who's <i>this</i> tight-lipped specimen?  "~player~"?  If you say so...<i>cutie</i>.
-3-female_human_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:human,marker:human=seductive,Yet another woman?  Like a drop in the bucket for a Mejarian...but even still, you're <i>far</i> cuter than I expected for an Earth girl.
-3-female_human_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:human,marker:human=seductive,You're a little more simply-dressed than the exotic types that seem to frequent this place, myself included.  But you sure have a cute face!
-3-female_human_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:human,marker:human=vain,And who are <i>you</i>,~player~?  You've barely said a thing...but you can admire my beauty too, if you want!
-3-female_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=vain,I have <i>lots</i> of secret weapons.  My Vandread, my breasts...and my fabulous golden hair.
-3-female_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=teasing,Thought I was all out of tricks?  I'm out of interest, but not tricks.
-3-female_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=teasing,I just <i>knew</i> flipping my hair back would finally draw your eye.  Leave these foul Earth men behind and be with women!
-3-female_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=seductive-2,Oh, ~player~, you're embarrassing me with your lustful gazes.  Earth women don't love each other the way Mejarians do!
-3-female_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=vain,Just couldn't keep your streak together when I'm like this?  Yeah, I understand.  Just take it easy and ogle away!
-3-female_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=vain,Finally broke that lucky run with my exquisite figure.  <i>Now</i> do you understand the appeal of your own sex?
-3-female_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=teasing,Knew I'd finally distract you long enough to lose.  If you think <i>I'm</i> beautiful, there's a whole pirate crew full of women almost as gorgeous...
-3-female_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=seductive,Don't fight your lust, ~player~.  I know that look in a woman's eye...a burgeoning love of curves and smoothness.
-3-female_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=seductive,<i>Hoo</i>...my life flashed before my eyes for a moment there.  My sex life, that is.
-3-female_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=vain,I was actually worried for a second there.  But then I remembered I could actually stand to relieve some tension...and now I'm all pent-up.
-3-female_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=teasing,All I had was a high card...but apparently it was <i>high enough</i>.
-3-female_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=seductive,Come on, all I had was a <i>high card</i>!  Aren't you going to finish me off, ~player~?
-3-female_must_strip=vain,Now, now, don't let your jealousy distract you from the game, ~name~.
-3-female_must_strip=laughing,Trying to match me, ~name~?  It's a little late for you to make a splash.
-3-female_must_strip=interested,You really should have stripped naked <i>before</i> me if you wanted to shock people.
-3-female_must_strip=vain,Being nude is more fun.  Don't tell me Earth girls are big prudes or something.
-3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>Well, howdy, pardner, how d'ya</i>--do...
-3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:0=shocked,What are you lugging that big men's gun around for--<i>ack</i>!
-3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:0=shocked,Well, aren't <i>you</i> spunky!  You even brought a model g--<i>eek</i>!
-3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:0=shocked,Uh...where are you pointing that thing?  Are you--wait--<i>eek!  Don't</i>!
-3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1=excited,Ooh!  Ooh!  Are you doing it again?  Do it again!
-3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1=excited,Ooh, Aimee's turn!  Show us that trick again!
-3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1=excited,Aimee!  You're so cool!  How do you shoot like that?  Do that trick again!
-3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1=excited,Give us a <i>show</i>, girl!  That last time was incredible!
-3-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0=interested,What's up, cutie?  You look a little embarrassed to be here...which is funny, considering your choice of outfit.
-3-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0=teasing,Yeah, not sure I'm buying this whole "I was tricked" act, dearie.  I mean, you <i>are</i> displaying your butt 24/7.
-3-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0=teasing,Oh, don't act all embarrassed.  You've got hips to <i>die</i> for, cutie...and they're fully on display, even now.
-3-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0=laughing,Ooh, you are just <i>adorable</i>!  Especially the way your figure is just <i>straining</i> against the bounds of that suit, <i>begging</i> to be free.
-3-female_must_strip,target:zelda,targetStage:0=interested,You know what I see when a woman calls herself "royalty"?  <i>An inferiority complex</i>, Miss Boring-Brunette.
-3-female_must_strip,target:zelda,targetStage:0=laughing,You're cute, especially as far as overhyped princesses go.  Let's see how cute you are <i>without</i> all your jewelry.
-3-female_must_strip,target:zelda,targetStage:0=laughing,You know what I think of miserable jealous girls who dress themselves up and pretend they're better than the rest of us?  ...I like stripping them.
-3-female_must_strip,target:zelda,targetStage:0=vain,Take away a princess's fancy dress and what does she have?  Hopefully a cute butt, and a pirate nearby who's earned her clothes.
-3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:4=smug,Well, I guess if you've come this far, you might as well finish the job.  Go for it.
-3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:4=seductive,I'd expect nothing less, cutie.  Be sure to wow us!
-3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:4=teasing,Might as well seal the deal, even if it's just your thong.  You can do it, honey!
-3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:4=smug,Seems we've got similar taste in underwear.  Shame you're about to shoot it right off, but at least it'll look cool.
-3-female_must_strip,target:uhura,targetStage:0=smug,Oh, don't worry, dear.  We on Mejare are well aware of Earth's space program...you <i>have</i> tried to harvest us, after all.
-3-female_must_strip,target:uhura,targetStage:0=teasing,You can call it "Star Fleet" if you want, dear, but it'll always be the Harvest to me.  <i>You nasty organ-stealers, you</i>.
-3-female_must_strip,target:uhura,targetStage:0=vain,I don't buy this whole "peaceful space travel" angle, Miss Star Fleet.  I've spent far too much time fending off your little Harvest cubes!
-3-female_must_strip,target:uhura,targetStage:0=smug,Yeah, yeah, I'm sure this "Star Fleet" is super peaceful.  Just remember I've got a Vandread...so I'm not afraid of you.
-3-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:1=vain,Should've figured Little Miss Princess would want to break away and strip for strangers.  You must be so sheltered!
-3-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:1=teasing,Oh, is it true you're a <i>princess</i>, darling?  That would explain the haughty attitude...and the phony embarrassment.
-3-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:1=teasing,I'm a pirate, dearie...and no huge fan of authority figures.  Luckily, I <i>love</i> girls who strip for fun and pleasure.
-3-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:1=interested,So you're a princess, is that it?  You should know you're not fooling me--you <i>love</i> being ogled, don't you?
-3-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:1=interested,A princess, hm?  Only makes sense that such a public figure as yourself would love exhibiting her body for total strangers.
-3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=smug,Well, guess I can say I beat you <i>once</i>.
-3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=seductive-2,You've just been toying with me, haven't you?  Pirates should just go for the kill, boss.
-3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=teasing,I'm a reasonable gal.  I'm not expecting you to strip nude too or anything.
-3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=smug,Don't be too hard on yourself.  You're being as dominant as I figured you'd be.
-3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=vain,Only when I throw random cards back does she finally lose.  Ah, the mysteries of fate...
-3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=interested,Gascogne's trained you well, it seems.  Leaving me in the dust.
-3-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:0=vain,Check out that outfit!  Going for the natural look?  So would I, if Mejare had much of nature.
-3-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:0=interested,Did you just piece that outfit together from bits you found in a forest?  It doesn't even look that bad, but...it's certainly all-natural.
-3-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:0=vain,If only Mejare had the same verdant natural resources as Earth.  Perhaps then I could try to emulate your all-natural style.
-3-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:0=vain,Mejare's a little too wasteful to have the greenery for me to dress like <i>you</i> do.  You can see how little we wear to compensate.
-3-female_must_strip,target:tina,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=teasing,Planet <i>America</i>, hm?  Never heard of it--but it seems to have produced as least one knockout!
-3-female_must_strip,target:tina,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=thinking,<i>Britain</i>, <i>Japan</i>, and now your <i>America</i>.  I'm starting to think these aren't actually planets...and Earth people are just very splintered.
-3-female_must_strip,target:tina,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=teasing,Hey, now, Miss Wrestler...this place has a <i>no-touching</i> rule, even if Planet <i>America</i> doesn't.
-3-female_must_strip,target:tina,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=vain,I don't know how they do things on Planet America, honey, but you keep your wrestling hands to yourself--I'm taken!
-3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:1=awkward,Our friends from Earth must be all confused why <i>you're</i> the one who's blushing.
-3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:1=annoyed,You're all probably wondering why Meia's blushing suddenly.  Well, it's none of your business.
-3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:1=awkward,Pull yourself together, Meia.  I'm seeing a lot of quizzical looks.
-3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:1=angry,Don't stare at her!  She's...just a little flustered, is all.
-3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:1=vain,Uh...<i>everyone look at me, please</i>!  And not Meia's odd blushing.
-3-female_must_strip,target:alpha,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=laughing,You're pale as marble, dearie!  Do they not have a sun on this "Japan" planet?
-3-female_must_strip,target:alpha,targetStage:0=confused,Are you...<i>flickering</i>?  Are you some kind of hologram?  That might explain your skin tone.
-3-female_must_strip,target:alpha,targetStage:0=confused,You OK there, sweetheart?  You look a little pale...and non-corporeal.
-3-female_must_strip,target:alpha,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=vain,And I thought <i>Mejarians</i> liked the pale look!  This "Japan" planet puts us to shame.
-3-female_must_strip,target:zoey,targetStage:0=smug,These "zombies" of yours don't sound so bad...but then, I guess you don't have a fabulous fighter spaceship, do you?
-3-female_must_strip,target:zoey,targetStage:0=stretching,See, my Vandread can shield a whole planet.  So I think we could quarantine your little zombie virus.
-3-female_must_strip,target:zoey,targetStage:0=vain,A zombie virus, eh?  Not to brag, but my Vandread helped avoid the spread of disease on a planet once...<i>I'm so talented</i>.
-3-female_must_strip,target:zoey,targetStage:0=laughing,The more you describe these "zombies," the more they just sound like men.  You sure that's not what you mean?
-3-female_must_strip,target:alice_degracia,targetStage:0=smug,Hey, hey, hey!  Check out the <i>all-purple</i> look.  That's a new one...
-3-female_must_strip,target:alice_degracia,targetStage:0=vain,Hey, honey, color <i>contrasts</i> show confidence.  Would I look nearly as stunning if this dress matched my hair?
-3-female_must_strip,target:alice_degracia,targetStage:0=smug,Purple hair's certainly got an exotic appeal...too bad mine is boring old blonde.  As for the matching outfit, I don't follow the logic.
-3-female_must_strip,target:alice_degracia,targetStage:0=teasing,Quite the exotic color scheme you've got there, sweetie.  Too bad you forgot to mix it up at all.
-3-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:0=awkward,...Are you alright there, honey?  With the knife and all?
-3-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:0=awkward,...You know, I carry the rapier mostly for fashion...maybe you could relegate that knife to the same thing?
-3-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:0=annoyed,...Could you maybe put down the knife, sweetheart?  Hey, are you listening?
-3-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:0=bored,What a weirdo...knives are just as deadly as swords, with none of the style.
-3-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:0=frustrated,Better keep my sword on hand, with <i>this</i> nutcase on the scene.
-3-female_must_strip,target:tracer,targetStage:0=teasing,All about speed, eh, girlie?  Try not to blink right out of your costume...or back to before I won, you little cheat.
-3-female_must_strip,target:tracer,targetStage:0=vain,Hey, where's <i>my</i> time travel?  Actually, there's nothing about my life I regret, so no issue.
-3-female_must_strip,target:tracer,targetStage:0=seductive,Mind if I borrow that time device, sweetie?  I want to fall in love with my Barnette <i>all over again</i>.
-3-female_must_strip,target:tracer,targetStage:0=teasing,If that thing can really travel you back in time, that's pretty fantastic.  How many times have we done this match over again, <i>loser</i>?
-3-female_must_strip,target:tracer,targetStage:0=smug,You know what I've learned as a pirate?  You only get one chance to do things right.  This time-travel business sounds like a crutch.
-3-female_must_strip,target:aiyana,targetStage:0=vain,That tan is something else, and your energy is boundless!  Most Mejarians opt for pale, as you can see...
-3-female_must_strip,target:aiyana,targetStage:0=teasing,Barnette's kind of tan like you are.  She's cute, too, so women can pull it off!
-3-female_must_strip,target:aiyana,targetStage:0=teasing,Slow down there, tiger.  That energy is going to turn you into a tan smear on the ground.
-3-female_must_strip,target:aiyana,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=confused,Tan is certainly a look on Mejare, but pale is the norm for us...where'd you say you were from?  Planet Austria?
-3-female_must_strip,target:zizou_valentine,targetStage:0=interested,Don't you have a magic spell to give yourself some clothes, little Miss Magician?
-3-female_must_strip,target:zizou_valentine,targetStage:0=interested,I must say, Zizou, I like your standard outfit better.  This is just trying too hard to make men like you.
-3-female_must_strip,target:zizou_valentine,targetStage:0=laughing,Ohh, Barnette wears just as little when she cooks for me!  It's so cute...but then, <i>she</i> has breasts.
-3-female_must_strip,target:zizou_valentine,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, Miss Magician...<i>don't wear clothes you can't fill</i>.  But definitely wear clothes in general.
-3-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:0=confused,...I had no idea Earth girls came in so many...flavors.  How'd your parents pick <i>grape</i>?
-3-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:0=confused,...So, uh, that skin color.  Am I missing something?  Is this a common look on Earth?
-3-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:0=confused,Gotta be honest, girlie, I'm out of the loop on what Earth people look like.  Is that complexion of yours...<i>normal</i>?
-3-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:0=confused,What's this about <i>ponies</i> that you keep going on about?  Is a "pony" a purple Earthling?  I'm totally lost here.
-3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:3=awkward,Uh, Aimee?  Are you sure you want to keep doing that?  You nearly got hit last time...and your targets are getting smaller.
-3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:3=shocked,Um, it's OK, Aimee!  You've been very impressive!  Just go out on top, you know?
-3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:3=awkward,...Are you sure about this, Aimee?  After...last time?  Don't kill yourself...
-3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:3=awkward,Uh--don't go all the way just for <i>my</i> sake.  What you did was cool, but, um...well, you'll be fine.
-3-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:0=seductive,Hey there, Miss Two-Tone!  I like your sense of fashion--that exposed, that hat, and those cute little boots!
-3-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, is that two-toned hair natural?  That's fancier than even <i>Mejarians</i> have come up with.
-3-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:0=interested,You seem pretty smug, honey.  Do you have a sweeter half like your hair implies?
-3-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:0=excited,Ooh, can I try on your hat when you lose it?  Or that amulet?  Can you two-tone my hair like yours?
-3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:2=seductive,I'd call you crazy for this sort of thing, but how could I when you defy death like it's nothing?
-3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:2=excited,You're just so <i>awesome</i>!  I can't get enough of this!
-3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:2=teasing,Can you do it a <i>third</i> time, hotshot?  Yeah, probably.
-3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:2=excited,I could watch you do this all day.  My heart jumps every time!
-3-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:5=smug,Call it woman's intuition, but I think our little fashion show is about to come to an end soon...
-3-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:5=interested,This has been fun, Vriska, but I don't think you can keep this up forever.  That die's got a sick sense of humor.
-3-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:5=interested,Can't you see the writing on the wall, sweetheart?  I like these outfits, but they keep getting skimpier and skimpier.
-3-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:5=laughing,Roll all you want...I think the die's in control here.  And it wants to see some blue skin.
-3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,count-meia:2=annoyed,Ugh, now there's <i>two</i> of you?  I guess ~player~ is a big fan of being rejected.
-3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,count-meia:2=angry,<i>Two</i> Meias?  Hey, I've been hitting on you this entire time!  What's <i>she</i> done besides give you the cold shoulder?
-3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,count-meia:2=annoyed,...You know, I put a lot of effort into my appearance.  Meia rolls out of bed, and <i>she's</i> the one to get two of her?
-3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,count-meia:2=angry,Hey, what's this all about, ~player~?  You really think Meia's prettier than I am?
-3-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_playing_with_boys=smug,Oh, don't worry about men so much.  They're too clumsy and oafish to make use of all that strength.
-3-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_playing_with_boys,marker:nagisa-tubes=interested,I really thought Earth women would be pretty comfortable around men.  Don't you have them shove their tubes into you on a regular basis?
-3-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_playing_with_boys=interested,Aren't you used to men ogling and clawing at you?  I thought Earth women do that with them all the time.
-3-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_playing_with_boys=stretching,You're so damn shy around these men.  Listen, I fight a whole planet of the toughest men around.  They're all talk.
-3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=vain,No jokes here, darling!  We're one hundred percent <i>alien</i>...if you define "alien" as "not from Earth."
-3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=seductive,We <i>are</i> from another planet, honey!  We're fearless Mejarian pirates...and we've come <i>all this way</i> to learn about Earth.
-3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=vain,Yep, just two exotic women from another world!  So we stuck together, since we can only trust each other around here.
-3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=teasing,We're pirates from Mejare, darling, and all we know about Earth is that men and women live together here!  Which sounds strange to us.
-3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=seductive,That's right, Elizabeth--Meia and I are from another world!  And we're stripping here--<i>that's how much we trust each other</i>.
-3-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,Mei and Meia, eh?  I hope our other guests won't mix the two of you up--both are cold in your own ways, after all.
-3-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,Look, Meia, this girl's nearly got your name.  But she smiles, so telling you two apart should be easy.
-3-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Mei and Meia?  I'd play matchmaker, but you'd be the most confusing couple of all time.
-3-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,See, Meia?  You're so sweet, this girl was nearly named after you.  Nearly.
-3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,Hey, Meia, what do you think?  Should we try to find you a bodysuit with polka dots?  Maybe force you to smile like Marinette?
-3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=interested,This girl makes bodysuits look a lot cuter than <i>you</i> do, Meia.  Must be because she smiles...or because of the polka dots.
-3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,Even with the mask on, this girl emotes much more than <i>you</i>, Meia.  Maybe a polka-dotted suit would lighten you up.
-3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,If you're not a fan of polka dots, Meia, maybe you could adopt this girl's adorable accent and actually brighten a room for once.
-3-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:2=teasing,I'm <i>waiting</i>, Vriska!  Don't disappoint me and pick some boring outfit!
-3-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:2=teasing,I'm expecting some good fashion from you, you know!  Don't leave it up to chance!
-3-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:2=smug,Don't you have some way to control that?  I'd rather you showed off something specific.
-3-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:2=teasing,Lay the fashion on me, Vriska!  Fashion from...wherever it is that you live.
-3-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, Miss Moneybags, you'd better watch out.  This pirate's got half a mind to loot you with extreme prejudice!
-3-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0=teasing,Sure you're not worried to be playing in a seedy place like this, Miss Heiress?  You might get mugged by, say, an ornery pirate.
-3-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0=interested,Nice premature white hair, Miss Heirlooms.  I guess having all that inherited money must be <i>oh-so-stressful</i> for you.
-3-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0=laughing,Looking quite adorable there, Coinstacks.  Maybe I'll help myself to the jewelry you'll undoubtedly remove first.
-3-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=interested,Look, Meia, she's just as pale, serious, and boring as you are.  Think she'd smile around Kahlua?
-3-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,Hey, Meia's standing right here.  Isn't that enough boredom for one table without <i>you</i> aping her style?
-3-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,Look at that, Meia, Earth's found a way to mass-produce you!  <i>Diabolical</i>.
-3-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,<i>Yeah, yeah, Meia, stay cocky</i>.  Oh wait, Meia's over <i>here</i>!  You two are just so similar.
-3-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,What's up, sourpuss?  You look even more miserable than a certain squadron leader I know...the one right next to us.
-3-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,Hey, lighten up, girlie.  I could have gotten this mood from playing poker with Meia back on the ship.
-3-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=stretching,<i>Yawn</i>...are you really going to be a miserable bore this whole time?  Would having <i>my</i> breasts make you feel better?
-3-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,Looks like it's Little Miss Sunshine's turn to strip.  Between you and Meia here, the energy's just through the roof.
-3-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia,marker:planet-countries=smug,Where'd you say you were from?  Planet <i>Korea</i>?  Well then, it seems Korea and Mejare share a fashion sense...
-3-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia,marker:planet-countries=teasing,You're a cutie, Miss Bodysuit, if a little on the short side.  Is that just how they make women over on Planet Korea?
-3-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Well, everyone, cards on the table.  Who wears the whole bodysuit look better--D.Va or my miserable old boss here?
-3-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,You're an adorable little thing, D.Va!  All wrapped up in that cute bodysuit, just like <i>another</i> pilot I know...who might be sitting here.
-3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:2=teasing,Your protection's gone, and it seems to have opened the floodgates.
-3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:2=seductive,Perfect!  If I know what's next, our Earth friends will get to see plenty of lovely Mejarian skin now.
-3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:2=teasing,Time for the big hitter, right, Meia?  <i>The killing shot</i>?  <i>The pale moon</i>?
-3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:2=vain,If I know Meia like I think I do, ladies, get ready for some serious skin!  Besides mine, of course.
-3-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:3=excited,Here we go again.  This is so <i>exciting</i>!  Every outfit is an adventure!
-3-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:3=excited,This is making me feel so alive!  I love checking out women's fashion!  Show some more!
-3-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:3=seductive,You're so cool, Vriska!  And maybe even a little cute!  What else have you got for me?
-3-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:3=teasing,Don't stop now, cutie!  Any more adorable outfits you've got in store for me?
-3-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:7=smug,...Yeah, we all know how <i>this</i> is ending, don't we?
-3-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:7=smug,Some women just refuse to see what's right in front of them.  It's sad, really.
-3-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:7=laughing,Well, get ready for full-blown blue nudity, everyone.
-3-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:7=smug,All the magic in the universe, and not one ounce of sense.  You poor thing.
-3-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,<i>Oh, dear</i>.  I can see where <i>this</i> is going, Ice Queen.
-3-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,<i>Flirting</i>, are we Meia?  I figured as much.  Best to let the lovebirds just figure things out on their own.
-3-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,Meia, honey, you're just setting yourself up for disappointment.  Earth girls don't like each others' bodies the way <i>we</i> do.
-3-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Ooh, you're so <i>cute</i> when a woman actually gets you going!  She'll deny it now, Chun, but Meia here is <i>totally</i> into you.
-3-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=stretching,See, Meia, I think you do the "strong, silent type" thing pretty well.  Chell here is an example of taking it too far.
-3-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,Slow on the uptake?  The "strong, silent type" doesn't mean <i>literally</i> never speaking, you know.
-3-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,Oh, don't feel bad.  I know you're speechless at the sight of me--but I'll do enough talking for both of us!
-3-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Stunned into speechlessness?  I'm flattered, but really, honey, you can talk to me.  I won't mind.
-3-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Hey, Chell.  If I'm the most gorgeous woman you've ever met, don't say anything.
-3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:3=teasing,I know I can be a little forward with my sexuality, Meia, but I haven't lost just yet.
-3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:3=teasing,Is that <i>complacency</i> I smell?  Since when does <i>Meia Gisborn</i> get complacent?
-3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:3=interested,Well, there goes your decency.  But that's OK--you enjoy showing off your body as much as I do, don't you?
-3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:3=vain,Another loss?  These Earth people are lucky--who'd have thought they'd get full views of four exotic Mejarian breasts?
-3-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:6=interested,I appreciated the fashion show, Vriska, but really, I doubt you've got fuel left in the tank.
-3-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:6=stretching,Just going to keep on trying, huh?  Give it up already.
-3-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:6=stretching,Poor girl just can't control her gambling problem.  Now she'll be nude for it.
-3-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:6=interested,And is this magically going to restock your wardrobe?  I doubt it.
-3-female_must_strip,target:arwen,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=confused,Hey, what's all this about the <i>middle</i> of Earth?  Is there a spot underground that only you elf-people get to live in?
-3-female_must_strip,target:arwen,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=confused,And I call <i>you</i> pale, Meia.  Arwen here looks almost ghostly...is that just the way elves are?
-3-female_must_strip,target:arwen,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=confused,Hey, what's up with those pointy ears?  And that pallid skin?  You're a strange one, "elf" girl.
-3-female_must_strip,target:arwen,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=confused,So you call yourself an elf, right?  Is that another word for "Earthling with crazy ears"?  Because you look human otherwise.
-3-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:4=teasing,Hey, honey...take <i>my</i> dress, and I'll love you forever.
-3-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:4=smug,Feel free to flatter me and steal my dress, dear!  It's...over there somewhere.
-3-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:4=seductive,Say, Vriska...can that die steal <i>my</i> dress?  <i>Please</i> say yes.
-3-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:4=vain,I'd <i>love</i> to see how my dress looks on someone else.  But I can't just let you try it on...so use the die.
-3-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=seductive,Is that so?  Well, Ami, you've <i>got</i> to let me know how to become an Earth model.  I'm a bit of an outlaw on Mejare, after all.
-3-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Thanks for the tip, Meia.  Leave it to you to gather a little intel on our friends here...how's life as an Earth model, honey?
-3-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,Ooh, she's a <i>model</i>?  <i>Now</i> I'm curious...that was always my dream job, after all.
-3-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=smug,Jeez, what a head case.  Good thing she's got her girlfriend here to keep her in check.
-3-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=interested,Running, running, running.  We're not trying to kill you here, you know.
-3-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=teasing,Time for take two, everyone.  Better than the first, perhaps?
-3-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=seductive,And <i>there she goes</i>.  Poor little thing, beaten down by the world.
-3-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0=smug,And here I thought I was on Earth.  Turns out we've got a woman from a frozen tundra planet, evolved for camouflage.
-3-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0=teasing,You look like you're in pretty good shape, honey.  And even better, I bet sweat blends right in to your marble complexion!
-3-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0=vain,I'll be frank--you wouldn't catch me dead exercising.  It's so much work, and look at what it's done to this poor woman's skin!
-3-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0=stretching,<i>Fitness this</i>, <i>exercise that</i>.  Why should I take advice from a woman who's apparently never seen sunlight?
-3-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:0=stretching,And they say <i>men</i> are tall!  You're enough woman for the whole table, sweetie.
-3-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:0=smug,You said you don't get out much?  Guess men like short women...that makes things awkward for me.
-3-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:0=smug,You know, I tend to turn heads with my height alone.  Better not invite <i>you</i> to the ship, or you'll steal my thunder.
-3-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:0=seductive,From what I know of men, you're as tall as one...and built like them, too.  Don't worry, you wear it well--so does Gascogne!
-3-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:0=teasing,Hibiki's a teenie-weenie man I know.  I guess you represent the opposite end of the spectrum on both counts.
-3-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:1=excited,Omigosh!  <i>Vriska</i>!  Do that thing again!  There's so much you could teach me about Earth fashion!
-3-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:1=excited,<i>Vriiiska</i>!  I love fashion!  Show me more of your Earth outfits!
-3-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:1=excited,Your wardrobe's so cool!  I only really have this dress!  You've got to show me what Earth girls wear!
-3-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:1=excited,Yes!  Vriska's turn!  Show me what else Earth women wear!  I want it all!
-3-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Ooh, look, Meia.  Another Misty.  <i>Don't go falling in love with her, now</i>!
-3-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,OK, Meia.  I know this girl's called Misty, but don't start trying to be <i>her</i> Big Sister, too.
-3-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Don't tell anyone, but...<i>Meia's got a bit of a crush on a girl named Misty</i>.  Fair warning!
-3-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=stretching,Gonna win over Meia's heart here?  You wouldn't be the first <i>Misty</i> to do it.
-3-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_first_time_playing=laughing,Wait, wait, wait.  You've <i>never</i> played poker before?  What are you, in some religious cult or something?
-3-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_first_time_playing=smug,You poor, poor thing.  Never played poker before...what a way to start.
-3-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_first_time_playing=laughing,You've <i>never</i> played poker before?  Oh, dear...well, I'll be sure to show you the ropes, sweetie.
-3-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_first_time_playing=seductive,Your first time ever, huh?  I'm afraid you picked a hell of a game to start with...but you're a cute little thing, so don't be embarrassed.
-3-female_must_strip,target:velma,targetStage:0=teasing,It's a rare woman who can pull off the glasses look, you know.  Parfet landed herself a man...how about <i>you</i>, Miss Mystery?
-3-female_must_strip,target:velma,targetStage:0=stretching,I know a glasses-wearing egghead myself...Parfet's her name, and what she looks like with them off is the <i>real</i> mystery.
-3-female_must_strip,target:velma,targetStage:0=laughing,Hey, Miss Mystery...can you solve how to make glasses look good on a woman?  Here's the answer: <i>give them to me</i>.
-3-female_must_strip,target:velma,targetStage:0=vain,So, you solve mysteries, is that right?  I guess the glasses would help there...think you could solve the mystery of this <i>alien woman</i>?
-3-female_must_strip,target:velma,targetStage:0=interested,Hey, Miss Mystery.  Push those frames up and answer a few questions...because <i>men</i> are a mystery to me.
-3-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0=interested,I was about to comment on how I love blondes, but that mechanical arm really stands out.  How'd you get it?
-3-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0=confused,It's hard to feel too awkward about you losing your arm when that thing looks like a pretty useful replacement.  Got a story to tell?
-3-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0=laughing,Check out Miss Cyborg over here!  You wear that mechanical arm quite well--<i>do Earth men find you too much to handle</i>?
-3-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0=seductive,I must say, that cold steel clashes with your fiery personality.  Talk about a two-tiered threat!
-3-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,totalMales:1-3=interested,Jeez, you're terrified.  Maybe men <i>do</i> eat women's livers.
-3-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,totalMales:1-3=confused,...Are men actually anything to be afraid of?  Sure, they're big and lumbering, but they seem kind of slow.
-3-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,totalMales:1-3=bored,Calm down, would you?  Yeesh.  Maybe Mejare was right about men, considering the state they've got this girl in.
-3-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,totalMales:1-3=teasing,Hey, I've dealt with my fair share of male soldiers.  They're nothing to be super afraid of...too stupid.
-3-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=seductive,Ooh, I <i>love</i> your makeup!  Where do you get it on Earth?  I usually make a point to steal some during raids.
-3-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=seductive,You're just <i>adorable</i> how you've dolled yourself up!  And you're so teenie-weenie.
-3-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=excited,Omigosh, that little outfit is <i>so</i> cute!  And you might be more into makeup than even <i>I</i> am.
-3-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=excited,Ooh, do they make dresses that cute in my size?  What about your makeup?  You look so adorable!
-3-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0,count-weiss_v4:1=vain,Hey, Miss Moneybags, nice wardrobe.  I'm just a poor little pirate--<i>this dress is the best I can afford</i>.
-3-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0,count-weiss_v4:1=smug,Figures Miss Princess can't go five minutes without changing her clothes.  A few months of piracy will teach you appreciate the clothes you've got.
-3-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0,count-weiss_v4:1=interested,At least you mixed up the colors a little with this new outfit, Miss Heirlooms.  What you had before was like if I wore all yellow.
-3-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0,count-weiss_v4:1=teasing,Looking cute there, Coinstacks.  Nice new outfit--gotta show off the money somehow, right?
-3-female_must_strip,target:velma_classic,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, Earth to ~player~.  There's a Velma model out now that doesn't look like a goblin.
-3-female_must_strip,target:velma_classic,targetStage:0=interested,What, you figured out the offline version but still chose <i>this</i> Velma?  How nostalgia-blinded can you get?
-3-female_must_strip,target:velma_classic,targetStage:0=interested,Hey, ~player~, it's not 2016 anymore.  There's a Velma you can play with that's actually on-model.
-3-female_must_strip,target:velma_classic,targetStage:0=laughing,Hey, ~player~, Velma Classic is just here to remember the past...not masturbate to it.
-3-female_must_strip,target:velma_classic,targetStage:0=laughing,Don't do this to yourself, ~player~--there's a better Velma now.  I mean, <i>look</i> at this one.
-3-female_must_strip,target:velma_classic,targetStage:0=vain,Hey, ~player~, Barnette might understand the appeal of antiques, but <i>I</i> say stick with the fresh and new.
-3-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0,count-ruby_v4:1=interested,Looking a little different there, Ruby.  Brighter, in fact.  Something bring up the mood where you're from?
-3-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0,count-ruby_v4:1=smug,I see you've been mixing up the colors, sweetie.  Not a bad approach, but I'm totally in love with this dress just as it is.
-3-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0,count-ruby_v4:1=stretching,Mixing up the outfits, are we?  I've cultivated a certain look with my crewmates I'd rather just maintain.
-3-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0,count-ruby_v4:1=vain,Hey, check out the new style Ruby's rocking.  Not bad, but I'm the kind of girl to just stick with what I know best!
-3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:4=smug,Well, there she goes.  My boss, ladies of Earth.  Catching up to her second-in-command.
-3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:4=seductive,Oh, Meia!  You didn't lose on purpose just to make me feel better, right?  That's so sweet of you!
-3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:4=interested,For being your second-in-command, somehow I've managed to fly even with you.
-3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:4=teasing,Can't finish me off <i>that</i> easily, boss!  You're the one who taught me, after all.
-3-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0=seductive,You know what I love more than anything in this vast universe?  A fellow blonde...especially a cute one!  And you fit the bill, fireball.
-3-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, I like your energy--and your blondeness!  My girlfriend Barnette's a real spark plug herself.
-3-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0=interested,You're a cutie, Miss Midriff--that messy blonde hair is only making me fall further in love.  Where do you get all your energy?
-3-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0=teasing,Slow down there, firecracker--you're like a burning torch with all that blonde hair flying about.  But it's definitely cute!
-3-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,count-d.va_cruiser:1=teasing,I don't even know you, girlie, but you seem dressed up for a special occasion all the same.  Feeling sexy today?
-3-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,count-d.va_cruiser:1,marker:planet-countries=seductive,Hey, cutie.  Is it a holiday on planet Korea?  Because you look different from usual.
-3-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,count-d.va_cruiser:1,marker:planet-countries=interested,This "Korea" planet of yours has got quite the range of fashion.  I <i>swear</i> I've seen you running around in something else.
-3-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,count-d.va_cruiser:1=stretching,What's up, D.Va?  That's a cute outfit--but it doesn't seem quite like your usual fare.  What's the occasion?
-3-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:0=excited,Ohhh, you're so <i>cute</i>!  Draped in a loose-fitting shirt...and those <i>pigtails</i>!  I just wanna squeeze you!
-3-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:0=excited,There's something about pigtails on a girl that just make me want to squeeze her even more...you're so <i>adorable</i>!
-3-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:0=teasing,So, honey...<i>do men like to yank on those pigtails</i>?  It's OK, you can tell me--I'm not from around here.
-3-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:0=seductive,You look like you've taken your first step into womanhood...and no more than that, with too-big clothes and adorable little pigtails!
-3-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=bored,Oh, for God's sake, Meia, don't go on a damn moral crusade.  She's kind of cute, isn't that enough?
-3-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=frustrated,We barely know her or what Earth's military is like, Meia.  Don't start with your vendettas against authority.
-3-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=bored,It wasn't Earth soldiers that shut down our living districts, Meia.  Cool it and try to have a nice time.
-3-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=frustrated,Oh, don't start ragging on the poor girl like we understand the politics of this place.  Let's just all calm down and enjoy each others' breasts.
-3-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=interested,...So it's <i>piloting</i> that really gets you going, Leader.  <i>You hopeless intellectual, you</i>.
-3-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,I <i>knew</i> you were a robot.  The only thing that makes you lighten up is another woman's skills.
-3-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=stretching,I guess I'm just shallower than you are, boss.  There you go, seeking out girlfriends on things <i>beyond</i> looks.
-3-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=stretching,Oh, thank God, you're flirting.  For a second there I was worried you really <i>were</i> sexless.
-3-female_must_strip,target:willow,targetStage:0=seductive,Tell me about these "vampires," sweetie.  Sucking blood actually sounds a little romantic!
-3-female_must_strip,target:willow,targetStage:0=interested,A computer nerd, eh?  So's Parfet--but I wouldn't trust her to handle supernatural blood-suckers.
-3-female_must_strip,target:willow,targetStage:0=vain,I know a computer nerd--Parfet's her name.  Cute little thing...and she's with a man, who we <i>used</i> to think sucked blood.
-3-female_must_strip,target:willow,targetStage:0=teasing,I think I drew blood on Barnette once--it was a steamy night.  But I never sucked it, so maybe I'm not one of these "vampires."
-3-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=seductive,Omigosh, Meia, look!  <i>Another</i> spacefarer who recognizes the value of a bodysuit.  You should chat her up!
-3-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,Blonde like me, suit like yours, from space like both of us!  This <i>Samus</i> covers all our bases, Meia.  Go flirt with her!
-3-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,This woman's practically a Mejarian, between the spacey jumpsuit and gorgeous figure.  Go get her, Meia--she's got your sense of style!
-3-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=seductive,Full jumpsuit, shapely behind, cute face, <i>from space</i>?  Meia, this girl is prime girlfriend material!  Now's the time!
-3-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:0=laughing,Nice look you've got going there, Miss Bodypaint.  The orange really contrasts nicely with the blue...skin.
-3-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:0=laughing,Nice fruity complexion, honey.  Really matches your horns...and your one crazy eye.
-3-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:0=smug,You seem surprised to have lost, dear...but you can complain about fate until you're blue in the face.
-3-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:0=interested,What are you rolling that thing for?  Trying to pick a new color of body paint?
-3-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=bored,<i>Yeesh</i>.  Meia, I'm sorry I ever called you miserable.  Next to this girl, you're a field of sunflowers.
-3-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,I'm glad we came here, boss.  Miss Blueberry over here has given me a new appreciation for your sense of humor.
-3-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=bored,Jeez, I've at least <i>seen</i> you smile, Meia.  I don't think this girl <i>has</i> those muscles.
-3-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,At least you have your face on display, Leader.  This girl's both miserable <i>and</i> refuses to show it.
-3-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale_swimsuit,targetStage:0=laughing,How can a woman dress for a sun she's apparently never seen?  The mysteries just keep piling up.
-3-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale_swimsuit,targetStage:0=interested,Cute swimsuit, honey, but I've always preferred the shade.  So do you, clearly.
-3-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale_swimsuit,targetStage:0=vain,Yeah, I'm more the type to lounge under an umbrella than do any swimming.  But more power to you, if you ever choose to go outside.
-3-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale_swimsuit,targetStage:0=interested,Look, dear.  You can wear that swimsuit all day, but that complexion's not fooling anybody.
-3-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,You'll have to excuse Meia's hostility.  She's absorbed all of our collective pirate hatred of authority.
-3-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,Oh, don't mind Meia.  She's taken the whole pirates-hating--soldiers thing a little too much to heart.
-3-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,Just let Meia fume a little, Miss Military. We know you're not from <i>Mejare's</i> nasty old ranks.
-3-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=stretching,Cute purple hair, Miss Military.  Oh, don't worry about Meia.  She's even touchier with soldier women than the rest of us.
-3-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:5=smug,Well, that's that.  Do what you must behind those flowers.
-3-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:5=interested,You can hide yourself with the flowers, honey, but you're naked, so that's a loss in my book.
-3-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:5=smug,Nice try with the foliage, dear, but no one's going to call that clothing.  You're out.
-3-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:5=stretching,<i>And so the frightened little princess falls before her betters.  Even the forest spirits couldn't save her</i>.
-3-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=vain,Way to come in a full outfit, Miss Maid.  And you're still speaking just as politely as when you're on the job!
-3-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=smug,Whoever is your house's owner must really crack the whip, Miss Maid.  Even <i>now</i> you're using those silly honorifics.
-3-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=vain,"Jura-chan" sounds like the most <i>adorable</i> nickname!  I've got to get Barnette to start calling me that...Barnette-<i>chan</i>.
-3-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=teasing,You don't have to keep speaking all polite, Miss Maid.  You're in the company of a brutal pirate now--feel free to join the crew.
-3-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=laughing,Well, aren't <i>you</i> a tight little ball of sexual energy!  I guess it's got nowhere to go in that tiny frame of yours.
-3-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=vain,You've got a lot of libido packed into a little body.  Must be the effects of Earth men...we Mejarians are <i>tasteful</i> in our sexuality.
-3-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=laughing,<i>Why, I never</i>!  You're so dreadfully lewd, Miss Tan...do men just like women on the shorter side?
-3-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=vain,You must get a lot of attention from men to be all amped-up like this.  <i>Tell me a tall woman still has a chance</i>!
-3-female_must_strip,target:pauling,targetStage:0=teasing,Nice sensible little outfit you've got there.  The glasses sell the sexy-and-smart look!
-3-female_must_strip,target:pauling,targetStage:0=teasing,Working for an old woman, eh?  I know the feeling.  Those glasses must have convinced her you knew what you were doing.
-3-female_must_strip,target:pauling,targetStage:0=stretching,A woman with glasses, eh?  <i>I</i> certainly couldn't pull off the look...I guess I don't look very smart.
-3-female_must_strip,target:pauling,targetStage:0=smug,I know an engineering egghead with glasses--Parfet's her name.  And she seems to attract what few smart men I know.
-3-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:3=confused,This is so freaky to me, and I've dealt with the Paksis's weird energy.  Do you just swtich all the time?
-3-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:3=confused,Are you really bouncing back and forth like this all the time?  Like, do you have any friends?
-3-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:3=confused,Must be hard getting to know anyone when you keep losing your memory.  How do you deal with always switching?
-3-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:3=confused,I can't believe you have split personalities.  Where does the other one go?  How do you make friends?
-3-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, a dark-skinned woman!  We only have a few of those on Mejare--you'd turn heads, Miss Exotic.  And your outfit would fit right in.
-3-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=teasing,Talk about a fierce look in your eye--and even skimpier clothing than me!  But you make it work, Miss Chocolate.
-3-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=seductive,Hey there, cutie!  Between that exotic dark skin and light dress, you'd be a real steal where <i>I'm</i> from!
-3-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=teasing,You're already a model Mejarian with that much skin showing, Miss Warrior.  <i>I'd like to see some sweat roll off those chocolate-flavored muscles</i>.
-3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:3=bored,Is there a doctor in the building?  One specializing in mental health?
-3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:3=frustrated,...This isn't funny anymore.  Now I'm just worried about you.
-3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:3=frustrated,...This is getting old.  <i>I'm</i> getting old listening to this.
-3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:3=annoyed,What a surprise.  Intentionally throwing the game tends to make you lose.
-3-female_must_strip,target:tifa,targetStage:0=interested,Ohoho.  A <i>martial artist</i>, honey?  Well, I can certainly see where all your momentum comes from.
-3-female_must_strip,target:tifa,targetStage:0=laughing,With a figure like that, I imagine you've developed your <i>own</i> style of martial arts...centered around counterweights.
-3-female_must_strip,target:tifa,targetStage:0=teasing,<i>My, my</i>!  Those things outdo even mine, sweetie...but I don't pretend I'm some sort of athlete.
-3-female_must_strip,target:tifa,targetStage:0=seductive,Bigger breasts <i>and</i> martial arts skill?  Jeez, you're outmaneuvering me left and right.  Good thing you're such a cutie!
-3-female_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=seductive,<i>Hoo</i>...my life flashed before my eyes for a moment there.  My sex life, that is.
-3-female_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=vain,I was actually worried for a second there.  But then I remembered I could actually stand to relieve some tension...and now I'm all pent-up.
-3-female_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=teasing,All I had was a high card...but apparently it was <i>high enough</i>.
-3-female_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=seductive,Come on, all I had was a <i>high card</i>!  Aren't you going to finish me off, ~name~?
-3-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:2=confused,So, uh, besides being blue, what's your deal?  You're all sweet and polite now.
-3-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:2=seductive,Can't say I prefer blue hair, but you're certainly a lot sweeter now, honey.  What <i>happened</i>?
-3-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:2=seductive,Normally I like blondes, but at least you're not waving a gun around and cursing anymore.  Nice tradeoff.
-3-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:2=vain,Blue hair is more exotic, but blonde is far more beautiful.  Still, I'll take this polite version of you over the alternative.
-3-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:1=seductive,Omigosh, Palutena, that gorgeous green hair is even longer than mine!  My <i>girlfriend</i> has green hair, you know.
-3-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:1=vain,How do you <i>maintain</i> all that hair?  I have the best time washing mine...and wrapping my green-haired girlfriend in it.
-3-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:1=seductive,You know who else has beautiful green hair, Miss Goddess?  My girlfriend, Barnette.  That sweet little thing is back on the ship!
-3-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:1=stretching,So is that lovely green hair just the goddess's right?  My girlfriend got hers from standard Mejarian genetic trickery.
-3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:4=bored,...Maybe I should stop hitting on men.  Look what it does to you...
-3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:4=annoyed,Is this really what Earth women are like?  She's an outlier, right?
-3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:4=frustrated,Seems running the Harvest has a tendency to scramble Earth women's brains...and make them want to play poker.
-3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:4=bored,...At least she's losing quickly.  Easy to do when you barely check the cards.
-3-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:0=awkward,Uh...you want to calm down there, sweetheart?  Maybe put that men's gun down?  Take a nap?
-3-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:0=bored,Jeez, we knew you meant business by the gun.  No need to shout...must be men's influence.
-3-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:0=frustrated,Can you pipe down?  Way to confirm the image of Earth girls as nasty little gun-toting balls of violence.
-3-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:0=shocked,Uh...why are you carrying that giant men's gun?  I'd show it to Barnette, but you, uh, don't seem too friendly.
-3-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:0=bored,That's a huge gun, Miss Moxie...men's mechanical weapons are so noisy and inefficient.  Don't tell Barnette I said that.
-3-female_must_strip,target:riva,targetStage:0=smug,You should know I'm not a fan of princesses, Miss Magician.  But <i>blonde</i> ones?  ...I might yield a little.
-3-female_must_strip,target:riva,targetStage:0=stretching,Maybe all it takes is some blonde hair to warm me up to the idea of royalty...or magic.
-3-female_must_strip,target:riva,targetStage:0=vain,Don't feel bad about your unearned title, Miss Princess.  I hear you can perform magic--and alongside blonde hair, I'd say you're alright in my book.
-3-female_must_strip,target:riva,targetStage:0=vain,Little Miss Magician is a <i>princess</i>, as well?  Well, against my pirate nature, I think I'll let a fellow blonde be on her way.
-3-female_must_strip,target:lara,targetStage:0=stretching,Raiding tombs, you said?  Why would you <i>ever</i> want to be all dirty and dusty?
-3-female_must_strip,target:lara,targetStage:0=stretching,You won't find <i>me</i> in catacombs like you explore.  It'd ruin my dress...and my face.
-3-female_must_strip,target:lara,targetStage:0=teasing,So what's in these tombs, anyway?  <i>We</i> conduct raids on the living and able--so watch out!
-3-female_must_strip,target:lara,targetStage:0=smug,Raiding those who can't defend themselves doesn't sound too impressive, honey.  Or do monsters live in those tombs of yours?
-3-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0=interested,What's with the wings, Miss Pixie?  You some kind of sex-fairy sent to wake up our libidos?
-3-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0=seductive,And what do we have here?  A tender little love fairy to help us all along in our sexual adventures?
-3-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0=teasing,A love fairy, eh?  You listen here, Miss Pixie--<i>I'm</i> in a happy relationship.  So no touching!
-3-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0=laughing,Little Miss Pixie's got quite the filthy mouth for being so frilly-pink with love.  I guess sex <i>is</i> a part of love, but still...
-3-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0=stretching,Hey, Chatterbox, feel free to live a little.  You're as bad as Meia...good thing she ended up somewhere else.
-3-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0=stretching,And here I thought I was sparing this table the boredom of having Meia around.  Enter her Earth doppelganger.
-3-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0=smug,Pale, dead-serious, somehow convinced there's strategy in cards.  I didn't know they synthesized Meia's brand of boredom on Earth.
-3-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0=laughing,<i>Please, Chatterbox, you're talking our ears off.  And your smiles are just so radiant</i>!  A woman after Meia's own black heart.
-3-female_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=vain,I have <i>lots</i> of secret weapons.  My Vandread, my breasts...and my fabulous golden hair.
-3-female_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=teasing,Thought I was all out of tricks?  I'm out of interest, but not tricks.
-3-female_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=teasing,I just <i>knew</i> flipping my hair back would finally draw your eye.  Leave these foul Earth men behind and be with women!
-3-female_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=seductive-2,Oh, ~name~, you're embarrassing me with your lustful gazes.  Earth women don't love each other the way Mejarians do!
-3-female_must_strip,target:rosalina,targetStage:0=teasing,And what do we have here--a fellow spacefarer, and a tall blonde one at that?  <i>People are going to get us confused</i>.
-3-female_must_strip,target:rosalina,targetStage:0=vain,Flying around on an <i>observatory</i>, you said?  That sounds heavenly--space is such a beautiful place!
-3-female_must_strip,target:rosalina,targetStage:0=teasing,Space can actually be rather beautiful when you're not busy robbing people.  Surely you agree, Miss Princess?
-3-female_must_strip,target:rosalina,targetStage:0=vain,You <i>say</i> you're a princess, but space belongs to everyone--surely a traveler like yourself knows that better than most.
-3-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0=excited,Ooh!  Ooh!  You're the one who's with a woman, right?  You some kind of Mejarian envoy to Earth?
-3-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0=thinking,You're with a woman, isn't that right?  Maybe Mejare was just aping what Earthlings came up with first...
-3-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0=interested,So, you're the one showing these poor Earth girls the Mejarian way, right?  That they don't need men to be happy?  Good job.
-3-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0=vain,<i>Finally</i>, an Earth woman who's realized how much better other women's bodies are.  We should gossip about our girlfriends later.
-3-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0,marker:fama_and_oma=smug,So, Miss Mejarian-style, are you going to be the Fama, or is your ladyfriend?  My Barnette's far too cute to carry babies herself.
-3-female_must_strip,target:kimberly,targetStage:0=confused,Hey, so, uh, normally I'd tease you or something, but what was with that big lightshow from you earlier?
-3-female_must_strip,target:kimberly,targetStage:0=confused,Wait, weren't you wearing pink a little while ago?  Like, a full suit?  Was that lightshow back there <i>you</i>?
-3-female_must_strip,target:kimberly,targetStage:0=shocked,Hey, who's the new girl?  And where'd that pink-suit-wearing woman go after she flashed away?  Wait, was that <i>you</i>?
-3-female_must_strip,target:kimberly,targetStage:0=angry,Hey, aren't you the one who half-blinded us all a little bit ago?  Where'd your suit go?  I thought it was cool, so start talking.
-3-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, cutie!  You look a little wide-eyed and naive to be here...but those bullets suggest otherwise.
-3-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0=stretching,I've got my eye on you, Miss Ruby-Red.  I know better than to trust a cute girl with ammo clips on her belt.
-3-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0=vain,You know who else is a cute girl with a little ammo on the side?  My girlfriend, Barnette.  And if you're anything like her, I better not get you angry.
-3-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0=seductive,The black-and-red outfit is a winner, honey--very intimidating!  So's that ammo.  Guess you need to balance out your cute face.
-3-female_must_strip,target:kim,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, nice and simple fashion is always a treat to see.  I have a crewmate who bares her stomach just like you do!
-3-female_must_strip,target:kim,targetStage:0=laughing,Hey, girlie.  I hope your stomach isn't feeling too vulnerable, all exposed next to the alien lady's rapier.
-3-female_must_strip,target:kim,targetStage:0=teasing,Feeling confident, dear?  With a name like Pissible and a belly that vulnerable, you <i>must</i>.
-3-female_must_strip,target:kim,targetStage:0=teasing,<i>Save the world</i>, huh?  Well, dearie, you and your little midriff should know I'm not <i>from</i> this world.
-3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=seductive,<i>Oooh</i>!  Even ~player~ realizes how beautiful I am--enough to add a clone!  You're so <i>adorable</i>.
-3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=laughing,Hey, what's this all about, ~player~?  Did I keep on winning, and you wanted to see me naked <i>that</i> badly?
-3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=vain,Would you look at that?  My beauty was so enticing that ~player~ figured out the offline version just to add more of me.
-3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=vain,Earth's cloning technology is well underway!  And ~player~ picked the <i>perfect</i> specimen, I must say.
-3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=vain,I never thought ~player~ could manage to flatter me, and then they go and pick <i>two</i> of me!  Good show.
-3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=laughing,<i>My, my, ~player~</i>.  You <i>really</i> like the look of me.
-3-female_must_strip,target:jubilee,targetStage:0=vain,Well, aren't <i>you</i> a little fireball, Miss Mutant?  You look pretty human to me, and this is a girl who thought <i>men</i> were aliens.
-3-female_must_strip,target:jubilee,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, honey, <i>men</i> are mutant people, as far as I'm concerned.  And they're still cute, so don't be so hard on yourself.
-3-female_must_strip,target:jubilee,targetStage:0=smug,How many people have to tell you you're ugly for you to introduce yourself as a <i>mutant</i>?  You poor, rundown thing.
-3-female_must_strip,target:jubilee,targetStage:0=stretching,You look pretty mundane for a <i>mutant</i>, darling.  Although you've certainly got an inhuman fire in you.
-3-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=smug,Dull that edge, honey.  We're all just trying to have a good time here, stripping naked for complete strangers.
-3-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=vain,You're a fiery one, Miss Edge.  A lot like my <i>darling</i> Barnette!  So I don't mind.
-3-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=laughing,That red streak in your hair should've tipped us off that you'd be all angry.  Maybe feeling the breeze on your breasts will cheer you up.
-3-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=vain,You know what warms me up to others, Miss Edge?  Shaking my breasts around for them--<i>they always appreciate that</i>!
-3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:5=frustrated,Oh God, she's finally doing it.  Be very afraid...unless you Earth people are used to this sort of thing.
-3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:5=frustrated,Please don't.  I've learned my lesson.  I'll stay on Mejare.
-3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:5=bored,I'm really appreciating Mejare right now.  Maybe I'll straighten up and get a normal job.
-3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:5=frustrated,This is the last time I come to Earth.  Even among Mejarian pirate scum, none of us act like this.
-3-female_must_strip,target:joey,targetStage:0=confused,What's with all the makeup?  Someone said you're a...<i>clown</i>, whatever that means?
-3-female_must_strip,target:joey,targetStage:0=confused,...So does <i>clown</i> mean "makeup advertiser"?  Because you're modeling too many products at once.
-3-female_must_strip,target:joey,targetStage:0=laughing,...Earth makeup is something else.  Apparently there's whole classes of women called <i>clowns</i> who just cake it on!
-3-female_must_strip,target:joey,targetStage:0=confused,So if I wore as much makeup as you do, would that make me a "clown"?  Where's the lower limit?  This is all new to me.
-3-female_must_strip,target:hope,targetStage:0=confused,Hey, dearie, no reason to come out knives-swinging.  I've got my rapier sheathed like a civilized woman.
-3-female_must_strip,target:hope,targetStage:0=awkward,Settle down there, honey.  There's something awfully scary about wearing a smile with a knife out.
-3-female_must_strip,target:hope,targetStage:0=frustrated,I know I brought a sword, sweetheart, but that was just for fashion.  Don't turn this place into a bloodbath.
-3-female_must_strip,target:hope,targetStage:0=shocked,Well, hi there, cutie--er, uh, <i>knife-wielding</i> cutie.  Yeah.  Carry on.
-3-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:0=laughing,<i>Boo</i>!  <i>The nasty pirate woman's going to kill you</i>!
-3-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:0=laughing,You're a cute little thing, Saki!  So plain and innocent...perfect for a pirate like me to <i>kidnap</i>!
-3-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:0=laughing,Seeing a cute little Earth girl all clammed up like this really makes me want to comfort her...<i>with my rapier</i>!
-3-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:0=laughing,Hey, Miss Schoolgirl.  Ever met an <i>alien</i> before?  You should know...<i>we eat Earthlings' brains</i>!
-3-female_must_strip,target:hinata,targetStage:0=smug,So what are these "ninjas" all about, huh?  Disappearing into the night doesn't sound useful in a game like <i>this</i>.
-3-female_must_strip,target:hinata,targetStage:0=teasing,Don't tell me your going to use those ninja skills to hide your body, now.
-3-female_must_strip,target:hinata,targetStage:0=stretching,Certainly an impressive profile, Miss Ninja.  Think you could show us just <i>how</i> impressive?
-3-female_must_strip,target:hinata,targetStage:0=interested,Does "ninja" just mean you wear a headband?  Sounds like a lofty title for my Barnette to accidentally fall under.
-3-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0=seductive,Check out that messy hair...and adorable student outfit!  Did you say you're a <i>witch</i>?
-3-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0=smug,Watch out, ladies, we've got a full-blown <i>magician</i> on our hands.  On Mejare you get called a witch for saying men aren't the worst thing ever.
-3-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0=vain,A <i>witch</i>, eh?  Forgive my doubts...that jealous old hag of a judge called me a witch just for having that anatomy book!
-3-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0=seductive,Awww!  She even brought a little magic wand to complete the costume!  <i>You're so cute, Miss Witch</i>.
-3-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0=vain,Between you and that time I got called a witch for showing interest in men, witches are just <i>irresistible</i> these days.
-3-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0=confused,...Look, honey.  Makeup is a girl's best friend, but...it's possible to get a little too close to your friends.
-3-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0,marker:fama_and_oma=laughing,Dear god.  Did you break into your Fama's makeup closet and start applying whatever you could find?  Your friends are letting you down.
-3-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0=smug,I guess I never appreciated how light with makeup I can be with my natural beauty.  Here we see the alternative...
-3-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0=vain,Check out Miss Makeup over here.  Somehow she made it through childhood without hearing the expression "less is more."
-3-female_must_strip,target:kurumu,targetStage:0=laughing,Hey there, short stuff!  Seems all your height went into your chest--those things are even bigger than mine!
-3-female_must_strip,target:kurumu,targetStage:0=interested,You hogging all the nutrients on this planet, Miss Vampire?  You're the only Earth girl I've seen that outdoes <i>my</i> breasts.
-3-female_must_strip,target:kurumu,targetStage:0=smug,Even through that schoolgirl's outfit, I can tell your breasts are superior to mine.  Hopefully Barnette loves me for <i>other</i> reasons.
-3-female_must_strip,target:kurumu,targetStage:0=laughing,Is it true you suck blood, Miss Vampire?  If so...well, we certainly know where it all goes.
-3-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0=smug,Well, look at what we have here!  A blonde spacefarer in a jumpsuit.  Well, I guess we <i>almost</i> match...
-3-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0=seductive,I'm a big fan of the bodysuit look, cutie.  So's a certain crewmate of mine I wish was here...space just makes it so much easier.
-3-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, a <i>blonde</i>!  And she travels around in space, too.  If only you had the sense to wear my dress instead of that suit, we'd be twins.
-3-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0=vain,A shapely little specimen, zipping around space in that provocative bodysuit?  You're a model Mejarian--if only Meia were here!
-3-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:5=shocked,Bless you--<i>oh no</i>.
-3-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:5=shocked,Who sneezed--<i>eep!  N-not Launch</i>!
-3-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:5=shocked,<i>Ack!  Why'd you have to sneeze again</i>?
-3-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:5=shocked,<i>Eek!  N-not again!  My heart can't take this</i>!
-3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:1=shocked,What's next, Ocean Girl?  You shir--<i>I was kidding</i>!
-3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:1=shocked,I imagine the shirt is ne--<i>wait, no, I was just joking</i>!
-3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:1=annoyed,...You're not serious?  I'm telling you, you have to <i>tease</i> a little!
-3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:1=bored,...Ocean Girl's a total idiot.  Just stripping nude right off the bat...way to miss the point.
-3-female_must_strip,target:may,targetStage:0=smug,What'd you say you did?  Train in poker?  Well, it didn't save you <i>that</i> hand...unless they're animals or something.
-3-female_must_strip,target:may,targetStage:0=stretching,So, you're all about <i>poker</i>-mon, was it?  Well, seems you've been training all your life for this game...
-3-female_must_strip,target:may,targetStage:0=frustrated,These <i>pokuhmon</i> things just sound like more trouble than they're worth.  Animals in Mejarian zoos are so <i>dirty</i>!
-3-female_must_strip,target:may,targetStage:0=confused,You're an animal trainer, isn't that right?  Or was it <i>poker</i>...mons?  Not following the Earth slang here.
-3-female_must_strip,target:meg,targetStage:0=vain,What's with the hat, honey?  Take it off and let your hair run wild, like any woman's should!
-3-female_must_strip,target:meg,targetStage:0=smug,Matting your lovely hair under a hat like that...even if you <i>do</i> run all the time, I just can't understand.
-3-female_must_strip,target:meg,targetStage:0=smug,A <i>killer</i>, you said?  The only killer here is what that hat's doing to your hair.
-3-female_must_strip,target:meg,targetStage:0=teasing,Check out Miss Exercise over here.  There's no running from <i>this</i> game...so drop the hat and let your hair breathe a while.
-3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:5=teasing,Don't stop now, honey!  I hope I'm not imposing...but I'd <i>love</i> to hear some more French!
-3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:5=seductive,Your language is the absolute <i>coolest</i>, darling!  Say some more for me, if you don't mind...I hope I'm not being a burden.
-3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:5=teasing,I'm not demanding too much of you, am I, Marinette?  I just <i>love</i> your language...and this should take your mind off stripping.
-3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:5=vain,Normally I'm interested in women's tongues for <i>other</i> reasons...but with you, I can't get over how cool your language is!
-3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:5=seductive,I think I'm jealous, Marinette!  Not only are you the <i>cutest</i> little blueberry muffin of a girl, but your language is to <i>die</i> for!
-3-female_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=vain,Just couldn't keep your streak together when I'm like this?  Yeah, I understand.  Just take it easy and ogle away!
-3-female_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=vain,Finally broke that lucky run with my exquisite figure.  <i>Now</i> do you understand the appeal of your own sex?
-3-female_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=teasing,Knew I'd finally distract you long enough to lose.  If you think <i>I'm</i> beautiful, there's a whole pirate crew full of women almost as gorgeous...
-3-female_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=seductive,Don't fight your lust, ~name~.  I know that look in a woman's eye...a burgeoning love of curves and smoothness.
-3-female_must_strip,target:piper,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey there, Miss Meterstick.  Thanks for not letting my ego get too big when it came to height.
-3-female_must_strip,target:piper,targetStage:0=stretching,Every woman I know says I'm tall.  Do you turn heads when you enter a room, too?
-3-female_must_strip,target:piper,targetStage:0=vain,Oh, good, a woman who understands what it's like towering over people.  The intimidation can be kind of fun, no?
-3-female_must_strip,target:piper,targetStage:0=stretching,Men seem to be taller than women.  I guess I wouldn't turn as many heads on Earth, then...but you'd do it no matter what.
-3-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=stretching,...Yeah, we're gonna be here a while.  This girl's dressed for the vacuum of space.
-3-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=interested,Does it really get that cold on Earth?  Or <i>anywhere</i>, for that matter?
-3-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=interested,You're from Planet China, is that right?  Must be one big snowball if <i>that's</i> in vogue over there.
-3-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=laughing,I understand why you must be so cold.  Your name is pretty close to <i>Meia</i>, after all.
-3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:4=excited,Forget the common language, Marinette, your "French" sounds like the most <i>romantic</i> thing!  You've <i>got</i> to say some more.
-3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:4=excited,<i>Oooh, Marinette</i>!  Can you say some more "French"?  My heart beats faster every time your tongue slips!
-3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:4=seductive,You should say some more French, Marinette!  It's got the <i>silkiest</i> sound to it--it makes my heart go wild!
-3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:4=seductive,Oooh, Marinette, since it's your turn, can you throw out some more of this "French"?  It sounds like a <i>lover's</i> language.
-3-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:0=stretching,Shame you're not an <i>actual</i> pearl.  I could go for one of those...Mejare hardly has any.
-3-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:0=smug,No animals on Mejare means no pearls.  If only you <i>were</i> one of those beauties...
-3-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:0=bored,All stretched-out like that...you're not shaped like a pearl at all!  Shame, because I love those things.
-3-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:0=vain,<i>Oh, to hold a real pearl in my hands</i>!  I've only seen pictures in Earth history books.
-3-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=laughing,Ooh, a <i>lady</i> doctor!  The Nirvana's only doctor is a man--I wonder if he'd lose his cool with you gunning for his spot.
-3-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=vain,Honestly, I'm torn!  You're a cute woman doctor--and <i>blonde</i>!  But our ship's doctor is a man with rather nice hair himself.
-3-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=teasing,Ooh, a doctor from Earth!  I bet that makes you an <i>expert</i> on male sexuality, doesn't it?
-3-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, a woman doctor is <i>just</i> what I've been looking for!  Think you could help me and Barnette get pregnant?
-3-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=vain,Female <i>and</i> blonde...if only Duero were blond, then he'd be the perfect doctor for me.  So <i>handsome</i>...
-3-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, Miss Medicine.  Since you're from Earth, I might have a few questions about men's tubes tonight.
-3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:3=confused,Hey, what were those noises you made before?  Didn't sound like the common language...
-3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:3=confused,...What's the name of that language you keep slipping into, anyway?  Some sort of Earth code-talk?  I only speak the common one...
-3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:3=vain,Bilingualism is so impressive, Marinette!  I only speak the common language...I don't even know Mejarians' codespeak.
-3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:3=seductive,So you speak the common language, but also this other one?  What's it called?  Because it sounds so <i>cute</i>!
-3-female_must_strip,target:pyrrha,targetStage:0=laughing,Hey there, Miss Mind-Your-Manners.  You talk the talk, but that cleavage tells me you've got a wild side.
-3-female_must_strip,target:pyrrha,targetStage:0=teasing,You're awfully polite for a woman perverted enough to come here in the first place.  Just trying to throw us off, cutie?
-3-female_must_strip,target:pyrrha,targetStage:0=stretching,Yeah, yeah, I don't buy the whole polite-and-formal act from a girl willing to strip nude in public.  Just waiting for the good stuff?
-3-female_must_strip,target:pyrrha,targetStage:0=interested,You talk pretty prim-and-proper, dear...and yet here you are, stripping nude for us.  Do you have a dirty side, or did you lose a bet?
-3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0=seductive,Well, hi there, Miss Accent!  That is just the <i>cutest</i> polka-dot bodysuit you have on!
-3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0=seductive,Omigosh, your funny accent is so <i>cute</i>!  It matches your goofy polka-dotted suit.
-3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0=laughing,Well, aren't <i>you</i> the most adorable thing!  All dolled up in polka dots, stumbling over your words!  I could just <i>gobble you up</i>!
-3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0=seductive,That's a pretty darling suit, sweetie, with all the polka dots.  And the way you trip over your words just makes me <i>melt</i>!
-3-female_must_strip,target:mia,targetStage:0=vain,<i>My, my</i>!  You work in the <i>law</i>?  This old pirate better be careful around you.
-3-female_must_strip,target:mia,targetStage:0=teasing,So you do something with the law, huh?  Think you could defend my murderous pirate self in a courtroom?
-3-female_must_strip,target:mia,targetStage:0=vain,So what's a "lawyer" do all day?  Pushing papers around sounds dreadfully boring when you're a daredevil star pilot.
-3-female_must_strip,target:mia,targetStage:0=laughing,I see you're quite well-endowed there, Miss Magistrate.  Is that how you win people over in your legal arguments?
-3-female_must_strip,target:marceline,targetStage:0=bored,...Is someone playing a Halloween prank on me?  Where are your eyes?  How are you floating?  <i>Earth</i>...
-3-female_must_strip,target:marceline,targetStage:0=confused,Don't get me wrong, Mejare has Halloween just like Earth...but we just dress up.  That doesn't look like a costume.
-3-female_must_strip,target:marceline,targetStage:0=confused,...OK, it's hard to comment on what's weird about you when there's so much to choose from.  Do I start with your floating or your eyes?
-3-female_must_strip,target:marceline,targetStage:0=confused,...Is this Earth?  Did I get the right planet?  Because you like even more alien that I do, with that skin...and no eyes.
-3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:2=interested,Honey, you'd be better off putting some meat on your bones than trying desperately to show them off.
-3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:2=bored,Sweetie, you're a twig.  This is just unhealthy...as unhealthy as you look.
-3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:2=confused,Are you suffering from this "anorexia" I keep reading about?  Eating disorders?  Do men do this to you?
-3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:2=vain,Talk about needing a girlfriend.  See what happens when you're never validated?
-3-female_must_strip,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0=laughing,Judging by that sword, you're not from Earth either, Miss Crystal.  Where can I get one of those?
-3-female_must_strip,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0=smug,Don't ask me why that thing is <i>drawn</i>, but damn if it isn't more impressive than my silly little rapier.  Got any extras?
-3-female_must_strip,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, I like the look of that glowing sword!  Even <i>Mejare</i> hasn't though to put its lasers in blades yet.
-3-female_must_strip,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0=smug,I could do for an upgrade on this rapier--would you please refer me to the planet where they make those glowing swords?
-3-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=seductive,Blonde, scantily-clad, loves attention?  Honey, you're a woman after my own heart.
-3-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=teasing,I like the energy you're bringing, Miss Wrestler!  The scant layering doesn't hurt, either.
-3-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=vain,See, <i>you're</i> my kind of woman!  These other Earth girls are so dreadfully boring, always covering up the good stuff.
-3-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=teasing,Barely wearing anything? You should know my girlfriend is the same way, cutie...only <i>she's</i> not blonde.
-3-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=vain,Hel-<i>looo, camera</i>!  Over here, sweetie--get whatever angle you like best.
-3-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=vain,Omigosh, you brought a <i>camera</i>?  A sign from the heavens!  Now all of Earth will get to see my beautiful naked body!
-3-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=teasing,Looking to get some photographs of the exotic alien woman, were you?  But now you've got a whole <i>different</i> reason to capture me.
-3-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=vain,Go right ahead with that camera, dearie.  It's always been shameful how I've been in the media for piracy instead of beauty.
-3-female_must_strip,target:peach,targetStage:0=vain,I've never been a fan of royalty, but a <i>blonde</i> woman in charge?  Suddenly it doesn't seem so bad.
-3-female_must_strip,target:peach,targetStage:0=smug,At least you've got the hair color to match your presumptuous title, Miss Princess.  This pirate still might rob you later.
-3-female_must_strip,target:peach,targetStage:0=vain,You damn princesses and your unearned jewelry and dresses.  I stole everything I have, you know!  But at least you're blonde.
-3-female_must_strip,target:peach,targetStage:0=teasing,So from one blonde to another, Miss Princess, how much is that crown worth?  ...<i>Just a pirate's curiosity</i>.
-3-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0=excited,Ooh, an Earth woman with green hair!  My girlfriend Barnette has green hair...and she is the <i>cutest</i> thing!
-3-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, I didn't know Earth women could have green hair!  I've always considered it the most cutely exotic thing about Barnette.
-3-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0=seductive,A sword <i>and</i> lovely green hair?  You must be a sign that Barnette and I are ready for children, sweetie.
-3-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0=teasing,Ooh, green hair on a woman never fails to get me going.  But don't worry, my verdantly-colored girlfriend can handle the rest.
-3-female_must_strip,target:lux,targetStage:0=laughing,A covert agent, eh?  I guess if an alien woman knows that, you've already failed at your job.
-3-female_must_strip,target:lux,targetStage:0=teasing,So what are you so <i>covert</i> about, Miss Agent?  We pirates just charge in and gun the place down before they know what hit them!
-3-female_must_strip,target:lux,targetStage:0=interested,What kind of covert agent fights with light?  You know, the thing that makes your position <i>clearer</i>?
-3-female_must_strip,target:lux,targetStage:0=smug,Oho--we've got an <i>agent</i> on our hands.  Wouldn't be the first we had on our ship--and we made her come around to our side.
-3-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, cutie!  You look like you've got some kind of rank to your name, with that beret--care to share any details?
-3-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, you're not a bad looker, Earth-girl!  I like that exotic purple hair.  What is it you do, exactly?
-3-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0=seductive,Tell me more about your exciting "NERV" job, Miss Military.  I want to know <i>all about</i> Earth!
-3-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0=teasing,Ohoho--a <i>military</i> woman.  Well, indulge this filthy pirate scum and share what it is you do all day.
-3-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0=interested,Talk about a big ball of misery.  Even your <i>skin</i> has turned all blue in despair.
-3-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0=teasing,Show your face, honey!  Or are you trying to hide that weird blue skin?  Don't worry, it suits your miserable demeanor.
-3-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0=laughing,I guess I'd be miserable, too, if I had the complexion of a grapefruit.
-3-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0=stretching,I should bring Meia over here for some counseling.  Even <i>she's</i> not as miserable as Miss Blueberry here.
-3-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=stretching,Ooh, I know a girl named Misty!  She's this cute little thing from Pluto--barely has any breasts at all!  Must be cold there.
-3-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=smug,Why, the Nirvana has a young girl named Misty aboard!  Being from Pluto, she knew her way around men better than any of us.
-3-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=seductive,You're not the first Misty I've come to know, actually.  A teenie-weenie Plutonian girl we have is called the same thing!
-3-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=stretching,I don't think they have your <i>poker</i>-mon things on Pluto...but they do have girls named Misty.
-3-female_must_strip,target:lilith,targetStage:0=vain,Planet <i>Pandora</i>, was it?  What a lovely name!  I might have to retire there with my darling Barnette when we're older.
-3-female_must_strip,target:lilith,targetStage:0=vain,Pandora sounds like such a <i>gorgeous</i> name.  I think I'll call my first daughter that--surely Barnette won't mind.
-3-female_must_strip,target:lilith,targetStage:0=teasing,Barnette and I are <i>always</i> discussing baby names.  Pandora sounds positively wonderful!
-3-female_must_strip,target:lilith,targetStage:0=teasing,A hunter, eh?  And what do hunters hunt on lovely little Pandora--a cute name, by the way.
-3-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=seductive,Hey there, Miss Star-Student!  That's a school uniform, right?  What do they teach you on Earth?
-3-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=teasing,Check out the uniformed student type!  I was never good in school--but what is it they teach you on Earth, huh?
-3-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=vain,Mejare's schools are nothing but <i>men this, violence that</i>, with a little math.  How does your fancy Earth education compare?
-3-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=vain,A student, huh?  Do they teach you anything interesting on Earth?  I was never a brainiac, but I still rose to be a pilot!
-3-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, an Earth girl still in school!  Have they taught you anything about men?  What do they teach you in general?
-3-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=confused,...You're not from Earth either, are you?  ...Or human.  Or cute.
-3-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=confused,Say, Miss, I couldn't help but notice your...eye.  What planet are you from, exactly?
-3-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=awkward,And here I thought I'd be seeing some <i>Earth</i> women in this place...or that I'd be the most exotic one.
-3-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=laughing,Always nice to look a woman in the eye.  Singular.
-3-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=smug,I guess they don't value depth perception on whatever planet you're from.  You must be a real steal.
-3-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=interested,Magno Vivan's pirates accept all women...but with depth perception like yours, you wouldn't make it as a pilot.
-3-female_must_strip,target:paya,targetStage:0=smug,My sympathies about the premature white hair, honey.  You look a lot older than you should.
-3-female_must_strip,target:paya,targetStage:0=confused,You might want to rethink those facial markings, dear.  With that white hair, they look an awful lot like wrinkles.
-3-female_must_strip,target:paya,targetStage:0=laughing,Couples can choose their babies' hair color on Mejare thanks to genetic engineering...there's a reason white isn't very popular.
-3-female_must_strip,target:paya,targetStage:0=stretching,You poor thing.  Our captain's ancient, but even <i>she</i> still has color in her hair.
-3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:0=interested,What's up, Ocean Girl?  You seem awfully eager.  Does being around men tend to hypersexualize a woman?
-3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:0=smug,Jeez, it didn't take a loss for you to start piping up about stripping.  You don't need a <i>game</i> to do that, you know.
-3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:0=interested,And here we have Miss Eager-Beaver.  You don't look like you have the assets to be all excited about stripping, sweetheart.
-3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:0=stretching,At least you're confident about nudity.  But are you seriously just losing on purpose?  <i>Earth girls</i>...
-3-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey there, Miss Gunslinger!  You're not gonna <i>fire</i> those things, are you?  My girlfriend collects those sorts of guns.
-3-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=seductive,Omigosh, are those antique men's kinetic weapons?  My girlfriend collects them!  You should meet her.
-3-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=seductive,Always good to see an armed woman!  My girlfriend, Barnette, is totally obsessed with men's mechanical guns like yours.
-3-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=vain,Hey, Miss Gunslinger!  You should lighten up a little and show those men's kinetic guns to my girlfriend.  She's a total connoisseur.
-3-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=teasing,I like the grace of Mejarian laser rings myself, but you want some serious interest on those men's guns of yours?  Talk to my girlfriend.
-3-female_must_strip,target:mileena,targetStage:0=smug,...OK, no one here has any right to call me skimpily-dressed with Bandages here running around.
-3-female_must_strip,target:mileena,targetStage:0=stretching,What kind of sex-crazed planet considers that street clothes?  And here I thought Earth was conservative.
-3-female_must_strip,target:mileena,targetStage:0=laughing,...Seems I've walking into a game that is well in progress.  Poor thing has been losing so badly!
-3-female_must_strip,target:mileena,targetStage:0=laughing,Jeez.  I'm a <i>pirate</i>, and I can afford more clothing than you.  Too bad there's no money involved here.
-3-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:0=seductive,I understand, dear.  You're so stunned by my beauty that you hid your own face in shame.  I'm sure you're still cute!
-3-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:0=seductive,Don't hide that pretty little face on <i>my</i> account, honey.  You've certainly got a beautiful <i>figure</i>.
-3-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:0=teasing,Nice little bodysuit you've got there, even if you plan on being the Masked Woman.  I know a sugar-and-ice girl with your fashion sense.
-3-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:0=laughing,You've got a lot of sass for someone who won't show her face, Miss Masked.  Hiding some grisly injury, or just your own embarrassment?
-3-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0=laughing,What's up, sourpuss?  You look even more miserable than a certain squadron leader I know.
-3-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0=smug,Hey, lighten up, girlie.  I didn't come all the way to Earth to find what I could get from Meia's strategy lectures.
-3-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0=stretching,<i>Yawn</i>...are you really going to be a miserable bore this whole time?  Would having <i>my</i> breasts make you feel better?
-3-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0=smug,Looks like it's Little Miss Sunshine's turn to strip.  Good thing Meia's not here, or this table would just freeze over.
-3-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=laughing,What's up, Four-Feet-Four-Eyes?  You look like someone brought you here at gunpoint.
-3-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=laughing,Oh, look, the egghead love child of Parfet and Dita--nerdy and <i>and</i> eccentric!  How's the weather at the bottom of the earth?
-3-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0,marker:fama_and_oma=laughing,I keep trying to look over your outfit, but my eyes just keep moving too fast and missing it.  Did your Fama not produce milk, shorty?
-3-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=interested,You're such a cute little bespectacled spectacle--but damn if you don't look eleven.  Where's the other two feet of your body?
-3-female_must_strip,target:buffy,targetStage:0=confused,Do you seriously fight those "vampire" things?  I mean, you just don't look all that imposing.
-3-female_must_strip,target:buffy,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, you're kind of cute!  Is that how you kill "vampires"?  Just making them let their guard down with your adorable face?
-3-female_must_strip,target:buffy,targetStage:0=confused,So what's it take to kill these "vampires"?  Can't you just get the military to shoot them or something?  You don't seem all that special.
-3-female_must_strip,target:buffy,targetStage:0=smug,For a girl called "Buffy," you sure seem awful willowy.  You <i>do</i> have a cute face, so maybe that's your strategy for killing those vampire things.
-3-female_must_strip,target:gogo,targetStage:0=teasing,What's your story, Miss Highlights?  Got any gum to share?
-3-female_must_strip,target:gogo,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=teasing,Hey, toss me a piece of that gum, cutie.  I could use a snack while you tell me all about your "San Fransokyo" planet.
-3-female_must_strip,target:gogo,targetStage:0=vain,Just gonna blow bubbles all day, or are you actually going to strip?  Either way, I wouldn't mind having some myself...
-3-female_must_strip,target:gogo,targetStage:0=interested,You seem a little sour, Miss Gumball.  If those bubbles aren't cheering you up, just give me the rest to chew.
-3-female_must_strip,target:shego,targetStage:0=laughing,You OK there, Miss Jumpsuit?  You're looking a little green-around-the-frills.
-3-female_must_strip,target:shego,targetStage:0=interested,Is all the stripping and teasing making you nauseous, dearie?  Just trying to grin and bear it?
-3-female_must_strip,target:shego,targetStage:0=teasing,I'm liking the style on the bodysuit, honey--it helps obscure your sickly green hue.
-3-female_must_strip,target:shego,targetStage:0=smug,Mejarians have some say in their skin tone from genetic engineering...I don't think we can do green, but then I doubt it'd be too popular.
-3-female_must_strip,target:blake,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, the black-and-white look is a classic!  Very striking and confident with that contrast.  And such a cute little bow!
-3-female_must_strip,target:blake,targetStage:0=teasing,Maybe it's just me, but you've got a Mejarian sense of style!  Clashing colors, nice and sexy and revealing!  A woman after my own heart.
-3-female_must_strip,target:blake,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, that's a cute outfit, Blake!  I love this dress, but I don't have anything quite as fancy as all that clashing-colors business.
-3-female_must_strip,target:blake,targetStage:0=teasing,<i>Mmm</i>...the lace, the contrast, the <i>heels</i>!  I like your style, Blake!  Not bad for an Earth girl.
-3-female_must_strip,target:blackrose,targetStage:0=confused,I was gonna say something about that cool dark skin, but apparently...you're just some sort of image?  What's <i>that</i> about?
-3-female_must_strip,target:blackrose,targetStage:0=frustrated,You're..."virtual"?  Listen, honey, you can't just assume we know what these things mean.  Piloting's a busy life, you know!
-3-female_must_strip,target:blackrose,targetStage:0=bored,Wait, so you're not really here, and you're some kind of "virtual" avatar?  Earth has really gotten advanced from all the technology they keep stealing.
-3-female_must_strip,target:blackrose,targetStage:0=annoyed,Hey, if we can just use computers to <i>project</i> ourselves here, why didn't anyone tell me?  I had to <i>fly</i> all the way here!
-3-female_must_strip,target:black_canary,targetStage:0=teasing,Oho--a fellow blonde!  Good to see them running around on Earth--we've got to stick together!
-3-female_must_strip,target:black_canary,targetStage:0=seductive,Hey there, cutie!  Always good to see more lovely blonde women running around.  Got to keep each other safe from those jealous brunettes.
-3-female_must_strip,target:black_canary,targetStage:0=vain,Ooh, is blonde your natural color?  It's not as exotic as some of Mejare's other hair colors, but it's certainly appealing to be wrapped in gold.
-3-female_must_strip,target:black_canary,targetStage:0=vain,What, was "Blonde Canary" taken?  Because <i>that's</i> what I would advertise, if I were you.
-3-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=smug,<i>Well, well, well</i>.  We've got a <i>goddess</i> here, ladies...besides me, of course.
-3-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=vain,A <i>goddess</i>, eh?  I guess that makes <i>two</i> at this table, then.
-3-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=teasing,Just look at that shimmering green hair--and that ornamentation!  But I think I'm every bit the goddess you are, hot stuff.
-3-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=laughing,Just look at that--two goddesses, near-opposite color schemes.  I guess I'm the <i>evil, nasty</i> one.
-3-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, an armed woman--and one with chocolate flavoring!  You're like an extreme version of my tan little gun-nut girlfriend.
-3-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0=vain,I'm not sure what's most intimidating--that height, that imposing dark complexion, or that huge mechanical firearm!
-3-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0=stretching,If only I brought my cute little Barnette here.  She'd be head-over-heels for a woman with a man's gun!
-3-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0=teasing,You might be even taller than me, Miss Nighttime.  That might turn even more heads on Mejare than your rather large firearm!
-3-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0=smug,Come now, honey.  You can't waltz in waving that huge kinetic weapon around and expect to make any friends.
-3-female_must_strip,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=laughing,Normally I'd say rock the skin color you have, but <i>wow</i>.  Pink is <i>not</i> an attractive color...not <i>that</i> pink.
-3-female_must_strip,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=stretching,And here I thought <i>Mejarians</i> were the ones with the exotic body colors.  Earth girls are breaking out the bright pink skin!
-3-female_must_strip,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=confused,Why's your skin all gross-looking and pink?  Like, <i.really</i> pink.  It's distracting...so is that eyepatch, too.
-3-female_must_strip,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=smug,Not to be outdone, Earth starts showing this Mejarian just how bizarre its colors can truly get.  Next on the agenda: <i>pink skin</i>.
-3-female_must_strip,target:ayano,targetStage:0=confused,...You OK there, schoolgirl?  You look a little on edge...especially when you look <i>my</i> way.
-3-female_must_strip,target:ayano,targetStage:0=teasing,Looking a little bug-eyed there, honey.  Too much coffee this morning?
-3-female_must_strip,target:ayano,targetStage:0=confused,Uh, you OK, Ayano?  Your eyes are all shifty, like somebody's watching you.
-3-female_must_strip,target:ayano,targetStage:0=annoyed,...Could you settle down there, girlie?  You're giving me the stink-eye like I killed someone.  It's creeping me out.
-3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:6=bored,The storm is almost over...or maybe this is just the calm before it.
-3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:6=bored,I think I'd prefer the <i>Harvest's</i> company at this point.
-3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:6=bored,Oh, you're still here.  Why not just strip more than one thing at a time?  Well, too late.
-3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:6=bored,I still don't know who made you wait this long to show what you wanted.
-3-female_must_strip,target:athena,targetStage:0=interested,I really thought I'd be the most lightly-dressed woman here, but there you go showing me up on <i>that</i> front.
-3-female_must_strip,target:athena,targetStage:0=smug,Way to dispel my stereotypes of Earth girls being overdressed.  You wear even less than I do.
-3-female_must_strip,target:athena,targetStage:0=interested,Hey, I understand wanting to show a little skin, but you can't walk around in a <i>bikini</i> all day.  Even Barnette doesn't go that far.
-3-female_must_strip,target:athena,targetStage:0=stretching,Even my darling little Barnette covers herself up better than <i>you</i> do...and she's got a reputation for dressing flimsily.
-3-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:0=seductive,Hi there, dearie!  That's an absolutely <i>adorable</i> hat you have on--do you have any others that match that uniform?
-3-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:0=seductive,Ohh, tiny little things like you always make my heart melt!  Is the schoolgirl look a style where you live?
-3-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:0=stretching,A student's uniform is always the most adorable thing.  As you might imagine from my piracy, I wasn't the best student.
-3-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:0=vain,School was always so dreadfully boring, the way they prattled on about men.  But you make the outfit look pretty cute, Miss Magician!
-3-female_must_strip,target:asuna,targetStage:0=frustrated,What'd you say you lived in?  An M-M-O--ripgah?  I can't keep track of all that.
-3-female_must_strip,target:asuna,targetStage:0=confused,Did you say you lived in a computer or something like that?  Sounds like Heaven to Parfet, with how much she tinkers with machines.
-3-female_must_strip,target:asuna,targetStage:0=confused,So what's it like inside a computer?  Do you have to wear a rubber suit to avoid getting electrocuted?
-3-female_must_strip,target:asuna,targetStage:0=confused,You live inside a game, right?  And now you're <i>playing</i> a game?  Is this whole place a game I've stepped inside?
-3-female_must_strip,target:orendi,targetStage:0=confused,...You OK there, Fireball?  You on the same planet as the rest of us?
-3-female_must_strip,target:orendi,targetStage:0=confused,I may <i>be</i> an alien...but you're certainly acting like one.
-3-female_must_strip,target:orendi,targetStage:0=annoyed,Four arms looks useful, but I really can't get over the constant shouting.  Can't you pipe down?
-3-female_must_strip,target:orendi,targetStage:0=frustrated,Hey, Earth-girl.  Or wherever you're from.  There's this thing called an <i>indoor</i> voice.
-3-female_must_strip,target:arwen,targetStage:0=confused,Hey, what's all this about the <i>middle</i> of Earth?  Is there a spot underground that only you elf-people get to live in?
-3-female_must_strip,target:arwen,targetStage:0=confused,And I call <i>Meia</i> pale.  You look almost ghostly...is that just the way you elves are?
-3-female_must_strip,target:arwen,targetStage:0=confused,Hey, what's up with those pointy ears?  And the pale, Meia-like skin?  You're a strange one, "elf" girl.
-3-female_must_strip,target:arwen,targetStage:0=confused,So you call yourself an elf, right?  Is that another word for "Earthling with crazy ears"?  Because you look human otherwise.
-3-female_must_strip,target:neo,targetStage:0=laughing,My, you Earth girls have so much on your minds!  And it's apparently content to stay there.
-3-female_must_strip,target:neo,targetStage:0=interested,So, Miss Motormouth, how's life?  Or the weather?  Or your family?  Or <i>anything</i>?
-3-female_must_strip,target:neo,targetStage:0=teasing,I guess you're too tiny to fit a voice box in the model.  Don't feel bad--you're quite expressive, dear.
-3-female_must_strip,target:neo,targetStage:0=vain,I guess I'm doing enough talking for the both of us.  And hey--that adorable two-toned hair is a statement unto itself!
-3-female_must_strip,target:navi,targetStage:0=laughing,...Yeah, I can see why you'd be comfortable here.  We'd need a computer scan to find your vagina.
-3-female_must_strip,target:navi,targetStage:0=interested,You know, I tease Earth girls about growing up all small, but <i>wow</i>.  Now I just feel bad.
-3-female_must_strip,target:navi,targetStage:0=smug,At least you've got those wings to buzz around to <i>our</i> height.  Inferiority complex, sweetie?
-3-female_must_strip,target:navi,targetStage:0=bored,Well, there goes any chance of getting a <i>good look</i> at what Earth girls have got.  You <i>are</i> from Earth, right?
-3-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:6=laughing,Even with all that, you're still forced to be naked?  It's official--you're totally into this.
-3-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:6=teasing,Even with your little flower setup, dearie, I think you're out of options.  Cough up the good stuff--I'm convinced you want to.
-3-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:6=vain,<i>That</i> ought to do it, unless you've got more of the plant kingdom at your disposal.  Isn't this what you wanted, playing this game?
-3-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:6=seductive,Oh, I'm sure you're cute, dear--I remember your butt!  Besides...I seriously doubt this isn't turning you on.
-3-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0=excited,Omigosh!  <i>Omigosh</i>!  You are just the <i>cutest</i> little thing, Nagisa!  You're practically a little girl--who forced you to be here?
-3-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0=seductive,<i>Ohhhh</i>, you're the most adorable little cinnamon roll of a girl, Nagisa!  Who rolled you in sugar before forcing you to come here?
-3-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0=seductive,<i>You're such a sweet little thing, Nagisa</i>!  My heart melts every time you stammer.  Did you lose a bet to be here?
-3-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0=seductive,How'd this sugary-sweet cutie in a school uniform end up in this seedy place?  I just want to <i>squeeze</i> you, not strip you!
-3-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0=seductive,And I thought Earth girls were cold-blooded organ harvesters.  You couldn't harvest a <i>plant</i>, cutie!  How'd you get here?
-3-female_must_strip,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=laughing,And I thought <i>I</i> was trying to be seductive!  Here comes Miss Succubus, decked out in her Halloween costume.
-3-female_must_strip,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=smug,Don't think you're slipping that past me, honey.  We have Halloween on Mejare...and I've dressed as a succubus before, yes.
-3-female_must_strip,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=interested,Nice costume, Miss Seductress.  Looks like I have competition for all my man-hunting tonight.
-3-female_must_strip,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=teasing,Mejare has stories of succubi, too...they really know how to tire a woman out.  I guess you must have a lot of fun with men here.
-3-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=vain,Omigosh, are you <i>filming</i> this?  Look this way--over here!  Get every angle you can!
-3-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=vain,You're <i>broadcasting</i> this?  To a <i>live audience</i>?  This is a dream come true--now <i>all of Earth</i> will witness my beauty!
-3-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=vain,Omigosh!  <i>Omigosh</i>!  You're <i>broadcasting</i> this to people all around Earth?  Maybe I'll finally become a model!
-3-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=seductive,You're <i>filming</i> this?  Omigosh--normally I have to get Barnette to capture my beauty on camera!  You're so sweet!
-3-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=vain,I hope you don't think that camera is going to scare me away.  I may be a wanted criminal, but I'm also <i>beautiful</i>!
-3-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=vain,You picked a good table to film, honey.  The only thing that loves me more than Barnette is a camera!
-3-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, girlie, someone told me you're a model on Earth...is that true?  I'd like to get in on that...
-3-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0=teasing,You're pretty cute, honey, but I hear people like legs on their models...better hope <i>I</i> don't hit the scene.
-3-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0=vain,Hey now, sweetheart.  You're cute, but there's no need to brag about being a model...not when a <i>Mejarian's</i> on the scene.
-3-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0=teasing,Don't be so full of yourself, Miss Model...I'd be a model, too, if not for Mejare's pesky little corrupt government.
-3-female_must_strip,target:calisto,targetStage:0=interested,What's up, Miss Pantsuit?  You sure laugh a lot for someone dressed so prim-and-proper.
-3-female_must_strip,target:calisto,targetStage:0=laughing,You some kind of businesswoman, Miss Yuck-it-up?  How could such an esteemed professional be so <i>depraved</i> as to play this?
-3-female_must_strip,target:calisto,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey there, Chuckles!  You look more conservative than I've ever <i>dreamed</i> of being...and yet here you are, stripping with me.
-3-female_must_strip,target:calisto,targetStage:0=teasing,Something funny, Miss Formalwear?  Make sure this nasty pirate doesn't put a ransom on your very professional head.
-3-female_must_strip,target:amy_rose,targetStage:0=confused,You're, uh, looking a little pink there.  And what's up with those ears?
-3-female_must_strip,target:amy_rose,targetStage:0=confused,I know I joke about Earth girls being aliens, but, uh, you really do look kind of weird.  What's with all the...<i>fur</i>?
-3-female_must_strip,target:amy_rose,targetStage:0=confused,Wait, did they say you're a...a <i>hedgehog</i> or something?  Is that some kind of animal?  That would explain the, uh, pink...and ears.
-3-female_must_strip,target:amy_rose,targetStage:0=confused,...I really can't make heads or tails of you.  You kind of <i>look</i> like you should have a tail, what with that fur and all.
-3-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:0=confused,...You OK, honey?  You look a little...<i>dead</i>.
-3-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:0=shocked,...OK.  So.  You're a ghost.  I can work with this...<i>but please put down the knife</i>.
-3-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:0=bored,Guess there's no stabbing <i>you</i> if things get hairy, is there?  ...Not that I was planning on doing that to anyone else.
-3-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:0=laughing,A...ghost.  OK.  Well, at least this means I can still annoy Meia if I get shot down and killed.
-3-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:0=awkward,...Well, I <i>do</i> appreciate learning that there's an afterlife, but it's not why I came to Earth.
-3-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0=vain,How's a young little thing like you a model if you're still in school?  <i>I've</i> got modeling potential, but it's hard for pirates to land a job.
-3-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0=smug,A student <i>and</i> a model?  And here I am, with all my beauty, and still a lowly criminal.  At least I have my wonderful piloting skills.
-3-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0=vain,<i>If only my circumstances let me be the beautiful model I've always dreamed of being</i>!  Guess I'll have to settle for death-defying pirate.
-3-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0=teasing,You're a lucky one, Earth-girl.  I never had the benefit of much schooling, nor the opportunity to be a model.  So cherish what you've got!
-3-female_must_strip,target:annie,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey there, Plain-Jane.  What's brought you here, with all your layers?  Looking to overcome some shyness?
-3-female_must_strip,target:annie,targetStage:0=smug,Exhibit A of Earth girls' ridiculous conservatism.  Can't you appreciate your own body instead of hiding it?  Must be men doing this to you.
-3-female_must_strip,target:annie,targetStage:0=laughing,What's up, cutie?  You seem to be making every effort to hide that cuteness, actually.  Just look at those packed-on layers.
-3-female_must_strip,target:annie,targetStage:0=vain,I guess I'd be a little shyer about my body if I had your height and plain looks, but come on.  Confidence makes <i>any</i> woman look better!
-3-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0=laughing,Hey there, short stuff.  I think you might actually be shorter than Hibiki, which is a challenge even for women.
-3-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0=laughing,You said you fight "Titans"?  I imagine that's everyone, considering your stature.
-3-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0=laughing,"Titans," huh?  You mean like me next to you?  Or anyone, really?
-3-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0=interested,How's the weather down there, at the very bottom of Earth?  You really need to drink your milk, honey.
-3-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0,marker:fama_and_oma=vain,...See, <i>this</i> is why I'm going to be the Fama for Barnette.  I don't want our daughters growing up all short from lack of milk.
-3-female_must_strip,target:sonya,targetStage:0=teasing,I can appreciate military women--they're always so very <i>fit</i>.  Try not to wring my neck for my horrible pirate crimes.
-3-female_must_strip,target:sonya,targetStage:0=vain,<i>Please don't hurt me, O fearsome woman soldier.  I have a girlfriend waiting for me back home</i>!
-3-female_must_strip,target:sonya,targetStage:0=vain,Looking pretty muscular, Miss Militia.  Please try to see this beautiful pirate's point of view before sticking your knee in her back.
-3-female_must_strip,target:sonya,targetStage:0=teasing,I imagine you're not too fond of my line of work, Miss Militia.  It's OK--<i>I'm pretty fond of that short blonde hair</i>.
-3-female_must_strip,target:april,targetStage:0=vain,Ooh, do you really report the news?  Be sure to get my good side--oh wait, that's <i>every</i> side!
-3-female_must_strip,target:april,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey there, Jumpsuit.  Someone said you're a reporter--but <i>this</i> pirate doesn't mind a little publicity!
-3-female_must_strip,target:april,targetStage:0=smug,I've been in the media for much worse than a few glory shots, so don't think I'm afraid of that camera, newsgirl.
-3-female_must_strip,target:april,targetStage:0=vain,Hey, newsie, I've got all the story you need right here.  Your Earth viewers have never seen a body like mine!
-3-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0=vain,Ooh, you're into art?  Do you think you could paint a portrait of me?  Maybe frame it in your collection to capture my eternal beauty?
-3-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0=teasing,Ooh, so you're an <i>artist</i>?  I know a particularly handsome man that can paint, too...think you could capture me better?
-3-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0=vain,Did you say you go to school with men?  I was never that big on school--except for art, where we could finally appreciate <i>beauty</i>!
-3-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0=vain,Students tend to be such bores--like that egghead Parfet.  But an <i>art</i> student?  Now we're talking--my whole body is art!
-3-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:0=teasing,Ooh, an <i>assassin</i>.  I hope there's no bounty on my head!
-3-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:0=stretching,Forgive this pirate for being a little on edge around an <i>assassin</i>.  There's a reward for my head, no doubt!
-3-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:0=vain,You assassins always act so tough on the ground.  Let's see you take me in a dogfight!
-3-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:0=teasing,You're a cute little thing, Miss Assassin.  I guess that helps in your line of work--people lower their guards.
-3-female_must_strip,target:blake_v4,targetStage:0=laughing,Way to go and expose your entire midriff there, Blake.  Who do you think you are, Dita?  <i>Me</i>?
-3-female_must_strip,target:blake_v4,targetStage:0=interested,Nice vest you're rocking there, honey.  But you forgot to cover up your midsection...like me.
-3-female_must_strip,target:blake_v4,targetStage:0=smug,Taking a few fashion tips from <i>me</i>, are you, Blake?  What with that midriff fully on display and all.
-3-female_must_strip,target:blake_v4,targetStage:0=teasing,Well, aren't <i>you</i> looking more exposed than usual?  But as far as exposure goes, the midsection's a good choice.
-3-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0=smug,You know, I'd call Meia the strong, silent type...but she still speaks <i>occasionally</i>.
-3-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0=laughing,Slow on the uptake?  The "strong, silent type" doesn't mean <i>literally</i> never speaking, you know.
-3-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0=vain,Oh, don't feel bad.  I know you're speechless at the sight of me--but I'll do enough talking for both of us!
-3-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0=teasing,Stunned into speechlessness?  I'm flattered, but really, honey, you can talk to me.  I won't mind.
-3-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, Chell.  If I'm the most gorgeous woman you've ever met, don't say anything.
-3-female_must_strip,target:chara,targetStage:0=bored,<i>Yeesh</i>.  Being as beautiful as I am, I try to let other girls down easy, but...you're hard to look at.
-3-female_must_strip,target:chara,targetStage:0=angry,...<i>Ew</i>.  I really can't tell where your face begins and your body ends.
-3-female_must_strip,target:chara,targetStage:0=smug,...It's times like these that I <i>really</i> appreciate how fortunate I am to be born this beautiful.  Take a look at the alternative.
-3-female_must_strip,target:chara,targetStage:0=annoyed,As if you weren't ugly enough, you've got this horrible look in your eyes.  What's your problem?
-3-female_must_strip,target:daria,targetStage:0=laughing,Way to half-ass your outfit, honey.  You look like you picked out whatever fell on you when you opened your closet!
-3-female_must_strip,target:daria,targetStage:0=interested,...So is the "zero-effort" look how you attract Earth men?  Have I been going at this all wrong?
-3-female_must_strip,target:daria,targetStage:0=smug,I should have known--men are too simple to understand complex outfits, so they respond better to cobbled-together looks like yours.
-3-female_must_strip,target:daria,targetStage:0=laughing,Gotta be honest here, sweetheart--you don't look like the type to be playing this.  Those glasses aren't helping you pick out appealing clothes.
-3-female_must_strip,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:0=interested,...Can I maybe just call you "DMG" for short?  Because <i>Dark Magician Girl</i> is a hell of a mouthful.
-3-female_must_strip,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:0,marker:fama_and_oma=confused,...Don't you have an actual name?  You know, like the one your Fama gives you?
-3-female_must_strip,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:0=teasing,You've really got to give yourself a snappier nickname, dearie...men aren't bright enough to remember that many words.
-3-female_must_strip,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:0=stretching,If you really <i>are</i> a magician, color me interested...but that clunky name could use a shortening or two.
-3-female_must_strip,target:seven,targetStage:0=teasing,Seems bodysuits are more popular among spacegoers than even <i>I</i> figured.  Works for me--I like your figure.
-3-female_must_strip,target:seven,targetStage:0=seductive,<i>My, my, honey</i>!  You've got some interesting decorations, but that suit is making me fall in love already.
-3-female_must_strip,target:seven,targetStage:0=vain,I really ought to try out one of those bodysuits myself...or maybe stuff Barnette in one.  They're just so <i>revealing</i>!
-3-female_must_strip,target:seven,targetStage:0=vain,Those jumpsuits really are the best, especially when you're in low gravity.  The enemy should know how beautiful you are!
-3-female_must_strip,target:dawn,targetStage:0=confused,What'd you say you raised?  Those little <i>Poker</i>--whatevers?  Is that why you're playing this game?
-3-female_must_strip,target:dawn,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, dearie, that exotic blue hair will take you further than weird animal training--you should be a model for shampoo or something.
-3-female_must_strip,target:dawn,targetStage:0=confused,Mejare has barely any animals at all, so this whole "pokey-mon" thing is lost on me.  And they just do whatever you say?
-3-female_must_strip,target:dawn,targetStage:0=laughing,So could you train <i>men</i> the way you do these <i>poker</i>-whatevers?  Because <i>that</i> would be quite interesting...
-3-female_must_strip,target:elaine,targetStage:0=seductive,And what do we have here?  An <i>Earth</i> pirate?  And with a sword, to boot!  Interesting...
-3-female_must_strip,target:elaine,targetStage:0=teasing,I see even Earth pirates understand the subtle elegance of a blade!  And you've got some <i>luxurious</i> hair yourself.
-3-female_must_strip,target:elaine,targetStage:0=seductive,Oho--a fellow pirate?  I'd absolutely <i>love</i> to have a drink later--maybe you could teach me how to handle my sword better.
-3-female_must_strip,target:elaine,targetStage:0=seductive,<i>Well, now</i>!  You Earth pirates don't dress like we do on Mejare--but your choice of weapon isn't too far off.  Can you show me around?
-3-female_must_strip,target:elena,targetStage:0=teasing,Little Miss Princess wants to play strip poker, does she?  Well, I hope you don't mind if this nasty pirate holds you hostage.
-3-female_must_strip,target:elena,targetStage:0=laughing,Looking a little out of your element, Miss Blueblood.  Gonna prove that you're really better than the rest of us like your title implies?
-3-female_must_strip,target:elena,targetStage:0=smug,Look at Miss Princess, lugging around a scepter just to prove she's better than the peons.  We'll see how you enjoy stripping down like us.
-3-female_must_strip,target:elena,targetStage:0=annoyed,Royals really get on my nerves, you know...mostly because I'm <i>not</i> one, despite actually being better-looking.
-3-female_must_strip,target:daphne,targetStage:0=smug,Oh good, a fellow blonde...and tall, too.  Wasn't sure Earth girls could fit either category.
-3-female_must_strip,target:daphne,targetStage:0=vain,You're not a bad looker yourself, honey.  Must be our wonderful blonde genetics that inform the rest of our bodies!
-3-female_must_strip,target:daphne,targetStage:0=vain,You solve mysteries, is that right?  Well...there's no mystery about how wonderful it is to be blonde.
-3-female_must_strip,target:daphne,targetStage:0=stretching,<i>Ho-hum</i>.  Another blonde in a dress...I'm just kidding, you're still cute.
-3-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0=excited,Ooh, Sei, you're such a cutie!  You look <i>just like</i> my squadron leader, Meia--that short blue hair is to <i>die</i> for!
-3-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0=teasing,Short blue hair and shoulder armor?  You're the spitting image of my boss, Sei--too bad she's at another table!
-3-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0=seductive,Short blue hair?  Omigosh, Sei, my boss Meia looks <i>just like</i> you!  And she could really use a girlfriend.
-3-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0=seductive,Sei!  That's your name, right?  You look like my boss Meia with that short-cut blue hair.  Your eyes are a lot softer, though.
-3-female_must_strip,target:evie,targetStage:0=vain,So what's your story?  You can cast magic spells or something?  If it's true, sign me up--it'll be another wonderful thing about me!
-3-female_must_strip,target:evie,targetStage:0=vain,Some might call my <i>beauty</i> magical...I'm inclined to agree.
-3-female_must_strip,target:evie,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, honey.  Cast a spell on <i>me</i>...one that makes me even prettier.  Now <i>that</i> would be magic!
-3-female_must_strip,target:evie,targetStage:0=interested,Alright, I've seen enough crazy Paksis-magic to believe your tales.  But why don't you put your money where your mouth is?
-3-female_must_strip,target:faye,targetStage:0=smug,Beautiful hair, makeup, spacefaring?  With <i>both</i> of us running around, this table's going to get sick of the archetype.
-3-female_must_strip,target:faye,targetStage:0=laughing,Do we have a fellow star-crossing seductress on our hands?  I'm not sure there's enough meat for both of us.
-3-female_must_strip,target:faye,targetStage:0=teasing,<i>Hey, good-lookin'.</i>  Trying to steal my thunder with the "seductress-from-space" angle?  I don't mind--<i>I like women, too</i>.
-3-female_must_strip,target:faye,targetStage:0=seductive,You didn't doll yourself up like that just to please some <i>men</i>, did you?  Come show this fellow spacefarer what you can do.
-3-female_must_strip,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0=teasing,Totally devoted to scarlet, eh?  It certainly gets the heart racing...<i>and my appetite stirred</i>.
-3-female_must_strip,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0=vain,Maybe <i>I</i> should get a fanciful nickname like Scarlet Witch...but not if it means restricting myself to one measly color.
-3-female_must_strip,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0=seductive,What do you think would be a good nickname for me, dear?  <i>The Black Pirate</i>?  I can't pull off all-red like you do.
-3-female_must_strip,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0=stretching,I wonder if all-red would look good on me.  I'm a pirate--I don't exactly have my pick of the litter with clothes!
-3-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:0=laughing,Hey, Kitty-cat.  You're supposed to strip <i>during</i> the game, not <i>before</i> it.
-3-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:0=interested,Nice Halloween costume, Kitty, but maybe you should have picked something a little more complex for this game.
-3-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:0=smug,Not too interested in winning, huh, Kitty-cat?  Unless you've brought some yarn-balls you plan on counting.
-3-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:0=smug,I only know about cats from Mejare's zoos...they only showed the females, of course.  But they were definitely more covered than <i>you</i> are.
-3-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:1=awkward,So, Miss Kitty, you, uh, going to shave your bottom fur now?  ...I'd like that.
-3-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:1=frustrated,Knowing that that's fur now makes me <i>really</i> want to see you shaved...Mejare likes shaving.
-3-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:1=bored,Is the bottom fur going now?  Because I <i>hate</i> hair...except on the head.
-3-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:1=bored,Please tell me you're shaving everything else.  That's sort of the style on Mejare, so it's what I know.
-3-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0=smug,Dear god, girl, you'd cower if a light breeze rolled in.  What's the big deal with a little <i>exposure</i>?
-3-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0=seductive,You are just <i>so</i> cute.  How do you feel about women, little Miss?  <i>Do my breasts bother you</i>?
-3-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0=vain,Shy around nudity, sweetie?  Did the big, bad Earth men beat this into you?  Just <i>enjoy</i> yourself...
-3-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0=laughing,You're such a nervous wreck that I just feel bad for teasing you.  Way to ruin my fun.
-3-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0=interested,Looks like this place attracts more spacefarers than I gave it credit for.  Fine by me--at least someone knows where I'm coming from.
-3-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0=seductive,What planet are you from, Miss Starshine?  Your fabulous blonde hair is winning me over as we speak.
-3-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0=vain,Guess I can't learn about Earth girls from <i>you</i>--but hey, it's nice to know there's other gorgeous spacefarers out there.  Who like stripping.
-3-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0=vain,Ooh, you cut your hair short like Meia does.  But it's wonderful blonde like mine--<i>space is so vast in its variety</i>!
-3-female_must_strip,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=seductive,Oh?  And what do we have here, besides the most adorably shy little woman I've ever seen?
-3-female_must_strip,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=stretching,Such a cutie...and in a traditional-looking dress!  Hard to believe someone so shy would even be here.
-3-female_must_strip,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=seductive,Something wrong, honey?  <i>You've hardly been looking me in the eye</i>.  It's OK, I don't bite.
-3-female_must_strip,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=vain,Why so shy, Elizabeth?  Confidence makes women ten times as beautiful--just look at me!
-3-female_must_strip,target:shantae,targetStage:0=teasing,Ooh, I think that dark complexion is <i>exotic</i>--so do most Mejarians.  You got a thing for women, Miss Genie?
-3-female_must_strip,target:shantae,targetStage:0=seductive,So what's a "genie," anyway?  Does that mean "cute chocolate-flavored girl"?  Because I think I like genies, then.
-3-female_must_strip,target:shantae,targetStage:0=seductive,I like your style, Miss Genie!  You're as revealing as my girlfriend Barnette--a little tanner, though.
-3-female_must_strip,target:shantae,targetStage:0=teasing,Ooh, the way you move your hips is <i>exquisite</i>, Miss Genie!  I want to learn how to add a little vanilla flavoring to that, if you follow.
-3-female_must_strip,target:penny,targetStage:0=smug,Looks like we've found an Earth girl who's just decided to embrace the whole "boring conservatism" stereotype.  At least your hair is a fiery red.
-3-female_must_strip,target:penny,targetStage:0=teasing,That fiery red hair contrasts your rather plain outfit.  But it's not a bad look overall!
-3-female_must_strip,target:penny,targetStage:0=vain,<i>Finally</i>, a normal-looking Earth girl.  I need a measuring stick to compare all these superpowered weirdos to...all you've got is that red hair.
-3-female_must_strip,target:penny,targetStage:0=seductive,Good, a civilian girl.  So many people at this bar are such colorful characters--oh, but your hair is pretty vibrant, I guess.
-3-female_must_strip,target:daisy,targetStage:0=smug,Ohoho.  Miss Boring-old-Brunette puts on a fancy store-bought dress and suddenly thinks she's better than the rest of us.
-3-female_must_strip,target:daisy,targetStage:0=interested,So, "Princesses" are like rulers, right?  So what makes <i>you</i> so special, girlie?
-3-female_must_strip,target:daisy,targetStage:0=annoyed,I've never subscribed to the idea of royalty.  What, some plain-jane with a chip on her shoulder just <i>decides</i> she's better than me?
-3-female_must_strip,target:daisy,targetStage:0=vain,So what if I had to steal my dress?  I'm still more beautiful than Miss Too-Big-for-her-Brooches here, with her servants and fancy title.
-3-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=interested,Hey, Eyebags, you gonna stay awake all game?  You look like you're drifting away already.
-3-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=teasing,Talk about never leaving the house.  You look like you've never seen sunlight--and you're dozing off as we speak!
-3-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=smug,Gotta be honest, sweetie--between the pale skin and the vacant look in your eyes, you're really reminding me of a zombie.
-3-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=confused,So do you work super hard all day at your job?  Why do you look all gaunt and drowsy?  Get some beauty sleep, woman.
-3-female_must_strip,target:shazza,targetStage:0=smug,Quite the interesting accent you've got there.  I can't quite call it refined, but then again, I <i>am</i> a filthy pirate.
-3-female_must_strip,target:shazza,targetStage:0=stretching,I guess when I lead a life of crime, I can't get away with calling you uncivilized-sounding.  Actions mean so much more!
-3-female_must_strip,target:shazza,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=laughing,Interesting dialect you have on Planet Australia.  Don't you ever get tired of misunderstanding each other?
-3-female_must_strip,target:shazza,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=laughing,This <i>Australia</i> planet certainly has a way with words...mostly for making them incomprehensible.
-3-female_must_strip,target:chica,targetStage:0=confused,...You know, I was shown films as a girl about how men were horrible monsters.  You're about what they looked like in those.
-3-female_must_strip,target:chica,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>Ew</i>!  <i>Eek</i>!  <i>G-get away</i>!  <i>Stop</i>!  <i>What are you</i>?
-3-female_must_strip,target:chica,targetStage:0=annoyed,...I really came here to meet some Earth women.  Not...whatever <i>this</i> is supposed to be.  Besides terrifying.
-3-female_must_strip,target:chica,targetStage:0=angry,...What the hell am I looking at?  I wanted some cute girls, not a--a mechanical monstrosity!
-3-female_must_strip,target:chica,targetStage:0=bored,You're a <i>robot</i>?  So like, you're Pyoro if he were designed by a blind woman?
-3-female_must_strip,target:ciri,targetStage:0=smug,A <i>witcher</i>, eh?  Is that Earth dialect for witch?  Because I got called a witch for possession of Duero's sex book.
-3-female_must_strip,target:ciri,targetStage:0=stretching,Is it <i>witcher</i> or <i>witch</i>?  Or, shall I say, <i>which</i> is it?
-3-female_must_strip,target:ciri,targetStage:0=vain,So is a "witcher" even witchier than a witch?  I've been called a witch just for wanting to see what men have got in their pants.
-3-female_must_strip,target:ciri,targetStage:0=smug,Forgive me for not being impressed with the term "witcher."  How <i>could</i> I be when all it takes for that on Mejare is a libido?
-3-female_must_strip,target:sharla,targetStage:0=teasing,Good thing you're a medic, because that mysterious dark complexion is making my heart beat ever faster.
-3-female_must_strip,target:sharla,targetStage:0=seductive,Do you know how many women on Mejare are dark-skinned, Miss Medic?  Not enough, I say...even my Barnette is just a little tan.
-3-female_must_strip,target:sharla,targetStage:0=vain,Oh, Miss Medic?  I think I'm coming down with something--<i>love for your chocolate flavoring</i>!
-3-female_must_strip,target:sharla,targetStage:0=teasing,You dress pretty casually for a medic, but that exotic dark skin is helping me overlook your shoddy sense of professionalism.
-3-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, you're a cutie!  Yet surprisingly sturdy on your feet, what with all that armor.  <i>Don't bowl me right over</i>!
-3-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=laughing,Hi there, darling!  You must be pretty tough to lug all that armor around.  <i>Afraid I'll stab you</i>?
-3-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=seductive,What's with that armor, sweetheart?  You'd be a lot cuter without it...I know I'm a pirate, but I'd never kill someone as cute as you.
-3-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=vain,Adorable hairstyle, cute face--but all that armor!  You a soldier, dear?  <i>Oh, please forgive my horrid piracy</i>!
-3-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=teasing,Ooh, you've got quite the set of muscles on you.  Shame Meia's not here.  She'd totally melt right in front of you!
-3-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=seductive,Check out those legs, hot stuff!  You look like you could lift up the whole table with those things alone--good thing Meia's not here to fawn over you.
-3-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=seductive,Omigosh, you should meet Meia, my boss--she's really icy, but women with muscles totally get her going.  And she'd try not to show it!
-3-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, Miss Muscles, you into women?  Because my squadron leader Meia is all about exercise, and she <i>desperately</i> needs a girlfriend.
-3-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=smug,Where'd you say you were from?  Planet <i>Korea</i>?  Well then, it seems Korea and Mejare share a fashion sense...
-3-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,marker:planet-countries=teasing,You're a cutie, Miss Bodysuit, if a little on the short side.  Is that just how they make women over on Planet Korea?
-3-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0=vain,If only Meia were here.  She dresses just like you do, D.Va...we should find out who wears it better!
-3-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0=seductive,You're an adorable little thing, D.Va!  All wrapped up in that cute bodysuit, just like a certain <i>other</i> pilot I know.

-2-male_human_must_strip=stretching,By all means, ~player~.  Who <i>knows</i> what my instincts will do?
-2-male_human_must_strip=teasing,Here's your chance to pry me away from a lifetime of women.
-2-male_human_must_strip=interested,Hey, ~player~, show me something I won't know how to react to.
-2-male_human_must_strip=vain,Anything you've got that books can't teach me, ~player~?
-2-male_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=smug,I really thought <i>masturbating</i> in front of a man would finally distract him, but I guess that Tarakkian competitiveness runs deep.
-2-male_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=smug,Any more lucky runs, ~player~?  Not sure why you'd want them, when you could be masturbating with me instead.
-2-male_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=interested,Sure you don't want to just throw it all away and come join an exotic woman in self-pleasure, ~player~?  Think about it.
-2-male_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=vain,Men are so physical and blunt.  Why they'd be all proud of a poker winning streak is beyond me.
-2-male_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=seductive-2,Teehee.  I had a feeling masturbating in front of you might finally shake you up a bit.
-2-male_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=smug,Is something distracting you, handsome?  Something exotic, gorgeous, female, and masturbating?
-2-male_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=seductive-2,Oh, come on, ~player~.  I'm fairly certain Mejarian and Earth vaginas are the same.  What are you staring at?
-2-male_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=seductive-2,Don't you have a game to win, handsome?  Or are you totally overcome by my beauty?  It's so <i>embarrassing</i>!
-2-male_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=seductive,My, my, my.  Gearing up to join me, ~player~?  I'm certainly in the mood to get some seed from you.
-2-male_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=teasing,Keep going, ~player~...I want to see you nude, and what it'll do to me when I'm like this.
-2-male_must_strip=stretching,By all means, ~name~.  Who <i>knows</i> what my instincts will do?
-2-male_must_strip=teasing,Here's your chance to pry me away from a lifetime of women.
-2-male_must_strip=interested,Hey, ~name~, show me something I won't know how to react to.
-2-male_must_strip=vain,Anything you've got that books can't teach me, ~name~?
-2-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:5=teasing,It's now or never, Little Dungeon Bot.  Going to look me in the eyes for once?
-2-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:5=laughing,I spy with my little eye something you can still take off, Dungeon Robo.  That's because my eyes are uncovered.
-2-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:5=interested,Sure you don't want to part with that blindfold, Mr. Robo-man?  Are you aware of the alternative, darling?
-2-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:5=interested,Looks like Little Dungeon Bot is all out of dungeon items...well, except for the most striking one of all.
-2-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:2=vain,I can't get over how cute you are, honey...but seriously, what's with the angel outfit?  Men are no angels.
-2-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:2=smug,Men have always struck as more <i>beastly</i> than angelic...which is fine by me.  So why do you dress like one?
-2-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:2=confused,So, uh, I read about angels as a girl, but they were always women.  Why are you dolled-up like one, anyway?
-2-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:2=confused,Do those wings detach?  They look pretty convincing, and the rest of your angel outfit is pretty good.  Why do you have that on, anyway?
-2-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:2=smug,Hey, so what's with those "Neighbors" you keep talking about?  I mean, Mejare certainly doesn't get along with <i>its</i> neighbors.
-2-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:2=seductive,Hey, Handsome, when you say you fight Neighbors, how big a scale are we talking?  Let's just say neighboring planet Tarak isn't our best friend.
-2-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:2=interested,Who are these "Neighbors" you say you fight?  Is this like a front-lawn kind of dispute, or do you mean as a solider?
-2-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:2=interested,Did you say you fight neighbors, darling?  Mejarians usually fight their neighbors over gardening, unless we're talking planets.
-2-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:4=shocked,<i>Eep</i>!  O-oh, you <i>can</i> talk?  B-but...why didn't you?
-2-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:4=interested,...So are you over your fear of women now?  Is that what the grunting was all about?
-2-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:4=seductive,Oh, you <i>can</i> talk.  Did my beauty make you clam up, cutie?
-2-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:4=smug,Well, that solves <i>that</i> mystery.  Come on and join us in the land of language like a civilized person.
-2-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:4=smug,Oh, good, you can talk.  I had really lost all hope for men's intelligence for a while there.
-2-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:4=shocked,<i>Ack</i>!  Wha--o-oh, you're done screaming!  Uh...OK.
-2-male_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=smug,Is something distracting you, handsome?  Something exotic, gorgeous, female, and masturbating?
-2-male_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=seductive-2,Oh, come on, ~name~.  I'm fairly certain Mejarian and Earth vaginas are the same.  What are you staring at?
-2-male_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=seductive-2,Don't you have a game to win, handsome?  Or are you totally overcome by my beauty?  It's so <i>embarrassing</i>!
-2-male_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=teasing,My, my, my.  Gearing up to join me, ~name~?  I'm certainly in the mood to get some seed from you.
-2-male_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=excited,Keep going, ~name~...I want to see you nude, and what it'll do to me when I'm like this.
-2-male_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=smug,I really thought <i>masturbating</i> in front of a man would finally distract him, but I guess that Tarakkian competitiveness runs deep.
-2-male_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=smug,Any more lucky runs, ~name~?  Not sure why you'd want them, when you could be masturbating with me instead.
-2-male_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=interested,Sure you don't want to just throw it all away and come join an exotic woman in self-pleasure, ~player~.  Think about it.

-2-male_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=seductive-2,Teehee.  I had a feeling masturbating in front of you might finally shake you up a bit.
-2-female_human_must_strip=excited,So common of a sight for me.  But I can still masturbate to it just fine.
-2-female_human_must_strip=interested,As mundane as this is to a Mejarian, you're pretty enough for me to work with it.
-2-female_human_must_strip=teasing,Keep on losing, ~player~.  This is <i>much</i> more fun.
-2-female_human_must_strip=interested,Your turn, ~player~, and <i>my</i> benefit.
-2-female_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=seductive,What's with this sudden spell of losses, ~player~?  Could it be...you're feeling a certain attraction you hadn't before?
-2-female_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=seductive-2,Ah, a wandering eye and a miserable poker streak.  Classic signs of a woman in love.
-2-female_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=seductive,I know that lustful, distracted look, ~player~...it's the same one Barnette and I gave each other when we first met.
-2-female_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=excited,Ready to join me, ~player~?  Women are always better off sticking together in this big universe of ours.
-2-female_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=seductive-2,You're stripping so fast, ~player~!  I like women's bodies...and I don't think I can keep up with this!
-2-female_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=vain,Broke your focus, did I?  Maybe a little?  Come on, ~player~, stroke my ego here.
-2-female_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=vain,I can't fault a lucky run.  Every victory over the Harvest we have takes some luck in the end...and a whole lot of love.
-2-female_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=teasing,You go, girlie.  Keep up those winning streaks, since you're so obsessed with winning for some reason.
-2-female_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=vain,You've got more fighting spirit down the stretch than I do.  Me, a pirate!  I can't help but root for you a little.
-2-female_must_strip=excited,So common of a sight for me.  But I can still masturbate to it just fine.
-2-female_must_strip=interested,As mundane as this is to a Mejarian, you're pretty enough for me to work with it.
-2-female_must_strip=seductive,Keep on losing, ~name~.  This is <i>much</i> more fun.
-2-female_must_strip=interested,Your turn, ~name~, and <i>my</i> benefit.
-2-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:6=bored,The storm is almost over...or maybe this is just the calm before it.
-2-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:6=bored,I think I'd prefer the <i>Harvest's</i> company at this point.
-2-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:6=bored,Oh, you're still here.  Why not just strip more than one thing at a time?  Well, too late.
-2-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:6=bored,I still don't know who made you wait this long to show what you wanted.
-2-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:4=bored,...Maybe I should stop hitting on men.  Look what it does to you...
-2-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:4=annoyed,Is this really what Earth women are like?  She's an outlier, right?
-2-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:4=frustrated,Seems running the Harvest has a tendency to scramble Earth women's brains...and make them want to play poker.
-2-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:4=bored,...At least she's losing quickly.  Easy to do when you barely check the cards.
-2-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:2=interested,Honey, you'd be better off putting some meat on your bones than trying desperately to show them off.
-2-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:2=bored,Sweetie, you're a twig.  This is just unhealthy...as unhealthy as you look.
-2-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:2=confused,Are you suffering from this "anorexia" I keep reading about?  Eating disorders?  Do men do this to you?
-2-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:2=vain,Talk about needing a girlfriend.  See what happens when you're never validated?
-2-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:3=bored,Is there a doctor in the building?  One specializing in mental health?
-2-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:3=frustrated,...This isn't funny anymore.  Now I'm just worried about you.
-2-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:3=frustrated,...This is getting old.  <i>I'm</i> getting old listening to this.
-2-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:3=annoyed,What a surprise.  Intentionally throwing the game tends to make you lose.
-2-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:5=frustrated,Oh God, she's finally doing it.  Be very afraid...unless you Earth people are used to this sort of thing.
-2-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:5=frustrated,Please don't.  I've learned my lesson.  I'll stay on Mejare.
-2-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:5=bored,I'm really appreciating Mejare right now.  Maybe I'll straighten up and get a normal job.
-2-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:5=frustrated,This is the last time I come to Earth.  Even among Mejarian pirate scum, none of us act like this.
-2-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:5=smug,Well, that's that.  Do what you must behind those flowers.
-2-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:5=interested,You can hide yourself with the flowers, honey, but you're naked, so that's a loss in my book.
-2-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:5=smug,Nice try with the foliage, dear, but no one's going to call that clothing.  You're out.
-2-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:5=stretching,<i>And so the frightened little princess falls before her betters.  Even the forest spirits couldn't save her</i>.
-2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=interested,Aw, what's the matter, Meia?  Has the loss of your crewmates hit you <i>that</i> hard?
-2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=stretching,So, you beat me, and now you don't care about winning anymore?  Is that it?
-2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=vain,Couldn't even tag you once.  I already give you a lot of credit, but I guess you deserve a little more.
-2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=smug,I went and blew it, while you haven't lost <i>once</i> yet.  Your opinion of me is more glowing than ever, I'm sure.
-2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=smug,You beat me as badly as I figured you would.  Maybe I'll just get off to the shame of it all.
-2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:1=vain,Don't be so focused on victory, Meia.  Look how much fun <i>I'm</i> having!
-2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:1=teasing,If you knew what's good for you, you'd have lost a long time ago.
-2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:1=stretching,Can't you see the stress melting away from me?  What's so great about winning?
-2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:1=vain,This is <i>so</i> much fun, Meia.  You'll regret this focus on winning when you're twisting and turning in bed tonight.
-2-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:2=confused,So, uh, besides being blue, what's your deal?  You're all sweet and polite now.
-2-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:2=seductive,Can't say I prefer blue hair, but you're certainly a lot sweeter now, honey.  What <i>happened</i>?
-2-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:2=seductive,Normally I like blondes, but at least you're not waving a gun around and cursing anymore.  Nice tradeoff.
-2-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:2=vain,Blue hair is more exotic, but blonde is far more beautiful.  Still, I'll take this polite version of you over the alternative.
-2-female_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=teasing,Broke your focus, did I?  Maybe a little?  Come on, ~name~, stroke my ego here.
-2-female_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=vain,I can't fault a lucky run.  Every victory over the Harvest we have takes some luck in the end...and a whole lot of love.
-2-female_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=stretching,You go, girlie.  Keep up those winning streaks, since you're so obsessed with winning for some reason.
-2-female_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=vain,You've got more fighting spirit down the stretch than I do.  Me, a pirate!  I can't help but root for you a little.
-2-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=smug,Jeez, what a head case.  Good thing she's got her girlfriend here to keep her in check.
-2-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=interested,Running, running, running.  We're not trying to kill you here, you know.
-2-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=teasing,Time for take two, everyone.  Better than the first, perhaps?
-2-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=seductive,And <i>there she goes</i>.  Poor little thing, beaten down by the world.
-2-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:5=smug,Call it woman's intuition, but I think our little fashion show is about to come to an end soon...
-2-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:5=interested,This has been fun, Vriska, but I don't think you can keep this up forever.  That die's got a sick sense of humor.
-2-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:5=interested,Can't you see the writing on the wall, sweetheart?  I like these outfits, but they keep getting skimpier and skimpier.
-2-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:5=laughing,Roll all you want...I think the die's in control here.  And it wants to see some blue skin.
-2-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:3=confused,This is so freaky to me, and I've dealt with the Paksis's weird energy.  Do you just swtich all the time?
-2-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:3=confused,Are you really bouncing back and forth like this all the time?  Like, do you have any friends?
-2-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:3=confused,Must be hard getting to know anyone when you keep losing your memory.  How do you deal with always switching?
-2-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:3=confused,I can't believe you have split personalities.  Where does the other one go?  How do you make friends?
-2-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:3=excited,Here we go again.  This is so <i>exciting</i>!  Every outfit is an adventure!
-2-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:3=excited,This is making me feel so alive!  I love checking out women's fashion!  Show some more!
-2-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:3=seductive,You're so cool, Vriska!  And maybe even a little cute!  What else have you got for me?
-2-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:3=teasing,Don't stop now, cutie!  Any more adorable outfits you've got in store for me?
-2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:3=smug,I think I know what's next.  And you'll undoubtedly be all miserable about it for no reason.
-2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:3=interested,Here it comes.  Just when I need it most, some good-old fashioned Mejarian nudity.
-2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:3=excited,Well, there goes all your decency.  Unless you've got accessories in rather unsavory areas.
-2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:3=teasing,Meia Gisborn always has an escape maneuver, right?  Or maybe just charges straight into battle.
-2-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:5=shocked,Bless you--<i>oh no</i>.
-2-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:5=shocked,Who sneezed--<i>eep!  N-not Launch</i>!
-2-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:5=shocked,<i>Ack!  Why'd you have to sneeze again</i>?
-2-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:5=shocked,<i>Eek!  N-not again!  My heart can't take this</i>!
-2-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:2=teasing,I'm <i>waiting</i>, Vriska!  Don't disappoint me and pick some boring outfit!
-2-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:2=teasing,I'm expecting some good fashion from you, you know!  Don't leave it up to chance!
-2-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:2=smug,Don't you have some way to control that?  I'd rather you showed off something specific.
-2-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:2=teasing,Lay the fashion on me, Vriska!  Fashion from...wherever it is that you live.
-2-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:6=interested,I appreciated the fashion show, Vriska, but really, I doubt you've got fuel left in the tank.
-2-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:6=stretching,Just going to keep on trying, huh?  Give it up already.
-2-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:6=stretching,Poor girl just can't control her gambling problem.  Now she'll be nude for it.
-2-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:6=interested,And is this magically going to restock your wardrobe?  I doubt it.
-2-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:4=teasing,Hey, honey...take <i>my</i> dress, and I'll love you forever.
-2-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:4=smug,Feel free to flatter me and steal my dress, dear!  It's...over there somewhere.
-2-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:4=seductive,Say, Vriska...can that die steal <i>my</i> dress?  <i>Please</i> say yes.
-2-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:4=vain,I'd <i>love</i> to see how my dress looks on someone else.  But I can't just let you try it on...so use the die.
-2-female_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=seductive,What's with this sudden spell of losses, ~name~?  Could it be...you're feeling a certain attraction you hadn't before?
-2-female_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=seductive-2,Ah, a wandering eye and a miserable poker streak.  Classic signs of a woman in love.
-2-female_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=seductive,I know that lustful, distracted look, ~name~...it's the same one Barnette and I gave each other when we first met.
-2-female_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=interested,Ready to join me, ~name~?  Women are always better off sticking together in this big universe of ours.
-2-female_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=seductive-2,You're stripping so fast, ~name~!  I like women's bodies...and I don't think I can keep up with this!
-2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:2=seductive,I'd call you crazy for this sort of thing, but how could I when you defy death like it's nothing?
-2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:2=excited,You're just so <i>awesome</i>!  I can't get enough of this!
-2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:2=teasing,Can you do it a <i>third</i> time, hotshot?  Yeah, probably.
-2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:2=excited,I could watch you do this all day.  My heart jumps every time!
-2-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:7=smug,...Yeah, we all know how <i>this</i> is ending, don't we?
-2-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:7=smug,Some women just refuse to see what's right in front of them.  It's sad, really.
-2-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:7=laughing,Well, get ready for full-blown blue nudity, everyone.
-2-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:7=smug,All the magic in the universe, and not one ounce of sense.  You poor thing.
-2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:4=stretching,Well, Meia, that's about it.  I know you're not the type to pull any tricks on us.
-2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:4=seductive,Here's the thing about my boss here--she doesn't mess around!  So those shorts are next.
-2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:4=excited,Right on time, Leader.  Come on, drop those things and help me get this over with.
-2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:4=smug,This'll help me finish.  That's what you'd prefer, right?
-2-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:3=confused,Hey, what were those noises you made before?  Didn't sound like the common language...
-2-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:3=confused,...What's the name of that language you keep slipping into, anyway?  Some sort of Earth code-talk?  I only speak the common one...
-2-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:3=vain,Bilingualism is so impressive, Marinette!  I only speak the common language...I don't even know Mejarians' codespeak.
-2-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:3=seductive,So you speak the common language, but also this other one?  What's it called?  Because it sounds so <i>cute</i>!
-2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:3=awkward,Uh, Aimee?  Are you sure you want to keep doing that?  You nearly got hit last time...and your targets are getting smaller.
-2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:3=shocked,Um, it's OK, Aimee!  You've been very impressive!  Just go out on top, you know?
-2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:3=awkward,...Are you sure about this, Aimee?  After...last time?  Don't kill yourself...
-2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:3=awkward,Uh--don't go all the way just for <i>my</i> sake.  What you did was cool, but, um...well, you'll be fine.
-2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:4=smug,Well, I guess if you've come this far, you might as well finish the job.  Go for it.
-2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:4=seductive,I'd expect nothing less, cutie.  Be sure to wow us!
-2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:4=teasing,Might as well seal the deal, even if it's just your thong.  You can do it, honey!
-2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:4=smug,Seems we've got similar taste in underwear.  Shame you're about to shoot it right off, but at least it'll look cool.
-2-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:6=laughing,Even with all that, you're still forced to be naked?  It's official--you're totally into this.
-2-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:6=teasing,Even with your little flower setup, dearie, I think you're out of options.  Cough up the good stuff--I'm convinced you want to.
-2-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:6=vain,<i>That</i> ought to do it, unless you've got more of the plant kingdom at your disposal.  Isn't this what you wanted, playing this game?
-2-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:6=seductive,Oh, I'm sure you're cute, dear--I remember your butt!  Besides...I seriously doubt this isn't turning you on.
-2-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:4=excited,Forget the common language, Marinette, your "French" sounds like the most <i>romantic</i> thing!  You've <i>got</i> to say some more.
-2-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:4=excited,<i>Oooh, Marinette</i>!  Can you say some more "French"?  My heart beats faster every time your tongue slips!
-2-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:4=seductive,You should say some more French, Marinette!  It's got the <i>silkiest</i> sound to it--it makes my heart go wild!
-2-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:4=seductive,Oooh, Marinette, since it's your turn, can you throw out some more of this "French"?  It sounds like a <i>lover's</i> language.
-2-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:5=teasing,Don't stop now, honey!  I hope I'm not imposing...but I'd <i>love</i> to hear some more French!
-2-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:5=seductive,Your language is the absolute <i>coolest</i>, darling!  Say some more for me, if you don't mind...I hope I'm not being a burden.
-2-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:5=teasing,I'm not demanding too much of you, am I, Marinette?  I just <i>love</i> your language...and this should take your mind off stripping.
-2-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:5=vain,Normally I'm interested in women's tongues for <i>other</i> reasons...but with you, I can't get over how cool your language is!
-2-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:5=seductive,I think I'm jealous, Marinette!  Not only are you the <i>cutest</i> little blueberry muffin of a girl, but your language is to <i>die</i> for!
-2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:2=interested,Nice to see you're doing your poor masturbating crewmate some favors after all.
-2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:2=seductive,Against your better nature, you're helping me out here, aren't you?
-2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:2=vain,I know.  My body is too magnificent for you to not help me bring it along to climax.
-2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:2=seductive,Is your mind drifting elsewhere, Meia?  That's just <i>unprofessional</i>...but I could use some help, if you'd please.

-1-male_human_must_strip=teasing,Feeling amped-up after the show I put on for you, ~player~?
-1-male_human_must_strip=interested,You just couldn't resist taking something off after my little demonstration, huh, ~player~?
-1-male_human_must_strip=vain,Only slightly more exciting than my daily life of piloting, pirating, and planet-saving heroics.
-1-male_human_must_strip=teasing,Too bad I couldn't masturbate to whatever you'll be showing me now.  But the biologist in me is still curious.
-1-male_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=vain,I don't know what to tell you, ~player~.  I could understand losing this miserably if I were still playing, but...
-1-male_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=teasing,Still enjoying your silly card game?  Sure you're not unconsciously ready to join me down here?
-1-male_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=smug,Keep up the good work, ~player~.  Shame you couldn't strip this much when I was masturbating, but I guess I'll have to live with purely rational analysis.
-1-male_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=seductive-2,Really inconsiderate timing to suddenly strip a whole bunch, handsome.  I've already finished--I can't just go again right away.
-1-male_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=seductive,Such fierce competitiveness from a man!  I like that...maybe <i>your</i> seed is what I've been looking for.

-1-male_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=laughing,What made you finally lose after all that?  The sinking realization that I'm planning to <i>eat you with all my Mejarian sisters</i>?
-1-male_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=stretching,Men's minds will forever be a mystery to me.  I get all naked and masturbate, and only after I finish does he finally lose.  Must've been luck...

-1-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:4=seductive,Oh, you <i>can</i> talk.  Did my beauty make you clam up, cutie?
-1-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:4=smug,Well, that solves <i>that</i> mystery.  Come on and join us in the land of language like a civilized person.
-1-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:4=smug,Oh, good, you can talk.  I had really lost all hope for men's intelligence for a while there.
-1-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:4=shocked,<i>Ack</i>!  Wha--o-oh, you're done screaming!  Uh...OK.
-1-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:5=teasing,It's now or never, Little Dungeon Bot.  Going to look me in the eyes for once?
-1-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:5=laughing,I spy with my little eye something you can still take off, Dungeon Robo.  That's because my eyes are uncovered.
-1-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:5=interested,Sure you don't want to part with that blindfold, Mr. Robo-man?  Are you aware of the alternative, darling?
-1-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:5=interested,Looks like Little Dungeon Bot is all out of dungeon items...well, except for the most striking one of all.

-1-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:2=seductive,Hey, Handsome, when you say you fight Neighbors, how big a scale are we talking?  Let's just say neighboring planet Tarak isn't our best friend.
-1-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:2=interested,Who are these "Neighbors" you say you fight?  Is this like a front-lawn kind of dispute, or do you mean as a solider?
-1-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:2=interested,Did you say you fight neighbors, darling?  Mejarians usually fight their neighbors over gardening, unless we're talking planets.
-1-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:2=vain,I can't get over how cute you are, honey...but seriously, what's with the angel outfit?  Men are no angels.
-1-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:2=smug,Men have always struck as more <i>beastly</i> than angelic...which is fine by me.  So why do you dress like one?
-1-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:2=confused,So, uh, I read about angels as a girl, but they were always women.  Why are you dolled-up like one, anyway?
-1-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:2=confused,Do those wings detach?  They look pretty convincing, and the rest of your angel outfit is pretty good.  Why do you have that on, anyway?
-1-female_human_must_strip=teasing,I understand, ~player~.  You saw what my fingers could do and wanted to skip to the fun.
-1-female_human_must_strip=teasing,That's it, honey.  Forget this silly card game and get to the <i>real</i> fun.
-1-female_human_must_strip=afterglow,What a warm feeling...like Christmas with my Barnette.
-1-female_human_must_strip=stretching,What's a Mejarian to do, all tapped out like this while Earth women lord over you with their poker skills?
-1-female_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=stretching,What incredible poker skills to last so long.  Only problem: this is strip poker, and the objective is to masturbate and have fun.
-1-female_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=vain,Yeah, yeah, ~player~, enjoy your little lucky poker runs.  I'm going to roll over and think of my darling Barnette, fully at peace.
-1-female_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=vain,Nice job maintaining your poker face despite my little masturbation session.  I've always worn my heart on my sleeve, and it's brought so many wonderful women into my life!
-1-female_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=laughing,Streaks like that would probably impress Meia.  She's utterly convinced you can win this game consistently because Gascogne keeps psyching her out.
-1-female_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=smug,Streaks like that might earn you a spot on our crew.  You know, if you could pull them off consistently, and knew how to pilot.
-1-female_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=stretching,Don't get complacent, now!  A Mejarian leaves her mark on a scene long after she leaves.
-1-female_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=laughing,Tsk, tsk.  The Mejarian woman finishes, and the Earth woman thinks it's safe to play it fast and loose.
-1-female_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=vain,Was it worth it, ~player~?  Wasting all this effort trying to win, when <i>I'm</i> the one who's relaxed and comfortable now?
-1-female_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=vain,And it all comes tumbling down.  If it's not life-or-death, why worry so much about winning in the first place?
-1-female_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99,alsoPlaying:meia=stretching,What incredible poker skills to last so long.  Only problem: this is strip poker, and the objective is to masturbate and have fun.

-1-female_must_strip=stretching,What's a Mejarian to do, all tapped out like this while Earth women lord over you with their poker skills?
-1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:2=teasing,Are we up to the big stuff?  You could've done this earlier, you know.  For your crewmate's sake.
-1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:2=teasing,You're getting sloppy, Meia.  It's rather unbecoming...unlike nudity.
-1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:2=seductive-2,I've already masturbated, but your beauty is so overwhelming.  I'm not sure I can take what's coming next.
-1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:2=vain,Ooh, you're going to take off the suit now, I can feel it.  <i>This is too much</i>!
-1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:3=interested,Some nudity for us at last, even if it embarrasses you.  Did you wait till I finished masturbating just to spite me?
-1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:3=smug,You're not the type to hide anything, even if you're irrationally embarrassed by it.  So we know what's next.
-1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:3=teasing,Well, here comes Meia's breasts.  She's having a meltdown, but don't worry, she bottles that sort of thing up.
-1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:3=seductive-2,<i>Oh, dear, Meia.  You've got to show your adorable breasts.  The horror of it all</i>.
-1-female_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=stretching,Don't get complacent, now!  A Mejarian leaves her mark on a scene long after she leaves.

-1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=stretching,Jeez, I forgot you hadn't lost yet.  I didn't think you'd be winning <i>this</i> easily.
-1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=interested,How can you expect to have any fun in strip poker if you never lose?  I've been trying to help you here.
-1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=seductive,Don't you <i>like</i> fun, Meia?  Is nothing fun to you but piloting?
-1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=teasing,You're too good at cards for this game.  Don't you want to feel sexy?  Even a <i>little</i>?
-1-female_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=stretching,What incredible poker skills to last so long.  Only problem: this is strip poker, and the objective is to masturbate and have fun.

-1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:4=seductive,Didn't see you being pushed this far.  But you'll pull through, right?  You always do.
-1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:4=teasing,Eh, what's a little full-body nudity?  You've handled worse--it's why you're our leader!
-1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:4=seductive-2,Don't complain, now!  Remember the humiliation <i>I've</i> just endured.
-1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:4=laughing,At least you're not masturbating, right?  <i>For now</i>.
-1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:4=teasing,Those shorts didn't seem like much of a defense.  More than my thong, I guess, but you'll be masturbating soon regardless.
-1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:1=awkward,You OK, Meia?  You're blushing, and I don't think it's from me.  Please try to feel better.
-1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:1=awkward,Are you feeling OK?  I'm telling you, stripping will make you feel better.
-1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:1=sad,Take off that armor.  I swear it chokes the life out of you.
-1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:1=awkward,You're all flushed from removing your eyepiece.  <i>Please</i> just loosen up a little.  You'll feel great, I promise.
-1-female_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99,alsoPlaying:meia=stretching,What incredible poker skills to last so long.  Only problem: this is strip poker, and the objective is to masturbate and have fun.

-1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:3=awkward,Uh, Aimee?  Are you sure you want to keep doing that?  You nearly got hit last time...and your targets are getting smaller.
-1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:3=shocked,Um, it's OK, Aimee!  You've been very impressive!  Just go out on top, you know?
-1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:3=awkward,...Are you sure about this, Aimee?  After...last time?  Don't kill yourself...
-1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:3=awkward,Uh--don't go all the way just for <i>my</i> sake.  What you did was cool, but, um...well, you'll be fine.
-1-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:3=confused,This is so freaky to me, and I've dealt with the Paksis's weird energy.  Do you just swtich all the time?
-1-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:3=confused,Are you really bouncing back and forth like this all the time?  Like, do you have any friends?
-1-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:3=confused,Must be hard getting to know anyone when you keep losing your memory.  How do you deal with always switching?
-1-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:3=confused,I can't believe you have split personalities.  Where does the other one go?  How do you make friends?
-1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:5=teasing,Don't stop now, honey!  I hope I'm not imposing...but I'd <i>love</i> to hear some more French!
-1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:5=seductive,Your language is the absolute <i>coolest</i>, darling!  Say some more for me, if you don't mind...I hope I'm not being a burden.
-1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:5=teasing,I'm not demanding too much of you, am I, Marinette?  I just <i>love</i> your language...and this should take your mind off stripping.
-1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:5=vain,Normally I'm interested in women's tongues for <i>other</i> reasons...but with you, I can't get over how cool your language is!
-1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:5=seductive,I think I'm jealous, Marinette!  Not only are you the <i>cutest</i> little blueberry muffin of a girl, but your language is to <i>die</i> for!
-1-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:3=bored,Is there a doctor in the building?  One specializing in mental health?
-1-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:3=frustrated,...This isn't funny anymore.  Now I'm just worried about you.
-1-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:3=frustrated,...This is getting old.  <i>I'm</i> getting old listening to this.
-1-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:3=annoyed,What a surprise.  Intentionally throwing the game tends to make you lose.
-1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:4=excited,Forget the common language, Marinette, your "French" sounds like the most <i>romantic</i> thing!  You've <i>got</i> to say some more.
-1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:4=excited,<i>Oooh, Marinette</i>!  Can you say some more "French"?  My heart beats faster every time your tongue slips!
-1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:4=seductive,You should say some more French, Marinette!  It's got the <i>silkiest</i> sound to it--it makes my heart go wild!
-1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:4=seductive,Oooh, Marinette, since it's your turn, can you throw out some more of this "French"?  It sounds like a <i>lover's</i> language.
-1-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:7=smug,...Yeah, we all know how <i>this</i> is ending, don't we?
-1-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:7=smug,Some women just refuse to see what's right in front of them.  It's sad, really.
-1-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:7=laughing,Well, get ready for full-blown blue nudity, everyone.
-1-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:7=smug,All the magic in the universe, and not one ounce of sense.  You poor thing.
-1-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:6=interested,I appreciated the fashion show, Vriska, but really, I doubt you've got fuel left in the tank.
-1-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:6=stretching,Just going to keep on trying, huh?  Give it up already.
-1-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:6=stretching,Poor girl just can't control her gambling problem.  Now she'll be nude for it.
-1-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:6=interested,And is this magically going to restock your wardrobe?  I doubt it.
-1-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:5=smug,Call it woman's intuition, but I think our little fashion show is about to come to an end soon...
-1-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:5=interested,This has been fun, Vriska, but I don't think you can keep this up forever.  That die's got a sick sense of humor.
-1-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:5=interested,Can't you see the writing on the wall, sweetheart?  I like these outfits, but they keep getting skimpier and skimpier.
-1-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:5=laughing,Roll all you want...I think the die's in control here.  And it wants to see some blue skin.
-1-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=smug,Jeez, what a head case.  Good thing she's got her girlfriend here to keep her in check.
-1-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=interested,Running, running, running.  We're not trying to kill you here, you know.
-1-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=teasing,Time for take two, everyone.  Better than the first, perhaps?
-1-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=seductive,And <i>there she goes</i>.  Poor little thing, beaten down by the world.
-1-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:4=bored,...Maybe I should stop hitting on men.  Look what it does to you...
-1-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:4=annoyed,Is this really what Earth women are like?  She's an outlier, right?
-1-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:4=frustrated,Seems running the Harvest has a tendency to scramble Earth women's brains...and make them want to play poker.
-1-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:4=bored,...At least she's losing quickly.  Easy to do when you barely check the cards.
-1-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:5=frustrated,Oh God, she's finally doing it.  Be very afraid...unless you Earth people are used to this sort of thing.
-1-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:5=frustrated,Please don't.  I've learned my lesson.  I'll stay on Mejare.
-1-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:5=bored,I'm really appreciating Mejare right now.  Maybe I'll straighten up and get a normal job.
-1-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:5=frustrated,This is the last time I come to Earth.  Even among Mejarian pirate scum, none of us act like this.
-1-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:6=bored,The storm is almost over...or maybe this is just the calm before it.
-1-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:6=bored,I think I'd prefer the <i>Harvest's</i> company at this point.
-1-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:6=bored,Oh, you're still here.  Why not just strip more than one thing at a time?  Well, too late.
-1-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:6=bored,I still don't know who made you wait this long to show what you wanted.
-1-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:4=teasing,Hey, honey...take <i>my</i> dress, and I'll love you forever.
-1-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:4=smug,Feel free to flatter me and steal my dress, dear!  It's...over there somewhere.
-1-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:4=seductive,Say, Vriska...can that die steal <i>my</i> dress?  <i>Please</i> say yes.
-1-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:4=vain,I'd <i>love</i> to see how my dress looks on someone else.  But I can't just let you try it on...so use the die.
-1-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:3=excited,Here we go again.  This is so <i>exciting</i>!  Every outfit is an adventure!
-1-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:3=excited,This is making me feel so alive!  I love checking out women's fashion!  Show some more!
-1-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:3=seductive,You're so cool, Vriska!  And maybe even a little cute!  What else have you got for me?
-1-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:3=teasing,Don't stop now, cutie!  Any more adorable outfits you've got in store for me?
-1-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:2=teasing,I'm <i>waiting</i>, Vriska!  Don't disappoint me and pick some boring outfit!
-1-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:2=teasing,I'm expecting some good fashion from you, you know!  Don't leave it up to chance!
-1-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:2=smug,Don't you have some way to control that?  I'd rather you showed off something specific.
-1-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:2=teasing,Lay the fashion on me, Vriska!  Fashion from...wherever it is that you live.
-1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:2=seductive,I'd call you crazy for this sort of thing, but how could I when you defy death like it's nothing?
-1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:2=excited,You're just so <i>awesome</i>!  I can't get enough of this!
-1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:2=teasing,Can you do it a <i>third</i> time, hotshot?  Yeah, probably.
-1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:2=excited,I could watch you do this all day.  My heart jumps every time!
-1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:4=smug,Well, I guess if you've come this far, you might as well finish the job.  Go for it.
-1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:4=seductive,I'd expect nothing less, cutie.  Be sure to wow us!
-1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:4=teasing,Might as well seal the deal, even if it's just your thong.  You can do it, honey!
-1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:4=smug,Seems we've got similar taste in underwear.  Shame you're about to shoot it right off, but at least it'll look cool.
-1-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:5=smug,Well, that's that.  Do what you must behind those flowers.
-1-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:5=interested,You can hide yourself with the flowers, honey, but you're naked, so that's a loss in my book.
-1-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:5=smug,Nice try with the foliage, dear, but no one's going to call that clothing.  You're out.
-1-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:5=stretching,<i>And so the frightened little princess falls before her betters.  Even the forest spirits couldn't save her</i>.
-1-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:6=laughing,Even with all that, you're still forced to be naked?  It's official--you're totally into this.
-1-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:6=teasing,Even with your little flower setup, dearie, I think you're out of options.  Cough up the good stuff--I'm convinced you want to.
-1-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:6=vain,<i>That</i> ought to do it, unless you've got more of the plant kingdom at your disposal.  Isn't this what you wanted, playing this game?
-1-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:6=seductive,Oh, I'm sure you're cute, dear--I remember your butt!  Besides...I seriously doubt this isn't turning you on.
-1-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:2=confused,So, uh, besides being blue, what's your deal?  You're all sweet and polite now.
-1-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:2=seductive,Can't say I prefer blue hair, but you're certainly a lot sweeter now, honey.  What <i>happened</i>?
-1-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:2=seductive,Normally I like blondes, but at least you're not waving a gun around and cursing anymore.  Nice tradeoff.
-1-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:2=vain,Blue hair is more exotic, but blonde is far more beautiful.  Still, I'll take this polite version of you over the alternative.
-1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:3=confused,Hey, what were those noises you made before?  Didn't sound like the common language...
-1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:3=confused,...What's the name of that language you keep slipping into, anyway?  Some sort of Earth code-talk?  I only speak the common one...
-1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:3=vain,Bilingualism is so impressive, Marinette!  I only speak the common language...I don't even know Mejarians' codespeak.
-1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:3=seductive,So you speak the common language, but also this other one?  What's it called?  Because it sounds so <i>cute</i>!
-1-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:2=interested,Honey, you'd be better off putting some meat on your bones than trying desperately to show them off.
-1-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:2=bored,Sweetie, you're a twig.  This is just unhealthy...as unhealthy as you look.
-1-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:2=confused,Are you suffering from this "anorexia" I keep reading about?  Eating disorders?  Do men do this to you?
-1-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:2=vain,Talk about needing a girlfriend.  See what happens when you're never validated?
-1-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:5=shocked,Bless you--<i>oh no</i>.
-1-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:5=shocked,Who sneezed--<i>eep!  N-not Launch</i>!
-1-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:5=shocked,<i>Ack!  Why'd you have to sneeze again</i>?
-1-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:5=shocked,<i>Eek!  N-not again!  My heart can't take this</i>!

0-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=interested,I'm calling your bluff on that thing being a visor.  I think you're some weird fetish-man who's been peeking at the cards underneath it.  Can I see?
0-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=interested,Oh, I see.  It's thin enough to see through, and you just like messing with people?
0-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=vain,Ah, I see--it's thin fabric.  Men and their deceitful ways, thinking they could pull one over on me!
0-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=interested,Could've fooled me, with that hand you were rocking.  Still, I guess the fabric's thin enough to see, and you just like playing pretend.
0-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=teasing,So you're just a fan of the dungeon look, and the blindfold's thin enough to see through?  Nice try fooling Jura Basil Elden.
0-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:1=laughing,Something the matter, Mr. Muscle?  You look so <i>dreadfully</i> uncomfortable.
0-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:1=vain,Am I being distracting, Mr. Muscle?  Well, you're guilty of it yourself, with that hunky body of yours.
0-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:1=seductive,Am I drawing your eyes, honey?  Well you started it--how can I <i>not</i> stare at all those muscles of yours?
0-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:1=teasing,See something you like, dearie?  You seem so <i>uncomfortable</i> around women for an Earth man--I guess you've never seen one like me!
0-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=confused,...Wait, you're a <i>man</i>?  Aren't men...<i>tall</i>?  And, you know, <i>masculine</i>?
0-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=confused,...Oh, you're a man.  Well, that's disappointing.  What's the word for this?  <i>Han-droggo-niss</i> or something?
0-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=confused,...Huh.  You're a man.  I guess I can work with this, but <i>wow</i>.  You really had me fooled...
0-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=bored,...Oh.  Well, this wouldn't be the <i>first</i> time a man fooled me into thinking he's a woman, but <i>that</i> was on purpose...
0-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=awkward,...Wait, one of you is a <i>man</i>?  But--you--I...<i>wow</i>.
0-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=confused,...Wait, I'm confused.  Men and women don't look <i>that</i> close.  Are you sure you're a man?
0-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=awkward,...Oh.  I really thought I was getting good at telling men and women apart...
0-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=confused,...Wait, you're a <i>man</i>?  I mean, Duero wears his hair long, and Meia's is short, so I don't assume anything there...
0-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=confused,...Are you sure, Meia?  I mean, B.C. fooled <i>you</i>, too.
0-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,...Wait, really?  Well, wouldn't be the first time, although poor Corrin here seems to have fooled us by <i>accident</i>.
0-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=awkward,...Uh...good eye, Meia.  Well, this is awkward.  Sorry, Miss--Mister.  You're still pretty cute...for a man.
0-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=confused,...Meia, don't mess with me.  Are you <i>sure</i>?  I mean, look at her--him.
0-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=laughing,Oh, weapons count, do they?  You've just given me an <i>excellent</i> idea, handsome.
0-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=smug,Nice sword you've got there, Trigger Finger.  Even better, it's revealed to me what counts as "clothing" in this place.
0-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=interested,Do weapons really count?  That seems too easy...but I guess this place plays fast and loose with the rules.  <i>Interesting</i>...
0-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=teasing,Would you look at that?  Jin is very kindly setting the precedent for weapons counting.  <i>I'll keep that in mind</i>.
0-male_removed_accessory=smug,We'll see if you can keep that up against Mejare's finest.
0-male_removed_accessory=seductive,Well, since you're not being interesting with your stripping...<i>ever slept with a woman</i>?
0-male_removed_accessory=teasing,I think there's quite a lot you could teach me about men tonight, ~name~.  Consider yourself a fine male specimen?
0-male_removed_accessory=interested,You could be very enlightening for me, ~name~...but not with stuff like <i>that</i>.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=laughing,Hey, what <i>that</i> supposed to mean, Gearbox?  What Barnette and I do in private is none of your business.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=vain,Oh, please.  I'm the <i>giver</i> in my relationship...<i>Barnette</i> would get to wear the blindfold.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=teasing,<i>Oho</i>!  And Little Dungeon Bot shows some spunk.  You're getting more human all the time...<i>maybe we could use that blindfold</i>.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=teasing,Ha!  About time you manned up and talked back to me.  But to be honest, <i>Barnette's</i> usually wearing the blindfold.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=teasing,Well then, don't think I won't tease you!  It'll just be in a different sort of way...
0-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=laughing,A man who looks like a woman might be <i>exactly</i> the kind of seed I need...wouldn't want my children all hairy and gross.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=seductive,OK.  Well, nothing I can't work with!  Now you're cute in a completely different sort of way, <i>Mister</i> Corrin.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=vain,Don't feel too bad about it, then.  Women's bodies are so much smoother and luscious anyway...you should strive to emulate us.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=shocked,So why do you two look the same?  ...You're the same <i>person</i>?  But--how's that possible?
0-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=excited,W-wait, you're the <i>male</i> version of her?  Where's the male version of <i>me</i>?  I bet he's <i>handsome</i>!
0-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=vain,Oh, wow, you're the same person, but the opposite sex?  Where's the male <i>me</i>?  Tall, gorgeous--and <i>blond</i>!
0-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=thinking,T-this is really incredible.  Are there male versions of <i>every</i> woman I know?  I wonder if male Barnette is handsome...
0-female_removing_accessory=interested,That's it, huh?  Earth women are awfully boring.
0-female_removing_accessory=smug,Just that?  Why, you won't see <i>me</i> taking off something that small.  No way.
0-female_removing_accessory=laughing,Boring and perfectly sensible.  You'd be good friends with Meia--you know, if Meia <i>wanted</i> any friends.
0-female_removing_accessory=smug,I didn't expect any different.  Was sure hoping for it, though.
0-female_removing_accessory=teasing,Don't be like that, ~name~!  I just met you--<i>excite me</i>!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=teasing,Hey, Miss Military--where'd you get all that beer?  Throw some this way, let's have fun!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=vain,Just chugging it down, huh, Miss Military?  <i>Mejarians</i> are so much more tasteful...but give me some, if you don't mind.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=smug,I hope you brought enough booze for <i>everyone</i>, Misato.  It's not nice to hoard.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=stretching,I thought I smelled beer...more of a rum woman myself, but when on Earth, drink as the classless Earth girls drink.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=shocked,Anyway, I--your eyepiece?  Really?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=shocked,O-oh wow, your eyepiece.  I...didn't think you'd even take that off.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=awkward,Huh.  I thought you might save that for the end, if you took it off at all.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=awkward,Wow.  Your <i>eyepiece</i>?  You're taking this pretty seriously.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=shocked,Y-your eyepiece?  It's OK, Meia, you don't have to...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=seductive,<i>Oooh</i>!  That sounded so <i>cute</i>, honey, whatever it was!  What does that mean?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=seductive,<i>Teeheehee</i>!  I don't know what you said, but your home language sounds so silky smooth and romantic!  What's it mean?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, what's <i>that</i> mean, dear?  Because it sounded like the most romantic thing I've ever heard!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=excited,Omigosh, that's so <i>romantic</i>-sounding!  What does it mean?  I want to talk like that!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0=interested,Losing your sword, hm?  Not a bad idea...I wasn't aware this place counted weapons.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0=laughing,Maybe you're smarter than I thought, Swordswoman.  Why bend the rules when you can slice right through them?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0=start,Is that your sword you're throwing out?  I guess that makes <i>me</i> the leading blade-wielder at this table.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0=losing-rapier,Oh, dear.  And your sword was actually quite stylish.  Perhaps <i>I</i> should strip my rapier, too?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1=shocked,And a <i>Bless You</i> to--to...<i>where'd Launch go</i>?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1=confused,...That's, uh, a pretty hard sneeze.  Didn't realize it could turn your hair blue.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1=awkward,...Uh...is this an Earth thing, or would <i>my</i> hair turn blue if I sneezed too hard?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1=shocked,...<i>Launch?  Where'd the blonde girl go</i>?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:0=seductive,<i>Heeheehee!  Such a tease, Miss Valentine</i>!  You can deny it all you want, but I see myself written all over you.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:0=vain,It's OK to want to distance yourself from me, dear.  I am, after all, taller and more beautiful.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:0=smug,Why deny the similarities, darling?  Women across Mejare <i>wish</i> they could be mentioned alongside Jura Basil Elden.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:0=teasing,What, too proud to admit we're alike?  <i>Afraid I do your image better than you</i>?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,<i>Heeheehee</i>!  Oh, you're hopelessly in love now!  This is so <i>cute</i>!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,I <i>knew</i> we'd meet a girl here who was your type--and with all these hormones flowing, you'd <i>have</i> to break your stoicism eventually.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Do you hear that, Chunners?  It's the sound of ice melting nearby.  You've lit a fire in her heart.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,Go on, Meia, ask her out.  You both know how an exercise session is going to end.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Of course she does, honey!  She just refuses to show it, which is why I drag her to places like this.  She only ever smiles with Ezra's baby.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=stretching,Why do you think I brought her here, Miss Polka-dot?  You need <i>steam</i> to melt all that ice of hers...or a baby.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=seductive,Oh, my Leader is an absolute <i>sweetheart</i>, Miss Accent.  You should see her with Ezra's little baby!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Meia's the sweetest girl you'll ever meet, Miss Ladybug...but she only shows it when she's making our crewmate's baby laugh.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=seductive,Meia just doesn't like crowds or strangers, that's all.  She thinks she's got to be all dignified.  But see how she acts with a baby!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=smug,You going to throw up, sweetie?  Looks like it...well, don't face <i>me</i> when it happens.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=laughing,Can we get a janitor over here?  This girl's about to pee herself.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=annoyed,Jeez, this girl's gonna spend the evening sobbing.  Can't we just tell her to leave?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=bored,You're no fun.  You're such a head case that I can't even tease you.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=laughing,...Well, that's one down.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=interested,...I really thought Earth girls handled men better than anyone.  I wanted to see her naked, too.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=smug,...That girl really needed some time on Mejare to toughen her up.  Men are giant pushovers.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=bored,Should've known we wouldn't all make it through this without bailing.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=smug,Well, I mean, if <i>anyone</i> was going to chicken out, it was going to be her.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:7=sad,<i>So long, Ang</i>--oh.  Well, I guess that counts.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:7=sad,<i>Awww</i>!  And here I thought I had beaten you.  But no, you proved too wily for me.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:7=vain,Damn Earth girls and their tricks.  <i>Who would do that, bring a bunch of accessories to a strip poker game</i>?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:7=smug,My pilot's eyes should've spotted that, but you snuck right past me--and yourself, even.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:3=smug,And at last the trumped-up girlie removes the only thing maintaining her arrogance.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:3=teasing,Hey, Princess...you can't strip what makes <i>me</i> beautiful.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:3=smug,<i>Royals</i>...talk about jewelry for jewelry's sake.  It's supposed to <i>improve</i> your looks, not create them.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:3=teasing,Thaaaank <i>you</i>!  Now the property of Magno Vivan's pirates, little Miss Princess!  So sorry.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:5=angry,Wha--<i>oh, goddamnit!  Just take things off in a proper order</i>!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:5=angry,Hey, I came here to see some Earth nudity!  I don't appreciate being toyed around with!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:5=annoyed,Yeah, yeah, hotshot.  Real clever.  You definitely played this game and <i>didn't</i> want people to see you naked.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:5=bored,This must be how people feel around <i>me</i>.  Clinging to accessories...at least <i>I</i> have a body worth teasing.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:5=annoyed,I <i>hate it</i> when people bounce around with the importance of what they take off.  Let the audience know what to expect!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=laughing,...Wow, I was just kidding.  You really <i>are</i> a sex fairy, just presenting like that.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=interested,Honey, you can't just <i>present</i> like that right from the get-go.  The audience can't get what they want until the grand finale.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=smug,Seems Earth girls overdo it as usual.  What kind of tease would I be if just spread my legs right here and now?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=teasing,Easy there, hot stuff.  You're already wearing so little--no need to spoil what surprises you <i>have</i>.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:3=interested,Sure you don't want to cling to that, dearie?  It <i>is</i> what marks as you as better than the rest of us.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:3=vain,I guess I can understand losing that, even as a princess.  It'll let your blonde hair flow free and unencumbered!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:3=seductive,Miss Princess dropping her overinflated jewelry?  Oh, I forgot--you're blonde, so you're not so bad.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:3=teasing,That's it, honey.  Lower yourself to the level of us dirty commoners.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=confused,...Did I miss something?  Can't we take off whatever we want?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=confused,...Is there really a nebulous <i>management</i> that's got guns to our heads if we don't strip how they want?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=confused,...Who exactly is holding a gun to your head and making you do this?  Hey, are you listening?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=confused,...Why do you have to take off your shoes next?  I mean, you <i>should</i>, but apparently you <i>have</i> to?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=excited,...So, uh, Ochako.  You're floating.  ...Are you going to explain that?  Because it's <i>incredible</i>!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=excited,Wait--are you--omigosh, Ochako, you can <i>float</i>?  That's so <i>cool</i>!  How are you doing that?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=excited,Omigosh!  <i>Omigosh</i>!  Ochako!  You can just <i>float</i> like that?  I'd have been doing it all game if I could <i>float</i>!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=excited,...OK.  Ochako.  You're...<i>levitating</i>.  And that is so <i>cool</i>!  What's your secret?  Can <i>I</i> learn to float?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=stretching,Just a <i>little</i> nervous?  Damn...I guess I'm too gorgeous to be scary.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=laughing,Nervous?  I was really trying to scare you--I guess you're already falling in love with me.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=vain,I was hoping for a better reaction than that.  Maybe you're tougher than you look--or I'm just that lovable!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=teasing,Just trying to break you in, dear.  You look positively miserable--I wanted to scare you into having fun!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:1=smug,<i>Dear, dear</i>.  Removing your fancy jewelry so readily?  Don't you care about that precious ttle of yours?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:1=teasing,Blonde women are always favorites of mine...even better, you're removing that ridiculous crown early.  Come have some fun with us commoners.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:1=interested,No sense keeping it on long, right?  You're already lowering yourself by playing this, anyway.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:1=teasing,Make the gown next to go, Miss Princess.  I think you'll find how fun we dirty common folk can be.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=bored,<i>Management</i>?  What is <i>up</i> with this girl?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=confused,...I'm totally lost.  There's <i>rules</i> about what you can strip?  They didn't tell me any rules.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=confused,...Honey, did the bouncer clock you upside the head before you came in?  I'm not teasing, I'm dead serious.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=frustrated,I...<i>what</i>?  <i>Management</i>?  Yeah, you could <i>use</i> a little management, that's for sure.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:0=interested,You're, uh, a little on display there, honey.  Unless that sort of thing excites you.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:0=laughing,Oh, please.  You're flashing us on purpose, aren't you?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:0=teasing,Don't act like that flash was an accident, dearie.  I know your type...nerdy little Parfet is a freak, too.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:0=smug,Showing off the underwear early?  Should've pegged you as the falsely-modest type.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>Aaack!  No!  Wait!  I'm too young to die!  Too beautiful</i>!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>Eek!  Noooo!  Wait!  I'll give you whatever you want</i>!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>Ack!  The Harvest!  I should've known this was a trap</i>!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>Eeeeek!  No!  Please!  I have a girlfriend</i>!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0=frustrated,Oh, good, the knife.  Wasn't sure what you were doing with that thing...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0=angry,Why'd you even <i>bring</i> that thing?  Just to scare us to death?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0=frustrated,<i>Phew</i>...for a second there, I thought you brought that thing so you'd make some ghost friends.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0=frustrated,<i>Phew</i>...OK.  Everyone calm down, the dead woman is unarmed now.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=excited,Yes!  <i>Yes</i>!  Go for it!  Roll that die!  Can I have one?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=excited,You are so <i>cool</i>, Vriska!  Where can I get one of those things?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=excited,So it's that die that does it for you?  Can I have one?  I want to switch my outfit on the fly!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=teasing,Where'd you get that die?  I don't want to have to steal <i>yours</i>, you know!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=teasing,<i>Atta girl</i>!  Now show me something magical!  ...Besides this.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=vain,These vortices are pretty fantastic, but it's the end result I care about.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=seductive,You really are something else.  I've already grown accustomed to your magic vortices!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=seductive,All that magic, but all I care about is the outfit waiting for me.  I never thought I'd meet someone like you!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=confused,...Seriously, do you have <i>any</i> control over this?  Even a little?  Or is it all luck?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=confused,...Talk about living life up to chance, by the way.  This is so weird...and I'm a pilot.  I've <i>seen</i> weird.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=stretching,There she goes with another vortex.  Life is just a game of luck to our little fashionista here.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=vain,Too bad this isn't the spectacle it used to be.  But the random chance <i>does</i> keep it interesting!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=shocked,O-oh, are you putting the guns down?  I-I promise I won't touch them.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=awkward,<i>(Oh, thank God...)</i>  Er, Revy, good choice there.  Good choice.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=awkward,Hey, uh, now that you're disarmed, try to relax a little, would you?  Instead of yelling at us.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=sad,I was <i>hoping</i> tonight wouldn't end with someone getting shot.  Don't we all just want to see each other naked?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:1=interested,And what do we have here?  Miserable old Miss Brunette is admitting she's no better than the rest of us?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:1=laughing,Hey, Miss Princess.  You don't mind if this pirate holds onto that tiara, do you?  Just for a little <i>inspection</i>?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:1=teasing,Don't stop there, Miss Princess.  Nothing satisfies a pirate quite like watching nobles stripped down to nothing at all.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:1=laughing,Take away her tiara and she's a brunette in a dress.  Take away her dress...and I hope her butt is cute.
0-female_removing_accessory,alsoPlaying:meia=interested,That's it, huh?  Earth women are awfully boring.
0-female_removing_accessory,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,Just that?  Why, you won't see <i>me</i> taking off something that small.  No way.
0-female_removing_accessory,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,I didn't expect any different.  Was sure hoping for it, though.
0-female_removing_accessory,alsoPlaying:meia=stretching,Just what I expected, nothing like I hoped for.  Try not to let us down tonight.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=bored,It's refreshing to know you won't acknowledge anything I say.  Real liberating.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=awkward,...Look, I know I tease a lot, but I'm just having fun.  Nothing about <i>this</i> is fun.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=frustrated,Talk about a lost cause.  She won't even acknowledge me.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=teasing,<i>Hey, Ocean Girl.  If you're being held against your will, blink twice.  I'm a pirate, I understand</i>.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=teasing,<i>Oh, am I being too forward</i>?  My apologies.  Just know you'd have your pick of the bunch over there.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=seductive,Oh, sorry, I got carried away there.  But you're still a beautiful, musclebound woman!  That's a plus anywhere.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=seductive,Maybe that was a little forward of me.  But Mejarians would love you!  I wonder if men feel the same.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=teasing,Well, just know how in-demand you are on Mejare...if these bumbling Earth men start giving you the cold shoulder.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=laughing,<i>Heeheehee</i>!  Oh, so you <i>are</i> the embarrassed type!  I was just calling you sexy, honey.  Relax.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, when a woman compliments your figure, you say "Thanks, you too."  Talk about <i>rude</i>.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=smug,I call you sexy enough to rock a bodysuit, and you get all flustered and offended.  Earth woman are so scared of each other.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=seductive,What?  That was <i>complimentary</i>, silly!  That suit is doing all <i>sorts</i> of favors for your hips.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=seductive,There you go!  Take off that hemet and show the world the cute face to match your sexy figure.  I wasn't teasing you before.
0-female_removed_accessory=smug,Guess I'll just have to beat you the <i>hard</i> way.
0-female_removed_accessory=teasing,Hey, girlie, wanna guess what <i>I'll</i> take off first?
0-female_removed_accessory=interested,Is that how you attract Earth men?  Playing hard-to-get?
0-female_removed_accessory=seductive,Earth women should be more proud of their bodies...unless you're just teasing me.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=teasing,I've got my eye on you, Miss Pixie...because my ears are totally confused when you talk.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=vain,Little Miss Pixie must think she's clever, saying all these things that go over my poor foreigner head.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=seductive,Have some sympathy for this poor alien woman, Kyu.  You're always saying things only an Earth woman would understand.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=vain,Feel free to start making sense for <i>everyone</i>, Miss Pixie.  Think of the poor aliens in your presence when you speak.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4c=laughing,Hah!  Going for <i>my</i> look, are you?  Yeah, cleavage tends to get people to do what you want.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4c=laughing,Feeling a little breezy, honey?  Don't worry, you'll get used to it--I did.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4c=laughing,Pfft!  How do you like <i>my</i> style, then?  I'm flattered you had this on the backburner, sweetie.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4c=vain,Doesn't the breeze feel good between your breasts?  It always perks me up when I'm down.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2a=awkward,Uh...ew.  That's kind of ratty, actually.  But you've got more, right?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2a=confused,...Now you kind of smell salty.  Don't you have something else?  Something <i>nicer</i>?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2a=confused,...I have no clue what that is.  Kind of looks like <i>men's</i> clothing...all tattered and gross.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2a=confused,...That's certainly a lot of extra stuff.  But somehow it just ends up looking like rags, whatever it is.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=interested,Oh, you're back.  Try not to make a habit of that, dearie...it's not very intimidating.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=confused,...Well, at least you came back.  Serously, did a man kill your family or something?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=teasing,Listen, honey, you ought to come my my home planet sometime.  It's nothing but women...and we make a habit of shooting nasty men.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=vain,You have <i>nothing</i> to be scared of, honey.  I've fought the toughest, burliest men around and come out on top!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Oh, dear.  Now you've done it, Rinkah...Meia <i>loves</i> women with muscles.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=interested,Just try to ride this out, honey.  Meia acts icy, but those muscles melt her right down like nobody's business.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Don't believe her cover stories, Rinkah.  Meia doesn't want your muscles...she wants <i>you</i>.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,Heehee!  Meia tends to get like this around particularly <i>fit</i> women, if you follow.  Don't mind her desperate advances.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,Oh, please.  All this titilating nudity is enough excitement for one evening.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,As if I need to drink to have fun when there's full-blown Earth nudity in our midst!  <i>I resent your implication</i>.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,Hey, Misato can drink alone.  <i>I</i> only drink when I know my darling Barnette is there to take care of me.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:meia=thinking,Hey now, I'm tall!  I can handle at least...uh...a few beers, give or take.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,Don't ask questions you don't want the answer to, Meia.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=stretching,This is why I mostly stick to asking about men and fashion.  See what happens?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=interested,See, Meia?  Don't encourage people to discuss things you don't care about.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Oh, <i>this</i> ought to be a treat.  <i>Have fun, Leader</i>!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=vain,Talk about a terrestial booze-a-thon.  Oh, well, I've got the height to drink with the best of them!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=smug,I get that this place is a bar, but damn, ladies, at least <i>pretend</i> you're trying to win.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=interested,So I get this place has a no-touching rule, but you two aren't really disguising how you're planning to take some of us home afterward.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=laughing,I <i>do</i> love drinking, but I don't think I could keep up with you two.  I guess living around men forces you to drown your sorrows.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=annoyed,Am I getting through to you?  Jura to Ocean Girl!  <i>Hello</i>?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=angry,Hey, Ocean Girl!  <i>I'm talking to you</i>!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=annoyed,What's your name, floozy?  <i>Moon</i>?  Yeah, you're a lunatic, alright!  Say something to me!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=annoyed,Hel-<i>looo</i>?  Am I breaking up?  Have we achieved first contact?  <i>God</i>...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=confused,Me-<i>ow</i>!  Heeheehee--wait, you're serious?  Like, the animal, a cat?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=confused,...Earth girls can have <i>cat</i> ears?  Like, the cats I see in zoos?  How?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=confused,...You, uh, going to explain this to me?  I'm still shaky on what a <i>cat</i> is, much less a "Faunus."
0-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=frustrated,...Listen, I'm not from Earth.  You can't expect me to understand why you have cat ears...or why you've been hiding them.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:leela,targetStage:1=teasing,Ooh, what's <i>that</i> thing?  A men's gun fused with a woman's?  Not as unlikely as you might think.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:leela,targetStage:1=vain,Is that a men's gun that shoots lasers?  Listen, honey...combining male and female weapons is par for the course on the Nirvana.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:6=angry,What do you mean, <i>not fun</i>?  The fun is starting off with some teasing and then revealing your beautiful body!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:6=vain,<i>Hmph</i>.  It would seem <i>I'm</i> the only proper seductress around here, properly building up to nudity like a lady.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:6=bored,There's a right way and a wrong way to strip, and you're starting to fall into the wrong way.  It needs to escalate!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:6=smug,<i>Well</i>.  I'd never make it as a model if I deflated the excitement like you do.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2b=seductive,Ohhh, that's cute!  Now you're all dressed up like a maid--which Mejare frowns upon, but not as much as it does pirates.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2b=vain,Maid outfits are so adorable!  I'd dress up my girlfriend in one...if I could afford one.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2b=excited,Ohh, I wish I had something as cute as that!  Barnette and I could do a little roleplay, you know, pretend we have money.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2b=teasing,Life's tough for a Mejarian pirate...but the alternative is to be a maid for some rich old hag.  No thanks!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1=vain,<i>Ohoho</i>.  So your sword is <i>divine</i>, is it?  I guess that blows my silly little fashion item out of the water.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1=vain,If that thing's really so divine, maybe you should keep it on.  <i>Who knows what could happen here</i>?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1=teasing,Seems a little silly bringing a <i>divine</i> sword to this seedy little dump.  Does it know its owner is dirtying herself?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1=seductive,<i>Divine</i>, hm?  I like your style, honey...sword, green hair, and the favor of the gods.  If it's true.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,marker:fama_and_oma=confused,...Uh...what's a grandfather?  Like a grand-Fama?  It's mostly the "father" part I'm confused over.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1=awkward,That's, uh, a lot of family history.  You lost me at "father," whatever <i>that</i> means.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,marker:fama_and_oma=confused,...OK, I know what "grand" means, but what's a "father"?  Is that some weird Earth term for Omas?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1=frustrated,Wait, wait, stop, forget the makeup.  Now I'm confused as to what a "father" is, though apparently they're grand.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=angry,Seriously, what just happened?  You can't just shapeshift like that and act like nothing happened!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=confused,Are you even a woman?  Or an Earthling?  Are you some kind of alien shapeshifter?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=sad,<i>I'm so confused</i>.  Are you a shapeshifting alien?  Is this what Earth women are capable of?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=awkward,I had no idea Earth genetics were so...<i>advanced</i>.  Just changing your hair color on a whim.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3c=seductive,Oh, I see!  These must be Earth women's street clothes, right?  You're so considerate!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3c=smug,Going for something simple, huh?  Just basic Earth street clothes on display?  I get it.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3c=smug,Jacket and jeans?  Seen it--but I guess street clothes on Earth don't <i>have</i> to be all that different.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3c=teasing,Earth's street clothes sticking to the familiars, eh?  Mejarians tend to aim a little <i>tighter</i>.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4b=vain,Bare midriff?  My dress brings me pretty close to that...but <i>Dita's</i> the girl who wears it best!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4b=seductive,Ooh, my crewmate Dita dresses like that!  She's such a naive little thing, even with her midriff exposed all sexy-like.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4b=vain,I know a sweet young girl who dresses like that!  Dita's her name--she's so naive.  Barely even notices her exposed belly.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4b=smug,Yeah, Dita shows off her belly too.  I can't tell if she's just too naive to know how sexy she's being or just doesn't care.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3b=seductive,You're getting sexier all the time, cutie!  I like leaving my shoulders bare, too...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3b=vain,<i>Now</i> you're speaking my language!  A woman's shoulders should be as free as space is vast.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3b=vain,As long as the universe is expanding, a woman's shoulders should be unmasked to see it happen.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3b=seductive,<i>Exactly</i> what I would go for, with those uncovered shoulders.  I feel like you already know me so well, Vriska!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=frustrated,Not to be rude, but, uh...<i>you've totally got a screw loose</i>.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=confused,...Is this what I sound like?  I just think flirting is fun...this girl's <i>nuts</i>.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=bored,...Maybe I should stop flirting so much.  If <i>this</i> girl is the end result, that is.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=bored,...Does sex with men do this to you?  Because this girl's <i>really</i> starting to freak me out.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3a=seductive,Ooh, a sexy red-and-black!  I like your style, Vriska--and it clashes with your skin!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3a=teasing,Nothing like blood-red and shadow-black to get the heart beating.  Plus, those bullets get it going even faster!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3a=vain,Talk about making my heart jump.  Red, black, and bullets on the side!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3a=vain,I wish <i>I</i> owned something red...and this dress is the closest thing to black.  <i>A pirate's problems</i>!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=shocked,I--I'm sorry.  You didn't have to do that.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=awkward,I hardly ever see you without that thing...this is weird.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=confused,You, uh, want my sword?  You shouldn't have had to count that...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=awkward,You OK, Meia?  I don't want to antagonize you over that...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2=laughing,Knowing what I do about Earth, you <i>do</i> have plenty of reasons to drink.  So get to it, Miss Military.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2=stretching,Isn't Earth devastated where you come from?  Same here, honey...bottoms up, drink it all away.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2=interested,The world's a terrifying place...especially where you come from, I hear.  So don't feel bad about your little booze habit.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2=interested,What's all the beer for, honey?  Depressed about losing your boots, or about this "Second Impact" I keep hearing of?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2c=seductive,Oh, I see!  These must be Earth women's street clothes, right?  You're so considerate!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2c=smug,Starting off simple, huh?  Just basic Earth street clothes on display?  I get it.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2c=smug,Jacket and jeans?  Seen it--but I guess street clothes on Earth don't <i>have</i> to be all that different.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2c=teasing,Earth's street clothes sticking to the familiars, eh?  Mejarians tend to aim a little <i>tighter</i>.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a=laughing,Oho!  I <i>knew</i> you weren't so above it all!  And what a shift--bodysuits are pretty sexy.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a=laughing,Heeheehee!  I think the die was getting annoyed at you hiding your figure!  Go on, show off your hips!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a=interested,Going to do a little dance, Vriska?  Show off that figure a little?  Because that adorable polka-dotted suit is giving you a head start.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a=seductive,That's positively <i>adorable</i>, Vriska!  Polka-dots <i>and</i> a revealing shape.  Now it's <i>Mejarian</i> fashion!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=seductive,You're quite the fit little specimen, Rinkah.  I know a certain squadron leader who'd fall head-over-heels for you...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=teasing,I know a woman who loves muscles very much, Rinkah...you'd put her in a tizzy.  Do Earth women like each other in that way?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=seductive,Mind if I play a little matchmaker?  I brought my boss here...and she <i>loves</i> muscles on a woman, even if she won't admit it.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=seductive,You into women, sweetheart?  Because I know a certain blue-haired ice queen who would <i>totally</i> fall for those abs of yours.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=vain,Finally shedding all your little things.  That's good...women are much cuter unencumbered.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=seductive,I can't get over how cute you are...especially without all that extra padding!  Just a tiny little thing with gorgeous blue hair on top.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=smug,I wonder if you could pull off a dress like mine, Sei.  You're so preoccupied with all that silly armor and padding...why wear it?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=vain,What is it you do again that requires all this nonsense on your person?  You should wear something <i>sexy</i>!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=smug,Getting all liquored up, then?  Can't say you have the height for it.  Is this how you pick up men?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=interested,So is this how Earth girls spend a weekend?  Getting sloppy-drunk and falling on top of strange men?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=seductive,Oh, Sei, you're so cute!  Don't tell me you're just going to get sloshed and let some beastly man ravish you this evening.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=vain,Is this really what you Earth women do?  Get drunk and fondle strange men?  <i>Mejarians</i> are hopeless romantics.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:1=interested,OK, sure.  Just drop all pretenses. why don't you?  You're moving too fast with this.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:1=smug,You're a bigger tease than I am.  Hey, make them <i>work</i> for it.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:1=teasing,Hey, that little peek was enough.  You're going to ruin the surprise!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:1=vain,Come now, Velma, drag it out a bit!  You just got started...leave a little to the imagination.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=excited,<i>No!  Please!  I</i>--I--what?  Omigosh, that's <i>fantastic</i>!  Sorry I teased you!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=excited,...Oh my God!  You just changed your <i>whole</i> outfit?  That's spectacular!  Sorry about those skin comments.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=excited,Omigosh!  How--<i>how'd you do that</i>?  Do it again!  I want to see more outfits!  Who cares if your skin's blue?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=excited,Wha--what'd you just do?  <i>How</i>?  Tell me everything!  I'm sorry I made fun of your skin color!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:4=bored,For how excited you are to strip...I'm not sure I want to see what lies underneath.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:4=angry,As if we want to see your nasty little twig body.  You keep going on about how you're just a public plaything!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:4=frustrated,Oh, good, you're almost out.  Maybe then you can lose and leave and stop freaking me out.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:4=annoyed,Whatever ocean <i>you're</i> swimming in, I bet the fish are all dead.
0-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=smug,Still shaky on the game's rules, Miss Pixie?  You don't <i>have</i> to jump straight to be big-name items.
0-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=interested,Jeez, Kyu, settle down.  What kind of awful tease would jump straight to nudity?  You've got to keep them guessing.
0-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=laughing,Hey, I know <i>you're</i> not shy about it, but do try to understand why these poor Earth people might be ashamed.
0-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=vain,I don't get it either, Kyu, but don't get all mad.  Earth people just tend to hate their own bodies.

1-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=seductive,<i>There</i> you go.  Fully sighted like the rest of us!  I don't buy that nonsense about it being a visor...can I see it?
1-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=teasing,If that thing's really a visor, toss it over here.  If you get to cheat, why can't I see how?
1-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=teasing,You're not afraid to let a simple human woman see what advantages you had, right?  Give it here.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=interested,I'm calling your bluff on that thing being a visor.  I think you're some weird fetish-man who's been peeking at the cards underneath it.  Can I see?
1-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=awkward,...Wait, one of you is a <i>man</i>?  But--you--I...<i>wow</i>.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=confused,...Wait, I'm confused.  Men and women don't look <i>that</i> close.  Are you sure you're a man?
1-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=awkward,...Oh.  I really thought I was getting good at telling men and women apart...
1-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=confused,...Wait, you're a <i>man</i>?  I mean, Duero wears his hair long, and Meia's is short, so I don't assume anything there...
1-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=confused,...Wait, you're a <i>man</i>?  Aren't men...<i>tall</i>?  And, you know, <i>masculine</i>?
1-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=confused,...Oh, you're a man.  Well, that's disappointing.  What's the word for this?  <i>Han-droggo-niss</i> or something?
1-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=confused,...Huh.  You're a man.  I guess I can work with this, but <i>wow</i>.  You really had me fooled...
1-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=bored,...Oh.  Well, this wouldn't be the <i>first</i> time a man fooled me into thinking he's a woman, but <i>that</i> was on purpose...
1-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:1=laughing,Something the matter, Mr. Muscle?  You look so <i>dreadfully</i> uncomfortable.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:1=vain,Am I being distracting, Mr. Muscle?  Well, you're guilty of it yourself, with that hunky body of yours.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:1=seductive,Am I drawing your eyes, honey?  Well you started it--how can I <i>not</i> stare at all those muscles of yours?
1-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:1=teasing,See something you like, dearie?  You seem so <i>uncomfortable</i> around women for an Earth man--I guess you've never seen one like me!
1-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=annoyed,<i>Oho</i>.  So when <i>I</i> take off my sword, it's a lame first impression.  But not lame enough to not <i>copy</i>.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=vain,<i>Oh.  Mm-hm</i>.  Taking off your weapon--<i>I wonder where he got that idea</i>?
1-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=laughing,I didn't realize men were such fabulous hypocrites, Trigger Finger.  But at least you're not too scared to be disarmed around me.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=vain,<i>Removing a sword, eh</i>?  And here I thought men were the <i>honorable</i> sex.  But no, you're content to emulate what you criticize.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=interested,Oh, I see.  It's thin enough to see through, and you just like messing with people?
1-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=vain,Ah, I see--it's thin fabric.  Men and their deceitful ways, thinking they could pull one over on me!
1-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=interested,Could've fooled me, with that hand you were rocking.  Still, I guess the fabric's thin enough to see, and you just like playing pretend.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=teasing,So you're just a fan of the dungeon look, and the blindfold's thin enough to see through?  Nice try fooling Jura Basil Elden.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=confused,...Are you sure, Meia?  I mean, B.C. fooled <i>you</i>, too.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,...Wait, really?  Well, wouldn't be the first time, although poor Corrin here seems to have fooled us by <i>accident</i>.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=awkward,...Uh...good eye, Meia.  Well, this is awkward.  Sorry, Miss--Mister.  You're still pretty cute...for a man.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=confused,...Meia, don't mess with me.  Are you <i>sure</i>?  I mean, look at her--him.
1-male_removed_accessory=interested,Makes sense, I guess.  Men from Tarak don't know how to have fun, either.
1-male_removed_accessory=teasing,If only Duero were here.  He could help treat your <i>no-fun-itis</i>.
1-male_removed_accessory=confused,Is that some kind of rank insignia?
1-male_removed_accessory=interested,A <i>man</i> wearing accessories...you're just trying to make me curious, aren't you?
1-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=teasing,Well then, don't think I won't tease you!  It'll just be in a different sort of way...
1-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=laughing,A man who looks like a woman might be <i>exactly</i> the kind of seed I need...wouldn't want my children all hairy and gross.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=seductive,OK.  Well, nothing I can't work with!  Now you're cute in a completely different sort of way, <i>Mister</i> Corrin.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=vain,Don't feel too bad about it, then.  Women's bodies are so much smoother and luscious anyway...you should strive to emulate us.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=laughing,Hey, what <i>that</i> supposed to mean, Gearbox?  What Barnette and I do in private is none of your business.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=vain,Oh, please.  I'm the <i>giver</i> in my relationship...<i>Barnette</i> would get to wear the blindfold.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=teasing,<i>Oho</i>!  And Little Dungeon Bot shows some spunk.  You're getting more human all the time...<i>maybe we could use that blindfold</i>.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=teasing,Ha!  About time you manned up and talked back to me.  But to be honest, <i>Barnette's</i> usually wearing the blindfold.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=shocked,So why do you two look the same?  ...You're the same <i>person</i>?  But--how's that possible?
1-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=excited,W-wait, you're the <i>male</i> version of her?  Where's the male version of <i>me</i>?  I bet he's <i>handsome</i>!
1-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=vain,Oh, wow, you're the same person, but the opposite sex?  Where's the male <i>me</i>?  Tall, gorgeous--and <i>blond</i>!
1-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=thinking,T-this is really incredible.  Are there male versions of <i>every</i> woman I know?  I wonder if male Barnette is handsome...
1-female_removing_accessory=smug,Fine, fine.  Let's get this one over with.
1-female_removing_accessory=interested,I see you're taking <i>my</i> approach to stripping.
1-female_removing_accessory=smug,Bold choice, dear.  I can see why you'd come to a place like this.
1-female_removing_accessory=laughing,What a brutal blow to your modesty.  Women all over Earth shroud themselves in shame!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=teasing,<i>Oh, am I being too forward</i>?  My apologies.  Just know you'd have your pick of the bunch over there.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=seductive,Oh, sorry, I got carried away there.  But you're still a beautiful, musclebound woman!  That's a plus anywhere.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=seductive,Maybe that was a little forward of me.  But Mejarians would love you!  I wonder if men feel the same.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=teasing,Well, just know how in-demand you are on Mejare...if these bumbling Earth men start giving you the cold shoulder.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1=shocked,And a <i>Bless You</i> to--to...<i>where'd Launch go</i>?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1=confused,...That's, uh, a pretty hard sneeze.  Didn't realize it could turn your hair blue.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1=awkward,...Uh...is this an Earth thing, or would <i>my</i> hair turn blue if I sneezed too hard?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1=shocked,...<i>Launch?  Where'd the blonde girl go</i>?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=laughing,<i>Heeheehee</i>!  Oh, so you <i>are</i> the embarrassed type!  I was just calling you sexy, honey.  Relax.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, when a woman compliments your figure, you say "Thanks, you too."  Talk about <i>rude</i>.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=smug,I call you sexy enough to rock a bodysuit, and you get all flustered and offended.  Earth woman are so scared of each other.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=seductive,What?  That was <i>complimentary</i>, silly!  That suit is doing all <i>sorts</i> of favors for your hips.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=seductive,There you go!  Take off that hemet and show the world the cute face to match your sexy figure.  I wasn't teasing you before.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:3=interested,Sure you don't want to cling to that, dearie?  It <i>is</i> what marks as you as better than the rest of us.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:3=vain,I guess I can understand losing that, even as a princess.  It'll let your blonde hair flow free and unencumbered!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:3=seductive,Miss Princess dropping her overinflated jewelry?  Oh, I forgot--you're blonde, so you're not so bad.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:3=teasing,That's it, honey.  Lower yourself to the level of us dirty commoners.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:7=sad,<i>So long, Ang</i>--oh.  Well, I guess that counts.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:7=sad,<i>Awww</i>!  And here I thought I had beaten you.  But no, you proved too wily for me.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:7=vain,Damn Earth girls and their tricks.  <i>Who would do that, bring a bunch of accessories to a strip poker game</i>?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:7=smug,My pilot's eyes should've spotted that, but you snuck right past me--and yourself, even.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=confused,...Seriously, do you have <i>any</i> control over this?  Even a little?  Or is it all luck?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=confused,...Talk about living life up to chance, by the way.  This is so weird...and I'm a pilot.  I've <i>seen</i> weird.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=stretching,There she goes with another vortex.  Life is just a game of luck to our little fashionista here.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=vain,Too bad this isn't the spectacle it used to be.  But the random chance <i>does</i> keep it interesting!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=stretching,Just a <i>little</i> nervous?  Damn...I guess I'm too gorgeous to be scary.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=laughing,Nervous?  I was really trying to scare you--I guess you're already falling in love with me.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=vain,I was hoping for a better reaction than that.  Maybe you're tougher than you look--or I'm just that lovable!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=teasing,Just trying to break you in, dear.  You look positively miserable--I wanted to scare you into having fun!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=laughing,...Wow, I was just kidding.  You really <i>are</i> a sex fairy, just presenting like that.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=interested,Honey, you can't just <i>present</i> like that right from the get-go.  The audience can't get what they want until the grand finale.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=smug,Seems Earth girls overdo it as usual.  What kind of tease would I be if just spread my legs right here and now?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=teasing,Easy there, hot stuff.  You're already wearing so little--no need to spoil what surprises you <i>have</i>.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=laughing,...Well, that's one down.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=interested,...I really thought Earth girls handled men better than anyone.  I wanted to see her naked, too.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=smug,...That girl really needed some time on Mejare to toughen her up.  Men are giant pushovers.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=bored,Should've known we wouldn't all make it through this without bailing.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=smug,Well, I mean, if <i>anyone</i> was going to chicken out, it was going to be her.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=excited,Yes!  <i>Yes</i>!  Go for it!  Roll that die!  Can I have one?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=excited,You are so <i>cool</i>, Vriska!  Where can I get one of those things?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=excited,So it's that die that does it for you?  Can I have one?  I want to switch my outfit on the fly!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=teasing,Where'd you get that die?  I don't want to have to steal <i>yours</i>, you know!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:3=smug,And at last the trumped-up girlie removes the only thing maintaining her arrogance.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:3=teasing,Hey, Princess...you can't strip what makes <i>me</i> beautiful.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:3=smug,<i>Royals</i>...talk about jewelry for jewelry's sake.  It's supposed to <i>improve</i> your looks, not create them.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:3=teasing,Thaaaank <i>you</i>!  Now the property of Magno Vivan's pirates, little Miss Princess!  So sorry.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=smug,You going to throw up, sweetie?  Looks like it...well, don't face <i>me</i> when it happens.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=laughing,Can we get a janitor over here?  This girl's about to pee herself.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=annoyed,Jeez, this girl's gonna spend the evening sobbing.  Can't we just tell her to leave?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=bored,You're no fun.  You're such a head case that I can't even tease you.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:1=smug,<i>Dear, dear</i>.  Removing your fancy jewelry so readily?  Don't you care about that precious ttle of yours?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:1=teasing,Blonde women are always favorites of mine...even better, you're removing that ridiculous crown early.  Come have some fun with us commoners.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:1=interested,No sense keeping it on long, right?  You're already lowering yourself by playing this, anyway.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:1=teasing,Make the gown next to go, Miss Princess.  I think you'll find how fun we dirty common folk can be.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=teasing,<i>Atta girl</i>!  Now show me something magical!  ...Besides this.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=vain,These vortices are pretty fantastic, but it's the end result I care about.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=seductive,You really are something else.  I've already grown accustomed to your magic vortices!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=seductive,All that magic, but all I care about is the outfit waiting for me.  I never thought I'd meet someone like you!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=shocked,O-oh, are you putting the guns down?  I-I promise I won't touch them.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=awkward,<i>(Oh, thank God...)</i>  Er, Revy, good choice there.  Good choice.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=awkward,Hey, uh, now that you're disarmed, try to relax a little, would you?  Instead of yelling at us.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=sad,I was <i>hoping</i> tonight wouldn't end with someone getting shot.  Don't we all just want to see each other naked?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:0=interested,You're, uh, a little on display there, honey.  Unless that sort of thing excites you.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:0=laughing,Oh, please.  You're flashing us on purpose, aren't you?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:0=teasing,Don't act like that flash was an accident, dearie.  I know your type...nerdy little Parfet is a freak, too.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:0=smug,Showing off the underwear early?  Should've pegged you as the falsely-modest type.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=bored,<i>Management</i>?  What is <i>up</i> with this girl?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=confused,...I'm totally lost.  There's <i>rules</i> about what you can strip?  They didn't tell me any rules.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=confused,...Honey, did the bouncer clock you upside the head before you came in?  I'm not teasing, I'm dead serious.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=frustrated,I...<i>what</i>?  <i>Management</i>?  Yeah, you could <i>use</i> a little management, that's for sure.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>Aaack!  No!  Wait!  I'm too young to die!  Too beautiful</i>!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>Eek!  Noooo!  Wait!  I'll give you whatever you want</i>!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>Ack!  The Harvest!  I should've known this was a trap</i>!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>Eeeeek!  No!  Please!  I have a girlfriend</i>!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:5=angry,Wha--<i>oh, goddamnit!  Just take things off in a proper order</i>!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:5=angry,Hey, I came here to see some Earth nudity!  I don't appreciate being toyed around with!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:5=annoyed,Yeah, yeah, hotshot.  Real clever.  You definitely played this game and <i>didn't</i> want people to see you naked.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:5=bored,This must be how people feel around <i>me</i>.  Clinging to accessories...at least <i>I</i> have a body worth teasing.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:5=annoyed,I <i>hate it</i> when people bounce around with the importance of what they take off.  Let the audience know what to expect!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:0=seductive,<i>Heeheehee!  Such a tease, Miss Valentine</i>!  You can deny it all you want, but I see myself written all over you.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:0=vain,It's OK to want to distance yourself from me, dear.  I am, after all, taller and more beautiful.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:0=smug,Why deny the similarities, darling?  Women across Mejare <i>wish</i> they could be mentioned alongside Jura Basil Elden.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:0=teasing,What, too proud to admit we're alike?  <i>Afraid I do your image better than you</i>?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=excited,...So, uh, Ochako.  You're floating.  ...Are you going to explain that?  Because it's <i>incredible</i>!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=excited,Wait--are you--omigosh, Ochako, you can <i>float</i>?  That's so <i>cool</i>!  How are you doing that?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=excited,Omigosh!  <i>Omigosh</i>!  Ochako!  You can just <i>float</i> like that?  I'd have been doing it all game if I could <i>float</i>!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=excited,...OK.  Ochako.  You're...<i>levitating</i>.  And that is so <i>cool</i>!  What's your secret?  Can <i>I</i> learn to float?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,<i>Heeheehee</i>!  Oh, you're hopelessly in love now!  This is so <i>cute</i>!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,I <i>knew</i> we'd meet a girl here who was your type--and with all these hormones flowing, you'd <i>have</i> to break your stoicism eventually.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Do you hear that, Chunners?  It's the sound of ice melting nearby.  You've lit a fire in her heart.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,Go on, Meia, ask her out.  You both know how an exercise session is going to end.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Of course she does, honey!  She just refuses to show it, which is why I drag her to places like this.  She only ever smiles with Ezra's baby.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=stretching,Why do you think I brought her here, Miss Polka-dot?  You need <i>steam</i> to melt all that ice of hers...or a baby.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=seductive,Oh, my Leader is an absolute <i>sweetheart</i>, Miss Accent.  You should see her with Ezra's little baby!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Meia's the sweetest girl you'll ever meet, Miss Ladybug...but she only shows it when she's making our crewmate's baby laugh.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=seductive,Meia just doesn't like crowds or strangers, that's all.  She thinks she's got to be all dignified.  But see how she acts with a baby!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=seductive,<i>Oooh</i>!  That sounded so <i>cute</i>, honey, whatever it was!  What does that mean?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=seductive,<i>Teeheehee</i>!  I don't know what you said, but your home language sounds so silky smooth and romantic!  What's it mean?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, what's <i>that</i> mean, dear?  Because it sounded like the most romantic thing I've ever heard!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=excited,Omigosh, that's so <i>romantic</i>-sounding!  What does it mean?  I want to talk like that!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=bored,It's refreshing to know you won't acknowledge anything I say.  Real liberating.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=awkward,...Look, I know I tease a lot, but I'm just having fun.  Nothing about <i>this</i> is fun.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=frustrated,Talk about a lost cause.  She won't even acknowledge me.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=teasing,<i>Hey, Ocean Girl.  If you're being held against your will, blink twice.  I'm a pirate, I understand</i>.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:1=interested,And what do we have here?  Miserable old Miss Brunette is admitting she's no better than the rest of us?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:1=laughing,Hey, Miss Princess.  You don't mind if this pirate holds onto that tiara, do you?  Just for a little <i>inspection</i>?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:1=teasing,Don't stop there, Miss Princess.  Nothing satisfies a pirate quite like watching nobles stripped down to nothing at all.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:1=laughing,Take away her tiara and she's a brunette in a dress.  Take away her dress...and I hope her butt is cute.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=shocked,Wait, your <i>eyepiece</i>?  I...OK, then.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=awkward,Uh...OK.  I--I didn't think...you'd take that off.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=shocked,O-oh wow, your eyepiece.  I mean, <i>they'll</i> think it's nothing, but...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=confused,...Did I miss something?  Can't we take off whatever we want?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=confused,...Is there really a nebulous <i>management</i> that's got guns to our heads if we don't strip how they want?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=confused,...Who exactly is holding a gun to your head and making you do this?  Hey, are you listening?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=confused,...Why do you have to take off your shoes next?  I mean, you <i>should</i>, but apparently you <i>have</i> to?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=teasing,Hey, Miss Military--where'd you get all that beer?  Throw some this way, let's have fun!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=vain,Just chugging it down, huh, Miss Military?  <i>Mejarians</i> are so much more tasteful...but give me some, if you don't mind.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=smug,I hope you brought enough booze for <i>everyone</i>, Misato.  It's not nice to hoard.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=stretching,I thought I smelled beer...more of a rum woman myself, but when on Earth, drink as the classless Earth girls drink.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0=teasing,You got that idea from <i>me</i>, you little cheat!  Once again the crafty Mejarian paves the way for the rest of womankind.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0=smug,<i>My, my, Lyn</i>.  <i>Bending the rules by removing a weapon?</i>  The <i>audacity</i>.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0=teasing,You're just copying what I came up with before...but you've got Barnette's cute green hair, so I'll let it slide.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0=laughing,I'd teach you a thing or two with my rapier for copying me like this, but, well, I threw it away.
1-female_removed_accessory=bored,I guess I can't complain when I own just as many trinkets.
1-female_removed_accessory=teasing,Hey, <i>my</i> accessories are a lot more fashionable.  <i>I</i> have an excuse to wear them.
1-female_removed_accessory=interested,Hey, <i>I</i> lost my sword.  Now <i>that's</i> exciting.
1-female_removed_accessory=stretching,Guess I'll just go over the formations practice for tomorrow.  You know, since you can't hold my attention.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3b=seductive,You're getting sexier all the time, cutie!  I like leaving my shoulders bare, too...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3b=vain,<i>Now</i> you're speaking my language!  A woman's shoulders should be as free as space is vast.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3b=vain,As long as the universe is expanding, a woman's shoulders should be unmasked to see it happen.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3b=seductive,<i>Exactly</i> what I would go for, with those uncovered shoulders.  I feel like you already know me so well, Vriska!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3a=seductive,Ooh, a sexy red-and-black!  I like your style, Vriska--and it clashes with your skin!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3a=teasing,Nothing like blood-red and shadow-black to get the heart beating.  Plus, those bullets get it going even faster!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3a=vain,Talk about making my heart jump.  Red, black, and bullets on the side!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3a=vain,I wish <i>I</i> owned something red...and this dress is the closest thing to black.  <i>A pirate's problems</i>!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,Don't ask questions you don't want the answer to, Meia.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=stretching,This is why I mostly stick to asking about men and fashion.  See what happens?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=interested,See, Meia?  Don't encourage people to discuss things you don't care about.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Oh, <i>this</i> ought to be a treat.  <i>Have fun, Leader</i>!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=excited,<i>No!  Please!  I</i>--I--what?  Omigosh, that's <i>fantastic</i>!  Sorry I teased you!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=excited,...Oh my God!  You just changed your <i>whole</i> outfit?  That's spectacular!  Sorry about those skin comments.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=excited,Omigosh!  How--<i>how'd you do that</i>?  Do it again!  I want to see more outfits!  Who cares if your skin's blue?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=excited,Wha--what'd you just do?  <i>How</i>?  Tell me everything!  I'm sorry I made fun of your skin color!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:leela,targetStage:1=teasing,Ooh, what's <i>that</i> thing?  A men's gun fused with a woman's?  Not as unlikely as you might think.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:leela,targetStage:1=vain,Is that a men's gun that shoots lasers?  Listen, honey...combining male and female weapons is par for the course on the Nirvana.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4c=laughing,Hah!  Going for <i>my</i> look, are you?  Yeah, cleavage tends to get people to do what you want.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4c=laughing,Feeling a little breezy, honey?  Don't worry, you'll get used to it--I did.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4c=laughing,Pfft!  How do you like <i>my</i> style, then?  I'm flattered you had this on the backburner, sweetie.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4c=vain,Doesn't the breeze feel good between your breasts?  It always perks me up when I'm down.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=seductive,You're quite the fit little specimen, Rinkah.  I know a certain squadron leader who'd fall head-over-heels for you...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=teasing,I know a woman who loves muscles very much, Rinkah...you'd put her in a tizzy.  Do Earth women like each other in that way?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=seductive,Mind if I play a little matchmaker?  I brought my boss here...and she <i>loves</i> muscles on a woman, even if she won't admit it.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=seductive,You into women, sweetheart?  Because I know a certain blue-haired ice queen who would <i>totally</i> fall for those abs of yours.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2=laughing,Knowing what I do about Earth, you <i>do</i> have plenty of reasons to drink.  So get to it, Miss Military.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2=stretching,Isn't Earth devastated where you come from?  Same here, honey...bottoms up, drink it all away.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2=interested,The world's a terrifying place...especially where you come from, I hear.  So don't feel bad about your little booze habit.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2=interested,What's all the beer for, honey?  Depressed about losing your boots, or about this "Second Impact" I keep hearing of?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=vain,Finally shedding all your little things.  That's good...women are much cuter unencumbered.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=seductive,I can't get over how cute you are...especially without all that extra padding!  Just a tiny little thing with gorgeous blue hair on top.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=smug,I wonder if you could pull off a dress like mine, Sei.  You're so preoccupied with all that silly armor and padding...why wear it?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=vain,What is it you do again that requires all this nonsense on your person?  You should wear something <i>sexy</i>!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2b=seductive,Ohhh, that's cute!  Now you're all dressed up like a maid--which Mejare frowns upon, but not as much as it does pirates.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2b=vain,Maid outfits are so adorable!  I'd dress up my girlfriend in one...if I could afford one.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2b=excited,Ohh, I wish I had something as cute as that!  Barnette and I could do a little roleplay, you know, pretend we have money.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2b=teasing,Life's tough for a Mejarian pirate...but the alternative is to be a maid for some rich old hag.  No thanks!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2c=seductive,Oh, I see!  These must be Earth women's street clothes, right?  You're so considerate!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2c=smug,Starting off simple, huh?  Just basic Earth street clothes on display?  I get it.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2c=smug,Jacket and jeans?  Seen it--but I guess street clothes on Earth don't <i>have</i> to be all that different.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2c=teasing,Earth's street clothes sticking to the familiars, eh?  Mejarians tend to aim a little <i>tighter</i>.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=frustrated,Not to be rude, but, uh...<i>you've totally got a screw loose</i>.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=confused,...Is this what I sound like?  I just think flirting is fun...this girl's <i>nuts</i>.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=bored,...Maybe I should stop flirting so much.  If <i>this</i> girl is the end result, that is.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=bored,...Does sex with men do this to you?  Because this girl's <i>really</i> starting to freak me out.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=smug,Getting all liquored up, then?  Can't say you have the height for it.  Is this how you pick up men?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=interested,So is this how Earth girls spend a weekend?  Getting sloppy-drunk and falling on top of strange men?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=seductive,Oh, Sei, you're so cute!  Don't tell me you're just going to get sloshed and let some beastly man ravish you this evening.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=vain,Is this really what you Earth women do?  Get drunk and fondle strange men?  <i>Mejarians</i> are hopeless romantics.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=awkward,Er...as long as you're OK with it.  I mean, I don't want you to think you had to.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=awkward,That's...brave of you, Meia.  Really.  Sorry.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=awkward,I mean, I dragged you here, but...I figured you'd leave that on.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=interested,Oh, you're back.  Try not to make a habit of that, dearie...it's not very intimidating.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=confused,...Well, at least you came back.  Serously, did a man kill your family or something?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=teasing,Listen, honey, you ought to come my my home planet sometime.  It's nothing but women...and we make a habit of shooting nasty men.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=vain,You have <i>nothing</i> to be scared of, honey.  I've fought the toughest, burliest men around and come out on top!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,Oh, please.  All this titilating nudity is enough excitement for one evening.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,As if I need to drink to have fun when there's full-blown Earth nudity in our midst!  <i>I resent your implication</i>.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,Hey, Misato can drink alone.  <i>I</i> only drink when I know my darling Barnette is there to take care of me.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:meia=thinking,Hey now, I'm tall!  I can handle at least...uh...a few beers, give or take.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:1=interested,OK, sure.  Just drop all pretenses. why don't you?  You're moving too fast with this.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:1=smug,You're a bigger tease than I am.  Hey, make them <i>work</i> for it.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:1=teasing,Hey, that little peek was enough.  You're going to ruin the surprise!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:1=vain,Come now, Velma, drag it out a bit!  You just got started...leave a little to the imagination.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=confused,Me-<i>ow</i>!  Heeheehee--wait, you're serious?  Like, the animal, a cat?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=confused,...Earth girls can have <i>cat</i> ears?  Like, the cats I see in zoos?  How?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=confused,...You, uh, going to explain this to me?  I'm still shaky on what a <i>cat</i> is, much less a "Faunus."
1-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=frustrated,...Listen, I'm not from Earth.  You can't expect me to understand why you have cat ears...or why you've been hiding them.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a=laughing,Oho!  I <i>knew</i> you weren't so above it all!  And what a shift--bodysuits are pretty sexy.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a=laughing,Heeheehee!  I think the die was getting annoyed at you hiding your figure!  Go on, show off your hips!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a=interested,Going to do a little dance, Vriska?  Show off that figure a little?  Because that adorable polka-dotted suit is giving you a head start.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a=seductive,That's positively <i>adorable</i>, Vriska!  Polka-dots <i>and</i> a revealing shape.  Now it's <i>Mejarian</i> fashion!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3c=seductive,Oh, I see!  These must be Earth women's street clothes, right?  You're so considerate!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3c=smug,Going for something simple, huh?  Just basic Earth street clothes on display?  I get it.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3c=smug,Jacket and jeans?  Seen it--but I guess street clothes on Earth don't <i>have</i> to be all that different.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3c=teasing,Earth's street clothes sticking to the familiars, eh?  Mejarians tend to aim a little <i>tighter</i>.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=teasing,I've got my eye on you, Miss Pixie...because my ears are totally confused when you talk.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=vain,Little Miss Pixie must think she's clever, saying all these things that go over my poor foreigner head.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=seductive,Have some sympathy for this poor alien woman, Kyu.  You're always saying things only an Earth woman would understand.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=vain,Feel free to start making sense for <i>everyone</i>, Miss Pixie.  Think of the poor aliens in your presence when you speak.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1=vain,<i>Ohoho</i>.  So your sword is <i>divine</i>, is it?  I guess that blows my silly little fashion item out of the water.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1=vain,If that thing's really so divine, maybe you should keep it on.  <i>Who knows what could happen here</i>?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1=teasing,Seems a little silly bringing a <i>divine</i> sword to this seedy little dump.  Does it know its owner is dirtying herself?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1=seductive,<i>Divine</i>, hm?  I like your style, honey...sword, green hair, and the favor of the gods.  If it's true.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:6=angry,What do you mean, <i>not fun</i>?  The fun is starting off with some teasing and then revealing your beautiful body!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:6=vain,<i>Hmph</i>.  It would seem <i>I'm</i> the only proper seductress around here, properly building up to nudity like a lady.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:6=bored,There's a right way and a wrong way to strip, and you're starting to fall into the wrong way.  It needs to escalate!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:6=smug,<i>Well</i>.  I'd never make it as a model if I deflated the excitement like you do.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,marker:fama_and_oma=confused,...Uh...what's a grandfather?  Like a grand-Fama?  It's mostly the "father" part I'm confused over.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1=awkward,That's, uh, a lot of family history.  You lost me at "father," whatever <i>that</i> means.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,marker:fama_and_oma=confused,...OK, I know what "grand" means, but what's a "father"?  Is that some weird Earth term for Omas?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1=frustrated,Wait, wait, stop, forget the makeup.  Now I'm confused as to what a "father" is, though apparently they're grand.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=annoyed,Am I getting through to you?  Jura to Ocean Girl!  <i>Hello</i>?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=angry,Hey, Ocean Girl!  <i>I'm talking to you</i>!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=annoyed,What's your name, floozy?  <i>Moon</i>?  Yeah, you're a lunatic, alright!  Say something to me!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=annoyed,Hel-<i>looo</i>?  Am I breaking up?  Have we achieved first contact?  <i>God</i>...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4b=vain,Bare midriff?  My dress brings me pretty close to that...but <i>Dita's</i> the girl who wears it best!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4b=seductive,Ooh, my crewmate Dita dresses like that!  She's such a naive little thing, even with her midriff exposed all sexy-like.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4b=vain,I know a sweet young girl who dresses like that!  Dita's her name--she's so naive.  Barely even notices her exposed belly.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4b=smug,Yeah, Dita shows off her belly too.  I can't tell if she's just too naive to know how sexy she's being or just doesn't care.
1-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=smug,Still shaky on the game's rules, Miss Pixie?  You don't <i>have</i> to jump straight to be big-name items.
1-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=interested,Jeez, Kyu, settle down.  What kind of awful tease would jump straight to nudity?  You've got to keep them guessing.
1-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=laughing,Hey, I know <i>you're</i> not shy about it, but do try to understand why these poor Earth people might be ashamed.
1-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=vain,I don't get it either, Kyu, but don't get all mad.  Earth people just tend to hate their own bodies.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2a=awkward,Uh...ew.  That's kind of ratty, actually.  But you've got more, right?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2a=confused,...Now you kind of smell salty.  Don't you have something else?  Something <i>nicer</i>?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2a=confused,...I have no clue what that is.  Kind of looks like <i>men's</i> clothing...all tattered and gross.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2a=confused,...That's certainly a lot of extra stuff.  But somehow it just ends up looking like rags, whatever it is.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:4=bored,For how excited you are to strip...I'm not sure I want to see what lies underneath.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:4=angry,As if we want to see your nasty little twig body.  You keep going on about how you're just a public plaything!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:4=frustrated,Oh, good, you're almost out.  Maybe then you can lose and leave and stop freaking me out.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:4=annoyed,Whatever ocean <i>you're</i> swimming in, I bet the fish are all dead.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Oh, dear.  Now you've done it, Rinkah...Meia <i>loves</i> women with muscles.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=interested,Just try to ride this out, honey.  Meia acts icy, but those muscles melt her right down like nobody's business.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Don't believe her cover stories, Rinkah.  Meia doesn't want your muscles...she wants <i>you</i>.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,Heehee!  Meia tends to get like this around particularly <i>fit</i> women, if you follow.  Don't mind her desperate advances.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=angry,Seriously, what just happened?  You can't just shapeshift like that and act like nothing happened!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=confused,Are you even a woman?  Or an Earthling?  Are you some kind of alien shapeshifter?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=sad,<i>I'm so confused</i>.  Are you a shapeshifting alien?  Is this what Earth women are capable of?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=awkward,I had no idea Earth genetics were so...<i>advanced</i>.  Just changing your hair color on a whim.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=vain,Talk about a terrestial booze-a-thon.  Oh, well, I've got the height to drink with the best of them!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=smug,I get that this place is a bar, but damn, ladies, at least <i>pretend</i> you're trying to win.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=interested,So I get this place has a no-touching rule, but you two aren't really disguising how you're planning to take some of us home afterward.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=laughing,I <i>do</i> love drinking, but I don't think I could keep up with you two.  I guess living around men forces you to drown your sorrows.

2-male_removing_accessory=smug,Trinkets on a man?  Like a license plate on my Dread.
2-male_removing_accessory=interested,A man dolling himself up is so cute.  Leave that to women--we're more beautiful.
2-male_removing_accessory=laughing,Is this revenge for <i>my</i> accessories?  Well, I hope you have some more.
2-male_removing_accessory=laughing,Can I still complain about this?  For now...<i>yes</i>.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=awkward,...Wait, one of you is a <i>man</i>?  But--you--I...<i>wow</i>.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=confused,...Wait, I'm confused.  Men and women don't look <i>that</i> close.  Are you sure you're a man?
2-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=awkward,...Oh.  I really thought I was getting good at telling men and women apart...
2-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=confused,...Wait, you're a <i>man</i>?  I mean, Duero wears his hair long, and Meia's is short, so I don't assume anything there...
2-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=confused,...Are you sure, Meia?  I mean, B.C. fooled <i>you</i>, too.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,...Wait, really?  Well, wouldn't be the first time, although poor Corrin here seems to have fooled us by <i>accident</i>.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=awkward,...Uh...good eye, Meia.  Well, this is awkward.  Sorry, Miss--Mister.  You're still pretty cute...for a man.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=confused,...Meia, don't mess with me.  Are you <i>sure</i>?  I mean, look at her--him.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:1=laughing,Something the matter, Mr. Muscle?  You look so <i>dreadfully</i> uncomfortable.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:1=vain,Am I being distracting, Mr. Muscle?  Well, you're guilty of it yourself, with that hunky body of yours.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:1=seductive,Am I drawing your eyes, honey?  Well you started it--how can I <i>not</i> stare at all those muscles of yours?
2-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:1=teasing,See something you like, dearie?  You seem so <i>uncomfortable</i> around women for an Earth man--I guess you've never seen one like me!
2-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=confused,...Wait, you're a <i>man</i>?  Aren't men...<i>tall</i>?  And, you know, <i>masculine</i>?
2-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=confused,...Oh, you're a man.  Well, that's disappointing.  What's the word for this?  <i>Han-droggo-niss</i> or something?
2-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=confused,...Huh.  You're a man.  I guess I can work with this, but <i>wow</i>.  You really had me fooled...
2-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=bored,...Oh.  Well, this wouldn't be the <i>first</i> time a man fooled me into thinking he's a woman, but <i>that</i> was on purpose...
2-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=interested,Oh, I see.  It's thin enough to see through, and you just like messing with people?
2-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=vain,Ah, I see--it's thin fabric.  Men and their deceitful ways, thinking they could pull one over on me!
2-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=interested,Could've fooled me, with that hand you were rocking.  Still, I guess the fabric's thin enough to see, and you just like playing pretend.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=teasing,So you're just a fan of the dungeon look, and the blindfold's thin enough to see through?  Nice try fooling Jura Basil Elden.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=seductive,<i>There</i> you go.  Fully sighted like the rest of us!  I don't buy that nonsense about it being a visor...can I see it?
2-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=teasing,If that thing's really a visor, toss it over here.  If you get to cheat, why can't I see how?
2-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=teasing,You're not afraid to let a simple human woman see what advantages you had, right?  Give it here.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=interested,I'm calling your bluff on that thing being a visor.  I think you're some weird fetish-man who's been peeking at the cards underneath it.  Can I see?
2-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=annoyed,<i>Oho</i>.  So when <i>I</i> take off my sword, it's a lame first impression.  But not lame enough to not <i>copy</i>.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=vain,<i>Oh.  Mm-hm</i>.  Taking off your weapon--<i>I wonder where he got that idea</i>?
2-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=laughing,I didn't realize men were such fabulous hypocrites, Trigger Finger.  But at least you're not too scared to be disarmed around me.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=vain,<i>Removing a sword, eh</i>?  And here I thought men were the <i>honorable</i> sex.  But no, you're content to emulate what you criticize.
2-male_removed_accessory=seductive,Slow down there, ~name~.  Your manly accessories might push me over the edge.
2-male_removed_accessory=laughing,You're a regular Bart for this sense of fashion.  He dressed as a woman once.
2-male_removed_accessory=stretching,Stripping decisions like this should be punished.  You know what to do, Dealer.
2-male_removed_accessory=laughing,Funny.  I consider <i>men</i> accessories.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=teasing,Well then, don't think I won't tease you!  It'll just be in a different sort of way...
2-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=laughing,A man who looks like a woman might be <i>exactly</i> the kind of seed I need...wouldn't want my children all hairy and gross.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=seductive,OK.  Well, nothing I can't work with!  Now you're cute in a completely different sort of way, <i>Mister</i> Corrin.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=vain,Don't feel too bad about it, then.  Women's bodies are so much smoother and luscious anyway...you should strive to emulate us.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=shocked,So why do you two look the same?  ...You're the same <i>person</i>?  But--how's that possible?
2-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=excited,W-wait, you're the <i>male</i> version of her?  Where's the male version of <i>me</i>?  I bet he's <i>handsome</i>!
2-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=vain,Oh, wow, you're the same person, but the opposite sex?  Where's the male <i>me</i>?  Tall, gorgeous--and <i>blond</i>!
2-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=thinking,T-this is really incredible.  Are there male versions of <i>every</i> woman I know?  I wonder if male Barnette is handsome...
2-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=laughing,Hey, what <i>that</i> supposed to mean, Gearbox?  What Barnette and I do in private is none of your business.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=vain,Oh, please.  I'm the <i>giver</i> in my relationship...<i>Barnette</i> would get to wear the blindfold.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=teasing,<i>Oho</i>!  And Little Dungeon Bot shows some spunk.  You're getting more human all the time...<i>maybe we could use that blindfold</i>.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=teasing,Ha!  About time you manned up and talked back to me.  But to be honest, <i>Barnette's</i> usually wearing the blindfold.
2-female_removing_accessory=seductive,Kinda cute.  Where can I get something like your ~clothing~?
2-female_removing_accessory=smug,That's it, huh?  Well, <i>I</i> have no right to complain about it.
2-female_removing_accessory=laughing,Way to get into the spirit of things, ~name~.  I'd never take off something so frivolous.
2-female_removing_accessory=bored,Jeez, did you take fun lessons from Meia or what?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=bored,It's refreshing to know you won't acknowledge anything I say.  Real liberating.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=awkward,...Look, I know I tease a lot, but I'm just having fun.  Nothing about <i>this</i> is fun.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=frustrated,Talk about a lost cause.  She won't even acknowledge me.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=teasing,<i>Hey, Ocean Girl.  If you're being held against your will, blink twice.  I'm a pirate, I understand</i>.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1=shocked,And a <i>Bless You</i> to--to...<i>where'd Launch go</i>?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1=confused,...That's, uh, a pretty hard sneeze.  Didn't realize it could turn your hair blue.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1=awkward,...Uh...is this an Earth thing, or would <i>my</i> hair turn blue if I sneezed too hard?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1=shocked,...<i>Launch?  Where'd the blonde girl go</i>?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:5=angry,Wha--<i>oh, goddamnit!  Just take things off in a proper order</i>!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:5=angry,Hey, I came here to see some Earth nudity!  I don't appreciate being toyed around with!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:5=annoyed,Yeah, yeah, hotshot.  Real clever.  You definitely played this game and <i>didn't</i> want people to see you naked.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:5=bored,This must be how people feel around <i>me</i>.  Clinging to accessories...at least <i>I</i> have a body worth teasing.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:5=annoyed,I <i>hate it</i> when people bounce around with the importance of what they take off.  Let the audience know what to expect!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=stretching,Just a <i>little</i> nervous?  Damn...I guess I'm too gorgeous to be scary.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=laughing,Nervous?  I was really trying to scare you--I guess you're already falling in love with me.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=vain,I was hoping for a better reaction than that.  Maybe you're tougher than you look--or I'm just that lovable!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=teasing,Just trying to break you in, dear.  You look positively miserable--I wanted to scare you into having fun!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=shocked,O-oh, are you putting the guns down?  I-I promise I won't touch them.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=awkward,<i>(Oh, thank God...)</i>  Er, Revy, good choice there.  Good choice.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=awkward,Hey, uh, now that you're disarmed, try to relax a little, would you?  Instead of yelling at us.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=sad,I was <i>hoping</i> tonight wouldn't end with someone getting shot.  Don't we all just want to see each other naked?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:1=smug,<i>Dear, dear</i>.  Removing your fancy jewelry so readily?  Don't you care about that precious ttle of yours?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:1=teasing,Blonde women are always favorites of mine...even better, you're removing that ridiculous crown early.  Come have some fun with us commoners.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:1=interested,No sense keeping it on long, right?  You're already lowering yourself by playing this, anyway.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:1=teasing,Make the gown next to go, Miss Princess.  I think you'll find how fun we dirty common folk can be.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=teasing,<i>Oh, am I being too forward</i>?  My apologies.  Just know you'd have your pick of the bunch over there.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=seductive,Oh, sorry, I got carried away there.  But you're still a beautiful, musclebound woman!  That's a plus anywhere.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=seductive,Maybe that was a little forward of me.  But Mejarians would love you!  I wonder if men feel the same.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=teasing,Well, just know how in-demand you are on Mejare...if these bumbling Earth men start giving you the cold shoulder.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:3=interested,Sure you don't want to cling to that, dearie?  It <i>is</i> what marks as you as better than the rest of us.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:3=vain,I guess I can understand losing that, even as a princess.  It'll let your blonde hair flow free and unencumbered!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:3=seductive,Miss Princess dropping her overinflated jewelry?  Oh, I forgot--you're blonde, so you're not so bad.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:3=teasing,That's it, honey.  Lower yourself to the level of us dirty commoners.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=laughing,...Wow, I was just kidding.  You really <i>are</i> a sex fairy, just presenting like that.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=interested,Honey, you can't just <i>present</i> like that right from the get-go.  The audience can't get what they want until the grand finale.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=smug,Seems Earth girls overdo it as usual.  What kind of tease would I be if just spread my legs right here and now?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=teasing,Easy there, hot stuff.  You're already wearing so little--no need to spoil what surprises you <i>have</i>.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:3=smug,And at last the trumped-up girlie removes the only thing maintaining her arrogance.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:3=teasing,Hey, Princess...you can't strip what makes <i>me</i> beautiful.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:3=smug,<i>Royals</i>...talk about jewelry for jewelry's sake.  It's supposed to <i>improve</i> your looks, not create them.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:3=teasing,Thaaaank <i>you</i>!  Now the property of Magno Vivan's pirates, little Miss Princess!  So sorry.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=teasing,Hey, Miss Military--where'd you get all that beer?  Throw some this way, let's have fun!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=vain,Just chugging it down, huh, Miss Military?  <i>Mejarians</i> are so much more tasteful...but give me some, if you don't mind.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=smug,I hope you brought enough booze for <i>everyone</i>, Misato.  It's not nice to hoard.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=stretching,I thought I smelled beer...more of a rum woman myself, but when on Earth, drink as the classless Earth girls drink.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:0=seductive,<i>Heeheehee!  Such a tease, Miss Valentine</i>!  You can deny it all you want, but I see myself written all over you.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:0=vain,It's OK to want to distance yourself from me, dear.  I am, after all, taller and more beautiful.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:0=smug,Why deny the similarities, darling?  Women across Mejare <i>wish</i> they could be mentioned alongside Jura Basil Elden.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:0=teasing,What, too proud to admit we're alike?  <i>Afraid I do your image better than you</i>?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=confused,...Did I miss something?  Can't we take off whatever we want?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=confused,...Is there really a nebulous <i>management</i> that's got guns to our heads if we don't strip how they want?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=confused,...Who exactly is holding a gun to your head and making you do this?  Hey, are you listening?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=confused,...Why do you have to take off your shoes next?  I mean, you <i>should</i>, but apparently you <i>have</i> to?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=seductive,<i>Oooh</i>!  That sounded so <i>cute</i>, honey, whatever it was!  What does that mean?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=seductive,<i>Teeheehee</i>!  I don't know what you said, but your home language sounds so silky smooth and romantic!  What's it mean?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, what's <i>that</i> mean, dear?  Because it sounded like the most romantic thing I've ever heard!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=excited,Omigosh, that's so <i>romantic</i>-sounding!  What does it mean?  I want to talk like that!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:7=sad,<i>So long, Ang</i>--oh.  Well, I guess that counts.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:7=sad,<i>Awww</i>!  And here I thought I had beaten you.  But no, you proved too wily for me.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:7=vain,Damn Earth girls and their tricks.  <i>Who would do that, bring a bunch of accessories to a strip poker game</i>?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:7=smug,My pilot's eyes should've spotted that, but you snuck right past me--and yourself, even.
2-female_removing_accessory,alsoPlaying:meia=seductive,Kinda cute.  Where can I get something like your ~clothing~?
2-female_removing_accessory,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,That's it, huh?  Well, <i>I</i> have no right to complain about it.
2-female_removing_accessory,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,Way to get into the spirit of things, ~name~.  I'd never take off something so frivolous.
2-female_removing_accessory,alsoPlaying:meia=bored,Have you been giving lessons on fun to this girl, Meia?  Jeez.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=shocked,Y-your eyepiece?  You're not serious?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=shocked,Your <i>eyepiece</i>?  Are you...feeling alright, Meia?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=shocked,O-oh, wow.  That's...unexpected.  OK.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0=teasing,You got that idea from <i>me</i>, you little cheat!  Once again the crafty Mejarian paves the way for the rest of womankind.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0=smug,<i>My, my, Lyn</i>.  <i>Bending the rules by removing a weapon?</i>  The <i>audacity</i>.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0=teasing,You're just copying what I came up with before...but you've got Barnette's cute green hair, so I'll let it slide.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0=laughing,I'd teach you a thing or two with my rapier for copying me like this, but, well, I threw it away.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:1=interested,And what do we have here?  Miserable old Miss Brunette is admitting she's no better than the rest of us?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:1=laughing,Hey, Miss Princess.  You don't mind if this pirate holds onto that tiara, do you?  Just for a little <i>inspection</i>?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:1=teasing,Don't stop there, Miss Princess.  Nothing satisfies a pirate quite like watching nobles stripped down to nothing at all.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:1=laughing,Take away her tiara and she's a brunette in a dress.  Take away her dress...and I hope her butt is cute.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=confused,...Seriously, do you have <i>any</i> control over this?  Even a little?  Or is it all luck?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=confused,...Talk about living life up to chance, by the way.  This is so weird...and I'm a pilot.  I've <i>seen</i> weird.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=stretching,There she goes with another vortex.  Life is just a game of luck to our little fashionista here.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=vain,Too bad this isn't the spectacle it used to be.  But the random chance <i>does</i> keep it interesting!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=teasing,<i>Atta girl</i>!  Now show me something magical!  ...Besides this.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=vain,These vortices are pretty fantastic, but it's the end result I care about.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=seductive,You really are something else.  I've already grown accustomed to your magic vortices!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=seductive,All that magic, but all I care about is the outfit waiting for me.  I never thought I'd meet someone like you!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=excited,Yes!  <i>Yes</i>!  Go for it!  Roll that die!  Can I have one?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=excited,You are so <i>cool</i>, Vriska!  Where can I get one of those things?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=excited,So it's that die that does it for you?  Can I have one?  I want to switch my outfit on the fly!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=teasing,Where'd you get that die?  I don't want to have to steal <i>yours</i>, you know!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,<i>Heeheehee</i>!  Oh, you're hopelessly in love now!  This is so <i>cute</i>!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,I <i>knew</i> we'd meet a girl here who was your type--and with all these hormones flowing, you'd <i>have</i> to break your stoicism eventually.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Do you hear that, Chunners?  It's the sound of ice melting nearby.  You've lit a fire in her heart.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,Go on, Meia, ask her out.  You both know how an exercise session is going to end.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>Aaack!  No!  Wait!  I'm too young to die!  Too beautiful</i>!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>Eek!  Noooo!  Wait!  I'll give you whatever you want</i>!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>Ack!  The Harvest!  I should've known this was a trap</i>!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>Eeeeek!  No!  Please!  I have a girlfriend</i>!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Of course she does, honey!  She just refuses to show it, which is why I drag her to places like this.  She only ever smiles with Ezra's baby.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=stretching,Why do you think I brought her here, Miss Polka-dot?  You need <i>steam</i> to melt all that ice of hers...or a baby.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=seductive,Oh, my Leader is an absolute <i>sweetheart</i>, Miss Accent.  You should see her with Ezra's little baby!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Meia's the sweetest girl you'll ever meet, Miss Ladybug...but she only shows it when she's making our crewmate's baby laugh.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=seductive,Meia just doesn't like crowds or strangers, that's all.  She thinks she's got to be all dignified.  But see how she acts with a baby!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:0=interested,You're, uh, a little on display there, honey.  Unless that sort of thing excites you.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:0=laughing,Oh, please.  You're flashing us on purpose, aren't you?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:0=teasing,Don't act like that flash was an accident, dearie.  I know your type...nerdy little Parfet is a freak, too.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:0=smug,Showing off the underwear early?  Should've pegged you as the falsely-modest type.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=bored,<i>Management</i>?  What is <i>up</i> with this girl?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=confused,...I'm totally lost.  There's <i>rules</i> about what you can strip?  They didn't tell me any rules.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=confused,...Honey, did the bouncer clock you upside the head before you came in?  I'm not teasing, I'm dead serious.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=frustrated,I...<i>what</i>?  <i>Management</i>?  Yeah, you could <i>use</i> a little management, that's for sure.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=laughing,...Well, that's one down.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=interested,...I really thought Earth girls handled men better than anyone.  I wanted to see her naked, too.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=smug,...That girl really needed some time on Mejare to toughen her up.  Men are giant pushovers.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=bored,Should've known we wouldn't all make it through this without bailing.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=smug,Well, I mean, if <i>anyone</i> was going to chicken out, it was going to be her.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=excited,...So, uh, Ochako.  You're floating.  ...Are you going to explain that?  Because it's <i>incredible</i>!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=excited,Wait--are you--omigosh, Ochako, you can <i>float</i>?  That's so <i>cool</i>!  How are you doing that?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=excited,Omigosh!  <i>Omigosh</i>!  Ochako!  You can just <i>float</i> like that?  I'd have been doing it all game if I could <i>float</i>!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=excited,...OK.  Ochako.  You're...<i>levitating</i>.  And that is so <i>cool</i>!  What's your secret?  Can <i>I</i> learn to float?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=smug,You going to throw up, sweetie?  Looks like it...well, don't face <i>me</i> when it happens.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=laughing,Can we get a janitor over here?  This girl's about to pee herself.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=annoyed,Jeez, this girl's gonna spend the evening sobbing.  Can't we just tell her to leave?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=bored,You're no fun.  You're such a head case that I can't even tease you.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=laughing,<i>Heeheehee</i>!  Oh, so you <i>are</i> the embarrassed type!  I was just calling you sexy, honey.  Relax.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, when a woman compliments your figure, you say "Thanks, you too."  Talk about <i>rude</i>.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=smug,I call you sexy enough to rock a bodysuit, and you get all flustered and offended.  Earth woman are so scared of each other.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=seductive,What?  That was <i>complimentary</i>, silly!  That suit is doing all <i>sorts</i> of favors for your hips.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=seductive,There you go!  Take off that hemet and show the world the cute face to match your sexy figure.  I wasn't teasing you before.
2-female_removed_accessory=confused,Pretty stylish.  What are the clothing stores like on Earth?
2-female_removed_accessory=thinking,I've been a pirate for so long now.  I kind of miss shopping, even if it <i>did</i> all go to the state.
2-female_removed_accessory=annoyed,...Yeah, listen.  I'm a pirate.  I don't need <i>this</i> to get excitement in my life.
2-female_removed_accessory=thinking,...You know, I call Meia boring, but she only wears one accessory.
2-female_removed_accessory=sad,Not impressed with my strips so far, huh?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2c=seductive,Oh, I see!  These must be Earth women's street clothes, right?  You're so considerate!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2c=smug,Starting off simple, huh?  Just basic Earth street clothes on display?  I get it.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2c=smug,Jacket and jeans?  Seen it--but I guess street clothes on Earth don't <i>have</i> to be all that different.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2c=teasing,Earth's street clothes sticking to the familiars, eh?  Mejarians tend to aim a little <i>tighter</i>.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2=laughing,Knowing what I do about Earth, you <i>do</i> have plenty of reasons to drink.  So get to it, Miss Military.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2=stretching,Isn't Earth devastated where you come from?  Same here, honey...bottoms up, drink it all away.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2=interested,The world's a terrifying place...especially where you come from, I hear.  So don't feel bad about your little booze habit.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2=interested,What's all the beer for, honey?  Depressed about losing your boots, or about this "Second Impact" I keep hearing of?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=annoyed,Am I getting through to you?  Jura to Ocean Girl!  <i>Hello</i>?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=angry,Hey, Ocean Girl!  <i>I'm talking to you</i>!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=annoyed,What's your name, floozy?  <i>Moon</i>?  Yeah, you're a lunatic, alright!  Say something to me!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=annoyed,Hel-<i>looo</i>?  Am I breaking up?  Have we achieved first contact?  <i>God</i>...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:6=angry,What do you mean, <i>not fun</i>?  The fun is starting off with some teasing and then revealing your beautiful body!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:6=vain,<i>Hmph</i>.  It would seem <i>I'm</i> the only proper seductress around here, properly building up to nudity like a lady.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:6=bored,There's a right way and a wrong way to strip, and you're starting to fall into the wrong way.  It needs to escalate!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:6=smug,<i>Well</i>.  I'd never make it as a model if I deflated the excitement like you do.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3b=seductive,You're getting sexier all the time, cutie!  I like leaving my shoulders bare, too...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3b=vain,<i>Now</i> you're speaking my language!  A woman's shoulders should be as free as space is vast.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3b=vain,As long as the universe is expanding, a woman's shoulders should be unmasked to see it happen.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3b=seductive,<i>Exactly</i> what I would go for, with those uncovered shoulders.  I feel like you already know me so well, Vriska!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4c=laughing,Hah!  Going for <i>my</i> look, are you?  Yeah, cleavage tends to get people to do what you want.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4c=laughing,Feeling a little breezy, honey?  Don't worry, you'll get used to it--I did.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4c=laughing,Pfft!  How do you like <i>my</i> style, then?  I'm flattered you had this on the backburner, sweetie.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4c=vain,Doesn't the breeze feel good between your breasts?  It always perks me up when I'm down.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:leela,targetStage:1=teasing,Ooh, what's <i>that</i> thing?  A men's gun fused with a woman's?  Not as unlikely as you might think.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:leela,targetStage:1=vain,Is that a men's gun that shoots lasers?  Listen, honey...combining male and female weapons is par for the course on the Nirvana.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1=vain,<i>Ohoho</i>.  So your sword is <i>divine</i>, is it?  I guess that blows my silly little fashion item out of the water.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1=vain,If that thing's really so divine, maybe you should keep it on.  <i>Who knows what could happen here</i>?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1=teasing,Seems a little silly bringing a <i>divine</i> sword to this seedy little dump.  Does it know its owner is dirtying herself?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1=seductive,<i>Divine</i>, hm?  I like your style, honey...sword, green hair, and the favor of the gods.  If it's true.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3c=seductive,Oh, I see!  These must be Earth women's street clothes, right?  You're so considerate!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3c=smug,Going for something simple, huh?  Just basic Earth street clothes on display?  I get it.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3c=smug,Jacket and jeans?  Seen it--but I guess street clothes on Earth don't <i>have</i> to be all that different.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3c=teasing,Earth's street clothes sticking to the familiars, eh?  Mejarians tend to aim a little <i>tighter</i>.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=smug,Getting all liquored up, then?  Can't say you have the height for it.  Is this how you pick up men?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=interested,So is this how Earth girls spend a weekend?  Getting sloppy-drunk and falling on top of strange men?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=seductive,Oh, Sei, you're so cute!  Don't tell me you're just going to get sloshed and let some beastly man ravish you this evening.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=vain,Is this really what you Earth women do?  Get drunk and fondle strange men?  <i>Mejarians</i> are hopeless romantics.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,Oh, please.  All this titilating nudity is enough excitement for one evening.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,As if I need to drink to have fun when there's full-blown Earth nudity in our midst!  <i>I resent your implication</i>.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,Hey, Misato can drink alone.  <i>I</i> only drink when I know my darling Barnette is there to take care of me.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:meia=thinking,Hey now, I'm tall!  I can handle at least...uh...a few beers, give or take.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=confused,Me-<i>ow</i>!  Heeheehee--wait, you're serious?  Like, the animal, a cat?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=confused,...Earth girls can have <i>cat</i> ears?  Like, the cats I see in zoos?  How?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=confused,...You, uh, going to explain this to me?  I'm still shaky on what a <i>cat</i> is, much less a "Faunus."
2-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=frustrated,...Listen, I'm not from Earth.  You can't expect me to understand why you have cat ears...or why you've been hiding them.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a=laughing,Oho!  I <i>knew</i> you weren't so above it all!  And what a shift--bodysuits are pretty sexy.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a=laughing,Heeheehee!  I think the die was getting annoyed at you hiding your figure!  Go on, show off your hips!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a=interested,Going to do a little dance, Vriska?  Show off that figure a little?  Because that adorable polka-dotted suit is giving you a head start.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a=seductive,That's positively <i>adorable</i>, Vriska!  Polka-dots <i>and</i> a revealing shape.  Now it's <i>Mejarian</i> fashion!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=interested,Oh, you're back.  Try not to make a habit of that, dearie...it's not very intimidating.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=confused,...Well, at least you came back.  Serously, did a man kill your family or something?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=teasing,Listen, honey, you ought to come my my home planet sometime.  It's nothing but women...and we make a habit of shooting nasty men.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=vain,You have <i>nothing</i> to be scared of, honey.  I've fought the toughest, burliest men around and come out on top!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=shocked,I...I really didn't think that was going to come off.  Not so soon, anyway.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=shocked,I-I'm sorry.  Shouldn't have teased you...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=awkward,Meia...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2b=seductive,Ohhh, that's cute!  Now you're all dressed up like a maid--which Mejare frowns upon, but not as much as it does pirates.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2b=vain,Maid outfits are so adorable!  I'd dress up my girlfriend in one...if I could afford one.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2b=excited,Ohh, I wish I had something as cute as that!  Barnette and I could do a little roleplay, you know, pretend we have money.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2b=teasing,Life's tough for a Mejarian pirate...but the alternative is to be a maid for some rich old hag.  No thanks!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=vain,Talk about a terrestial booze-a-thon.  Oh, well, I've got the height to drink with the best of them!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=smug,I get that this place is a bar, but damn, ladies, at least <i>pretend</i> you're trying to win.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=interested,So I get this place has a no-touching rule, but you two aren't really disguising how you're planning to take some of us home afterward.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=laughing,I <i>do</i> love drinking, but I don't think I could keep up with you two.  I guess living around men forces you to drown your sorrows.
2-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=smug,Still shaky on the game's rules, Miss Pixie?  You don't <i>have</i> to jump straight to be big-name items.
2-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=interested,Jeez, Kyu, settle down.  What kind of awful tease would jump straight to nudity?  You've got to keep them guessing.
2-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=laughing,Hey, I know <i>you're</i> not shy about it, but do try to understand why these poor Earth people might be ashamed.
2-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=vain,I don't get it either, Kyu, but don't get all mad.  Earth people just tend to hate their own bodies.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=teasing,I've got my eye on you, Miss Pixie...because my ears are totally confused when you talk.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=vain,Little Miss Pixie must think she's clever, saying all these things that go over my poor foreigner head.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=seductive,Have some sympathy for this poor alien woman, Kyu.  You're always saying things only an Earth woman would understand.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=vain,Feel free to start making sense for <i>everyone</i>, Miss Pixie.  Think of the poor aliens in your presence when you speak.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=seductive,You're quite the fit little specimen, Rinkah.  I know a certain squadron leader who'd fall head-over-heels for you...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=teasing,I know a woman who loves muscles very much, Rinkah...you'd put her in a tizzy.  Do Earth women like each other in that way?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=seductive,Mind if I play a little matchmaker?  I brought my boss here...and she <i>loves</i> muscles on a woman, even if she won't admit it.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=seductive,You into women, sweetheart?  Because I know a certain blue-haired ice queen who would <i>totally</i> fall for those abs of yours.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3a=seductive,Ooh, a sexy red-and-black!  I like your style, Vriska--and it clashes with your skin!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3a=teasing,Nothing like blood-red and shadow-black to get the heart beating.  Plus, those bullets get it going even faster!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3a=vain,Talk about making my heart jump.  Red, black, and bullets on the side!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3a=vain,I wish <i>I</i> owned something red...and this dress is the closest thing to black.  <i>A pirate's problems</i>!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4b=vain,Bare midriff?  My dress brings me pretty close to that...but <i>Dita's</i> the girl who wears it best!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4b=seductive,Ooh, my crewmate Dita dresses like that!  She's such a naive little thing, even with her midriff exposed all sexy-like.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4b=vain,I know a sweet young girl who dresses like that!  Dita's her name--she's so naive.  Barely even notices her exposed belly.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4b=smug,Yeah, Dita shows off her belly too.  I can't tell if she's just too naive to know how sexy she's being or just doesn't care.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=excited,<i>No!  Please!  I</i>--I--what?  Omigosh, that's <i>fantastic</i>!  Sorry I teased you!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=excited,...Oh my God!  You just changed your <i>whole</i> outfit?  That's spectacular!  Sorry about those skin comments.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=excited,Omigosh!  How--<i>how'd you do that</i>?  Do it again!  I want to see more outfits!  Who cares if your skin's blue?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=excited,Wha--what'd you just do?  <i>How</i>?  Tell me everything!  I'm sorry I made fun of your skin color!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=vain,Finally shedding all your little things.  That's good...women are much cuter unencumbered.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=seductive,I can't get over how cute you are...especially without all that extra padding!  Just a tiny little thing with gorgeous blue hair on top.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=smug,I wonder if you could pull off a dress like mine, Sei.  You're so preoccupied with all that silly armor and padding...why wear it?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=vain,What is it you do again that requires all this nonsense on your person?  You should wear something <i>sexy</i>!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2a=awkward,Uh...ew.  That's kind of ratty, actually.  But you've got more, right?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2a=confused,...Now you kind of smell salty.  Don't you have something else?  Something <i>nicer</i>?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2a=confused,...I have no clue what that is.  Kind of looks like <i>men's</i> clothing...all tattered and gross.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2a=confused,...That's certainly a lot of extra stuff.  But somehow it just ends up looking like rags, whatever it is.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:4=bored,For how excited you are to strip...I'm not sure I want to see what lies underneath.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:4=angry,As if we want to see your nasty little twig body.  You keep going on about how you're just a public plaything!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:4=frustrated,Oh, good, you're almost out.  Maybe then you can lose and leave and stop freaking me out.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:4=annoyed,Whatever ocean <i>you're</i> swimming in, I bet the fish are all dead.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,Don't ask questions you don't want the answer to, Meia.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=stretching,This is why I mostly stick to asking about men and fashion.  See what happens?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=interested,See, Meia?  Don't encourage people to discuss things you don't care about.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Oh, <i>this</i> ought to be a treat.  <i>Have fun, Leader</i>!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Oh, dear.  Now you've done it, Rinkah...Meia <i>loves</i> women with muscles.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=interested,Just try to ride this out, honey.  Meia acts icy, but those muscles melt her right down like nobody's business.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Don't believe her cover stories, Rinkah.  Meia doesn't want your muscles...she wants <i>you</i>.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,Heehee!  Meia tends to get like this around particularly <i>fit</i> women, if you follow.  Don't mind her desperate advances.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:1=interested,OK, sure.  Just drop all pretenses. why don't you?  You're moving too fast with this.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:1=smug,You're a bigger tease than I am.  Hey, make them <i>work</i> for it.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:1=teasing,Hey, that little peek was enough.  You're going to ruin the surprise!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:1=vain,Come now, Velma, drag it out a bit!  You just got started...leave a little to the imagination.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=frustrated,Not to be rude, but, uh...<i>you've totally got a screw loose</i>.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=confused,...Is this what I sound like?  I just think flirting is fun...this girl's <i>nuts</i>.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=bored,...Maybe I should stop flirting so much.  If <i>this</i> girl is the end result, that is.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=bored,...Does sex with men do this to you?  Because this girl's <i>really</i> starting to freak me out.
2-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:meia=confused,Pretty stylish.  What are the clothing stores like on Earth?
2-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:meia=thinking,I've been a pirate for so long now.  I kind of miss shopping, even if it <i>did</i> all go to the state.
2-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:meia=annoyed,...Yeah, listen.  I'm a pirate.  I don't need <i>this</i> to get excitement in my life.
2-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:meia=bored,...You know, I call you boring, Meia, but now I know better.
2-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:meia=sad,Not impressed with my strips so far, huh?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=angry,Seriously, what just happened?  You can't just shapeshift like that and act like nothing happened!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=confused,Are you even a woman?  Or an Earthling?  Are you some kind of alien shapeshifter?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=sad,<i>I'm so confused</i>.  Are you a shapeshifting alien?  Is this what Earth women are capable of?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=awkward,I had no idea Earth genetics were so...<i>advanced</i>.  Just changing your hair color on a whim.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,marker:fama_and_oma=confused,...Uh...what's a grandfather?  Like a grand-Fama?  It's mostly the "father" part I'm confused over.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1=awkward,That's, uh, a lot of family history.  You lost me at "father," whatever <i>that</i> means.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,marker:fama_and_oma=confused,...OK, I know what "grand" means, but what's a "father"?  Is that some weird Earth term for Omas?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1=frustrated,Wait, wait, stop, forget the makeup.  Now I'm confused as to what a "father" is, though apparently they're grand.


#lost sleeves
3-male_removing_accessory=bored,Exactly what I deserve, I guess...
3-male_removing_accessory=smug,Are you still going on with your little trinkets?
3-male_removing_accessory=frustrated,Come <i>on</i>, I'm actually <i>excited</i> to see your body, ~name~.
3-male_removing_accessory=laughing,Still removing trinkets?  Hey Dealer, how about you and I hold this man down and strip him some <i>more</i>?
3-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=interested,Oh, I see.  It's thin enough to see through, and you just like messing with people?
3-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=vain,Ah, I see--it's thin fabric.  Men and their deceitful ways, thinking they could pull one over on me!
3-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=interested,Could've fooled me, with that hand you were rocking.  Still, I guess the fabric's thin enough to see, and you just like playing pretend.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=teasing,So you're just a fan of the dungeon look, and the blindfold's thin enough to see through?  Nice try fooling Jura Basil Elden.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=seductive,<i>There</i> you go.  Fully sighted like the rest of us!  I don't buy that nonsense about it being a visor...can I see it?
3-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=teasing,If that thing's really a visor, toss it over here.  If you get to cheat, why can't I see how?
3-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=teasing,You're not afraid to let a simple human woman see what advantages you had, right?  Give it here.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=interested,I'm calling your bluff on that thing being a visor.  I think you're some weird fetish-man who's been peeking at the cards underneath it.  Can I see?
3-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=confused,...Are you sure, Meia?  I mean, B.C. fooled <i>you</i>, too.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,...Wait, really?  Well, wouldn't be the first time, although poor Corrin here seems to have fooled us by <i>accident</i>.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=awkward,...Uh...good eye, Meia.  Well, this is awkward.  Sorry, Miss--Mister.  You're still pretty cute...for a man.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=confused,...Meia, don't mess with me.  Are you <i>sure</i>?  I mean, look at her--him.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:1=laughing,Something the matter, Mr. Muscle?  You look so <i>dreadfully</i> uncomfortable.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:1=vain,Am I being distracting, Mr. Muscle?  Well, you're guilty of it yourself, with that hunky body of yours.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:1=seductive,Am I drawing your eyes, honey?  Well you started it--how can I <i>not</i> stare at all those muscles of yours?
3-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:1=teasing,See something you like, dearie?  You seem so <i>uncomfortable</i> around women for an Earth man--I guess you've never seen one like me!
3-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=confused,...Wait, you're a <i>man</i>?  Aren't men...<i>tall</i>?  And, you know, <i>masculine</i>?
3-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=confused,...Oh, you're a man.  Well, that's disappointing.  What's the word for this?  <i>Han-droggo-niss</i> or something?
3-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=confused,...Huh.  You're a man.  I guess I can work with this, but <i>wow</i>.  You really had me fooled...
3-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=bored,...Oh.  Well, this wouldn't be the <i>first</i> time a man fooled me into thinking he's a woman, but <i>that</i> was on purpose...
3-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=annoyed,<i>Oho</i>.  So when <i>I</i> take off my sword, it's a lame first impression.  But not lame enough to not <i>copy</i>.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=vain,<i>Oh.  Mm-hm</i>.  Taking off your weapon--<i>I wonder where he got that idea</i>?
3-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=laughing,I didn't realize men were such fabulous hypocrites, Trigger Finger.  But at least you're not too scared to be disarmed around me.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=vain,<i>Removing a sword, eh</i>?  And here I thought men were the <i>honorable</i> sex.  But no, you're content to emulate what you criticize.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=awkward,...Wait, one of you is a <i>man</i>?  But--you--I...<i>wow</i>.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=confused,...Wait, I'm confused.  Men and women don't look <i>that</i> close.  Are you sure you're a man?
3-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=awkward,...Oh.  I really thought I was getting good at telling men and women apart...
3-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=confused,...Wait, you're a <i>man</i>?  I mean, Duero wears his hair long, and Meia's is short, so I don't assume anything there...
3-male_removed_accessory=bored,I knew <i>Tarakkians</i> were no fun, but you'd think an <i>Earth</i> man would be.  Sheesh.
3-male_removed_accessory=bored,I should've played this with Duero instead.  He's handsomer and doesn't wear much.
3-male_removed_accessory=awkward,So, uh, is this because of the game, or do men <i>actually</i> wear that on Earth?
3-male_removed_accessory=bored,Guess living around women doesn't loosen Earth men up at all.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=teasing,Well then, don't think I won't tease you!  It'll just be in a different sort of way...
3-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=laughing,A man who looks like a woman might be <i>exactly</i> the kind of seed I need...wouldn't want my children all hairy and gross.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=seductive,OK.  Well, nothing I can't work with!  Now you're cute in a completely different sort of way, <i>Mister</i> Corrin.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=vain,Don't feel too bad about it, then.  Women's bodies are so much smoother and luscious anyway...you should strive to emulate us.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=shocked,So why do you two look the same?  ...You're the same <i>person</i>?  But--how's that possible?
3-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=excited,W-wait, you're the <i>male</i> version of her?  Where's the male version of <i>me</i>?  I bet he's <i>handsome</i>!
3-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=vain,Oh, wow, you're the same person, but the opposite sex?  Where's the male <i>me</i>?  Tall, gorgeous--and <i>blond</i>!
3-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=thinking,T-this is really incredible.  Are there male versions of <i>every</i> woman I know?  I wonder if male Barnette is handsome...
3-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=laughing,Hey, what <i>that</i> supposed to mean, Gearbox?  What Barnette and I do in private is none of your business.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=vain,Oh, please.  I'm the <i>giver</i> in my relationship...<i>Barnette</i> would get to wear the blindfold.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=teasing,<i>Oho</i>!  And Little Dungeon Bot shows some spunk.  You're getting more human all the time...<i>maybe we could use that blindfold</i>.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=teasing,Ha!  About time you manned up and talked back to me.  But to be honest, <i>Barnette's</i> usually wearing the blindfold.
3-female_removing_accessory=bored,Earth women are so boring.
3-female_removing_accessory=teasing,Hey, at least <i>I'm</i> making a show of it.
3-female_removing_accessory=laughing,Still miffed about those armbands?
3-female_removing_accessory=interested,Oh, come on, don't be so vindictive about all <i>my</i> accessories.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=excited,...So, uh, Ochako.  You're floating.  ...Are you going to explain that?  Because it's <i>incredible</i>!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=excited,Wait--are you--omigosh, Ochako, you can <i>float</i>?  That's so <i>cool</i>!  How are you doing that?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=excited,Omigosh!  <i>Omigosh</i>!  Ochako!  You can just <i>float</i> like that?  I'd have been doing it all game if I could <i>float</i>!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=excited,...OK.  Ochako.  You're...<i>levitating</i>.  And that is so <i>cool</i>!  What's your secret?  Can <i>I</i> learn to float?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=laughing,...Well, that's one down.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=interested,...I really thought Earth girls handled men better than anyone.  I wanted to see her naked, too.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=smug,...That girl really needed some time on Mejare to toughen her up.  Men are giant pushovers.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=bored,Should've known we wouldn't all make it through this without bailing.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=smug,Well, I mean, if <i>anyone</i> was going to chicken out, it was going to be her.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:1=smug,<i>Dear, dear</i>.  Removing your fancy jewelry so readily?  Don't you care about that precious ttle of yours?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:1=teasing,Blonde women are always favorites of mine...even better, you're removing that ridiculous crown early.  Come have some fun with us commoners.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:1=interested,No sense keeping it on long, right?  You're already lowering yourself by playing this, anyway.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:1=teasing,Make the gown next to go, Miss Princess.  I think you'll find how fun we dirty common folk can be.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:3=interested,Sure you don't want to cling to that, dearie?  It <i>is</i> what marks as you as better than the rest of us.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:3=vain,I guess I can understand losing that, even as a princess.  It'll let your blonde hair flow free and unencumbered!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:3=seductive,Miss Princess dropping her overinflated jewelry?  Oh, I forgot--you're blonde, so you're not so bad.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:3=teasing,That's it, honey.  Lower yourself to the level of us dirty commoners.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=laughing,...Wow, I was just kidding.  You really <i>are</i> a sex fairy, just presenting like that.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=interested,Honey, you can't just <i>present</i> like that right from the get-go.  The audience can't get what they want until the grand finale.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=smug,Seems Earth girls overdo it as usual.  What kind of tease would I be if just spread my legs right here and now?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=teasing,Easy there, hot stuff.  You're already wearing so little--no need to spoil what surprises you <i>have</i>.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,<i>Heeheehee</i>!  Oh, you're hopelessly in love now!  This is so <i>cute</i>!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,I <i>knew</i> we'd meet a girl here who was your type--and with all these hormones flowing, you'd <i>have</i> to break your stoicism eventually.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Do you hear that, Chunners?  It's the sound of ice melting nearby.  You've lit a fire in her heart.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,Go on, Meia, ask her out.  You both know how an exercise session is going to end.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=excited,Yes!  <i>Yes</i>!  Go for it!  Roll that die!  Can I have one?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=excited,You are so <i>cool</i>, Vriska!  Where can I get one of those things?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=excited,So it's that die that does it for you?  Can I have one?  I want to switch my outfit on the fly!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=teasing,Where'd you get that die?  I don't want to have to steal <i>yours</i>, you know!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=laughing,<i>Heeheehee</i>!  Oh, so you <i>are</i> the embarrassed type!  I was just calling you sexy, honey.  Relax.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, when a woman compliments your figure, you say "Thanks, you too."  Talk about <i>rude</i>.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=smug,I call you sexy enough to rock a bodysuit, and you get all flustered and offended.  Earth woman are so scared of each other.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=seductive,What?  That was <i>complimentary</i>, silly!  That suit is doing all <i>sorts</i> of favors for your hips.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=seductive,There you go!  Take off that hemet and show the world the cute face to match your sexy figure.  I wasn't teasing you before.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=teasing,<i>Atta girl</i>!  Now show me something magical!  ...Besides this.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=vain,These vortices are pretty fantastic, but it's the end result I care about.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=seductive,You really are something else.  I've already grown accustomed to your magic vortices!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=seductive,All that magic, but all I care about is the outfit waiting for me.  I never thought I'd meet someone like you!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:0=seductive,<i>Heeheehee!  Such a tease, Miss Valentine</i>!  You can deny it all you want, but I see myself written all over you.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:0=vain,It's OK to want to distance yourself from me, dear.  I am, after all, taller and more beautiful.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:0=smug,Why deny the similarities, darling?  Women across Mejare <i>wish</i> they could be mentioned alongside Jura Basil Elden.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:0=teasing,What, too proud to admit we're alike?  <i>Afraid I do your image better than you</i>?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=shocked,O-oh, are you putting the guns down?  I-I promise I won't touch them.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=awkward,<i>(Oh, thank God...)</i>  Er, Revy, good choice there.  Good choice.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=awkward,Hey, uh, now that you're disarmed, try to relax a little, would you?  Instead of yelling at us.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=sad,I was <i>hoping</i> tonight wouldn't end with someone getting shot.  Don't we all just want to see each other naked?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=confused,...Seriously, do you have <i>any</i> control over this?  Even a little?  Or is it all luck?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=confused,...Talk about living life up to chance, by the way.  This is so weird...and I'm a pilot.  I've <i>seen</i> weird.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=stretching,There she goes with another vortex.  Life is just a game of luck to our little fashionista here.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=vain,Too bad this isn't the spectacle it used to be.  But the random chance <i>does</i> keep it interesting!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=bored,It's refreshing to know you won't acknowledge anything I say.  Real liberating.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=awkward,...Look, I know I tease a lot, but I'm just having fun.  Nothing about <i>this</i> is fun.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=frustrated,Talk about a lost cause.  She won't even acknowledge me.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=teasing,<i>Hey, Ocean Girl.  If you're being held against your will, blink twice.  I'm a pirate, I understand</i>.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=bored,<i>Management</i>?  What is <i>up</i> with this girl?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=confused,...I'm totally lost.  There's <i>rules</i> about what you can strip?  They didn't tell me any rules.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=confused,...Honey, did the bouncer clock you upside the head before you came in?  I'm not teasing, I'm dead serious.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=frustrated,I...<i>what</i>?  <i>Management</i>?  Yeah, you could <i>use</i> a little management, that's for sure.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1=shocked,And a <i>Bless You</i> to--to...<i>where'd Launch go</i>?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1=confused,...That's, uh, a pretty hard sneeze.  Didn't realize it could turn your hair blue.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1=awkward,...Uh...is this an Earth thing, or would <i>my</i> hair turn blue if I sneezed too hard?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1=shocked,...<i>Launch?  Where'd the blonde girl go</i>?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=seductive,<i>Oooh</i>!  That sounded so <i>cute</i>, honey, whatever it was!  What does that mean?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=seductive,<i>Teeheehee</i>!  I don't know what you said, but your home language sounds so silky smooth and romantic!  What's it mean?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, what's <i>that</i> mean, dear?  Because it sounded like the most romantic thing I've ever heard!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=excited,Omigosh, that's so <i>romantic</i>-sounding!  What does it mean?  I want to talk like that!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:7=sad,<i>So long, Ang</i>--oh.  Well, I guess that counts.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:7=sad,<i>Awww</i>!  And here I thought I had beaten you.  But no, you proved too wily for me.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:7=vain,Damn Earth girls and their tricks.  <i>Who would do that, bring a bunch of accessories to a strip poker game</i>?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:7=smug,My pilot's eyes should've spotted that, but you snuck right past me--and yourself, even.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:1=interested,And what do we have here?  Miserable old Miss Brunette is admitting she's no better than the rest of us?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:1=laughing,Hey, Miss Princess.  You don't mind if this pirate holds onto that tiara, do you?  Just for a little <i>inspection</i>?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:1=teasing,Don't stop there, Miss Princess.  Nothing satisfies a pirate quite like watching nobles stripped down to nothing at all.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:1=laughing,Take away her tiara and she's a brunette in a dress.  Take away her dress...and I hope her butt is cute.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:0=interested,You're, uh, a little on display there, honey.  Unless that sort of thing excites you.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:0=laughing,Oh, please.  You're flashing us on purpose, aren't you?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:0=teasing,Don't act like that flash was an accident, dearie.  I know your type...nerdy little Parfet is a freak, too.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:0=smug,Showing off the underwear early?  Should've pegged you as the falsely-modest type.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0=teasing,You got that idea from <i>me</i>, you little cheat!  Once again the crafty Mejarian paves the way for the rest of womankind.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0=smug,<i>My, my, Lyn</i>.  <i>Bending the rules by removing a weapon?</i>  The <i>audacity</i>.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0=teasing,You're just copying what I came up with before...but you've got Barnette's cute green hair, so I'll let it slide.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0=laughing,I'd teach you a thing or two with my rapier for copying me like this, but, well, I threw it away.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=stretching,Just a <i>little</i> nervous?  Damn...I guess I'm too gorgeous to be scary.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=laughing,Nervous?  I was really trying to scare you--I guess you're already falling in love with me.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=vain,I was hoping for a better reaction than that.  Maybe you're tougher than you look--or I'm just that lovable!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=teasing,Just trying to break you in, dear.  You look positively miserable--I wanted to scare you into having fun!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=confused,...Did I miss something?  Can't we take off whatever we want?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=confused,...Is there really a nebulous <i>management</i> that's got guns to our heads if we don't strip how they want?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=confused,...Who exactly is holding a gun to your head and making you do this?  Hey, are you listening?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=confused,...Why do you have to take off your shoes next?  I mean, you <i>should</i>, but apparently you <i>have</i> to?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=shocked,So what's fir--uh, <i>really</i>?  Uh...uh...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=shocked,So now that you're finally playing along, what'll it--be...uh...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=shocked,Y-your eyepiece?  I mean, <i>first</i>?  <i>At all</i>?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=teasing,Hey, Miss Military--where'd you get all that beer?  Throw some this way, let's have fun!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=vain,Just chugging it down, huh, Miss Military?  <i>Mejarians</i> are so much more tasteful...but give me some, if you don't mind.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=smug,I hope you brought enough booze for <i>everyone</i>, Misato.  It's not nice to hoard.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=stretching,I thought I smelled beer...more of a rum woman myself, but when on Earth, drink as the classless Earth girls drink.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:5=angry,Wha--<i>oh, goddamnit!  Just take things off in a proper order</i>!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:5=angry,Hey, I came here to see some Earth nudity!  I don't appreciate being toyed around with!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:5=annoyed,Yeah, yeah, hotshot.  Real clever.  You definitely played this game and <i>didn't</i> want people to see you naked.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:5=bored,This must be how people feel around <i>me</i>.  Clinging to accessories...at least <i>I</i> have a body worth teasing.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:5=annoyed,I <i>hate it</i> when people bounce around with the importance of what they take off.  Let the audience know what to expect!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Of course she does, honey!  She just refuses to show it, which is why I drag her to places like this.  She only ever smiles with Ezra's baby.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=stretching,Why do you think I brought her here, Miss Polka-dot?  You need <i>steam</i> to melt all that ice of hers...or a baby.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=seductive,Oh, my Leader is an absolute <i>sweetheart</i>, Miss Accent.  You should see her with Ezra's little baby!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Meia's the sweetest girl you'll ever meet, Miss Ladybug...but she only shows it when she's making our crewmate's baby laugh.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=seductive,Meia just doesn't like crowds or strangers, that's all.  She thinks she's got to be all dignified.  But see how she acts with a baby!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:3=smug,And at last the trumped-up girlie removes the only thing maintaining her arrogance.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:3=teasing,Hey, Princess...you can't strip what makes <i>me</i> beautiful.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:3=smug,<i>Royals</i>...talk about jewelry for jewelry's sake.  It's supposed to <i>improve</i> your looks, not create them.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:3=teasing,Thaaaank <i>you</i>!  Now the property of Magno Vivan's pirates, little Miss Princess!  So sorry.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=teasing,<i>Oh, am I being too forward</i>?  My apologies.  Just know you'd have your pick of the bunch over there.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=seductive,Oh, sorry, I got carried away there.  But you're still a beautiful, musclebound woman!  That's a plus anywhere.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=seductive,Maybe that was a little forward of me.  But Mejarians would love you!  I wonder if men feel the same.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=teasing,Well, just know how in-demand you are on Mejare...if these bumbling Earth men start giving you the cold shoulder.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=smug,You going to throw up, sweetie?  Looks like it...well, don't face <i>me</i> when it happens.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=laughing,Can we get a janitor over here?  This girl's about to pee herself.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=annoyed,Jeez, this girl's gonna spend the evening sobbing.  Can't we just tell her to leave?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=bored,You're no fun.  You're such a head case that I can't even tease you.
3-female_removed_accessory=seductive,This is what makes Barnette so wonderful.  She barely wears anything!
3-female_removed_accessory=vain,You're like those horrid Mejarian soldiers with all your accessories.  Or me.
3-female_removed_accessory=vain,<i>Why wear what has no meaning to you</i>?  That's Meia's M.O.  Bless that girl, so laser-focused.
3-female_removed_accessory=interested,I see you have an eye for fashion.  Just not sure its sight is 20/20.
3-female_removed_accessory=vain,Now that I think about it, Dita has a little necklace to remove...and so do I.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2b=seductive,Ohhh, that's cute!  Now you're all dressed up like a maid--which Mejare frowns upon, but not as much as it does pirates.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2b=vain,Maid outfits are so adorable!  I'd dress up my girlfriend in one...if I could afford one.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2b=excited,Ohh, I wish I had something as cute as that!  Barnette and I could do a little roleplay, you know, pretend we have money.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2b=teasing,Life's tough for a Mejarian pirate...but the alternative is to be a maid for some rich old hag.  No thanks!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2=laughing,Knowing what I do about Earth, you <i>do</i> have plenty of reasons to drink.  So get to it, Miss Military.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2=stretching,Isn't Earth devastated where you come from?  Same here, honey...bottoms up, drink it all away.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2=interested,The world's a terrifying place...especially where you come from, I hear.  So don't feel bad about your little booze habit.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2=interested,What's all the beer for, honey?  Depressed about losing your boots, or about this "Second Impact" I keep hearing of?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:1=interested,OK, sure.  Just drop all pretenses. why don't you?  You're moving too fast with this.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:1=smug,You're a bigger tease than I am.  Hey, make them <i>work</i> for it.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:1=teasing,Hey, that little peek was enough.  You're going to ruin the surprise!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:1=vain,Come now, Velma, drag it out a bit!  You just got started...leave a little to the imagination.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=seductive,You're quite the fit little specimen, Rinkah.  I know a certain squadron leader who'd fall head-over-heels for you...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=teasing,I know a woman who loves muscles very much, Rinkah...you'd put her in a tizzy.  Do Earth women like each other in that way?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=seductive,Mind if I play a little matchmaker?  I brought my boss here...and she <i>loves</i> muscles on a woman, even if she won't admit it.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=seductive,You into women, sweetheart?  Because I know a certain blue-haired ice queen who would <i>totally</i> fall for those abs of yours.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:4=bored,For how excited you are to strip...I'm not sure I want to see what lies underneath.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:4=angry,As if we want to see your nasty little twig body.  You keep going on about how you're just a public plaything!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:4=frustrated,Oh, good, you're almost out.  Maybe then you can lose and leave and stop freaking me out.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:4=annoyed,Whatever ocean <i>you're</i> swimming in, I bet the fish are all dead.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,marker:fama_and_oma=confused,...Uh...what's a grandfather?  Like a grand-Fama?  It's mostly the "father" part I'm confused over.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1=awkward,That's, uh, a lot of family history.  You lost me at "father," whatever <i>that</i> means.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,marker:fama_and_oma=confused,...OK, I know what "grand" means, but what's a "father"?  Is that some weird Earth term for Omas?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1=frustrated,Wait, wait, stop, forget the makeup.  Now I'm confused as to what a "father" is, though apparently they're grand.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=vain,Finally shedding all your little things.  That's good...women are much cuter unencumbered.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=seductive,I can't get over how cute you are...especially without all that extra padding!  Just a tiny little thing with gorgeous blue hair on top.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=smug,I wonder if you could pull off a dress like mine, Sei.  You're so preoccupied with all that silly armor and padding...why wear it?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=vain,What is it you do again that requires all this nonsense on your person?  You should wear something <i>sexy</i>!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=frustrated,Not to be rude, but, uh...<i>you've totally got a screw loose</i>.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=confused,...Is this what I sound like?  I just think flirting is fun...this girl's <i>nuts</i>.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=bored,...Maybe I should stop flirting so much.  If <i>this</i> girl is the end result, that is.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=bored,...Does sex with men do this to you?  Because this girl's <i>really</i> starting to freak me out.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2c=seductive,Oh, I see!  These must be Earth women's street clothes, right?  You're so considerate!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2c=smug,Starting off simple, huh?  Just basic Earth street clothes on display?  I get it.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2c=smug,Jacket and jeans?  Seen it--but I guess street clothes on Earth don't <i>have</i> to be all that different.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2c=teasing,Earth's street clothes sticking to the familiars, eh?  Mejarians tend to aim a little <i>tighter</i>.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3a=seductive,Ooh, a sexy red-and-black!  I like your style, Vriska--and it clashes with your skin!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3a=teasing,Nothing like blood-red and shadow-black to get the heart beating.  Plus, those bullets get it going even faster!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3a=vain,Talk about making my heart jump.  Red, black, and bullets on the side!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3a=vain,I wish <i>I</i> owned something red...and this dress is the closest thing to black.  <i>A pirate's problems</i>!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4b=vain,Bare midriff?  My dress brings me pretty close to that...but <i>Dita's</i> the girl who wears it best!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4b=seductive,Ooh, my crewmate Dita dresses like that!  She's such a naive little thing, even with her midriff exposed all sexy-like.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4b=vain,I know a sweet young girl who dresses like that!  Dita's her name--she's so naive.  Barely even notices her exposed belly.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4b=smug,Yeah, Dita shows off her belly too.  I can't tell if she's just too naive to know how sexy she's being or just doesn't care.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=vain,Talk about a terrestial booze-a-thon.  Oh, well, I've got the height to drink with the best of them!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=smug,I get that this place is a bar, but damn, ladies, at least <i>pretend</i> you're trying to win.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=interested,So I get this place has a no-touching rule, but you two aren't really disguising how you're planning to take some of us home afterward.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=laughing,I <i>do</i> love drinking, but I don't think I could keep up with you two.  I guess living around men forces you to drown your sorrows.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:6=angry,What do you mean, <i>not fun</i>?  The fun is starting off with some teasing and then revealing your beautiful body!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:6=vain,<i>Hmph</i>.  It would seem <i>I'm</i> the only proper seductress around here, properly building up to nudity like a lady.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:6=bored,There's a right way and a wrong way to strip, and you're starting to fall into the wrong way.  It needs to escalate!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:6=smug,<i>Well</i>.  I'd never make it as a model if I deflated the excitement like you do.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=annoyed,Am I getting through to you?  Jura to Ocean Girl!  <i>Hello</i>?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=angry,Hey, Ocean Girl!  <i>I'm talking to you</i>!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=annoyed,What's your name, floozy?  <i>Moon</i>?  Yeah, you're a lunatic, alright!  Say something to me!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=annoyed,Hel-<i>looo</i>?  Am I breaking up?  Have we achieved first contact?  <i>God</i>...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3b=seductive,You're getting sexier all the time, cutie!  I like leaving my shoulders bare, too...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3b=vain,<i>Now</i> you're speaking my language!  A woman's shoulders should be as free as space is vast.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3b=vain,As long as the universe is expanding, a woman's shoulders should be unmasked to see it happen.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3b=seductive,<i>Exactly</i> what I would go for, with those uncovered shoulders.  I feel like you already know me so well, Vriska!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=smug,Getting all liquored up, then?  Can't say you have the height for it.  Is this how you pick up men?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=interested,So is this how Earth girls spend a weekend?  Getting sloppy-drunk and falling on top of strange men?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=seductive,Oh, Sei, you're so cute!  Don't tell me you're just going to get sloshed and let some beastly man ravish you this evening.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=vain,Is this really what you Earth women do?  Get drunk and fondle strange men?  <i>Mejarians</i> are hopeless romantics.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3c=seductive,Oh, I see!  These must be Earth women's street clothes, right?  You're so considerate!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3c=smug,Going for something simple, huh?  Just basic Earth street clothes on display?  I get it.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3c=smug,Jacket and jeans?  Seen it--but I guess street clothes on Earth don't <i>have</i> to be all that different.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3c=teasing,Earth's street clothes sticking to the familiars, eh?  Mejarians tend to aim a little <i>tighter</i>.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=confused,Me-<i>ow</i>!  Heeheehee--wait, you're serious?  Like, the animal, a cat?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=confused,...Earth girls can have <i>cat</i> ears?  Like, the cats I see in zoos?  How?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=confused,...You, uh, going to explain this to me?  I'm still shaky on what a <i>cat</i> is, much less a "Faunus."
3-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=frustrated,...Listen, I'm not from Earth.  You can't expect me to understand why you have cat ears...or why you've been hiding them.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a=laughing,Oho!  I <i>knew</i> you weren't so above it all!  And what a shift--bodysuits are pretty sexy.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a=laughing,Heeheehee!  I think the die was getting annoyed at you hiding your figure!  Go on, show off your hips!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a=interested,Going to do a little dance, Vriska?  Show off that figure a little?  Because that adorable polka-dotted suit is giving you a head start.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a=seductive,That's positively <i>adorable</i>, Vriska!  Polka-dots <i>and</i> a revealing shape.  Now it's <i>Mejarian</i> fashion!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,Don't ask questions you don't want the answer to, Meia.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=stretching,This is why I mostly stick to asking about men and fashion.  See what happens?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=interested,See, Meia?  Don't encourage people to discuss things you don't care about.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Oh, <i>this</i> ought to be a treat.  <i>Have fun, Leader</i>!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,Oh, please.  All this titilating nudity is enough excitement for one evening.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,As if I need to drink to have fun when there's full-blown Earth nudity in our midst!  <i>I resent your implication</i>.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,Hey, Misato can drink alone.  <i>I</i> only drink when I know my darling Barnette is there to take care of me.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:meia=thinking,Hey now, I'm tall!  I can handle at least...uh...a few beers, give or take.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=angry,Seriously, what just happened?  You can't just shapeshift like that and act like nothing happened!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=confused,Are you even a woman?  Or an Earthling?  Are you some kind of alien shapeshifter?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=sad,<i>I'm so confused</i>.  Are you a shapeshifting alien?  Is this what Earth women are capable of?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=awkward,I had no idea Earth genetics were so...<i>advanced</i>.  Just changing your hair color on a whim.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1=vain,<i>Ohoho</i>.  So your sword is <i>divine</i>, is it?  I guess that blows my silly little fashion item out of the water.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1=vain,If that thing's really so divine, maybe you should keep it on.  <i>Who knows what could happen here</i>?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1=teasing,Seems a little silly bringing a <i>divine</i> sword to this seedy little dump.  Does it know its owner is dirtying herself?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1=seductive,<i>Divine</i>, hm?  I like your style, honey...sword, green hair, and the favor of the gods.  If it's true.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=interested,Oh, you're back.  Try not to make a habit of that, dearie...it's not very intimidating.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=confused,...Well, at least you came back.  Serously, did a man kill your family or something?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=teasing,Listen, honey, you ought to come my my home planet sometime.  It's nothing but women...and we make a habit of shooting nasty men.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=vain,You have <i>nothing</i> to be scared of, honey.  I've fought the toughest, burliest men around and come out on top!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=teasing,I've got my eye on you, Miss Pixie...because my ears are totally confused when you talk.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=vain,Little Miss Pixie must think she's clever, saying all these things that go over my poor foreigner head.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=seductive,Have some sympathy for this poor alien woman, Kyu.  You're always saying things only an Earth woman would understand.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=vain,Feel free to start making sense for <i>everyone</i>, Miss Pixie.  Think of the poor aliens in your presence when you speak.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=excited,<i>No!  Please!  I</i>--I--what?  Omigosh, that's <i>fantastic</i>!  Sorry I teased you!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=excited,...Oh my God!  You just changed your <i>whole</i> outfit?  That's spectacular!  Sorry about those skin comments.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=excited,Omigosh!  How--<i>how'd you do that</i>?  Do it again!  I want to see more outfits!  Who cares if your skin's blue?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=excited,Wha--what'd you just do?  <i>How</i>?  Tell me everything!  I'm sorry I made fun of your skin color!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2a=awkward,Uh...ew.  That's kind of ratty, actually.  But you've got more, right?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2a=confused,...Now you kind of smell salty.  Don't you have something else?  Something <i>nicer</i>?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2a=confused,...I have no clue what that is.  Kind of looks like <i>men's</i> clothing...all tattered and gross.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2a=confused,...That's certainly a lot of extra stuff.  But somehow it just ends up looking like rags, whatever it is.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=awkward,A-are you OK, Meia?  You feeling alright?  Thought that thing wasn't going anywhere...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=awkward,Did the Harvest get a hold of you or something?  I thought that thing was staying on the whole game.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=awkward,Um...well, the others don't know any better, but this is kind of awkward.  Didn't think you'd take that off.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Oh, dear.  Now you've done it, Rinkah...Meia <i>loves</i> women with muscles.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=interested,Just try to ride this out, honey.  Meia acts icy, but those muscles melt her right down like nobody's business.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Don't believe her cover stories, Rinkah.  Meia doesn't want your muscles...she wants <i>you</i>.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,Heehee!  Meia tends to get like this around particularly <i>fit</i> women, if you follow.  Don't mind her desperate advances.
3-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:meia=seductive,This is what makes Barnette so wonderful.  She barely wears anything!
3-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,You're like those horrid Mejarian soldiers with all your accessories.  Or me.
3-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,<i>Why wear what has no meaning to you</i>?  That's your M.O., right, Meia?  Bless you, so laser-focused.
3-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:meia=interested,I see you have an eye for fashion.  Just not sure its sight is 20/20.
3-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,Now that I think about it, Dita has little necklace to remove...and so do I.
3-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=smug,Still shaky on the game's rules, Miss Pixie?  You don't <i>have</i> to jump straight to be big-name items.
3-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=interested,Jeez, Kyu, settle down.  What kind of awful tease would jump straight to nudity?  You've got to keep them guessing.
3-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=laughing,Hey, I know <i>you're</i> not shy about it, but do try to understand why these poor Earth people might be ashamed.
3-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=vain,I don't get it either, Kyu, but don't get all mad.  Earth people just tend to hate their own bodies.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4c=laughing,Hah!  Going for <i>my</i> look, are you?  Yeah, cleavage tends to get people to do what you want.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4c=laughing,Feeling a little breezy, honey?  Don't worry, you'll get used to it--I did.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4c=laughing,Pfft!  How do you like <i>my</i> style, then?  I'm flattered you had this on the backburner, sweetie.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4c=vain,Doesn't the breeze feel good between your breasts?  It always perks me up when I'm down.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:leela,targetStage:1=teasing,Ooh, what's <i>that</i> thing?  A men's gun fused with a woman's?  Not as unlikely as you might think.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:leela,targetStage:1=vain,Is that a men's gun that shoots lasers?  Listen, honey...combining male and female weapons is par for the course on the Nirvana.

4-male_removing_accessory=annoyed,Oh, give me a break already.
4-male_removing_accessory=bored,I'm sure Tarak's proud of your devotion to strategy.
4-male_removing_accessory=awkward,Men <i>wear</i> that?  Really?  Is it for your job or something?
4-male_removing_accessory=seductive,Definitely have no right to complain now.  Except that I'm from a planet of all women and I'm <i>very</i> curious about you.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:1=laughing,Something the matter, Mr. Muscle?  You look so <i>dreadfully</i> uncomfortable.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:1=vain,Am I being distracting, Mr. Muscle?  Well, you're guilty of it yourself, with that hunky body of yours.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:1=seductive,Am I drawing your eyes, honey?  Well you started it--how can I <i>not</i> stare at all those muscles of yours?
4-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:1=teasing,See something you like, dearie?  You seem so <i>uncomfortable</i> around women for an Earth man--I guess you've never seen one like me!
4-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=confused,...Wait, you're a <i>man</i>?  Aren't men...<i>tall</i>?  And, you know, <i>masculine</i>?
4-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=confused,...Oh, you're a man.  Well, that's disappointing.  What's the word for this?  <i>Han-droggo-niss</i> or something?
4-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=confused,...Huh.  You're a man.  I guess I can work with this, but <i>wow</i>.  You really had me fooled...
4-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=bored,...Oh.  Well, this wouldn't be the <i>first</i> time a man fooled me into thinking he's a woman, but <i>that</i> was on purpose...
4-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=annoyed,<i>Oho</i>.  So when <i>I</i> take off my sword, it's a lame first impression.  But not lame enough to not <i>copy</i>.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=vain,<i>Oh.  Mm-hm</i>.  Taking off your weapon--<i>I wonder where he got that idea</i>?
4-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=laughing,I didn't realize men were such fabulous hypocrites, Trigger Finger.  But at least you're not too scared to be disarmed around me.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=vain,<i>Removing a sword, eh</i>?  And here I thought men were the <i>honorable</i> sex.  But no, you're content to emulate what you criticize.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=awkward,...Wait, one of you is a <i>man</i>?  But--you--I...<i>wow</i>.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=confused,...Wait, I'm confused.  Men and women don't look <i>that</i> close.  Are you sure you're a man?
4-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=awkward,...Oh.  I really thought I was getting good at telling men and women apart...
4-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=confused,...Wait, you're a <i>man</i>?  I mean, Duero wears his hair long, and Meia's is short, so I don't assume anything there...
4-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=interested,Oh, I see.  It's thin enough to see through, and you just like messing with people?
4-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=vain,Ah, I see--it's thin fabric.  Men and their deceitful ways, thinking they could pull one over on me!
4-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=interested,Could've fooled me, with that hand you were rocking.  Still, I guess the fabric's thin enough to see, and you just like playing pretend.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=teasing,So you're just a fan of the dungeon look, and the blindfold's thin enough to see through?  Nice try fooling Jura Basil Elden.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=confused,...Are you sure, Meia?  I mean, B.C. fooled <i>you</i>, too.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,...Wait, really?  Well, wouldn't be the first time, although poor Corrin here seems to have fooled us by <i>accident</i>.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=awkward,...Uh...good eye, Meia.  Well, this is awkward.  Sorry, Miss--Mister.  You're still pretty cute...for a man.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=confused,...Meia, don't mess with me.  Are you <i>sure</i>?  I mean, look at her--him.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=seductive,<i>There</i> you go.  Fully sighted like the rest of us!  I don't buy that nonsense about it being a visor...can I see it?
4-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=teasing,If that thing's really a visor, toss it over here.  If you get to cheat, why can't I see how?
4-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=teasing,You're not afraid to let a simple human woman see what advantages you had, right?  Give it here.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=interested,I'm calling your bluff on that thing being a visor.  I think you're some weird fetish-man who's been peeking at the cards underneath it.  Can I see?
4-male_removed_accessory=annoyed,What is it with men and accessories?  Women love fashion, men love...military badges?
4-male_removed_accessory=vain,Hey, B.C. has a lot of trinkets...but for some <i>very</i> good reasons.
4-male_removed_accessory=teasing,Be glad I don't still have my sword, ~name~.  <i>I'm feeling a little incensed</i>.
4-male_removed_accessory=laughing,What's a Mejarian to do with an uncooperative man?  Try to sway him with a little skin?  Or just gobble him up and be done with it?
4-male_removed_accessory=thinking,I wonder if Hibiki would count his dogtag.  Why's he got that thing, anyway?
4-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=laughing,Hey, what <i>that</i> supposed to mean, Gearbox?  What Barnette and I do in private is none of your business.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=vain,Oh, please.  I'm the <i>giver</i> in my relationship...<i>Barnette</i> would get to wear the blindfold.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=teasing,<i>Oho</i>!  And Little Dungeon Bot shows some spunk.  You're getting more human all the time...<i>maybe we could use that blindfold</i>.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=teasing,Ha!  About time you manned up and talked back to me.  But to be honest, <i>Barnette's</i> usually wearing the blindfold.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=shocked,So why do you two look the same?  ...You're the same <i>person</i>?  But--how's that possible?
4-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=excited,W-wait, you're the <i>male</i> version of her?  Where's the male version of <i>me</i>?  I bet he's <i>handsome</i>!
4-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=vain,Oh, wow, you're the same person, but the opposite sex?  Where's the male <i>me</i>?  Tall, gorgeous--and <i>blond</i>!
4-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=thinking,T-this is really incredible.  Are there male versions of <i>every</i> woman I know?  I wonder if male Barnette is handsome...
4-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=teasing,Well then, don't think I won't tease you!  It'll just be in a different sort of way...
4-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=laughing,A man who looks like a woman might be <i>exactly</i> the kind of seed I need...wouldn't want my children all hairy and gross.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=seductive,OK.  Well, nothing I can't work with!  Now you're cute in a completely different sort of way, <i>Mister</i> Corrin.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=vain,Don't feel too bad about it, then.  Women's bodies are so much smoother and luscious anyway...you should strive to emulate us.
4-female_removing_accessory=annoyed,Hey, <i>I</i> have a body worth teasing for a while.  Yours is just passable.
4-female_removing_accessory=laughing,Is <i>this</i> what I've been doing the whole time?  It <i>is</i> annoying.
4-female_removing_accessory=vain,Just an accessory?  Why, I'd <i>never</i> take off something that small!  The audacity!
4-female_removing_accessory=interested,I hope that meant a lot to you, because it didn't really bring the outfit together.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:1=smug,<i>Dear, dear</i>.  Removing your fancy jewelry so readily?  Don't you care about that precious ttle of yours?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:1=teasing,Blonde women are always favorites of mine...even better, you're removing that ridiculous crown early.  Come have some fun with us commoners.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:1=interested,No sense keeping it on long, right?  You're already lowering yourself by playing this, anyway.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:1=teasing,Make the gown next to go, Miss Princess.  I think you'll find how fun we dirty common folk can be.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0=teasing,You got that idea from <i>me</i>, you little cheat!  Once again the crafty Mejarian paves the way for the rest of womankind.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0=smug,<i>My, my, Lyn</i>.  <i>Bending the rules by removing a weapon?</i>  The <i>audacity</i>.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0=teasing,You're just copying what I came up with before...but you've got Barnette's cute green hair, so I'll let it slide.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0=laughing,I'd teach you a thing or two with my rapier for copying me like this, but, well, I threw it away.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=teasing,<i>Atta girl</i>!  Now show me something magical!  ...Besides this.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=vain,These vortices are pretty fantastic, but it's the end result I care about.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=seductive,You really are something else.  I've already grown accustomed to your magic vortices!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=seductive,All that magic, but all I care about is the outfit waiting for me.  I never thought I'd meet someone like you!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:1=interested,And what do we have here?  Miserable old Miss Brunette is admitting she's no better than the rest of us?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:1=laughing,Hey, Miss Princess.  You don't mind if this pirate holds onto that tiara, do you?  Just for a little <i>inspection</i>?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:1=teasing,Don't stop there, Miss Princess.  Nothing satisfies a pirate quite like watching nobles stripped down to nothing at all.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:1=laughing,Take away her tiara and she's a brunette in a dress.  Take away her dress...and I hope her butt is cute.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=excited,Yes!  <i>Yes</i>!  Go for it!  Roll that die!  Can I have one?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=excited,You are so <i>cool</i>, Vriska!  Where can I get one of those things?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=excited,So it's that die that does it for you?  Can I have one?  I want to switch my outfit on the fly!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=teasing,Where'd you get that die?  I don't want to have to steal <i>yours</i>, you know!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=confused,...Seriously, do you have <i>any</i> control over this?  Even a little?  Or is it all luck?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=confused,...Talk about living life up to chance, by the way.  This is so weird...and I'm a pilot.  I've <i>seen</i> weird.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=stretching,There she goes with another vortex.  Life is just a game of luck to our little fashionista here.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=vain,Too bad this isn't the spectacle it used to be.  But the random chance <i>does</i> keep it interesting!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1=shocked,And a <i>Bless You</i> to--to...<i>where'd Launch go</i>?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1=confused,...That's, uh, a pretty hard sneeze.  Didn't realize it could turn your hair blue.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1=awkward,...Uh...is this an Earth thing, or would <i>my</i> hair turn blue if I sneezed too hard?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1=shocked,...<i>Launch?  Where'd the blonde girl go</i>?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=bored,It's refreshing to know you won't acknowledge anything I say.  Real liberating.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=awkward,...Look, I know I tease a lot, but I'm just having fun.  Nothing about <i>this</i> is fun.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=frustrated,Talk about a lost cause.  She won't even acknowledge me.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=teasing,<i>Hey, Ocean Girl.  If you're being held against your will, blink twice.  I'm a pirate, I understand</i>.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=confused,...Did I miss something?  Can't we take off whatever we want?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=confused,...Is there really a nebulous <i>management</i> that's got guns to our heads if we don't strip how they want?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=confused,...Who exactly is holding a gun to your head and making you do this?  Hey, are you listening?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=confused,...Why do you have to take off your shoes next?  I mean, you <i>should</i>, but apparently you <i>have</i> to?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=seductive,<i>Oooh</i>!  That sounded so <i>cute</i>, honey, whatever it was!  What does that mean?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=seductive,<i>Teeheehee</i>!  I don't know what you said, but your home language sounds so silky smooth and romantic!  What's it mean?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, what's <i>that</i> mean, dear?  Because it sounded like the most romantic thing I've ever heard!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=excited,Omigosh, that's so <i>romantic</i>-sounding!  What does it mean?  I want to talk like that!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=laughing,...Wow, I was just kidding.  You really <i>are</i> a sex fairy, just presenting like that.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=interested,Honey, you can't just <i>present</i> like that right from the get-go.  The audience can't get what they want until the grand finale.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=smug,Seems Earth girls overdo it as usual.  What kind of tease would I be if just spread my legs right here and now?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=teasing,Easy there, hot stuff.  You're already wearing so little--no need to spoil what surprises you <i>have</i>.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,<i>Heeheehee</i>!  Oh, you're hopelessly in love now!  This is so <i>cute</i>!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,I <i>knew</i> we'd meet a girl here who was your type--and with all these hormones flowing, you'd <i>have</i> to break your stoicism eventually.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Do you hear that, Chunners?  It's the sound of ice melting nearby.  You've lit a fire in her heart.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,Go on, Meia, ask her out.  You both know how an exercise session is going to end.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=bored,<i>Management</i>?  What is <i>up</i> with this girl?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=confused,...I'm totally lost.  There's <i>rules</i> about what you can strip?  They didn't tell me any rules.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=confused,...Honey, did the bouncer clock you upside the head before you came in?  I'm not teasing, I'm dead serious.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=frustrated,I...<i>what</i>?  <i>Management</i>?  Yeah, you could <i>use</i> a little management, that's for sure.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>Aaack!  No!  Wait!  I'm too young to die!  Too beautiful</i>!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>Eek!  Noooo!  Wait!  I'll give you whatever you want</i>!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>Ack!  The Harvest!  I should've known this was a trap</i>!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>Eeeeek!  No!  Please!  I have a girlfriend</i>!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:0=seductive,<i>Heeheehee!  Such a tease, Miss Valentine</i>!  You can deny it all you want, but I see myself written all over you.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:0=vain,It's OK to want to distance yourself from me, dear.  I am, after all, taller and more beautiful.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:0=smug,Why deny the similarities, darling?  Women across Mejare <i>wish</i> they could be mentioned alongside Jura Basil Elden.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:0=teasing,What, too proud to admit we're alike?  <i>Afraid I do your image better than you</i>?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=laughing,...Well, that's one down.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=interested,...I really thought Earth girls handled men better than anyone.  I wanted to see her naked, too.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=smug,...That girl really needed some time on Mejare to toughen her up.  Men are giant pushovers.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=bored,Should've known we wouldn't all make it through this without bailing.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=smug,Well, I mean, if <i>anyone</i> was going to chicken out, it was going to be her.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:3=interested,Sure you don't want to cling to that, dearie?  It <i>is</i> what marks as you as better than the rest of us.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:3=vain,I guess I can understand losing that, even as a princess.  It'll let your blonde hair flow free and unencumbered!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:3=seductive,Miss Princess dropping her overinflated jewelry?  Oh, I forgot--you're blonde, so you're not so bad.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:3=teasing,That's it, honey.  Lower yourself to the level of us dirty commoners.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=teasing,<i>Oh, am I being too forward</i>?  My apologies.  Just know you'd have your pick of the bunch over there.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=seductive,Oh, sorry, I got carried away there.  But you're still a beautiful, musclebound woman!  That's a plus anywhere.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=seductive,Maybe that was a little forward of me.  But Mejarians would love you!  I wonder if men feel the same.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=teasing,Well, just know how in-demand you are on Mejare...if these bumbling Earth men start giving you the cold shoulder.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:7=sad,<i>So long, Ang</i>--oh.  Well, I guess that counts.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:7=sad,<i>Awww</i>!  And here I thought I had beaten you.  But no, you proved too wily for me.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:7=vain,Damn Earth girls and their tricks.  <i>Who would do that, bring a bunch of accessories to a strip poker game</i>?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:7=smug,My pilot's eyes should've spotted that, but you snuck right past me--and yourself, even.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=shocked,O-oh, are you putting the guns down?  I-I promise I won't touch them.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=awkward,<i>(Oh, thank God...)</i>  Er, Revy, good choice there.  Good choice.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=awkward,Hey, uh, now that you're disarmed, try to relax a little, would you?  Instead of yelling at us.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=sad,I was <i>hoping</i> tonight wouldn't end with someone getting shot.  Don't we all just want to see each other naked?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=smug,You going to throw up, sweetie?  Looks like it...well, don't face <i>me</i> when it happens.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=laughing,Can we get a janitor over here?  This girl's about to pee herself.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=annoyed,Jeez, this girl's gonna spend the evening sobbing.  Can't we just tell her to leave?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=bored,You're no fun.  You're such a head case that I can't even tease you.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=excited,...So, uh, Ochako.  You're floating.  ...Are you going to explain that?  Because it's <i>incredible</i>!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=excited,Wait--are you--omigosh, Ochako, you can <i>float</i>?  That's so <i>cool</i>!  How are you doing that?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=excited,Omigosh!  <i>Omigosh</i>!  Ochako!  You can just <i>float</i> like that?  I'd have been doing it all game if I could <i>float</i>!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=excited,...OK.  Ochako.  You're...<i>levitating</i>.  And that is so <i>cool</i>!  What's your secret?  Can <i>I</i> learn to float?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=sad,Oh...well, that's a...downer.  Worried about awkward questions?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=awkward,...I'm sorry I said anything.  You're really in it to win it...and to avoid weird questions, I guess.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=awkward,...You don't have to take this game so seriously, Meia.  Or are you worried people would ask questions if you saved it for later?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Of course she does, honey!  She just refuses to show it, which is why I drag her to places like this.  She only ever smiles with Ezra's baby.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=stretching,Why do you think I brought her here, Miss Polka-dot?  You need <i>steam</i> to melt all that ice of hers...or a baby.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=seductive,Oh, my Leader is an absolute <i>sweetheart</i>, Miss Accent.  You should see her with Ezra's little baby!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Meia's the sweetest girl you'll ever meet, Miss Ladybug...but she only shows it when she's making our crewmate's baby laugh.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=seductive,Meia just doesn't like crowds or strangers, that's all.  She thinks she's got to be all dignified.  But see how she acts with a baby!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:5=angry,Wha--<i>oh, goddamnit!  Just take things off in a proper order</i>!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:5=angry,Hey, I came here to see some Earth nudity!  I don't appreciate being toyed around with!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:5=annoyed,Yeah, yeah, hotshot.  Real clever.  You definitely played this game and <i>didn't</i> want people to see you naked.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:5=bored,This must be how people feel around <i>me</i>.  Clinging to accessories...at least <i>I</i> have a body worth teasing.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:5=annoyed,I <i>hate it</i> when people bounce around with the importance of what they take off.  Let the audience know what to expect!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:0=interested,You're, uh, a little on display there, honey.  Unless that sort of thing excites you.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:0=laughing,Oh, please.  You're flashing us on purpose, aren't you?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:0=teasing,Don't act like that flash was an accident, dearie.  I know your type...nerdy little Parfet is a freak, too.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:0=smug,Showing off the underwear early?  Should've pegged you as the falsely-modest type.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=stretching,Just a <i>little</i> nervous?  Damn...I guess I'm too gorgeous to be scary.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=laughing,Nervous?  I was really trying to scare you--I guess you're already falling in love with me.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=vain,I was hoping for a better reaction than that.  Maybe you're tougher than you look--or I'm just that lovable!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=teasing,Just trying to break you in, dear.  You look positively miserable--I wanted to scare you into having fun!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:3=smug,And at last the trumped-up girlie removes the only thing maintaining her arrogance.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:3=teasing,Hey, Princess...you can't strip what makes <i>me</i> beautiful.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:3=smug,<i>Royals</i>...talk about jewelry for jewelry's sake.  It's supposed to <i>improve</i> your looks, not create them.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:3=teasing,Thaaaank <i>you</i>!  Now the property of Magno Vivan's pirates, little Miss Princess!  So sorry.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=teasing,Hey, Miss Military--where'd you get all that beer?  Throw some this way, let's have fun!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=vain,Just chugging it down, huh, Miss Military?  <i>Mejarians</i> are so much more tasteful...but give me some, if you don't mind.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=smug,I hope you brought enough booze for <i>everyone</i>, Misato.  It's not nice to hoard.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=stretching,I thought I smelled beer...more of a rum woman myself, but when on Earth, drink as the classless Earth girls drink.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=laughing,<i>Heeheehee</i>!  Oh, so you <i>are</i> the embarrassed type!  I was just calling you sexy, honey.  Relax.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, when a woman compliments your figure, you say "Thanks, you too."  Talk about <i>rude</i>.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=smug,I call you sexy enough to rock a bodysuit, and you get all flustered and offended.  Earth woman are so scared of each other.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=seductive,What?  That was <i>complimentary</i>, silly!  That suit is doing all <i>sorts</i> of favors for your hips.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=seductive,There you go!  Take off that hemet and show the world the cute face to match your sexy figure.  I wasn't teasing you before.
4-female_removed_accessory=bored,You're as boring as Meia.  Actually, you're worse, since Meia barely wears anything.
4-female_removed_accessory=interested,Apparently <i>some</i> people just refuse to take off the good stuff.
4-female_removed_accessory=laughing,Good thing pirates don't have uniforms.  I'd have to ruin my outfit with a bunch of meaningless accessories!
4-female_removed_accessory=thinking,Meia only has one thing you might call an "accessory"...and she might not even want to take it off.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3b=seductive,You're getting sexier all the time, cutie!  I like leaving my shoulders bare, too...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3b=vain,<i>Now</i> you're speaking my language!  A woman's shoulders should be as free as space is vast.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3b=vain,As long as the universe is expanding, a woman's shoulders should be unmasked to see it happen.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3b=seductive,<i>Exactly</i> what I would go for, with those uncovered shoulders.  I feel like you already know me so well, Vriska!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:leela,targetStage:1=teasing,Ooh, what's <i>that</i> thing?  A men's gun fused with a woman's?  Not as unlikely as you might think.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:leela,targetStage:1=vain,Is that a men's gun that shoots lasers?  Listen, honey...combining male and female weapons is par for the course on the Nirvana.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=confused,I guess that's understandable.  Wouldn't want people prying...they don't know any better.  I'll hold it if you want...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=awkward,OK...makes sense.  Want me to hold onto it?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=awkward,Makes sense...they don't know what it is.  Here, let me hold it.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=confused,Me-<i>ow</i>!  Heeheehee--wait, you're serious?  Like, the animal, a cat?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=confused,...Earth girls can have <i>cat</i> ears?  Like, the cats I see in zoos?  How?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=confused,...You, uh, going to explain this to me?  I'm still shaky on what a <i>cat</i> is, much less a "Faunus."
4-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=frustrated,...Listen, I'm not from Earth.  You can't expect me to understand why you have cat ears...or why you've been hiding them.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=annoyed,Am I getting through to you?  Jura to Ocean Girl!  <i>Hello</i>?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=angry,Hey, Ocean Girl!  <i>I'm talking to you</i>!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=annoyed,What's your name, floozy?  <i>Moon</i>?  Yeah, you're a lunatic, alright!  Say something to me!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=annoyed,Hel-<i>looo</i>?  Am I breaking up?  Have we achieved first contact?  <i>God</i>...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=interested,Oh, you're back.  Try not to make a habit of that, dearie...it's not very intimidating.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=confused,...Well, at least you came back.  Serously, did a man kill your family or something?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=teasing,Listen, honey, you ought to come my my home planet sometime.  It's nothing but women...and we make a habit of shooting nasty men.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=vain,You have <i>nothing</i> to be scared of, honey.  I've fought the toughest, burliest men around and come out on top!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3c=seductive,Oh, I see!  These must be Earth women's street clothes, right?  You're so considerate!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3c=smug,Going for something simple, huh?  Just basic Earth street clothes on display?  I get it.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3c=smug,Jacket and jeans?  Seen it--but I guess street clothes on Earth don't <i>have</i> to be all that different.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3c=teasing,Earth's street clothes sticking to the familiars, eh?  Mejarians tend to aim a little <i>tighter</i>.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a=laughing,Oho!  I <i>knew</i> you weren't so above it all!  And what a shift--bodysuits are pretty sexy.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a=laughing,Heeheehee!  I think the die was getting annoyed at you hiding your figure!  Go on, show off your hips!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a=interested,Going to do a little dance, Vriska?  Show off that figure a little?  Because that adorable polka-dotted suit is giving you a head start.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a=seductive,That's positively <i>adorable</i>, Vriska!  Polka-dots <i>and</i> a revealing shape.  Now it's <i>Mejarian</i> fashion!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=angry,Seriously, what just happened?  You can't just shapeshift like that and act like nothing happened!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=confused,Are you even a woman?  Or an Earthling?  Are you some kind of alien shapeshifter?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=sad,<i>I'm so confused</i>.  Are you a shapeshifting alien?  Is this what Earth women are capable of?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=awkward,I had no idea Earth genetics were so...<i>advanced</i>.  Just changing your hair color on a whim.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=smug,Getting all liquored up, then?  Can't say you have the height for it.  Is this how you pick up men?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=interested,So is this how Earth girls spend a weekend?  Getting sloppy-drunk and falling on top of strange men?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=seductive,Oh, Sei, you're so cute!  Don't tell me you're just going to get sloshed and let some beastly man ravish you this evening.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=vain,Is this really what you Earth women do?  Get drunk and fondle strange men?  <i>Mejarians</i> are hopeless romantics.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:1=interested,OK, sure.  Just drop all pretenses. why don't you?  You're moving too fast with this.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:1=smug,You're a bigger tease than I am.  Hey, make them <i>work</i> for it.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:1=teasing,Hey, that little peek was enough.  You're going to ruin the surprise!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:1=vain,Come now, Velma, drag it out a bit!  You just got started...leave a little to the imagination.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2=laughing,Knowing what I do about Earth, you <i>do</i> have plenty of reasons to drink.  So get to it, Miss Military.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2=stretching,Isn't Earth devastated where you come from?  Same here, honey...bottoms up, drink it all away.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2=interested,The world's a terrifying place...especially where you come from, I hear.  So don't feel bad about your little booze habit.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2=interested,What's all the beer for, honey?  Depressed about losing your boots, or about this "Second Impact" I keep hearing of?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,Oh, please.  All this titilating nudity is enough excitement for one evening.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,As if I need to drink to have fun when there's full-blown Earth nudity in our midst!  <i>I resent your implication</i>.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,Hey, Misato can drink alone.  <i>I</i> only drink when I know my darling Barnette is there to take care of me.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:meia=thinking,Hey now, I'm tall!  I can handle at least...uh...a few beers, give or take.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2b=seductive,Ohhh, that's cute!  Now you're all dressed up like a maid--which Mejare frowns upon, but not as much as it does pirates.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2b=vain,Maid outfits are so adorable!  I'd dress up my girlfriend in one...if I could afford one.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2b=excited,Ohh, I wish I had something as cute as that!  Barnette and I could do a little roleplay, you know, pretend we have money.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2b=teasing,Life's tough for a Mejarian pirate...but the alternative is to be a maid for some rich old hag.  No thanks!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=teasing,I've got my eye on you, Miss Pixie...because my ears are totally confused when you talk.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=vain,Little Miss Pixie must think she's clever, saying all these things that go over my poor foreigner head.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=seductive,Have some sympathy for this poor alien woman, Kyu.  You're always saying things only an Earth woman would understand.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=vain,Feel free to start making sense for <i>everyone</i>, Miss Pixie.  Think of the poor aliens in your presence when you speak.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:4=bored,For how excited you are to strip...I'm not sure I want to see what lies underneath.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:4=angry,As if we want to see your nasty little twig body.  You keep going on about how you're just a public plaything!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:4=frustrated,Oh, good, you're almost out.  Maybe then you can lose and leave and stop freaking me out.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:4=annoyed,Whatever ocean <i>you're</i> swimming in, I bet the fish are all dead.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2a=awkward,Uh...ew.  That's kind of ratty, actually.  But you've got more, right?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2a=confused,...Now you kind of smell salty.  Don't you have something else?  Something <i>nicer</i>?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2a=confused,...I have no clue what that is.  Kind of looks like <i>men's</i> clothing...all tattered and gross.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2a=confused,...That's certainly a lot of extra stuff.  But somehow it just ends up looking like rags, whatever it is.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4c=laughing,Hah!  Going for <i>my</i> look, are you?  Yeah, cleavage tends to get people to do what you want.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4c=laughing,Feeling a little breezy, honey?  Don't worry, you'll get used to it--I did.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4c=laughing,Pfft!  How do you like <i>my</i> style, then?  I'm flattered you had this on the backburner, sweetie.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4c=vain,Doesn't the breeze feel good between your breasts?  It always perks me up when I'm down.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,Don't ask questions you don't want the answer to, Meia.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=stretching,This is why I mostly stick to asking about men and fashion.  See what happens?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=interested,See, Meia?  Don't encourage people to discuss things you don't care about.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Oh, <i>this</i> ought to be a treat.  <i>Have fun, Leader</i>!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=vain,Finally shedding all your little things.  That's good...women are much cuter unencumbered.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=seductive,I can't get over how cute you are...especially without all that extra padding!  Just a tiny little thing with gorgeous blue hair on top.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=smug,I wonder if you could pull off a dress like mine, Sei.  You're so preoccupied with all that silly armor and padding...why wear it?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=vain,What is it you do again that requires all this nonsense on your person?  You should wear something <i>sexy</i>!
4-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=smug,Still shaky on the game's rules, Miss Pixie?  You don't <i>have</i> to jump straight to be big-name items.
4-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=interested,Jeez, Kyu, settle down.  What kind of awful tease would jump straight to nudity?  You've got to keep them guessing.
4-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=laughing,Hey, I know <i>you're</i> not shy about it, but do try to understand why these poor Earth people might be ashamed.
4-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=vain,I don't get it either, Kyu, but don't get all mad.  Earth people just tend to hate their own bodies.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1=vain,<i>Ohoho</i>.  So your sword is <i>divine</i>, is it?  I guess that blows my silly little fashion item out of the water.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1=vain,If that thing's really so divine, maybe you should keep it on.  <i>Who knows what could happen here</i>?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1=teasing,Seems a little silly bringing a <i>divine</i> sword to this seedy little dump.  Does it know its owner is dirtying herself?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1=seductive,<i>Divine</i>, hm?  I like your style, honey...sword, green hair, and the favor of the gods.  If it's true.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2c=seductive,Oh, I see!  These must be Earth women's street clothes, right?  You're so considerate!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2c=smug,Starting off simple, huh?  Just basic Earth street clothes on display?  I get it.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2c=smug,Jacket and jeans?  Seen it--but I guess street clothes on Earth don't <i>have</i> to be all that different.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2c=teasing,Earth's street clothes sticking to the familiars, eh?  Mejarians tend to aim a little <i>tighter</i>.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=frustrated,Not to be rude, but, uh...<i>you've totally got a screw loose</i>.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=confused,...Is this what I sound like?  I just think flirting is fun...this girl's <i>nuts</i>.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=bored,...Maybe I should stop flirting so much.  If <i>this</i> girl is the end result, that is.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=bored,...Does sex with men do this to you?  Because this girl's <i>really</i> starting to freak me out.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4b=vain,Bare midriff?  My dress brings me pretty close to that...but <i>Dita's</i> the girl who wears it best!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4b=seductive,Ooh, my crewmate Dita dresses like that!  She's such a naive little thing, even with her midriff exposed all sexy-like.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4b=vain,I know a sweet young girl who dresses like that!  Dita's her name--she's so naive.  Barely even notices her exposed belly.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4b=smug,Yeah, Dita shows off her belly too.  I can't tell if she's just too naive to know how sexy she's being or just doesn't care.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=seductive,You're quite the fit little specimen, Rinkah.  I know a certain squadron leader who'd fall head-over-heels for you...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=teasing,I know a woman who loves muscles very much, Rinkah...you'd put her in a tizzy.  Do Earth women like each other in that way?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=seductive,Mind if I play a little matchmaker?  I brought my boss here...and she <i>loves</i> muscles on a woman, even if she won't admit it.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=seductive,You into women, sweetheart?  Because I know a certain blue-haired ice queen who would <i>totally</i> fall for those abs of yours.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3a=seductive,Ooh, a sexy red-and-black!  I like your style, Vriska--and it clashes with your skin!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3a=teasing,Nothing like blood-red and shadow-black to get the heart beating.  Plus, those bullets get it going even faster!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3a=vain,Talk about making my heart jump.  Red, black, and bullets on the side!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3a=vain,I wish <i>I</i> owned something red...and this dress is the closest thing to black.  <i>A pirate's problems</i>!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=excited,<i>No!  Please!  I</i>--I--what?  Omigosh, that's <i>fantastic</i>!  Sorry I teased you!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=excited,...Oh my God!  You just changed your <i>whole</i> outfit?  That's spectacular!  Sorry about those skin comments.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=excited,Omigosh!  How--<i>how'd you do that</i>?  Do it again!  I want to see more outfits!  Who cares if your skin's blue?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=excited,Wha--what'd you just do?  <i>How</i>?  Tell me everything!  I'm sorry I made fun of your skin color!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=vain,Talk about a terrestial booze-a-thon.  Oh, well, I've got the height to drink with the best of them!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=smug,I get that this place is a bar, but damn, ladies, at least <i>pretend</i> you're trying to win.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=interested,So I get this place has a no-touching rule, but you two aren't really disguising how you're planning to take some of us home afterward.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=laughing,I <i>do</i> love drinking, but I don't think I could keep up with you two.  I guess living around men forces you to drown your sorrows.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Oh, dear.  Now you've done it, Rinkah...Meia <i>loves</i> women with muscles.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=interested,Just try to ride this out, honey.  Meia acts icy, but those muscles melt her right down like nobody's business.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Don't believe her cover stories, Rinkah.  Meia doesn't want your muscles...she wants <i>you</i>.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,Heehee!  Meia tends to get like this around particularly <i>fit</i> women, if you follow.  Don't mind her desperate advances.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:6=angry,What do you mean, <i>not fun</i>?  The fun is starting off with some teasing and then revealing your beautiful body!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:6=vain,<i>Hmph</i>.  It would seem <i>I'm</i> the only proper seductress around here, properly building up to nudity like a lady.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:6=bored,There's a right way and a wrong way to strip, and you're starting to fall into the wrong way.  It needs to escalate!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:6=smug,<i>Well</i>.  I'd never make it as a model if I deflated the excitement like you do.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,marker:fama_and_oma=confused,...Uh...what's a grandfather?  Like a grand-Fama?  It's mostly the "father" part I'm confused over.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1=awkward,That's, uh, a lot of family history.  You lost me at "father," whatever <i>that</i> means.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,marker:fama_and_oma=confused,...OK, I know what "grand" means, but what's a "father"?  Is that some weird Earth term for Omas?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1=frustrated,Wait, wait, stop, forget the makeup.  Now I'm confused as to what a "father" is, though apparently they're grand.
4-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:meia=bored,You're as boring as Meia.  Tell them, Meia, they're just as boring as you.
4-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:meia=interested,Apparently <i>some</i> people just refuse to take off the good stuff.
4-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,Good thing pirates don't have uniforms.  I'd have to ruin my outfit with a bunch of meaningless accessories!
4-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:meia=awkward,Hey, Mejarians actually <i>value</i> their accessories...right, Meia?


#lost dress
5-male_removing_accessory=bored,Never thought a man would doll himself up this much.  Bad time to learn that.
5-male_removing_accessory=annoyed,Hey, ~name~, if you want an accessory, take my thong.  Covers about as much.
5-male_removing_accessory=angry,Ugh!  Even <i>now</i>, you won't show me something good?
5-male_removing_accessory=annoyed,I can't believe men can even <i>count</i> as high as the layers you have.
5-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=confused,...Are you sure, Meia?  I mean, B.C. fooled <i>you</i>, too.
5-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,...Wait, really?  Well, wouldn't be the first time, although poor Corrin here seems to have fooled us by <i>accident</i>.
5-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=awkward,...Uh...good eye, Meia.  Well, this is awkward.  Sorry, Miss--Mister.  You're still pretty cute...for a man.
5-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=confused,...Meia, don't mess with me.  Are you <i>sure</i>?  I mean, look at her--him.
5-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=interested,Oh, I see.  It's thin enough to see through, and you just like messing with people?
5-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=vain,Ah, I see--it's thin fabric.  Men and their deceitful ways, thinking they could pull one over on me!
5-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=interested,Could've fooled me, with that hand you were rocking.  Still, I guess the fabric's thin enough to see, and you just like playing pretend.
5-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=teasing,So you're just a fan of the dungeon look, and the blindfold's thin enough to see through?  Nice try fooling Jura Basil Elden.
5-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=awkward,...Wait, one of you is a <i>man</i>?  But--you--I...<i>wow</i>.
5-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=confused,...Wait, I'm confused.  Men and women don't look <i>that</i> close.  Are you sure you're a man?
5-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=awkward,...Oh.  I really thought I was getting good at telling men and women apart...
5-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=confused,...Wait, you're a <i>man</i>?  I mean, Duero wears his hair long, and Meia's is short, so I don't assume anything there...
5-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=annoyed,<i>Oho</i>.  So when <i>I</i> take off my sword, it's a lame first impression.  But not lame enough to not <i>copy</i>.
5-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=vain,<i>Oh.  Mm-hm</i>.  Taking off your weapon--<i>I wonder where he got that idea</i>?
5-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=laughing,I didn't realize men were such fabulous hypocrites, Trigger Finger.  But at least you're not too scared to be disarmed around me.
5-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=vain,<i>Removing a sword, eh</i>?  And here I thought men were the <i>honorable</i> sex.  But no, you're content to emulate what you criticize.
5-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=seductive,<i>There</i> you go.  Fully sighted like the rest of us!  I don't buy that nonsense about it being a visor...can I see it?
5-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=teasing,If that thing's really a visor, toss it over here.  If you get to cheat, why can't I see how?
5-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=teasing,You're not afraid to let a simple human woman see what advantages you had, right?  Give it here.
5-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=interested,I'm calling your bluff on that thing being a visor.  I think you're some weird fetish-man who's been peeking at the cards underneath it.  Can I see?
5-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=confused,...Wait, you're a <i>man</i>?  Aren't men...<i>tall</i>?  And, you know, <i>masculine</i>?
5-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=confused,...Oh, you're a man.  Well, that's disappointing.  What's the word for this?  <i>Han-droggo-niss</i> or something?
5-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=confused,...Huh.  You're a man.  I guess I can work with this, but <i>wow</i>.  You really had me fooled...
5-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=bored,...Oh.  Well, this wouldn't be the <i>first</i> time a man fooled me into thinking he's a woman, but <i>that</i> was on purpose...
5-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:1=laughing,Something the matter, Mr. Muscle?  You look so <i>dreadfully</i> uncomfortable.
5-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:1=vain,Am I being distracting, Mr. Muscle?  Well, you're guilty of it yourself, with that hunky body of yours.
5-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:1=seductive,Am I drawing your eyes, honey?  Well you started it--how can I <i>not</i> stare at all those muscles of yours?
5-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:1=teasing,See something you like, dearie?  You seem so <i>uncomfortable</i> around women for an Earth man--I guess you've never seen one like me!
5-male_removed_accessory=annoyed,How could a <i>man</i> manage to bore me?  I know, like, three of them.
5-male_removed_accessory=confused,Men can grow hair on their faces, right?  Why would you <i>ever</i> want that?
5-male_removed_accessory=sad,This isn't fun anymore.  Now I'm just a bimbo who got outwitted by a man.
5-male_removed_accessory=frustrated,Ah, jeez.  The men I know are from <i>Tarak</i>, and they'd still throw me a bone.
5-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=laughing,Hey, what <i>that</i> supposed to mean, Gearbox?  What Barnette and I do in private is none of your business.
5-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=vain,Oh, please.  I'm the <i>giver</i> in my relationship...<i>Barnette</i> would get to wear the blindfold.
5-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=teasing,<i>Oho</i>!  And Little Dungeon Bot shows some spunk.  You're getting more human all the time...<i>maybe we could use that blindfold</i>.
5-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=teasing,Ha!  About time you manned up and talked back to me.  But to be honest, <i>Barnette's</i> usually wearing the blindfold.
5-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=teasing,Well then, don't think I won't tease you!  It'll just be in a different sort of way...
5-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=laughing,A man who looks like a woman might be <i>exactly</i> the kind of seed I need...wouldn't want my children all hairy and gross.
5-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=seductive,OK.  Well, nothing I can't work with!  Now you're cute in a completely different sort of way, <i>Mister</i> Corrin.
5-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=vain,Don't feel too bad about it, then.  Women's bodies are so much smoother and luscious anyway...you should strive to emulate us.
5-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=shocked,So why do you two look the same?  ...You're the same <i>person</i>?  But--how's that possible?
5-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=excited,W-wait, you're the <i>male</i> version of her?  Where's the male version of <i>me</i>?  I bet he's <i>handsome</i>!
5-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=vain,Oh, wow, you're the same person, but the opposite sex?  Where's the male <i>me</i>?  Tall, gorgeous--and <i>blond</i>!
5-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=thinking,T-this is really incredible.  Are there male versions of <i>every</i> woman I know?  I wonder if male Barnette is handsome...
5-female_removing_accessory=sad,This is really making me feel guilty about all the accessories I took off first.
5-female_removing_accessory=angry,<i>Really</i>?  Is this because of what <i>I</i> did?
5-female_removing_accessory=frustrated,...I know <i>I</i> was like this, but come on, be the bigger woman here.
5-female_removing_accessory=smug,Looks like I've got to do the stripping for <i>everyone</i> around here.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,<i>Heeheehee</i>!  Oh, you're hopelessly in love now!  This is so <i>cute</i>!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,I <i>knew</i> we'd meet a girl here who was your type--and with all these hormones flowing, you'd <i>have</i> to break your stoicism eventually.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Do you hear that, Chunners?  It's the sound of ice melting nearby.  You've lit a fire in her heart.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,Go on, Meia, ask her out.  You both know how an exercise session is going to end.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Of course she does, honey!  She just refuses to show it, which is why I drag her to places like this.  She only ever smiles with Ezra's baby.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=stretching,Why do you think I brought her here, Miss Polka-dot?  You need <i>steam</i> to melt all that ice of hers...or a baby.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=seductive,Oh, my Leader is an absolute <i>sweetheart</i>, Miss Accent.  You should see her with Ezra's little baby!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Meia's the sweetest girl you'll ever meet, Miss Ladybug...but she only shows it when she's making our crewmate's baby laugh.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=seductive,Meia just doesn't like crowds or strangers, that's all.  She thinks she's got to be all dignified.  But see how she acts with a baby!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1=shocked,And a <i>Bless You</i> to--to...<i>where'd Launch go</i>?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1=confused,...That's, uh, a pretty hard sneeze.  Didn't realize it could turn your hair blue.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1=awkward,...Uh...is this an Earth thing, or would <i>my</i> hair turn blue if I sneezed too hard?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1=shocked,...<i>Launch?  Where'd the blonde girl go</i>?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=seductive,<i>Oooh</i>!  That sounded so <i>cute</i>, honey, whatever it was!  What does that mean?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=seductive,<i>Teeheehee</i>!  I don't know what you said, but your home language sounds so silky smooth and romantic!  What's it mean?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, what's <i>that</i> mean, dear?  Because it sounded like the most romantic thing I've ever heard!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=excited,Omigosh, that's so <i>romantic</i>-sounding!  What does it mean?  I want to talk like that!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=teasing,Hey, Miss Military--where'd you get all that beer?  Throw some this way, let's have fun!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=vain,Just chugging it down, huh, Miss Military?  <i>Mejarians</i> are so much more tasteful...but give me some, if you don't mind.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=smug,I hope you brought enough booze for <i>everyone</i>, Misato.  It's not nice to hoard.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=stretching,I thought I smelled beer...more of a rum woman myself, but when on Earth, drink as the classless Earth girls drink.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=bored,<i>Management</i>?  What is <i>up</i> with this girl?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=confused,...I'm totally lost.  There's <i>rules</i> about what you can strip?  They didn't tell me any rules.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=confused,...Honey, did the bouncer clock you upside the head before you came in?  I'm not teasing, I'm dead serious.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=frustrated,I...<i>what</i>?  <i>Management</i>?  Yeah, you could <i>use</i> a little management, that's for sure.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=confused,...Did I miss something?  Can't we take off whatever we want?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=confused,...Is there really a nebulous <i>management</i> that's got guns to our heads if we don't strip how they want?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=confused,...Who exactly is holding a gun to your head and making you do this?  Hey, are you listening?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=confused,...Why do you have to take off your shoes next?  I mean, you <i>should</i>, but apparently you <i>have</i> to?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=smug,You going to throw up, sweetie?  Looks like it...well, don't face <i>me</i> when it happens.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=laughing,Can we get a janitor over here?  This girl's about to pee herself.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=annoyed,Jeez, this girl's gonna spend the evening sobbing.  Can't we just tell her to leave?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=bored,You're no fun.  You're such a head case that I can't even tease you.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=laughing,...Well, that's one down.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=interested,...I really thought Earth girls handled men better than anyone.  I wanted to see her naked, too.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=smug,...That girl really needed some time on Mejare to toughen her up.  Men are giant pushovers.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=bored,Should've known we wouldn't all make it through this without bailing.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=smug,Well, I mean, if <i>anyone</i> was going to chicken out, it was going to be her.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:0=seductive,<i>Heeheehee!  Such a tease, Miss Valentine</i>!  You can deny it all you want, but I see myself written all over you.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:0=vain,It's OK to want to distance yourself from me, dear.  I am, after all, taller and more beautiful.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:0=smug,Why deny the similarities, darling?  Women across Mejare <i>wish</i> they could be mentioned alongside Jura Basil Elden.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:0=teasing,What, too proud to admit we're alike?  <i>Afraid I do your image better than you</i>?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=bored,It's refreshing to know you won't acknowledge anything I say.  Real liberating.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=awkward,...Look, I know I tease a lot, but I'm just having fun.  Nothing about <i>this</i> is fun.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=frustrated,Talk about a lost cause.  She won't even acknowledge me.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=teasing,<i>Hey, Ocean Girl.  If you're being held against your will, blink twice.  I'm a pirate, I understand</i>.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:3=interested,Sure you don't want to cling to that, dearie?  It <i>is</i> what marks as you as better than the rest of us.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:3=vain,I guess I can understand losing that, even as a princess.  It'll let your blonde hair flow free and unencumbered!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:3=seductive,Miss Princess dropping her overinflated jewelry?  Oh, I forgot--you're blonde, so you're not so bad.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:3=teasing,That's it, honey.  Lower yourself to the level of us dirty commoners.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:3=smug,And at last the trumped-up girlie removes the only thing maintaining her arrogance.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:3=teasing,Hey, Princess...you can't strip what makes <i>me</i> beautiful.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:3=smug,<i>Royals</i>...talk about jewelry for jewelry's sake.  It's supposed to <i>improve</i> your looks, not create them.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:3=teasing,Thaaaank <i>you</i>!  Now the property of Magno Vivan's pirates, little Miss Princess!  So sorry.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:5=angry,Wha--<i>oh, goddamnit!  Just take things off in a proper order</i>!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:5=angry,Hey, I came here to see some Earth nudity!  I don't appreciate being toyed around with!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:5=annoyed,Yeah, yeah, hotshot.  Real clever.  You definitely played this game and <i>didn't</i> want people to see you naked.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:5=bored,This must be how people feel around <i>me</i>.  Clinging to accessories...at least <i>I</i> have a body worth teasing.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:5=annoyed,I <i>hate it</i> when people bounce around with the importance of what they take off.  Let the audience know what to expect!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=laughing,...Wow, I was just kidding.  You really <i>are</i> a sex fairy, just presenting like that.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=interested,Honey, you can't just <i>present</i> like that right from the get-go.  The audience can't get what they want until the grand finale.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=smug,Seems Earth girls overdo it as usual.  What kind of tease would I be if just spread my legs right here and now?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=teasing,Easy there, hot stuff.  You're already wearing so little--no need to spoil what surprises you <i>have</i>.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=shocked,O-oh, are you putting the guns down?  I-I promise I won't touch them.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=awkward,<i>(Oh, thank God...)</i>  Er, Revy, good choice there.  Good choice.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=awkward,Hey, uh, now that you're disarmed, try to relax a little, would you?  Instead of yelling at us.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=sad,I was <i>hoping</i> tonight wouldn't end with someone getting shot.  Don't we all just want to see each other naked?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=teasing,<i>Oh, am I being too forward</i>?  My apologies.  Just know you'd have your pick of the bunch over there.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=seductive,Oh, sorry, I got carried away there.  But you're still a beautiful, musclebound woman!  That's a plus anywhere.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=seductive,Maybe that was a little forward of me.  But Mejarians would love you!  I wonder if men feel the same.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=teasing,Well, just know how in-demand you are on Mejare...if these bumbling Earth men start giving you the cold shoulder.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=shocked,...OK.  That's a fair trade.  Yeah.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=shocked,I--I wasn't <i>serious</i>, Meia.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=shocked,M-Meia?  You know that's your <i>eyepiece</i>, right?  You're gonna...really?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=awkward,Uh...you, uh...didn't <i>have</i> to match my embarrassment.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=awkward,...I was kidding about being embarrassed.  You don't have to do that...
5-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0=teasing,You got that idea from <i>me</i>, you little cheat!  Once again the crafty Mejarian paves the way for the rest of womankind.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0=smug,<i>My, my, Lyn</i>.  <i>Bending the rules by removing a weapon?</i>  The <i>audacity</i>.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0=teasing,You're just copying what I came up with before...but you've got Barnette's cute green hair, so I'll let it slide.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0=laughing,I'd teach you a thing or two with my rapier for copying me like this, but, well, I threw it away.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:1=interested,And what do we have here?  Miserable old Miss Brunette is admitting she's no better than the rest of us?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:1=laughing,Hey, Miss Princess.  You don't mind if this pirate holds onto that tiara, do you?  Just for a little <i>inspection</i>?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:1=teasing,Don't stop there, Miss Princess.  Nothing satisfies a pirate quite like watching nobles stripped down to nothing at all.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:1=laughing,Take away her tiara and she's a brunette in a dress.  Take away her dress...and I hope her butt is cute.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=confused,...Seriously, do you have <i>any</i> control over this?  Even a little?  Or is it all luck?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=confused,...Talk about living life up to chance, by the way.  This is so weird...and I'm a pilot.  I've <i>seen</i> weird.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=stretching,There she goes with another vortex.  Life is just a game of luck to our little fashionista here.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=vain,Too bad this isn't the spectacle it used to be.  But the random chance <i>does</i> keep it interesting!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=teasing,<i>Atta girl</i>!  Now show me something magical!  ...Besides this.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=vain,These vortices are pretty fantastic, but it's the end result I care about.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=seductive,You really are something else.  I've already grown accustomed to your magic vortices!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=seductive,All that magic, but all I care about is the outfit waiting for me.  I never thought I'd meet someone like you!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=excited,Yes!  <i>Yes</i>!  Go for it!  Roll that die!  Can I have one?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=excited,You are so <i>cool</i>, Vriska!  Where can I get one of those things?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=excited,So it's that die that does it for you?  Can I have one?  I want to switch my outfit on the fly!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=teasing,Where'd you get that die?  I don't want to have to steal <i>yours</i>, you know!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>Aaack!  No!  Wait!  I'm too young to die!  Too beautiful</i>!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>Eek!  Noooo!  Wait!  I'll give you whatever you want</i>!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>Ack!  The Harvest!  I should've known this was a trap</i>!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>Eeeeek!  No!  Please!  I have a girlfriend</i>!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:7=sad,<i>So long, Ang</i>--oh.  Well, I guess that counts.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:7=sad,<i>Awww</i>!  And here I thought I had beaten you.  But no, you proved too wily for me.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:7=vain,Damn Earth girls and their tricks.  <i>Who would do that, bring a bunch of accessories to a strip poker game</i>?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:7=smug,My pilot's eyes should've spotted that, but you snuck right past me--and yourself, even.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:0=interested,You're, uh, a little on display there, honey.  Unless that sort of thing excites you.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:0=laughing,Oh, please.  You're flashing us on purpose, aren't you?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:0=teasing,Don't act like that flash was an accident, dearie.  I know your type...nerdy little Parfet is a freak, too.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:0=smug,Showing off the underwear early?  Should've pegged you as the falsely-modest type.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=excited,...So, uh, Ochako.  You're floating.  ...Are you going to explain that?  Because it's <i>incredible</i>!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=excited,Wait--are you--omigosh, Ochako, you can <i>float</i>?  That's so <i>cool</i>!  How are you doing that?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=excited,Omigosh!  <i>Omigosh</i>!  Ochako!  You can just <i>float</i> like that?  I'd have been doing it all game if I could <i>float</i>!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=excited,...OK.  Ochako.  You're...<i>levitating</i>.  And that is so <i>cool</i>!  What's your secret?  Can <i>I</i> learn to float?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=laughing,<i>Heeheehee</i>!  Oh, so you <i>are</i> the embarrassed type!  I was just calling you sexy, honey.  Relax.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, when a woman compliments your figure, you say "Thanks, you too."  Talk about <i>rude</i>.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=smug,I call you sexy enough to rock a bodysuit, and you get all flustered and offended.  Earth woman are so scared of each other.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=seductive,What?  That was <i>complimentary</i>, silly!  That suit is doing all <i>sorts</i> of favors for your hips.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=seductive,There you go!  Take off that hemet and show the world the cute face to match your sexy figure.  I wasn't teasing you before.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=stretching,Just a <i>little</i> nervous?  Damn...I guess I'm too gorgeous to be scary.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=laughing,Nervous?  I was really trying to scare you--I guess you're already falling in love with me.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=vain,I was hoping for a better reaction than that.  Maybe you're tougher than you look--or I'm just that lovable!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=teasing,Just trying to break you in, dear.  You look positively miserable--I wanted to scare you into having fun!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:1=smug,<i>Dear, dear</i>.  Removing your fancy jewelry so readily?  Don't you care about that precious ttle of yours?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:1=teasing,Blonde women are always favorites of mine...even better, you're removing that ridiculous crown early.  Come have some fun with us commoners.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:1=interested,No sense keeping it on long, right?  You're already lowering yourself by playing this, anyway.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:1=teasing,Make the gown next to go, Miss Princess.  I think you'll find how fun we dirty common folk can be.
5-female_removed_accessory=frustrated,I've gotta say, compared to you, Meia's a party animal.
5-female_removed_accessory=bored,You'd think the sight of Mejare's most beautiful woman would inspire some bolder stripping.  Apparently not.
5-female_removed_accessory=angry,My dress is off, OK?  I'm done teasing.  <i>Live a little</i>.
5-female_removed_accessory=sad,Oh, ~name~...you're breaking my heart.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a=laughing,Oho!  I <i>knew</i> you weren't so above it all!  And what a shift--bodysuits are pretty sexy.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a=laughing,Heeheehee!  I think the die was getting annoyed at you hiding your figure!  Go on, show off your hips!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a=interested,Going to do a little dance, Vriska?  Show off that figure a little?  Because that adorable polka-dotted suit is giving you a head start.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a=seductive,That's positively <i>adorable</i>, Vriska!  Polka-dots <i>and</i> a revealing shape.  Now it's <i>Mejarian</i> fashion!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=frustrated,Not to be rude, but, uh...<i>you've totally got a screw loose</i>.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=confused,...Is this what I sound like?  I just think flirting is fun...this girl's <i>nuts</i>.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=bored,...Maybe I should stop flirting so much.  If <i>this</i> girl is the end result, that is.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=bored,...Does sex with men do this to you?  Because this girl's <i>really</i> starting to freak me out.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3b=seductive,You're getting sexier all the time, cutie!  I like leaving my shoulders bare, too...
5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3b=vain,<i>Now</i> you're speaking my language!  A woman's shoulders should be as free as space is vast.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3b=vain,As long as the universe is expanding, a woman's shoulders should be unmasked to see it happen.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3b=seductive,<i>Exactly</i> what I would go for, with those uncovered shoulders.  I feel like you already know me so well, Vriska!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=annoyed,Am I getting through to you?  Jura to Ocean Girl!  <i>Hello</i>?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=angry,Hey, Ocean Girl!  <i>I'm talking to you</i>!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=annoyed,What's your name, floozy?  <i>Moon</i>?  Yeah, you're a lunatic, alright!  Say something to me!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=annoyed,Hel-<i>looo</i>?  Am I breaking up?  Have we achieved first contact?  <i>God</i>...
5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3c=seductive,Oh, I see!  These must be Earth women's street clothes, right?  You're so considerate!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3c=smug,Going for something simple, huh?  Just basic Earth street clothes on display?  I get it.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3c=smug,Jacket and jeans?  Seen it--but I guess street clothes on Earth don't <i>have</i> to be all that different.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3c=teasing,Earth's street clothes sticking to the familiars, eh?  Mejarians tend to aim a little <i>tighter</i>.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3a=seductive,Ooh, a sexy red-and-black!  I like your style, Vriska--and it clashes with your skin!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3a=teasing,Nothing like blood-red and shadow-black to get the heart beating.  Plus, those bullets get it going even faster!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3a=vain,Talk about making my heart jump.  Red, black, and bullets on the side!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3a=vain,I wish <i>I</i> owned something red...and this dress is the closest thing to black.  <i>A pirate's problems</i>!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4b=vain,Bare midriff?  My dress brings me pretty close to that...but <i>Dita's</i> the girl who wears it best!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4b=seductive,Ooh, my crewmate Dita dresses like that!  She's such a naive little thing, even with her midriff exposed all sexy-like.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4b=vain,I know a sweet young girl who dresses like that!  Dita's her name--she's so naive.  Barely even notices her exposed belly.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4b=smug,Yeah, Dita shows off her belly too.  I can't tell if she's just too naive to know how sexy she's being or just doesn't care.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2c=seductive,Oh, I see!  These must be Earth women's street clothes, right?  You're so considerate!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2c=smug,Starting off simple, huh?  Just basic Earth street clothes on display?  I get it.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2c=smug,Jacket and jeans?  Seen it--but I guess street clothes on Earth don't <i>have</i> to be all that different.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2c=teasing,Earth's street clothes sticking to the familiars, eh?  Mejarians tend to aim a little <i>tighter</i>.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2b=seductive,Ohhh, that's cute!  Now you're all dressed up like a maid--which Mejare frowns upon, but not as much as it does pirates.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2b=vain,Maid outfits are so adorable!  I'd dress up my girlfriend in one...if I could afford one.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2b=excited,Ohh, I wish I had something as cute as that!  Barnette and I could do a little roleplay, you know, pretend we have money.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2b=teasing,Life's tough for a Mejarian pirate...but the alternative is to be a maid for some rich old hag.  No thanks!
5-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=smug,Still shaky on the game's rules, Miss Pixie?  You don't <i>have</i> to jump straight to be big-name items.
5-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=interested,Jeez, Kyu, settle down.  What kind of awful tease would jump straight to nudity?  You've got to keep them guessing.
5-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=laughing,Hey, I know <i>you're</i> not shy about it, but do try to understand why these poor Earth people might be ashamed.
5-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=vain,I don't get it either, Kyu, but don't get all mad.  Earth people just tend to hate their own bodies.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2=laughing,Knowing what I do about Earth, you <i>do</i> have plenty of reasons to drink.  So get to it, Miss Military.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2=stretching,Isn't Earth devastated where you come from?  Same here, honey...bottoms up, drink it all away.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2=interested,The world's a terrifying place...especially where you come from, I hear.  So don't feel bad about your little booze habit.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2=interested,What's all the beer for, honey?  Depressed about losing your boots, or about this "Second Impact" I keep hearing of?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=seductive,You're quite the fit little specimen, Rinkah.  I know a certain squadron leader who'd fall head-over-heels for you...
5-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=teasing,I know a woman who loves muscles very much, Rinkah...you'd put her in a tizzy.  Do Earth women like each other in that way?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=seductive,Mind if I play a little matchmaker?  I brought my boss here...and she <i>loves</i> muscles on a woman, even if she won't admit it.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=seductive,You into women, sweetheart?  Because I know a certain blue-haired ice queen who would <i>totally</i> fall for those abs of yours.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=smug,Getting all liquored up, then?  Can't say you have the height for it.  Is this how you pick up men?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=interested,So is this how Earth girls spend a weekend?  Getting sloppy-drunk and falling on top of strange men?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=seductive,Oh, Sei, you're so cute!  Don't tell me you're just going to get sloshed and let some beastly man ravish you this evening.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=vain,Is this really what you Earth women do?  Get drunk and fondle strange men?  <i>Mejarians</i> are hopeless romantics.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:6=angry,What do you mean, <i>not fun</i>?  The fun is starting off with some teasing and then revealing your beautiful body!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:6=vain,<i>Hmph</i>.  It would seem <i>I'm</i> the only proper seductress around here, properly building up to nudity like a lady.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:6=bored,There's a right way and a wrong way to strip, and you're starting to fall into the wrong way.  It needs to escalate!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:6=smug,<i>Well</i>.  I'd never make it as a model if I deflated the excitement like you do.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=vain,Talk about a terrestial booze-a-thon.  Oh, well, I've got the height to drink with the best of them!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=smug,I get that this place is a bar, but damn, ladies, at least <i>pretend</i> you're trying to win.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=interested,So I get this place has a no-touching rule, but you two aren't really disguising how you're planning to take some of us home afterward.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=laughing,I <i>do</i> love drinking, but I don't think I could keep up with you two.  I guess living around men forces you to drown your sorrows.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4c=laughing,Hah!  Going for <i>my</i> look, are you?  Yeah, cleavage tends to get people to do what you want.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4c=laughing,Feeling a little breezy, honey?  Don't worry, you'll get used to it--I did.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4c=laughing,Pfft!  How do you like <i>my</i> style, then?  I'm flattered you had this on the backburner, sweetie.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4c=vain,Doesn't the breeze feel good between your breasts?  It always perks me up when I'm down.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,marker:fama_and_oma=confused,...Uh...what's a grandfather?  Like a grand-Fama?  It's mostly the "father" part I'm confused over.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1=awkward,That's, uh, a lot of family history.  You lost me at "father," whatever <i>that</i> means.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,marker:fama_and_oma=confused,...OK, I know what "grand" means, but what's a "father"?  Is that some weird Earth term for Omas?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1=frustrated,Wait, wait, stop, forget the makeup.  Now I'm confused as to what a "father" is, though apparently they're grand.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,Don't ask questions you don't want the answer to, Meia.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=stretching,This is why I mostly stick to asking about men and fashion.  See what happens?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=interested,See, Meia?  Don't encourage people to discuss things you don't care about.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Oh, <i>this</i> ought to be a treat.  <i>Have fun, Leader</i>!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=vain,Finally shedding all your little things.  That's good...women are much cuter unencumbered.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=seductive,I can't get over how cute you are...especially without all that extra padding!  Just a tiny little thing with gorgeous blue hair on top.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=smug,I wonder if you could pull off a dress like mine, Sei.  You're so preoccupied with all that silly armor and padding...why wear it?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=vain,What is it you do again that requires all this nonsense on your person?  You should wear something <i>sexy</i>!
5-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:meia=bored,Sorry I said anything, Meia.  You're a party animal next to these Earth women.
5-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:meia=bored,You'd think the sight of Mejare's most beautiful woman would inspire some bolder stripping.  Apparently not.
5-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:meia=angry,My dress is off, OK?  I'm done teasing.  <i>Live a little</i>.
5-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:meia=sad,Oh, ~name~...you're breaking my heart.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=teasing,I've got my eye on you, Miss Pixie...because my ears are totally confused when you talk.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=vain,Little Miss Pixie must think she's clever, saying all these things that go over my poor foreigner head.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=seductive,Have some sympathy for this poor alien woman, Kyu.  You're always saying things only an Earth woman would understand.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=vain,Feel free to start making sense for <i>everyone</i>, Miss Pixie.  Think of the poor aliens in your presence when you speak.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=angry,Seriously, what just happened?  You can't just shapeshift like that and act like nothing happened!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=confused,Are you even a woman?  Or an Earthling?  Are you some kind of alien shapeshifter?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=sad,<i>I'm so confused</i>.  Are you a shapeshifting alien?  Is this what Earth women are capable of?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=awkward,I had no idea Earth genetics were so...<i>advanced</i>.  Just changing your hair color on a whim.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,Oh, please.  All this titilating nudity is enough excitement for one evening.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,As if I need to drink to have fun when there's full-blown Earth nudity in our midst!  <i>I resent your implication</i>.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,Hey, Misato can drink alone.  <i>I</i> only drink when I know my darling Barnette is there to take care of me.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:meia=thinking,Hey now, I'm tall!  I can handle at least...uh...a few beers, give or take.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Oh, dear.  Now you've done it, Rinkah...Meia <i>loves</i> women with muscles.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=interested,Just try to ride this out, honey.  Meia acts icy, but those muscles melt her right down like nobody's business.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Don't believe her cover stories, Rinkah.  Meia doesn't want your muscles...she wants <i>you</i>.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,Heehee!  Meia tends to get like this around particularly <i>fit</i> women, if you follow.  Don't mind her desperate advances.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:4=bored,For how excited you are to strip...I'm not sure I want to see what lies underneath.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:4=angry,As if we want to see your nasty little twig body.  You keep going on about how you're just a public plaything!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:4=frustrated,Oh, good, you're almost out.  Maybe then you can lose and leave and stop freaking me out.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:4=annoyed,Whatever ocean <i>you're</i> swimming in, I bet the fish are all dead.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2a=awkward,Uh...ew.  That's kind of ratty, actually.  But you've got more, right?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2a=confused,...Now you kind of smell salty.  Don't you have something else?  Something <i>nicer</i>?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2a=confused,...I have no clue what that is.  Kind of looks like <i>men's</i> clothing...all tattered and gross.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2a=confused,...That's certainly a lot of extra stuff.  But somehow it just ends up looking like rags, whatever it is.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=confused,Me-<i>ow</i>!  Heeheehee--wait, you're serious?  Like, the animal, a cat?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=confused,...Earth girls can have <i>cat</i> ears?  Like, the cats I see in zoos?  How?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=confused,...You, uh, going to explain this to me?  I'm still shaky on what a <i>cat</i> is, much less a "Faunus."
5-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=frustrated,...Listen, I'm not from Earth.  You can't expect me to understand why you have cat ears...or why you've been hiding them.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1=vain,<i>Ohoho</i>.  So your sword is <i>divine</i>, is it?  I guess that blows my silly little fashion item out of the water.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1=vain,If that thing's really so divine, maybe you should keep it on.  <i>Who knows what could happen here</i>?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1=teasing,Seems a little silly bringing a <i>divine</i> sword to this seedy little dump.  Does it know its owner is dirtying herself?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1=seductive,<i>Divine</i>, hm?  I like your style, honey...sword, green hair, and the favor of the gods.  If it's true.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=interested,Oh, you're back.  Try not to make a habit of that, dearie...it's not very intimidating.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=confused,...Well, at least you came back.  Serously, did a man kill your family or something?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=teasing,Listen, honey, you ought to come my my home planet sometime.  It's nothing but women...and we make a habit of shooting nasty men.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=vain,You have <i>nothing</i> to be scared of, honey.  I've fought the toughest, burliest men around and come out on top!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:leela,targetStage:1=teasing,Ooh, what's <i>that</i> thing?  A men's gun fused with a woman's?  Not as unlikely as you might think.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:leela,targetStage:1=vain,Is that a men's gun that shoots lasers?  Listen, honey...combining male and female weapons is par for the course on the Nirvana.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=shocked,I-I don't even know what to say.  You <i>are</i> Meia, right?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=shocked,You're Meia, right?  I didn't lose her in the crowd for some blue-haired Earth woman with no attachment to her eyepiece?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=awkward,Meia, I...this is so unlike you.  They don't know it, but that <i>does</i> match me.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=excited,<i>No!  Please!  I</i>--I--what?  Omigosh, that's <i>fantastic</i>!  Sorry I teased you!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=excited,...Oh my God!  You just changed your <i>whole</i> outfit?  That's spectacular!  Sorry about those skin comments.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=excited,Omigosh!  How--<i>how'd you do that</i>?  Do it again!  I want to see more outfits!  Who cares if your skin's blue?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=excited,Wha--what'd you just do?  <i>How</i>?  Tell me everything!  I'm sorry I made fun of your skin color!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:1=interested,OK, sure.  Just drop all pretenses. why don't you?  You're moving too fast with this.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:1=smug,You're a bigger tease than I am.  Hey, make them <i>work</i> for it.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:1=teasing,Hey, that little peek was enough.  You're going to ruin the surprise!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:1=vain,Come now, Velma, drag it out a bit!  You just got started...leave a little to the imagination.

-3-male_removing_accessory=angry,Oh, give it a <i>rest</i>!
-3-male_removing_accessory=frustrated,You're such a pain, ~name~.  Is it too much to ask for to see your tube?  Maybe collect some seed while I'm at it?
-3-male_removing_accessory=bored,I was planning on seeing a man's tube...I was <i>not</i> planning on men being any good at cards.
-3-male_removing_accessory=annoyed,I don't need to come back to this place.  Maybe I'll just show you what I can do with that rapier.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=awkward,...Wait, one of you is a <i>man</i>?  But--you--I...<i>wow</i>.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=confused,...Wait, I'm confused.  Men and women don't look <i>that</i> close.  Are you sure you're a man?
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=awkward,...Oh.  I really thought I was getting good at telling men and women apart...
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=confused,...Wait, you're a <i>man</i>?  I mean, Duero wears his hair long, and Meia's is short, so I don't assume anything there...
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=confused,...Wait, you're a <i>man</i>?  Aren't men...<i>tall</i>?  And, you know, <i>masculine</i>?
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=confused,...Oh, you're a man.  Well, that's disappointing.  What's the word for this?  <i>Han-droggo-niss</i> or something?
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=confused,...Huh.  You're a man.  I guess I can work with this, but <i>wow</i>.  You really had me fooled...
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=bored,...Oh.  Well, this wouldn't be the <i>first</i> time a man fooled me into thinking he's a woman, but <i>that</i> was on purpose...
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:1=laughing,Something the matter, Mr. Muscle?  You look so <i>dreadfully</i> uncomfortable.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:1=vain,Am I being distracting, Mr. Muscle?  Well, you're guilty of it yourself, with that hunky body of yours.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:1=seductive,Am I drawing your eyes, honey?  Well you started it--how can I <i>not</i> stare at all those muscles of yours?
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:1=teasing,See something you like, dearie?  You seem so <i>uncomfortable</i> around women for an Earth man--I guess you've never seen one like me!
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=seductive,<i>There</i> you go.  Fully sighted like the rest of us!  I don't buy that nonsense about it being a visor...can I see it?
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=teasing,If that thing's really a visor, toss it over here.  If you get to cheat, why can't I see how?
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=teasing,You're not afraid to let a simple human woman see what advantages you had, right?  Give it here.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=interested,I'm calling your bluff on that thing being a visor.  I think you're some weird fetish-man who's been peeking at the cards underneath it.  Can I see?
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=confused,...Are you sure, Meia?  I mean, B.C. fooled <i>you</i>, too.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,...Wait, really?  Well, wouldn't be the first time, although poor Corrin here seems to have fooled us by <i>accident</i>.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=awkward,...Uh...good eye, Meia.  Well, this is awkward.  Sorry, Miss--Mister.  You're still pretty cute...for a man.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=confused,...Meia, don't mess with me.  Are you <i>sure</i>?  I mean, look at her--him.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=interested,Oh, I see.  It's thin enough to see through, and you just like messing with people?
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=vain,Ah, I see--it's thin fabric.  Men and their deceitful ways, thinking they could pull one over on me!
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=interested,Could've fooled me, with that hand you were rocking.  Still, I guess the fabric's thin enough to see, and you just like playing pretend.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=teasing,So you're just a fan of the dungeon look, and the blindfold's thin enough to see through?  Nice try fooling Jura Basil Elden.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=annoyed,<i>Oho</i>.  So when <i>I</i> take off my sword, it's a lame first impression.  But not lame enough to not <i>copy</i>.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=vain,<i>Oh.  Mm-hm</i>.  Taking off your weapon--<i>I wonder where he got that idea</i>?
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=laughing,I didn't realize men were such fabulous hypocrites, Trigger Finger.  But at least you're not too scared to be disarmed around me.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=vain,<i>Removing a sword, eh</i>?  And here I thought men were the <i>honorable</i> sex.  But no, you're content to emulate what you criticize.
-3-male_removed_accessory=bored,You would think living around women would teach Earth men how to have fun.  But no, apparently not.
-3-male_removed_accessory=laughing,Wouldn't you rather strip nude and masturbate to me?  I mean, really.
-3-male_removed_accessory=annoyed,Men really <i>are</i> competitive.  I'm <i>right</i> here, who cares about the cards anymore?
-3-male_removed_accessory=frustrated,It's nothing but competition with you men, honestly.  Work together for once.
-3-male_removed_accessory=frustrated,This is more annoying than when Pyoro is talking but doesn't want my opinion.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=laughing,Hey, what <i>that</i> supposed to mean, Gearbox?  What Barnette and I do in private is none of your business.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=vain,Oh, please.  I'm the <i>giver</i> in my relationship...<i>Barnette</i> would get to wear the blindfold.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=teasing,<i>Oho</i>!  And Little Dungeon Bot shows some spunk.  You're getting more human all the time...<i>maybe we could use that blindfold</i>.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=teasing,Ha!  About time you manned up and talked back to me.  But to be honest, <i>Barnette's</i> usually wearing the blindfold.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=teasing,Well then, don't think I won't tease you!  It'll just be in a different sort of way...
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=laughing,A man who looks like a woman might be <i>exactly</i> the kind of seed I need...wouldn't want my children all hairy and gross.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=seductive,OK.  Well, nothing I can't work with!  Now you're cute in a completely different sort of way, <i>Mister</i> Corrin.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=vain,Don't feel too bad about it, then.  Women's bodies are so much smoother and luscious anyway...you should strive to emulate us.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=shocked,So why do you two look the same?  ...You're the same <i>person</i>?  But--how's that possible?
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=excited,W-wait, you're the <i>male</i> version of her?  Where's the male version of <i>me</i>?  I bet he's <i>handsome</i>!
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=vain,Oh, wow, you're the same person, but the opposite sex?  Where's the male <i>me</i>?  Tall, gorgeous--and <i>blond</i>!
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=thinking,T-this is really incredible.  Are there male versions of <i>every</i> woman I know?  I wonder if male Barnette is handsome...
-3-female_removing_accessory=angry,Oh, come <i>on</i> already!  Look at how <i>I</i> am!
-3-female_removing_accessory=annoyed,Hey, <i>I'm</i> already naked.  You're not topping <i>that</i> reveal.
-3-female_removing_accessory=annoyed,Maybe I should remind you that I'm a pirate, and operate outside the law.  Give me a reason to still follow it.
-3-female_removing_accessory=angry,Earth women's accessories are <i>not</i> worth this frustration.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:7=sad,<i>So long, Ang</i>--oh.  Well, I guess that counts.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:7=sad,<i>Awww</i>!  And here I thought I had beaten you.  But no, you proved too wily for me.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:7=vain,Damn Earth girls and their tricks.  <i>Who would do that, bring a bunch of accessories to a strip poker game</i>?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:7=smug,My pilot's eyes should've spotted that, but you snuck right past me--and yourself, even.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0=teasing,You got that idea from <i>me</i>, you little cheat!  Once again the crafty Mejarian paves the way for the rest of womankind.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0=smug,<i>My, my, Lyn</i>.  <i>Bending the rules by removing a weapon?</i>  The <i>audacity</i>.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0=teasing,You're just copying what I came up with before...but you've got Barnette's cute green hair, so I'll let it slide.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0=laughing,I'd teach you a thing or two with my rapier for copying me like this, but, well, I threw it away.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Of course she does, honey!  She just refuses to show it, which is why I drag her to places like this.  She only ever smiles with Ezra's baby.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=stretching,Why do you think I brought her here, Miss Polka-dot?  You need <i>steam</i> to melt all that ice of hers...or a baby.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=seductive,Oh, my Leader is an absolute <i>sweetheart</i>, Miss Accent.  You should see her with Ezra's little baby!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Meia's the sweetest girl you'll ever meet, Miss Ladybug...but she only shows it when she's making our crewmate's baby laugh.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=seductive,Meia just doesn't like crowds or strangers, that's all.  She thinks she's got to be all dignified.  But see how she acts with a baby!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=bored,<i>Management</i>?  What is <i>up</i> with this girl?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=confused,...I'm totally lost.  There's <i>rules</i> about what you can strip?  They didn't tell me any rules.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=confused,...Honey, did the bouncer clock you upside the head before you came in?  I'm not teasing, I'm dead serious.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=frustrated,I...<i>what</i>?  <i>Management</i>?  Yeah, you could <i>use</i> a little management, that's for sure.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:1=interested,And what do we have here?  Miserable old Miss Brunette is admitting she's no better than the rest of us?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:1=laughing,Hey, Miss Princess.  You don't mind if this pirate holds onto that tiara, do you?  Just for a little <i>inspection</i>?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:1=teasing,Don't stop there, Miss Princess.  Nothing satisfies a pirate quite like watching nobles stripped down to nothing at all.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:1=laughing,Take away her tiara and she's a brunette in a dress.  Take away her dress...and I hope her butt is cute.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=smug,You going to throw up, sweetie?  Looks like it...well, don't face <i>me</i> when it happens.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=laughing,Can we get a janitor over here?  This girl's about to pee herself.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=annoyed,Jeez, this girl's gonna spend the evening sobbing.  Can't we just tell her to leave?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=bored,You're no fun.  You're such a head case that I can't even tease you.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=laughing,...Well, that's one down.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=interested,...I really thought Earth girls handled men better than anyone.  I wanted to see her naked, too.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=smug,...That girl really needed some time on Mejare to toughen her up.  Men are giant pushovers.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=bored,Should've known we wouldn't all make it through this without bailing.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=smug,Well, I mean, if <i>anyone</i> was going to chicken out, it was going to be her.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=confused,...Seriously, do you have <i>any</i> control over this?  Even a little?  Or is it all luck?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=confused,...Talk about living life up to chance, by the way.  This is so weird...and I'm a pilot.  I've <i>seen</i> weird.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=stretching,There she goes with another vortex.  Life is just a game of luck to our little fashionista here.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=vain,Too bad this isn't the spectacle it used to be.  But the random chance <i>does</i> keep it interesting!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:3=smug,And at last the trumped-up girlie removes the only thing maintaining her arrogance.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:3=teasing,Hey, Princess...you can't strip what makes <i>me</i> beautiful.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:3=smug,<i>Royals</i>...talk about jewelry for jewelry's sake.  It's supposed to <i>improve</i> your looks, not create them.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:3=teasing,Thaaaank <i>you</i>!  Now the property of Magno Vivan's pirates, little Miss Princess!  So sorry.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=teasing,<i>Atta girl</i>!  Now show me something magical!  ...Besides this.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=vain,These vortices are pretty fantastic, but it's the end result I care about.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=seductive,You really are something else.  I've already grown accustomed to your magic vortices!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=seductive,All that magic, but all I care about is the outfit waiting for me.  I never thought I'd meet someone like you!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=excited,Yes!  <i>Yes</i>!  Go for it!  Roll that die!  Can I have one?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=excited,You are so <i>cool</i>, Vriska!  Where can I get one of those things?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=excited,So it's that die that does it for you?  Can I have one?  I want to switch my outfit on the fly!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=teasing,Where'd you get that die?  I don't want to have to steal <i>yours</i>, you know!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>Aaack!  No!  Wait!  I'm too young to die!  Too beautiful</i>!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>Eek!  Noooo!  Wait!  I'll give you whatever you want</i>!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>Ack!  The Harvest!  I should've known this was a trap</i>!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>Eeeeek!  No!  Please!  I have a girlfriend</i>!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:0=interested,You're, uh, a little on display there, honey.  Unless that sort of thing excites you.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:0=laughing,Oh, please.  You're flashing us on purpose, aren't you?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:0=teasing,Don't act like that flash was an accident, dearie.  I know your type...nerdy little Parfet is a freak, too.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:0=smug,Showing off the underwear early?  Should've pegged you as the falsely-modest type.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=excited,...So, uh, Ochako.  You're floating.  ...Are you going to explain that?  Because it's <i>incredible</i>!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=excited,Wait--are you--omigosh, Ochako, you can <i>float</i>?  That's so <i>cool</i>!  How are you doing that?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=excited,Omigosh!  <i>Omigosh</i>!  Ochako!  You can just <i>float</i> like that?  I'd have been doing it all game if I could <i>float</i>!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=excited,...OK.  Ochako.  You're...<i>levitating</i>.  And that is so <i>cool</i>!  What's your secret?  Can <i>I</i> learn to float?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=laughing,<i>Heeheehee</i>!  Oh, so you <i>are</i> the embarrassed type!  I was just calling you sexy, honey.  Relax.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey, when a woman compliments your figure, you say "Thanks, you too."  Talk about <i>rude</i>.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=smug,I call you sexy enough to rock a bodysuit, and you get all flustered and offended.  Earth woman are so scared of each other.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=seductive,What?  That was <i>complimentary</i>, silly!  That suit is doing all <i>sorts</i> of favors for your hips.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=seductive,There you go!  Take off that hemet and show the world the cute face to match your sexy figure.  I wasn't teasing you before.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=stretching,Just a <i>little</i> nervous?  Damn...I guess I'm too gorgeous to be scary.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=laughing,Nervous?  I was really trying to scare you--I guess you're already falling in love with me.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=vain,I was hoping for a better reaction than that.  Maybe you're tougher than you look--or I'm just that lovable!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=teasing,Just trying to break you in, dear.  You look positively miserable--I wanted to scare you into having fun!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:1=smug,<i>Dear, dear</i>.  Removing your fancy jewelry so readily?  Don't you care about that precious ttle of yours?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:1=teasing,Blonde women are always favorites of mine...even better, you're removing that ridiculous crown early.  Come have some fun with us commoners.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:1=interested,No sense keeping it on long, right?  You're already lowering yourself by playing this, anyway.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:1=teasing,Make the gown next to go, Miss Princess.  I think you'll find how fun we dirty common folk can be.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=teasing,<i>Oh, am I being too forward</i>?  My apologies.  Just know you'd have your pick of the bunch over there.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=seductive,Oh, sorry, I got carried away there.  But you're still a beautiful, musclebound woman!  That's a plus anywhere.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=seductive,Maybe that was a little forward of me.  But Mejarians would love you!  I wonder if men feel the same.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=teasing,Well, just know how in-demand you are on Mejare...if these bumbling Earth men start giving you the cold shoulder.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:0=seductive,<i>Heeheehee!  Such a tease, Miss Valentine</i>!  You can deny it all you want, but I see myself written all over you.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:0=vain,It's OK to want to distance yourself from me, dear.  I am, after all, taller and more beautiful.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:0=smug,Why deny the similarities, darling?  Women across Mejare <i>wish</i> they could be mentioned alongside Jura Basil Elden.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:0=teasing,What, too proud to admit we're alike?  <i>Afraid I do your image better than you</i>?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=shocked,O-oh, are you putting the guns down?  I-I promise I won't touch them.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=awkward,<i>(Oh, thank God...)</i>  Er, Revy, good choice there.  Good choice.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=awkward,Hey, uh, now that you're disarmed, try to relax a little, would you?  Instead of yelling at us.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=sad,I was <i>hoping</i> tonight wouldn't end with someone getting shot.  Don't we all just want to see each other naked?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:5=angry,Wha--<i>oh, goddamnit!  Just take things off in a proper order</i>!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:5=angry,Hey, I came here to see some Earth nudity!  I don't appreciate being toyed around with!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:5=annoyed,Yeah, yeah, hotshot.  Real clever.  You definitely played this game and <i>didn't</i> want people to see you naked.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:5=bored,This must be how people feel around <i>me</i>.  Clinging to accessories...at least <i>I</i> have a body worth teasing.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:5=annoyed,I <i>hate it</i> when people bounce around with the importance of what they take off.  Let the audience know what to expect!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:3=interested,Sure you don't want to cling to that, dearie?  It <i>is</i> what marks as you as better than the rest of us.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:3=vain,I guess I can understand losing that, even as a princess.  It'll let your blonde hair flow free and unencumbered!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:3=seductive,Miss Princess dropping her overinflated jewelry?  Oh, I forgot--you're blonde, so you're not so bad.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:3=teasing,That's it, honey.  Lower yourself to the level of us dirty commoners.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=laughing,...Wow, I was just kidding.  You really <i>are</i> a sex fairy, just presenting like that.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=interested,Honey, you can't just <i>present</i> like that right from the get-go.  The audience can't get what they want until the grand finale.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=smug,Seems Earth girls overdo it as usual.  What kind of tease would I be if just spread my legs right here and now?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=teasing,Easy there, hot stuff.  You're already wearing so little--no need to spoil what surprises you <i>have</i>.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1=shocked,And a <i>Bless You</i> to--to...<i>where'd Launch go</i>?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1=confused,...That's, uh, a pretty hard sneeze.  Didn't realize it could turn your hair blue.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1=awkward,...Uh...is this an Earth thing, or would <i>my</i> hair turn blue if I sneezed too hard?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1=shocked,...<i>Launch?  Where'd the blonde girl go</i>?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=bored,It's refreshing to know you won't acknowledge anything I say.  Real liberating.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=awkward,...Look, I know I tease a lot, but I'm just having fun.  Nothing about <i>this</i> is fun.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=frustrated,Talk about a lost cause.  She won't even acknowledge me.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=teasing,<i>Hey, Ocean Girl.  If you're being held against your will, blink twice.  I'm a pirate, I understand</i>.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=seductive,<i>Oooh</i>!  That sounded so <i>cute</i>, honey, whatever it was!  What does that mean?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=seductive,<i>Teeheehee</i>!  I don't know what you said, but your home language sounds so silky smooth and romantic!  What's it mean?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=seductive,Ooh, what's <i>that</i> mean, dear?  Because it sounded like the most romantic thing I've ever heard!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=excited,Omigosh, that's so <i>romantic</i>-sounding!  What does it mean?  I want to talk like that!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=confused,...Did I miss something?  Can't we take off whatever we want?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=confused,...Is there really a nebulous <i>management</i> that's got guns to our heads if we don't strip how they want?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=confused,...Who exactly is holding a gun to your head and making you do this?  Hey, are you listening?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=confused,...Why do you have to take off your shoes next?  I mean, you <i>should</i>, but apparently you <i>have</i> to?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,<i>Heeheehee</i>!  Oh, you're hopelessly in love now!  This is so <i>cute</i>!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,I <i>knew</i> we'd meet a girl here who was your type--and with all these hormones flowing, you'd <i>have</i> to break your stoicism eventually.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Do you hear that, Chunners?  It's the sound of ice melting nearby.  You've lit a fire in her heart.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,Go on, Meia, ask her out.  You both know how an exercise session is going to end.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=shocked,...Who are you, and what have you done with Meia?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=awkward,...Uh...we're supposed to be having <i>fun</i>, Meia.  Not dredging up painful memories.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=shocked,I...I...<i>why</i>?  You don't have to, Meia...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=awkward,...Hey, listen, I know I'm naked, but I'm not saying you should have to take <i>that</i> off.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=awkward,...I was just teasing.  That's way more than my whole outfit...even if they don't know it.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=teasing,Hey, Miss Military--where'd you get all that beer?  Throw some this way, let's have fun!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=vain,Just chugging it down, huh, Miss Military?  <i>Mejarians</i> are so much more tasteful...but give me some, if you don't mind.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=smug,I hope you brought enough booze for <i>everyone</i>, Misato.  It's not nice to hoard.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=stretching,I thought I smelled beer...more of a rum woman myself, but when on Earth, drink as the classless Earth girls drink.
-3-female_removed_accessory=bored,Jeez, at this rate, I'll have to invite Meia over here to bring some <i>fun</i> to the evening.
-3-female_removed_accessory=annoyed,Hey, ~name~, I have a girlfriend.  You're gonna have to work harder to hold my attention.
-3-female_removed_accessory=frustrated,...Hit me, Dealer.  Not with cards, I mean <i>actually</i> hit me.
-3-female_removed_accessory=frustrated,Good thing I've done my part to put the "strip" in this game.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4b=vain,Bare midriff?  My dress brings me pretty close to that...but <i>Dita's</i> the girl who wears it best!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4b=seductive,Ooh, my crewmate Dita dresses like that!  She's such a naive little thing, even with her midriff exposed all sexy-like.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4b=vain,I know a sweet young girl who dresses like that!  Dita's her name--she's so naive.  Barely even notices her exposed belly.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4b=smug,Yeah, Dita shows off her belly too.  I can't tell if she's just too naive to know how sexy she's being or just doesn't care.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2b=seductive,Ohhh, that's cute!  Now you're all dressed up like a maid--which Mejare frowns upon, but not as much as it does pirates.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2b=vain,Maid outfits are so adorable!  I'd dress up my girlfriend in one...if I could afford one.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2b=excited,Ohh, I wish I had something as cute as that!  Barnette and I could do a little roleplay, you know, pretend we have money.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2b=teasing,Life's tough for a Mejarian pirate...but the alternative is to be a maid for some rich old hag.  No thanks!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2c=seductive,Oh, I see!  These must be Earth women's street clothes, right?  You're so considerate!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2c=smug,Starting off simple, huh?  Just basic Earth street clothes on display?  I get it.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2c=smug,Jacket and jeans?  Seen it--but I guess street clothes on Earth don't <i>have</i> to be all that different.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2c=teasing,Earth's street clothes sticking to the familiars, eh?  Mejarians tend to aim a little <i>tighter</i>.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3a=seductive,Ooh, a sexy red-and-black!  I like your style, Vriska--and it clashes with your skin!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3a=teasing,Nothing like blood-red and shadow-black to get the heart beating.  Plus, those bullets get it going even faster!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3a=vain,Talk about making my heart jump.  Red, black, and bullets on the side!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3a=vain,I wish <i>I</i> owned something red...and this dress is the closest thing to black.  <i>A pirate's problems</i>!
-3-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:meia=bored,Hey, Meia, feel like teaching these Earth girls how to have <i>fun</i>?  You're better at it than <i>they</i> are.
-3-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:meia=annoyed,Hey, ~name~, I have a girlfriend.  You're gonna have to work harder to hold my attention.
-3-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:meia=frustrated,...Hit me, Dealer.  Not with cards, I mean <i>actually</i> hit me.
-3-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:meia=frustrated,Good thing I've done my part to put the "strip" in this game.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1=vain,<i>Ohoho</i>.  So your sword is <i>divine</i>, is it?  I guess that blows my silly little fashion item out of the water.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1=vain,If that thing's really so divine, maybe you should keep it on.  <i>Who knows what could happen here</i>?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1=teasing,Seems a little silly bringing a <i>divine</i> sword to this seedy little dump.  Does it know its owner is dirtying herself?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1=seductive,<i>Divine</i>, hm?  I like your style, honey...sword, green hair, and the favor of the gods.  If it's true.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=teasing,I've got my eye on you, Miss Pixie...because my ears are totally confused when you talk.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=vain,Little Miss Pixie must think she's clever, saying all these things that go over my poor foreigner head.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=seductive,Have some sympathy for this poor alien woman, Kyu.  You're always saying things only an Earth woman would understand.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=vain,Feel free to start making sense for <i>everyone</i>, Miss Pixie.  Think of the poor aliens in your presence when you speak.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=smug,Getting all liquored up, then?  Can't say you have the height for it.  Is this how you pick up men?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=interested,So is this how Earth girls spend a weekend?  Getting sloppy-drunk and falling on top of strange men?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=seductive,Oh, Sei, you're so cute!  Don't tell me you're just going to get sloshed and let some beastly man ravish you this evening.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=vain,Is this really what you Earth women do?  Get drunk and fondle strange men?  <i>Mejarians</i> are hopeless romantics.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3b=seductive,You're getting sexier all the time, cutie!  I like leaving my shoulders bare, too...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3b=vain,<i>Now</i> you're speaking my language!  A woman's shoulders should be as free as space is vast.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3b=vain,As long as the universe is expanding, a woman's shoulders should be unmasked to see it happen.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3b=seductive,<i>Exactly</i> what I would go for, with those uncovered shoulders.  I feel like you already know me so well, Vriska!
-3-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=smug,Still shaky on the game's rules, Miss Pixie?  You don't <i>have</i> to jump straight to be big-name items.
-3-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=interested,Jeez, Kyu, settle down.  What kind of awful tease would jump straight to nudity?  You've got to keep them guessing.
-3-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=laughing,Hey, I know <i>you're</i> not shy about it, but do try to understand why these poor Earth people might be ashamed.
-3-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=vain,I don't get it either, Kyu, but don't get all mad.  Earth people just tend to hate their own bodies.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=sad,I...I'm sorry, Meia.  You can put it back on.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=awkward,I'm serious, don't take that off.  You don't have to.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=awkward,Where's this coming from, Meia?  You can leave it on, really.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=confused,I know these Earth people will ask questions, but you can leave that on.  They don't know any better.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a=laughing,Oho!  I <i>knew</i> you weren't so above it all!  And what a shift--bodysuits are pretty sexy.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a=laughing,Heeheehee!  I think the die was getting annoyed at you hiding your figure!  Go on, show off your hips!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a=interested,Going to do a little dance, Vriska?  Show off that figure a little?  Because that adorable polka-dotted suit is giving you a head start.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a=seductive,That's positively <i>adorable</i>, Vriska!  Polka-dots <i>and</i> a revealing shape.  Now it's <i>Mejarian</i> fashion!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=angry,Seriously, what just happened?  You can't just shapeshift like that and act like nothing happened!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=confused,Are you even a woman?  Or an Earthling?  Are you some kind of alien shapeshifter?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=sad,<i>I'm so confused</i>.  Are you a shapeshifting alien?  Is this what Earth women are capable of?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=awkward,I had no idea Earth genetics were so...<i>advanced</i>.  Just changing your hair color on a whim.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=excited,<i>No!  Please!  I</i>--I--what?  Omigosh, that's <i>fantastic</i>!  Sorry I teased you!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=excited,...Oh my God!  You just changed your <i>whole</i> outfit?  That's spectacular!  Sorry about those skin comments.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=excited,Omigosh!  How--<i>how'd you do that</i>?  Do it again!  I want to see more outfits!  Who cares if your skin's blue?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=excited,Wha--what'd you just do?  <i>How</i>?  Tell me everything!  I'm sorry I made fun of your skin color!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=vain,Finally shedding all your little things.  That's good...women are much cuter unencumbered.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=seductive,I can't get over how cute you are...especially without all that extra padding!  Just a tiny little thing with gorgeous blue hair on top.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=smug,I wonder if you could pull off a dress like mine, Sei.  You're so preoccupied with all that silly armor and padding...why wear it?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=vain,What is it you do again that requires all this nonsense on your person?  You should wear something <i>sexy</i>!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:leela,targetStage:1=teasing,Ooh, what's <i>that</i> thing?  A men's gun fused with a woman's?  Not as unlikely as you might think.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:leela,targetStage:1=vain,Is that a men's gun that shoots lasers?  Listen, honey...combining male and female weapons is par for the course on the Nirvana.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3c=seductive,Oh, I see!  These must be Earth women's street clothes, right?  You're so considerate!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3c=smug,Going for something simple, huh?  Just basic Earth street clothes on display?  I get it.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3c=smug,Jacket and jeans?  Seen it--but I guess street clothes on Earth don't <i>have</i> to be all that different.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3c=teasing,Earth's street clothes sticking to the familiars, eh?  Mejarians tend to aim a little <i>tighter</i>.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=frustrated,Not to be rude, but, uh...<i>you've totally got a screw loose</i>.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=confused,...Is this what I sound like?  I just think flirting is fun...this girl's <i>nuts</i>.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=bored,...Maybe I should stop flirting so much.  If <i>this</i> girl is the end result, that is.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=bored,...Does sex with men do this to you?  Because this girl's <i>really</i> starting to freak me out.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,marker:fama_and_oma=confused,...Uh...what's a grandfather?  Like a grand-Fama?  It's mostly the "father" part I'm confused over.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1=awkward,That's, uh, a lot of family history.  You lost me at "father," whatever <i>that</i> means.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,marker:fama_and_oma=confused,...OK, I know what "grand" means, but what's a "father"?  Is that some weird Earth term for Omas?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1=frustrated,Wait, wait, stop, forget the makeup.  Now I'm confused as to what a "father" is, though apparently they're grand.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:1=interested,OK, sure.  Just drop all pretenses. why don't you?  You're moving too fast with this.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:1=smug,You're a bigger tease than I am.  Hey, make them <i>work</i> for it.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:1=teasing,Hey, that little peek was enough.  You're going to ruin the surprise!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:1=vain,Come now, Velma, drag it out a bit!  You just got started...leave a little to the imagination.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2a=awkward,Uh...ew.  That's kind of ratty, actually.  But you've got more, right?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2a=confused,...Now you kind of smell salty.  Don't you have something else?  Something <i>nicer</i>?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2a=confused,...I have no clue what that is.  Kind of looks like <i>men's</i> clothing...all tattered and gross.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2a=confused,...That's certainly a lot of extra stuff.  But somehow it just ends up looking like rags, whatever it is.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=interested,Oh, you're back.  Try not to make a habit of that, dearie...it's not very intimidating.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=confused,...Well, at least you came back.  Serously, did a man kill your family or something?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=teasing,Listen, honey, you ought to come my my home planet sometime.  It's nothing but women...and we make a habit of shooting nasty men.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=vain,You have <i>nothing</i> to be scared of, honey.  I've fought the toughest, burliest men around and come out on top!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Oh, dear.  Now you've done it, Rinkah...Meia <i>loves</i> women with muscles.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=interested,Just try to ride this out, honey.  Meia acts icy, but those muscles melt her right down like nobody's business.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Don't believe her cover stories, Rinkah.  Meia doesn't want your muscles...she wants <i>you</i>.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,Heehee!  Meia tends to get like this around particularly <i>fit</i> women, if you follow.  Don't mind her desperate advances.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=confused,Me-<i>ow</i>!  Heeheehee--wait, you're serious?  Like, the animal, a cat?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=confused,...Earth girls can have <i>cat</i> ears?  Like, the cats I see in zoos?  How?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=confused,...You, uh, going to explain this to me?  I'm still shaky on what a <i>cat</i> is, much less a "Faunus."
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=frustrated,...Listen, I'm not from Earth.  You can't expect me to understand why you have cat ears...or why you've been hiding them.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,Oh, please.  All this titilating nudity is enough excitement for one evening.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,As if I need to drink to have fun when there's full-blown Earth nudity in our midst!  <i>I resent your implication</i>.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,Hey, Misato can drink alone.  <i>I</i> only drink when I know my darling Barnette is there to take care of me.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:meia=thinking,Hey now, I'm tall!  I can handle at least...uh...a few beers, give or take.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:6=angry,What do you mean, <i>not fun</i>?  The fun is starting off with some teasing and then revealing your beautiful body!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:6=vain,<i>Hmph</i>.  It would seem <i>I'm</i> the only proper seductress around here, properly building up to nudity like a lady.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:6=bored,There's a right way and a wrong way to strip, and you're starting to fall into the wrong way.  It needs to escalate!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:6=smug,<i>Well</i>.  I'd never make it as a model if I deflated the excitement like you do.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2=laughing,Knowing what I do about Earth, you <i>do</i> have plenty of reasons to drink.  So get to it, Miss Military.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2=stretching,Isn't Earth devastated where you come from?  Same here, honey...bottoms up, drink it all away.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2=interested,The world's a terrifying place...especially where you come from, I hear.  So don't feel bad about your little booze habit.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2=interested,What's all the beer for, honey?  Depressed about losing your boots, or about this "Second Impact" I keep hearing of?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,Don't ask questions you don't want the answer to, Meia.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=stretching,This is why I mostly stick to asking about men and fashion.  See what happens?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=interested,See, Meia?  Don't encourage people to discuss things you don't care about.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Oh, <i>this</i> ought to be a treat.  <i>Have fun, Leader</i>!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=seductive,You're quite the fit little specimen, Rinkah.  I know a certain squadron leader who'd fall head-over-heels for you...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=teasing,I know a woman who loves muscles very much, Rinkah...you'd put her in a tizzy.  Do Earth women like each other in that way?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=seductive,Mind if I play a little matchmaker?  I brought my boss here...and she <i>loves</i> muscles on a woman, even if she won't admit it.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=seductive,You into women, sweetheart?  Because I know a certain blue-haired ice queen who would <i>totally</i> fall for those abs of yours.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=vain,Talk about a terrestial booze-a-thon.  Oh, well, I've got the height to drink with the best of them!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=smug,I get that this place is a bar, but damn, ladies, at least <i>pretend</i> you're trying to win.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=interested,So I get this place has a no-touching rule, but you two aren't really disguising how you're planning to take some of us home afterward.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=laughing,I <i>do</i> love drinking, but I don't think I could keep up with you two.  I guess living around men forces you to drown your sorrows.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4c=laughing,Hah!  Going for <i>my</i> look, are you?  Yeah, cleavage tends to get people to do what you want.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4c=laughing,Feeling a little breezy, honey?  Don't worry, you'll get used to it--I did.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4c=laughing,Pfft!  How do you like <i>my</i> style, then?  I'm flattered you had this on the backburner, sweetie.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4c=vain,Doesn't the breeze feel good between your breasts?  It always perks me up when I'm down.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:4=bored,For how excited you are to strip...I'm not sure I want to see what lies underneath.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:4=angry,As if we want to see your nasty little twig body.  You keep going on about how you're just a public plaything!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:4=frustrated,Oh, good, you're almost out.  Maybe then you can lose and leave and stop freaking me out.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:4=annoyed,Whatever ocean <i>you're</i> swimming in, I bet the fish are all dead.

-2-male_removing_accessory=bored,Oh, come <i>on</i>!  Let me see something good!  I'm sorry I teased you!
-2-male_removing_accessory=frustrated,<i>Really</i>?  You won't let me see your tube, even when I'm like this?
-2-male_removing_accessory=bored,...Unyielding to the end.  Lighten up, for goodness' sake.
-2-male_removing_accessory=annoyed,...Should I spread my legs <i>wider</i> or something?
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=seductive,<i>There</i> you go.  Fully sighted like the rest of us!  I don't buy that nonsense about it being a visor...can I see it?
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=teasing,If that thing's really a visor, toss it over here.  If you get to cheat, why can't I see how?
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=teasing,You're not afraid to let a simple human woman see what advantages you had, right?  Give it here.
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=interested,I'm calling your bluff on that thing being a visor.  I think you're some weird fetish-man who's been peeking at the cards underneath it.  Can I see?
-2-male_removed_accessory=smug,Men can be so cruel.  I'm at my most vulnerable, you know...
-2-male_removed_accessory=angry,Let me see your tube already.  Look how much <i>I'm</i> showing you!
-2-male_removed_accessory=annoyed,Guess I should've taken this game seriously if I wanted to see any men's secrets.
-2-male_removed_accessory=bored,Never thought I'd get outplayed by a man this badly.  I figured you didn't know what cards <i>were</i>.
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=laughing,Hey, what <i>that</i> supposed to mean, Gearbox?  What Barnette and I do in private is none of your business.
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=vain,Oh, please.  I'm the <i>giver</i> in my relationship...<i>Barnette</i> would get to wear the blindfold.
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=teasing,<i>Oho</i>!  And Little Dungeon Bot shows some spunk.  You're getting more human all the time...<i>maybe we could use that blindfold</i>.
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=teasing,Ha!  About time you manned up and talked back to me.  But to be honest, <i>Barnette's</i> usually wearing the blindfold.
-2-female_removing_accessory=bored,...You suck, ~name~.
-2-female_removing_accessory=frustrated,Give me a break here!  Is this because of how I taunted you before?
-2-female_removing_accessory=bored,Look, I'm sorry about the teasing, alright?  You beat me already!
-2-female_removing_accessory=bored,This is giving me a headache...good thing finishing up should cure that.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:3=smug,And at last the trumped-up girlie removes the only thing maintaining her arrogance.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:3=teasing,Hey, Princess...you can't strip what makes <i>me</i> beautiful.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:3=smug,<i>Royals</i>...talk about jewelry for jewelry's sake.  It's supposed to <i>improve</i> your looks, not create them.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:3=teasing,Thaaaank <i>you</i>!  Now the property of Magno Vivan's pirates, little Miss Princess!  So sorry.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:7=sad,<i>So long, Ang</i>--oh.  Well, I guess that counts.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:7=sad,<i>Awww</i>!  And here I thought I had beaten you.  But no, you proved too wily for me.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:7=vain,Damn Earth girls and their tricks.  <i>Who would do that, bring a bunch of accessories to a strip poker game</i>?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:7=smug,My pilot's eyes should've spotted that, but you snuck right past me--and yourself, even.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:5=angry,Wha--<i>oh, goddamnit!  Just take things off in a proper order</i>!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:5=angry,Hey, I came here to see some Earth nudity!  I don't appreciate being toyed around with!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:5=annoyed,Yeah, yeah, hotshot.  Real clever.  You definitely played this game and <i>didn't</i> want people to see you naked.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:5=bored,This must be how people feel around <i>me</i>.  Clinging to accessories...at least <i>I</i> have a body worth teasing.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:5=annoyed,I <i>hate it</i> when people bounce around with the importance of what they take off.  Let the audience know what to expect!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=confused,...Did I miss something?  Can't we take off whatever we want?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=confused,...Is there really a nebulous <i>management</i> that's got guns to our heads if we don't strip how they want?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=confused,...Who exactly is holding a gun to your head and making you do this?  Hey, are you listening?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=confused,...Why do you have to take off your shoes next?  I mean, you <i>should</i>, but apparently you <i>have</i> to?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=bored,It's refreshing to know you won't acknowledge anything I say.  Real liberating.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=awkward,...Look, I know I tease a lot, but I'm just having fun.  Nothing about <i>this</i> is fun.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=frustrated,Talk about a lost cause.  She won't even acknowledge me.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=teasing,<i>Hey, Ocean Girl.  If you're being held against your will, blink twice.  I'm a pirate, I understand</i>.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=awkward,Um...are you trying to shock me out of masturbating?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=awkward,...Uh...I can't masturbate to <i>that</i>.  And not for the reason these Earth people are thinking.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=awkward,...Well, this is awkward.  Are you OK, Meia?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=sad,I may have lost, but...now I feel bad for you.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=bored,Well, <i>that</i> stunts my libido.  Why are you doing this to yourself?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:3=interested,Sure you don't want to cling to that, dearie?  It <i>is</i> what marks as you as better than the rest of us.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:3=vain,I guess I can understand losing that, even as a princess.  It'll let your blonde hair flow free and unencumbered!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:3=seductive,Miss Princess dropping her overinflated jewelry?  Oh, I forgot--you're blonde, so you're not so bad.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:3=teasing,That's it, honey.  Lower yourself to the level of us dirty commoners.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=shocked,O-oh, are you putting the guns down?  I-I promise I won't touch them.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=awkward,<i>(Oh, thank God...)</i>  Er, Revy, good choice there.  Good choice.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=awkward,Hey, uh, now that you're disarmed, try to relax a little, would you?  Instead of yelling at us.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=sad,I was <i>hoping</i> tonight wouldn't end with someone getting shot.  Don't we all just want to see each other naked?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=confused,...Seriously, do you have <i>any</i> control over this?  Even a little?  Or is it all luck?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=confused,...Talk about living life up to chance, by the way.  This is so weird...and I'm a pilot.  I've <i>seen</i> weird.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=stretching,There she goes with another vortex.  Life is just a game of luck to our little fashionista here.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=vain,Too bad this isn't the spectacle it used to be.  But the random chance <i>does</i> keep it interesting!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=teasing,<i>Atta girl</i>!  Now show me something magical!  ...Besides this.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=vain,These vortices are pretty fantastic, but it's the end result I care about.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=seductive,You really are something else.  I've already grown accustomed to your magic vortices!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=seductive,All that magic, but all I care about is the outfit waiting for me.  I never thought I'd meet someone like you!
-2-female_removed_accessory=angry,Hey, I don't need to take this.  I have a girlfriend, you know!
-2-female_removed_accessory=annoyed,Maybe I'll just masturbate with my legs closed.  We'll see how <i>you</i> like it!
-2-female_removed_accessory=sad,This isn't how women should treat each other, ~name~.
-2-female_removed_accessory=bored,I thought <i>I</i> was a tease.  At least I don't wear much to begin with.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=confused,Me-<i>ow</i>!  Heeheehee--wait, you're serious?  Like, the animal, a cat?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=confused,...Earth girls can have <i>cat</i> ears?  Like, the cats I see in zoos?  How?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=confused,...You, uh, going to explain this to me?  I'm still shaky on what a <i>cat</i> is, much less a "Faunus."
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=frustrated,...Listen, I'm not from Earth.  You can't expect me to understand why you have cat ears...or why you've been hiding them.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=annoyed,Am I getting through to you?  Jura to Ocean Girl!  <i>Hello</i>?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=angry,Hey, Ocean Girl!  <i>I'm talking to you</i>!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=annoyed,What's your name, floozy?  <i>Moon</i>?  Yeah, you're a lunatic, alright!  Say something to me!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=annoyed,Hel-<i>looo</i>?  Am I breaking up?  Have we achieved first contact?  <i>God</i>...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4c=laughing,Hah!  Going for <i>my</i> look, are you?  Yeah, cleavage tends to get people to do what you want.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4c=laughing,Feeling a little breezy, honey?  Don't worry, you'll get used to it--I did.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4c=laughing,Pfft!  How do you like <i>my</i> style, then?  I'm flattered you had this on the backburner, sweetie.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4c=vain,Doesn't the breeze feel good between your breasts?  It always perks me up when I'm down.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:4=bored,For how excited you are to strip...I'm not sure I want to see what lies underneath.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:4=angry,As if we want to see your nasty little twig body.  You keep going on about how you're just a public plaything!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:4=frustrated,Oh, good, you're almost out.  Maybe then you can lose and leave and stop freaking me out.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:4=annoyed,Whatever ocean <i>you're</i> swimming in, I bet the fish are all dead.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:6=angry,What do you mean, <i>not fun</i>?  The fun is starting off with some teasing and then revealing your beautiful body!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:6=vain,<i>Hmph</i>.  It would seem <i>I'm</i> the only proper seductress around here, properly building up to nudity like a lady.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:6=bored,There's a right way and a wrong way to strip, and you're starting to fall into the wrong way.  It needs to escalate!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:6=smug,<i>Well</i>.  I'd never make it as a model if I deflated the excitement like you do.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3c=seductive,Oh, I see!  These must be Earth women's street clothes, right?  You're so considerate!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3c=smug,Going for something simple, huh?  Just basic Earth street clothes on display?  I get it.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3c=smug,Jacket and jeans?  Seen it--but I guess street clothes on Earth don't <i>have</i> to be all that different.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3c=teasing,Earth's street clothes sticking to the familiars, eh?  Mejarians tend to aim a little <i>tighter</i>.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4b=vain,Bare midriff?  My dress brings me pretty close to that...but <i>Dita's</i> the girl who wears it best!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4b=seductive,Ooh, my crewmate Dita dresses like that!  She's such a naive little thing, even with her midriff exposed all sexy-like.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4b=vain,I know a sweet young girl who dresses like that!  Dita's her name--she's so naive.  Barely even notices her exposed belly.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4b=smug,Yeah, Dita shows off her belly too.  I can't tell if she's just too naive to know how sexy she's being or just doesn't care.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3a=seductive,Ooh, a sexy red-and-black!  I like your style, Vriska--and it clashes with your skin!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3a=teasing,Nothing like blood-red and shadow-black to get the heart beating.  Plus, those bullets get it going even faster!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3a=vain,Talk about making my heart jump.  Red, black, and bullets on the side!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3a=vain,I wish <i>I</i> owned something red...and this dress is the closest thing to black.  <i>A pirate's problems</i>!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=awkward,You're making this really uncomfortable, Meia...mostly for yourself.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=bored,Believe me, I don't like seeing you all shaken like this.  Definitely don't want to masturbate to it, either.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=angry,Hey, everyone leave her alone.  That thing means a lot to her.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=bored,This is hard to watch...and impossible to get off to.  Why'd you take that off, Meia?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a=laughing,Oho!  I <i>knew</i> you weren't so above it all!  And what a shift--bodysuits are pretty sexy.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a=laughing,Heeheehee!  I think the die was getting annoyed at you hiding your figure!  Go on, show off your hips!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a=interested,Going to do a little dance, Vriska?  Show off that figure a little?  Because that adorable polka-dotted suit is giving you a head start.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a=seductive,That's positively <i>adorable</i>, Vriska!  Polka-dots <i>and</i> a revealing shape.  Now it's <i>Mejarian</i> fashion!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3b=seductive,You're getting sexier all the time, cutie!  I like leaving my shoulders bare, too...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3b=vain,<i>Now</i> you're speaking my language!  A woman's shoulders should be as free as space is vast.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3b=vain,As long as the universe is expanding, a woman's shoulders should be unmasked to see it happen.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3b=seductive,<i>Exactly</i> what I would go for, with those uncovered shoulders.  I feel like you already know me so well, Vriska!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=vain,Finally shedding all your little things.  That's good...women are much cuter unencumbered.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=seductive,I can't get over how cute you are...especially without all that extra padding!  Just a tiny little thing with gorgeous blue hair on top.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=smug,I wonder if you could pull off a dress like mine, Sei.  You're so preoccupied with all that silly armor and padding...why wear it?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=vain,What is it you do again that requires all this nonsense on your person?  You should wear something <i>sexy</i>!

-1-male_removing_accessory=bored,Honestly.  I knew men were stupid, but <i>boring</i>, too?
-1-male_removing_accessory=annoyed,I think I'm just gonna leave.  Even after all that, the men still don't want to show me any tubes.
-1-male_removing_accessory=frustrated,What is <i>with</i> Earth men?  I thought the sight of a nude woman just turned you into raging beasts.
-1-male_removing_accessory=seductive-2,Oh, the indignity of it all, being humiliated by a man this way.  Awful!
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=seductive,<i>There</i> you go.  Fully sighted like the rest of us!  I don't buy that nonsense about it being a visor...can I see it?
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=teasing,If that thing's really a visor, toss it over here.  If you get to cheat, why can't I see how?
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=teasing,You're not afraid to let a simple human woman see what advantages you had, right?  Give it here.
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=interested,I'm calling your bluff on that thing being a visor.  I think you're some weird fetish-man who's been peeking at the cards underneath it.  Can I see?
-1-male_removed_accessory=interested,I mean, come <i>on</i>, ~name~.  You think I teased you like that to watch you remove your ~clothing~?
-1-male_removed_accessory=frustrated,I don't give a damn about men's fashion.  Let me see your body already!
-1-male_removed_accessory=bored,Ugh, men are the <i>worst</i>.
-1-male_removed_accessory=annoyed,Hey, listen, ~name~.  I know a doctor who's more handsome and wears less.  So get stripping.
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=laughing,Hey, what <i>that</i> supposed to mean, Gearbox?  What Barnette and I do in private is none of your business.
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=vain,Oh, please.  I'm the <i>giver</i> in my relationship...<i>Barnette</i> would get to wear the blindfold.
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=teasing,<i>Oho</i>!  And Little Dungeon Bot shows some spunk.  You're getting more human all the time...<i>maybe we could use that blindfold</i>.
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=teasing,Ha!  About time you manned up and talked back to me.  But to be honest, <i>Barnette's</i> usually wearing the blindfold.
-1-female_removing_accessory=angry,<i>Seriously</i>?  Why do Earth girls wear so much?
-1-female_removing_accessory=bored,Take a fashion tip from a Mejarian.  Less is more.
-1-female_removing_accessory=annoyed,I've half a mind to borrow one of Barnette's guns.
-1-female_removing_accessory=teasing,Meia hates losing a lot more than I do.  She'd be <i>furious</i> with you!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=confused,...Did I miss something?  Can't we take off whatever we want?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=confused,...Is there really a nebulous <i>management</i> that's got guns to our heads if we don't strip how they want?

-1-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=shocked,...OK.  I agree.  You don't want to have fun.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=shocked,...Point taken.  No fun for you.  Got it.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=bored,...OK, now you're just actively trying to make this awful for yourself.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=awkward,W-wha--but...<i>why</i>?  You should be having fun, not torturing yourself!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=sad,...You'd still look sexy with that on.  It's not what I meant by stripping...or fun.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=confused,...Seriously, do you have <i>any</i> control over this?  Even a little?  Or is it all luck?

-1-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:3=smug,And at last the trumped-up girlie removes the only thing maintaining her arrogance.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:3=teasing,Hey, Princess...you can't strip what makes <i>me</i> beautiful.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:3=smug,<i>Royals</i>...talk about jewelry for jewelry's sake.  It's supposed to <i>improve</i> your looks, not create them.

-1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3a=vain,I wish <i>I</i> owned something red...and this dress is the closest thing to black.  <i>A pirate's problems</i>!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a=laughing,Oho!  I <i>knew</i> you weren't so above it all!  And what a shift--bodysuits are pretty sexy.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a=laughing,Heeheehee!  I think the die was getting annoyed at you hiding your figure!  Go on, show off your hips!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a=interested,Going to do a little dance, Vriska?  Show off that figure a little?  Because that adorable polka-dotted suit is giving you a head start.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a=seductive,That's positively <i>adorable</i>, Vriska!  Polka-dots <i>and</i> a revealing shape.  Now it's <i>Mejarian</i> fashion!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3c=seductive,Oh, I see!  These must be Earth women's street clothes, right?  You're so considerate!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3c=smug,Going for something simple, huh?  Just basic Earth street clothes on display?  I get it.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3c=smug,Jacket and jeans?  Seen it--but I guess street clothes on Earth don't <i>have</i> to be all that different.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3c=teasing,Earth's street clothes sticking to the familiars, eh?  Mejarians tend to aim a little <i>tighter</i>.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:4=bored,For how excited you are to strip...I'm not sure I want to see what lies underneath.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:4=angry,As if we want to see your nasty little twig body.  You keep going on about how you're just a public plaything!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:4=frustrated,Oh, good, you're almost out.  Maybe then you can lose and leave and stop freaking me out.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:4=annoyed,Whatever ocean <i>you're</i> swimming in, I bet the fish are all dead.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3b=seductive,You're getting sexier all the time, cutie!  I like leaving my shoulders bare, too...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3b=vain,<i>Now</i> you're speaking my language!  A woman's shoulders should be as free as space is vast.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3b=vain,As long as the universe is expanding, a woman's shoulders should be unmasked to see it happen.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3b=seductive,<i>Exactly</i> what I would go for, with those uncovered shoulders.  I feel like you already know me so well, Vriska!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=vain,Finally shedding all your little things.  That's good...women are much cuter unencumbered.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=seductive,I can't get over how cute you are...especially without all that extra padding!  Just a tiny little thing with gorgeous blue hair on top.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=smug,I wonder if you could pull off a dress like mine, Sei.  You're so preoccupied with all that silly armor and padding...why wear it?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=vain,What is it you do again that requires all this nonsense on your person?  You should wear something <i>sexy</i>!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=annoyed,Am I getting through to you?  Jura to Ocean Girl!  <i>Hello</i>?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=angry,Hey, Ocean Girl!  <i>I'm talking to you</i>!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=annoyed,What's your name, floozy?  <i>Moon</i>?  Yeah, you're a lunatic, alright!  Say something to me!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=annoyed,Hel-<i>looo</i>?  Am I breaking up?  Have we achieved first contact?  <i>God</i>...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4c=laughing,Hah!  Going for <i>my</i> look, are you?  Yeah, cleavage tends to get people to do what you want.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4c=laughing,Feeling a little breezy, honey?  Don't worry, you'll get used to it--I did.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4c=laughing,Pfft!  How do you like <i>my</i> style, then?  I'm flattered you had this on the backburner, sweetie.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4c=vain,Doesn't the breeze feel good between your breasts?  It always perks me up when I'm down.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=confused,Me-<i>ow</i>!  Heeheehee--wait, you're serious?  Like, the animal, a cat?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=confused,...Earth girls can have <i>cat</i> ears?  Like, the cats I see in zoos?  How?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=confused,...You, uh, going to explain this to me?  I'm still shaky on what a <i>cat</i> is, much less a "Faunus."
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=frustrated,...Listen, I'm not from Earth.  You can't expect me to understand why you have cat ears...or why you've been hiding them.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=sad,...Never thought you'd do that just to spite me.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=sad,That wasn't fun, least of all for you.  Why would you do that?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=awkward,...I'm sorry I dragged you here.  But please try to embrace it a little, OK?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=bored,So you're annoyed I dragged you here.  Don't make it <i>worse</i> for yourself.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=sad,...Now you're just guilt-tripping me.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:6=angry,What do you mean, <i>not fun</i>?  The fun is starting off with some teasing and then revealing your beautiful body!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:6=vain,<i>Hmph</i>.  It would seem <i>I'm</i> the only proper seductress around here, properly building up to nudity like a lady.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:6=bored,There's a right way and a wrong way to strip, and you're starting to fall into the wrong way.  It needs to escalate!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:6=smug,<i>Well</i>.  I'd never make it as a model if I deflated the excitement like you do.

0-male_removing_minor=teasing,Hey, ~name~...ever seen an <i>alien</i>?
0-male_removing_minor=teasing,Is this a chink in the armor?  You've yet to dent <i>me</i>, ~name~.
0-male_removing_minor=laughing,What's a man to do with a Mejarian taunting him?  Take off something boring, apparently.
0-male_removing_minor=smug,Men have proved to be nuisances in the past, but they've never proved to be <i>dull</i>.
0-male_removed_minor=teasing,You can't run from me forever, ~name~.
0-male_removed_minor=seductive,I'm seeing more of you all the time.  And it's all so <i>fascinating</i>!
0-male_removed_minor=seductive,Show a little skin, ~name~.  As a girl I was told it was spiny, but I've <i>got</i> to know for sure.
0-male_removed_minor=teasing,Give this guy some bad cards, dealer.  Show him this isn't funny.
0-male_removed_minor,target:link,targetStage:2=annoyed,Seriously, honey, <i>what</i> is the deal with the grunting?  It was funny for five minutes, but now it's embarrassing.
0-male_removed_minor,target:link,targetStage:2=interested,...So this is your identity, huh?  Just going to grunt?  Yeah, I think I'll find a man who's capable of telling me I'm beautiful.
0-male_removed_minor,target:link,targetStage:2=bored,I know you're overcome by my beauty, Elf-man, but this yelping thing is no longer endearing.  <i>Sheesh</i>.
0-male_removed_minor,target:link,targetStage:2=teasing,Maybe you're unaware, Elf-man, but I'm the kind of woman who's into dirty talk...so you're not really being my type at the moment.
0-female_removing_minor=vain,I think I own something like that.  I just love this dress so much, I can never wear it!
0-female_removing_minor=vain,Earth fashion is a curious thing.  Why cover up your wonderful body?
0-female_removing_minor=teasing,Hey, the body is meant to be enjoyed.  <i>Mejarians</i> certainly enjoy each other.
0-female_removing_minor=interested,What are your other plans to rattle me?  Blowing a kiss?
0-female_removing_minor,target:moon,targetStage:4=frustrated,Should I ask why you wear so much extra stuff when you just want to take it off in a hurry?
0-female_removing_minor,target:moon,targetStage:4=annoyed,<i>I'm</i> trying to be sensual and fun.  <i>This</i> girl is advertising her diseases.
0-female_removing_minor,target:moon,targetStage:4=awkward,...You all know I'm just flirting, right?  I'm not like this girl, I swear.
0-female_removing_minor,target:moon,targetStage:4=frustrated,I can't believe what I'm hearing.  I was just making jokes about Earth girls being sex fiends thanks to men...and now I meet one.
0-female_removing_minor,target:misato,targetStage:2=seductive,So what's your story, dear?  Don't you keep going on about "Angels" or something like that?  I'm curious.
0-female_removing_minor,target:misato,targetStage:2=seductive,I keep hearing about these "Angel" attacks.  Are they bad?  Because you came out looking pretty cute.
0-female_removing_minor,target:misato,targetStage:2=vain,Don't you fight "Angels" or something, dear?  I hope you don't mistake <i>me</i> for one...I could understand doing so.
0-female_removing_minor,target:misato,targetStage:2=teasing,So you're all about fighting off "Angels"?  Hey, you're looking at one...<i>don't shoot, darling</i>.
0-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1=teasing,Watch out, folks.  That armor can take some abuse...and it takes a while to get it off.
0-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1=teasing,Did you know?  Meia wears that armor to show she's our squadron leader.  She's a smart cookie!
0-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1=teasing,Your armor's pretty tough stuff, Meia, but it can't stop aces.
0-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1=laughing,Ace pilot, sure, but that armor can't seem to deflect aces.
0-female_removing_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:3,marker:planet-countries=vain,Ohhh, so <i>that's</i> what it's called?  Short and simple...and <i>romantic</i>.  And they speak it on Planet France?
0-female_removing_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:3,marker:planet-countries=vain,And is that the official language of Planet France?  I simply <i>have</i> to move there, then!
0-female_removing_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:3,marker:planet-countries=seductive,And is every woman on Planet France as cute-looking and sounding as you?  It sounds like <i>heaven</i>, then!
0-female_removing_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:3,marker:planet-countries=excited,Omigosh, Marinette!  You're from planet "France," right?  And <i>everyone</i> speaks French there?  That's so exciting!
0-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=stretching,Well, at least you brought your girlfriend to help through this.  I <i>hope</i> Barnette wouldn't be so cowardly.
0-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=seductive,Oh, so you two are lovers?  That's so <i>adorable</i>!  I've been going steady with Barnette for a while now.
0-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10,marker:fama_and_oma=laughing,<i>Teeheehee</i>!  I didn't know you two were <i>that</i> close!  I can tell Florina here is more Fama material, being all demure.
0-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=seductive,<i>Ohhh, I get it</i>!  Lyn's helping you overcome your fears!  What an adorable couple you two are, helping each other out!
0-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=confused,Uh...you alright, Miss Detective?  What's up?
0-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=confused,Oh, you're taking off the gloves now?  I just figured you really liked them.
0-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=confused,Oh, the gloves?  I thought you were just committed to some kind of fashion statement.  Why now?
0-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=confused,Hey, Kyoko, you look mortified.  Something happen?  Bad memories of men resurfacing?
0-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=confused,Hey, Miss Pokerface, you're not really living up the nickname anymore.  What's wrong?
0-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0=laughing,<i>Hahahaha</i>!  Oh, don't take things so seriously!  You're still cute--you're just a little on the short side, that's all!
0-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0=seductive,<i>Oh, relax</i>!  I'm just teasing you, honey--it's not often on Mejare you meet a woman so short!
0-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0=teasing,I'm just teasing, dear!  Don't take it personally--I'm quite used to towering over women.
0-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0=vain,Oh, are you sensitive about your height?  Don't worry, dear--I hear short <i>men</i> get much more flack for it.
0-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=teasing,That we are, Lizzie!  I'm glad you're so interested in these boring old alien women.
0-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=teasing,We <i>are</i> pirates, Elizabeth...but don't worry, you're too much of a sweetheart to kill and rob!
0-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=seductive,Don't you worry your pretty little head off about it, honey.  We may be pirates, but we only attack nasty soldier types.
0-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=vain,Pirates we are, Elizabeth...and we've got <i>so</i> many stories of high adventure and death-defying stunts to tell.
0-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=excited,I can't get over how cool this is.  You should join our crew with aim like that!
0-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=excited,...That's never going to get old.  It's brilliant to watch!
0-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=excited,The skill is one thing, but the <i>daring</i>!  You're not scared at all!
0-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=excited,This is unreal.  I never knew Earth women could be so <i>cool</i>!  Or daring!  Or spunky!
0-female_removing_minor,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=confused,Hm?  Oh, right, you brought your partner along.  Why isn't <i>she</i> playing?  Or saying anything?
0-female_removing_minor,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=interested,Your partner seems like the strong, silent type.  Not sure which part to emphasize.
0-female_removing_minor,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=laughing,Is that your wrestling partner helping you out?  What a loyal friend...even if she doesn't have much on her mind.
0-female_removing_minor,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=confused,Hey, this table's full!  Oh, she's just helping you...and has little to say about it.
0-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:1=seductive,Omigosh, Faye, that jacket is so <i>stylish</i>!  And the way you let it hang there just <i>screams</i> personality.
0-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:1=vain,I like your style, honey!  A scarlet-red jacket, just draped all sexy-like around your delicate frame...<i>exquisite</i>.
0-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:1=vain,Ooh, that jacket is so <i>cool</i>-looking!  My dress is the only fancy thing I own...such is the life of a pirate.
0-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:1=teasing,Ooh, I barely noticed that thing, the way you draped it around yourself with <i>style</i>!  You've got an eye for sex appeal, honey.
0-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=excited,Every bullet looks like it's going to hit you, and then it just grazes!  It's spectacular!  Can it be taught?
0-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=seductive,Could you shoot my dress off, too?  Not that I'd <i>want</i> you to, but could you?  Could I <i>learn</i> how to do it?
0-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=excited,Absolutely phenomenal!  And you even manage to look beautiful as you do it!  Could you maybe teach me?
0-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=seductive,I'd be quite the pirate if I could shoot like you!  Can you give me some tips?
0-female_removed_minor=vain,I can already tell you wear more than my darling Barnette.
0-female_removed_minor=interested,Hey, I <i>started</i> this game more exposed than you.  Live a little.
0-female_removed_minor=bored,Jeez, you Earth girls act like there's a reward for winning.
0-female_removed_minor=interested,We didn't put in any money, you know.  The only reward for winning is a whole lot of sexual frustration.
0-female_removed_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2=seductive,You had a <i>gun</i>?  And it's an old clunky kinetic one--my girlfriend collects those things!  Can I see it?
0-female_removed_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2=seductive,Oh, look at that--a men's kinetic weapon, cleverly concealed!  My girlfriend Barnette has a whole collection!
0-female_removed_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2=smug,You're a <i>spacefarer</i>, and still you cling to old men's guns?  You're just like my girlfriend, though she's just a collector.
0-female_removed_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2=vain,I thought a spacefarer would know better than to rely on mechanical sidearms.  But then, my girlfriend has laser rings and she still likes those things.
0-female_removed_minor,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:1=teasing,Hey, honey...you can lift me up <i>any</i> time you want.  I don't mind.
0-female_removed_minor,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:1=seductive,I like how strong she is, though.  You look like a chunk of muscle yourself, too!
0-female_removed_minor,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:1=teasing,I can appreciate a woman with muscles...mostly because she could spin me around.  So you two are good in my book.
0-female_removed_minor,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:1=seductive,Hey, you're both pretty cute.  And so strong!  How do you find the time to exercise so much?
0-female_removed_minor,target:moon,targetStage:5=annoyed,I'd ask to try it on, but it's probably got lice.  Why infect only one part of your body?
0-female_removed_minor,target:moon,targetStage:5=annoyed,Maybe it's best if you kept it on.  That way you could lose and leave faster.
0-female_removed_minor,target:moon,targetStage:5=annoyed,Don't let us stop you.  You could keep the hat and just strip like you want...on the sidewalk outside.
0-female_removed_minor,target:moon,targetStage:5=angry,Why'd you play this game anyway?  Just strip outside if you're not going to play for the fun of the tease...or talk to any of us.
0-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2=teasing,Feeling limber, Meia?  Hope that's what it takes to finally put a dent in me.
0-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2=smug,All stretched out now?  That armor looks so cumbersome--I could never wear it.
0-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2=interested,Ready to go this time?  Looks like you've really freed yourself up.
0-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2=teasing,Oho.  There's no stopping you now, Meia!  Not with your shoulders free to rotate.
0-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=shocked,...<i>Yeah.  Yeah, I understand now.  Sorry</i>.
0-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=shocked,<i>Eeek!  W-what's wrong with your--u-uh, I'm sorry!  It's not so bad, really</i>!
0-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=awkward,...Oh no, they're...interesting.  They look great.  You look great.  It's a style.
0-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=shocked,<i>Eep!  D-don't touch--er, uh, they're--cute!  Yes.  Very cute</i>.
0-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=smug,This isn't exactly Meia's idea of fun like it is mine.  I mean, she <i>likes</i> feeling sexy, but she'd never admit it.
0-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=teasing,Meia's not the type to admit it when she's having fun.  Don't worry, you're good company for her.
0-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=laughing,Don't let Meia fool you into thinking she doesn't like feeling sexy.  Just look at that suit she wears--her butt is constantly on display!
0-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=stretching,Oh, Meia's every bit the sultry young thing I am.  She just likes hiding it and playing hard-to-get.
0-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1,saidMarker:fama_and_oma=confused,...Wait, what's a mother?  Did I miss something?
0-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1,saidMarker:fama_and_oma=confused,...Your <i>mother</i>?  What's that?  Did I say that?
0-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1,saidMarker:fama_and_oma=awkward,...OK, you lost me.  I called you short, and now...you're talking about your "mother," whatever <i>that</i> is.
0-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1,saidMarker:fama_and_oma=thinking,...What's a <i>mother</i>?  I said <i>Fama</i>.  Oh wait, that's not a thing on Earth, right?  Or...is it?
0-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:1=shocked,Wait, you--you--<i>oh, wow.  You weren't kidding</i>.  Uh...so, uh, what's it like using magic?
0-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:1=shocked,...OK.  Yes.  You're a real witch.  I believe it.  Excellent job.
0-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:1=awkward,Wait, where'd they go?  Did you just make them--<i>vanish</i>?  And I thought what the Paksis did was impressive...
0-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:1=shocked,...OK.  I thought our technology was pretty impressive...but I can't tell what you just did.  That thing looks like a <i>stick</i>!
0-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=excited,Omigosh, I <i>have</i> to introduce you to Barnette.  She's a total gun nut!
0-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=seductive,My girlfriend <i>loves</i> those old men's weapons.  You've just <i>got</i> to meet her!
0-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=excited,I never knew those clunky old men's weapons could make something so--so <i>beautiful</i>!  Barnette would be so happy to meet you!
0-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=seductive,How can you spend all this time practicing your aim and still be so <i>cute</i>?  Then again, my darling Barnette is the same way.
0-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1=laughing,I don't know, dear.  Did you not have your glasses on when you were looking for your sense of humor?
0-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1=teasing,Hey, at least you've got some fighting spirit!  Pint-sized Hibiki is the same way, so I guess shortness transcends sex.
0-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1=smug,Yeah, can't crack a joke about Hibiki's height without him getting all huffy, either.  You shorties are such hotheads.
0-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1=vain,You Earth girls always call my clothes skimpy, like I'm supposed to be ashamed of my body.  But then, I have a lot more of it.
0-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4=laughing,...Hoo.  You are <i>really</i> throwing them back, dear.  Got an extra liver?
0-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4=interested,...Honey, is this typical for you?  Did one of these silly Earth men reject you earlier tonight?  What's with the drinking?
0-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4=interested,You, uh, alright there, Sei?  Because <i>I</i> don't drink that much, and I've got about two feet on you.
0-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4=stretching,It's weird seeing a blue-haired girl knock them back like you do.  Meia never drinks, because she hates fun.
0-female_removed_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2=laughing,<i>Hahahaha</i>!  I <i>knew</i> you had a dirty side, Elizabeth!  No girl that sweet would come here in <i>that</i>.

#lost rapier
1-male_removing_minor=vain,Surprised to find a man wearing so many clothes.  Tarak's all about efficiency--no style at all!
1-male_removing_minor=laughing,Why do men wear <i>any</i> clothes?  Worried about your tubes catching a stray laser?
1-male_removing_minor=thinking,There were some men on that one outpost Miss Liz ran.  But they were pretty grouchy, so I didn't mess with them.
1-male_removing_minor=bored,Out of all the men on Earth, I get one who dresses more than a <i>woman</i>.
1-male_removed_minor=seductive,Didn't know men were capable of teasing.  Congrats.
1-male_removed_minor=laughing,Slowly but surely, I'm picking away.  Waiting for a tube to sprout up from the ground.
1-male_removed_minor=seductive,I can feel the fires of instinct burning inside me, ~name~.
1-male_removed_minor=smug,For those keeping score, I'm outplaying this man, as expected.
1-male_removed_minor,target:link,targetStage:2=annoyed,Seriously, honey, <i>what</i> is the deal with the grunting?  It was funny for five minutes, but now it's embarrassing.
1-male_removed_minor,target:link,targetStage:2=interested,...So this is your identity, huh?  Just going to grunt?  Yeah, I think I'll find a man who's capable of telling me I'm beautiful.
1-male_removed_minor,target:link,targetStage:2=bored,I know you're overcome by my beauty, Elf-man, but this yelping thing is no longer endearing.  <i>Sheesh</i>.
1-male_removed_minor,target:link,targetStage:2=teasing,Maybe you're unaware, Elf-man, but I'm the kind of woman who's into dirty talk...so you're not really being my type at the moment.
1-female_removing_minor=smug,Soon you'll be showing the skin I'm <i>always</i> showing.
1-female_removing_minor=interested,Don't act all wounded about it.  I <i>started</i> showing more than that.
1-female_removing_minor=smug,I still say my sword was a heftier loss.
1-female_removing_minor=teasing,So much beating around the bush.  <i>Maybe I'll follow suit</i>.
1-female_removing_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:3,marker:planet-countries=vain,Ohhh, so <i>that's</i> what it's called?  Short and simple...and <i>romantic</i>.  And they speak it on Planet France?
1-female_removing_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:3,marker:planet-countries=vain,And is that the official language of Planet France?  I simply <i>have</i> to move there, then!
1-female_removing_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:3,marker:planet-countries=seductive,And is every woman on Planet France as cute-looking and sounding as you?  It sounds like <i>heaven</i>, then!
1-female_removing_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:3,marker:planet-countries=excited,Omigosh, Marinette!  You're from planet "France," right?  And <i>everyone</i> speaks French there?  That's so exciting!
1-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=confused,Uh...you alright, Miss Detective?  What's up?
1-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=confused,Oh, you're taking off the gloves now?  I just figured you really liked them.
1-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=confused,Oh, the gloves?  I thought you were just committed to some kind of fashion statement.  Why now?
1-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=confused,Hey, Kyoko, you look mortified.  Something happen?  Bad memories of men resurfacing?
1-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=confused,Hey, Miss Pokerface, you're not really living up the nickname anymore.  What's wrong?
1-female_removing_minor,target:moon,targetStage:4=frustrated,Should I ask why you wear so much extra stuff when you just want to take it off in a hurry?
1-female_removing_minor,target:moon,targetStage:4=annoyed,<i>I'm</i> trying to be sensual and fun.  <i>This</i> girl is advertising her diseases.
1-female_removing_minor,target:moon,targetStage:4=awkward,...You all know I'm just flirting, right?  I'm not like this girl, I swear.
1-female_removing_minor,target:moon,targetStage:4=frustrated,I can't believe what I'm hearing.  I was just making jokes about Earth girls being sex fiends thanks to men...and now I meet one.
1-female_removing_minor,target:misato,targetStage:2=seductive,So what's your story, dear?  Don't you keep going on about "Angels" or something like that?  I'm curious.
1-female_removing_minor,target:misato,targetStage:2=seductive,I keep hearing about these "Angel" attacks.  Are they bad?  Because you came out looking pretty cute.
1-female_removing_minor,target:misato,targetStage:2=vain,Don't you fight "Angels" or something, dear?  I hope you don't mistake <i>me</i> for one...I could understand doing so.
1-female_removing_minor,target:misato,targetStage:2=teasing,So you're all about fighting off "Angels"?  Hey, you're looking at one...<i>don't shoot, darling</i>.
1-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0=laughing,<i>Hahahaha</i>!  Oh, don't take things so seriously!  You're still cute--you're just a little on the short side, that's all!
1-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0=seductive,<i>Oh, relax</i>!  I'm just teasing you, honey--it's not often on Mejare you meet a woman so short!
1-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0=teasing,I'm just teasing, dear!  Don't take it personally--I'm quite used to towering over women.
1-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0=vain,Oh, are you sensitive about your height?  Don't worry, dear--I hear short <i>men</i> get much more flack for it.
1-female_removing_minor,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=confused,Hm?  Oh, right, you brought your partner along.  Why isn't <i>she</i> playing?  Or saying anything?
1-female_removing_minor,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=interested,Your partner seems like the strong, silent type.  Not sure which part to emphasize.
1-female_removing_minor,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=laughing,Is that your wrestling partner helping you out?  What a loyal friend...even if she doesn't have much on her mind.
1-female_removing_minor,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=confused,Hey, this table's full!  Oh, she's just helping you...and has little to say about it.
1-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=teasing,That we are, Lizzie!  I'm glad you're so interested in these boring old alien women.
1-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=teasing,We <i>are</i> pirates, Elizabeth...but don't worry, you're too much of a sweetheart to kill and rob!
1-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=seductive,Don't you worry your pretty little head off about it, honey.  We may be pirates, but we only attack nasty soldier types.
1-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=vain,Pirates we are, Elizabeth...and we've got <i>so</i> many stories of high adventure and death-defying stunts to tell.
1-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1=confused,Look, just take it easy, OK?  It's just a game...
1-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1=awkward,Are you fine now?  You sure?  You need to relax...
1-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1=awkward,Don't be all embarrassed, Meia.  They don't know about your eyepiece...
1-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=stretching,Well, at least you brought your girlfriend to help through this.  I <i>hope</i> Barnette wouldn't be so cowardly.
1-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=seductive,Oh, so you two are lovers?  That's so <i>adorable</i>!  I've been going steady with Barnette for a while now.
1-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10,marker:fama_and_oma=laughing,<i>Teeheehee</i>!  I didn't know you two were <i>that</i> close!  I can tell Florina here is more Fama material, being all demure.
1-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=seductive,<i>Ohhh, I get it</i>!  Lyn's helping you overcome your fears!  What an adorable couple you two are, helping each other out!
1-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=excited,Every bullet looks like it's going to hit you, and then it just grazes!  It's spectacular!  Can it be taught?
1-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=seductive,Could you shoot my dress off, too?  Not that I'd <i>want</i> you to, but could you?  Could I <i>learn</i> how to do it?
1-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=excited,Absolutely phenomenal!  And you even manage to look beautiful as you do it!  Could you maybe teach me?
1-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=seductive,I'd be quite the pirate if I could shoot like you!  Can you give me some tips?
1-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=excited,I can't get over how cool this is.  You should join our crew with aim like that!
1-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=excited,...That's never going to get old.  It's brilliant to watch!
1-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=excited,The skill is one thing, but the <i>daring</i>!  You're not scared at all!
1-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=excited,This is unreal.  I never knew Earth women could be so <i>cool</i>!  Or daring!  Or spunky!
1-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:1=seductive,Omigosh, Faye, that jacket is so <i>stylish</i>!  And the way you let it hang there just <i>screams</i> personality.
1-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:1=vain,I like your style, honey!  A scarlet-red jacket, just draped all sexy-like around your delicate frame...<i>exquisite</i>.
1-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:1=vain,Ooh, that jacket is so <i>cool</i>-looking!  My dress is the only fancy thing I own...such is the life of a pirate.
1-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:1=teasing,Ooh, I barely noticed that thing, the way you draped it around yourself with <i>style</i>!  You've got an eye for sex appeal, honey.
1-female_removed_minor=confused,Have you <i>been</i> with a man?  They're so hard to figure out!
1-female_removed_minor=thinking,I would've invited Dita here, but she's way too pure.  She'd be crying by now.
1-female_removed_minor=vain,Such cute little Earth items!  Where'd you get them?
1-female_removed_minor=thinking,Earth fashion is really all over the place.  But then, the state usually decides it on Mejare.
1-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:1=shocked,Wait, you--you--<i>oh, wow.  You weren't kidding</i>.  Uh...so, uh, what's it like using magic?
1-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:1=shocked,...OK.  Yes.  You're a real witch.  I believe it.  Excellent job.
1-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:1=awkward,Wait, where'd they go?  Did you just make them--<i>vanish</i>?  And I thought what the Paksis did was impressive...
1-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:1=shocked,...OK.  I thought our technology was pretty impressive...but I can't tell what you just did.  That thing looks like a <i>stick</i>!
1-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2=seductive,OK, well, if you're feeling better.  You certainly <i>look</i> better now.
1-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2=teasing,Glad you're feeling better, then.  Everyone take a gander at Meia's svelte figure, all tight in that bodysuit of hers!
1-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2=teasing,Getting out of that clunky armor will make you feel better.  You shouldn't wear it all the time, you know...your figure's <i>great</i>.
1-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2=seductive,Well, look who just got a lot cuter!  A woman's shoulders go a long way for her figure.
1-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1,saidMarker:fama_and_oma=confused,...Wait, what's a mother?  Did I miss something?
1-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1,saidMarker:fama_and_oma=confused,...Your <i>mother</i>?  What's that?  Did I say that?
1-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1,saidMarker:fama_and_oma=awkward,...OK, you lost me.  I called you short, and now...you're talking about your "mother," whatever <i>that</i> is.
1-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1,saidMarker:fama_and_oma=thinking,...What's a <i>mother</i>?  I said <i>Fama</i>.  Oh wait, that's not a thing on Earth, right?  Or...is it?
1-female_removed_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2=seductive,You had a <i>gun</i>?  And it's an old clunky kinetic one--my girlfriend collects those things!  Can I see it?
1-female_removed_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2=seductive,Oh, look at that--a men's kinetic weapon, cleverly concealed!  My girlfriend Barnette has a whole collection!
1-female_removed_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2=smug,You're a <i>spacefarer</i>, and still you cling to old men's guns?  You're just like my girlfriend, though she's just a collector.
1-female_removed_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2=vain,I thought a spacefarer would know better than to rely on mechanical sidearms.  But then, my girlfriend has laser rings and she still likes those things.
1-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=excited,Omigosh, I <i>have</i> to introduce you to Barnette.  She's a total gun nut!
1-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=seductive,My girlfriend <i>loves</i> those old men's weapons.  You've just <i>got</i> to meet her!
1-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=excited,I never knew those clunky old men's weapons could make something so--so <i>beautiful</i>!  Barnette would be so happy to meet you!
1-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=seductive,How can you spend all this time practicing your aim and still be so <i>cute</i>?  Then again, my darling Barnette is the same way.
1-female_removed_minor,target:moon,targetStage:5=annoyed,I'd ask to try it on, but it's probably got lice.  Why infect only one part of your body?
1-female_removed_minor,target:moon,targetStage:5=annoyed,Maybe it's best if you kept it on.  That way you could lose and leave faster.
1-female_removed_minor,target:moon,targetStage:5=annoyed,Don't let us stop you.  You could keep the hat and just strip like you want...on the sidewalk outside.
1-female_removed_minor,target:moon,targetStage:5=angry,Why'd you play this game anyway?  Just strip outside if you're not going to play for the fun of the tease...or talk to any of us.
1-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=smug,This isn't exactly Meia's idea of fun like it is mine.  I mean, she <i>likes</i> feeling sexy, but she'd never admit it.
1-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=teasing,Meia's not the type to admit it when she's having fun.  Don't worry, you're good company for her.
1-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=laughing,Don't let Meia fool you into thinking she doesn't like feeling sexy.  Just look at that suit she wears--her butt is constantly on display!
1-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=stretching,Oh, Meia's every bit the sultry young thing I am.  She just likes hiding it and playing hard-to-get.
1-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=shocked,Eep!  A-are you OK, Aimee?  Do you need help?  Is there a doctor in here?
1-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=shocked,Eek!  A-Aimee!  Are you OK?  <i>Say something</i>!
1-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=shocked,A-Aimee!  What's wrong?  Are you hit?  Did someone sabotage you?
1-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=shocked,Ack!  Aimee!  Are you alright?  Is there anything I can get you?  Did the gun misfire?
1-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=shocked,...<i>Yeah.  Yeah, I understand now.  Sorry</i>.
1-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=shocked,<i>Eeek!  W-what's wrong with your--u-uh, I'm sorry!  It's not so bad, really</i>!
1-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=awkward,...Oh no, they're...interesting.  They look great.  You look great.  It's a style.
1-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=shocked,<i>Eep!  D-don't touch--er, uh, they're--cute!  Yes.  Very cute</i>.
1-female_removed_minor,target:chell,targetStage:1=laughing,Really sticking to your guns, eh, Miss Motormouth?  Was this always your identity, or did you discover it after a night with duct tape?
1-female_removed_minor,target:chell,targetStage:1=interested,...I really hope you have a hobby, sweetie.  Because this silent treatment isn't much of an identity.
1-female_removed_minor,target:chell,targetStage:1=stretching,You know what kind of woman I like?  Ones who pay me compliments.  Maybe I'd return them.
1-female_removed_minor,target:chell,targetStage:1=smug,At what age did you start worrying your parents, dear?  At least you grew to be a functioning adult despite your disability.
1-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1=laughing,I don't know, dear.  Did you not have your glasses on when you were looking for your sense of humor?
1-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1=teasing,Hey, at least you've got some fighting spirit!  Pint-sized Hibiki is the same way, so I guess shortness transcends sex.
1-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1=smug,Yeah, can't crack a joke about Hibiki's height without him getting all huffy, either.  You shorties are such hotheads.
1-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1=vain,You Earth girls always call my clothes skimpy, like I'm supposed to be ashamed of my body.  But then, I have a lot more of it.
1-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4=laughing,...Hoo.  You are <i>really</i> throwing them back, dear.  Got an extra liver?
1-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4=interested,...Honey, is this typical for you?  Did one of these silly Earth men reject you earlier tonight?  What's with the drinking?
1-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4=interested,You, uh, alright there, Sei?  Because <i>I</i> don't drink that much, and I've got about two feet on you.
1-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4=stretching,It's weird seeing a blue-haired girl knock them back like you do.  Meia never drinks, because she hates fun.
1-female_removed_minor,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:1=teasing,Hey, honey...you can lift me up <i>any</i> time you want.  I don't mind.
1-female_removed_minor,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:1=seductive,I like how strong she is, though.  You look like a chunk of muscle yourself, too!
1-female_removed_minor,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:1=teasing,I can appreciate a woman with muscles...mostly because she could spin me around.  So you two are good in my book.
1-female_removed_minor,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:1=seductive,Hey, you're both pretty cute.  And so strong!  How do you find the time to exercise so much?
1-female_removed_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2=laughing,<i>Hahahaha</i>!  I <i>knew</i> you had a dirty side, Elizabeth!  No girl that sweet would come here in <i>that</i>.
1-female_removed_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2=laughing,<i>Ha</i>!  You really had me going for a while, dear, but it seems you're just as naughty as the rest of us!  Look at that thing!
1-female_removed_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2=laughing,<i>Pfft</i>.  Why'd you bother with the sweet-and-innocent act when you've got <i>fetish gear</i> underneath?
1-female_removed_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2=teasing,Now I can see what's got you all hot-and-bothered.  You're not sweet--you're just choking yourself, you little nymph!

2-male_removing_minor=stretching,<i>Yawn</i>.  How can a <i>man</i> manage to bore me?
2-male_removing_minor=stretching,Is that the best you can do?  Hibiki helps me form my lovely Vandread--now <i>that's</i> exciting.
2-male_removing_minor=stretching,<i>Sigh</i>...seems I shouldn't have expected much from Earth after all.
2-male_removing_minor=seductive,Is that male skin I see?  Oh, <i>do</i> show more.
2-male_removed_minor=laughing,How much clothing <i>do</i> men wear?  Soon, I'll know the answer.
2-male_removed_minor=thinking,Hibiki'd be all in a rage by now.  I don't think he wears very much, being low-class on Tarak and all.
2-male_removed_minor=interested,Earth men just don't seem to have that Tarakkian fire in the belly.

2-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=confused,Oh, the gloves?  I thought you were just committed to some kind of fashion statement.  Why now?
2-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=confused,Hey, Kyoko, you look mortified.  Something happen?  Bad memories of men resurfacing?
2-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=confused,Hey, Miss Pokerface, you're not really living up the nickname anymore.  What's wrong?
2-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0=laughing,<i>Hahahaha</i>!  Oh, don't take things so seriously!  You're still cute--you're just a little on the short side, that's all!
2-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0=seductive,<i>Oh, relax</i>!  I'm just teasing you, honey--it's not often on Mejare you meet a woman so short!
2-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0=teasing,I'm just teasing, dear!  Don't take it personally--I'm quite used to towering over women.
2-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0=vain,Oh, are you sensitive about your height?  Don't worry, dear--I hear short <i>men</i> get much more flack for it.
2-female_removing_minor,target:moon,targetStage:4=frustrated,Should I ask why you wear so much extra stuff when you just want to take it off in a hurry?
2-female_removing_minor,target:moon,targetStage:4=annoyed,<i>I'm</i> trying to be sensual and fun.  <i>This</i> girl is advertising her diseases.
2-female_removing_minor,target:moon,targetStage:4=awkward,...You all know I'm just flirting, right?  I'm not like this girl, I swear.
2-female_removing_minor,target:moon,targetStage:4=frustrated,I can't believe what I'm hearing.  I was just making jokes about Earth girls being sex fiends thanks to men...and now I meet one.
2-female_removing_minor,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=confused,Hm?  Oh, right, you brought your partner along.  Why isn't <i>she</i> playing?  Or saying anything?
2-female_removing_minor,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=interested,Your partner seems like the strong, silent type.  Not sure which part to emphasize.
2-female_removing_minor,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=laughing,Is that your wrestling partner helping you out?  What a loyal friend...even if she doesn't have much on her mind.
2-female_removing_minor,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=confused,Hey, this table's full!  Oh, she's just helping you...and has little to say about it.
2-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=teasing,That we are, Lizzie!  I'm glad you're so interested in these boring old alien women.
2-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=teasing,We <i>are</i> pirates, Elizabeth...but don't worry, you're too much of a sweetheart to kill and rob!
2-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=seductive,Don't you worry your pretty little head off about it, honey.  We may be pirates, but we only attack nasty soldier types.
2-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=vain,Pirates we are, Elizabeth...and we've got <i>so</i> many stories of high adventure and death-defying stunts to tell.
2-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1=seductive,Well, you'll feel better after this, right?  All loose and limber.
2-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1=seductive,Getting out of that armor would certainly cheer <i>me</i> up.
2-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1=seductive,Come on, now.  Perk up a bit.  Where's that fighting spirit we all look up to?
2-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1=seductive,You're too cute to be this sour, Meia...even though you always are.
2-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:1=seductive,Omigosh, Faye, that jacket is so <i>stylish</i>!  And the way you let it hang there just <i>screams</i> personality.
2-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:1=vain,I like your style, honey!  A scarlet-red jacket, just draped all sexy-like around your delicate frame...<i>exquisite</i>.
2-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:1=vain,Ooh, that jacket is so <i>cool</i>-looking!  My dress is the only fancy thing I own...such is the life of a pirate.
2-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:1=teasing,Ooh, I barely noticed that thing, the way you draped it around yourself with <i>style</i>!  You've got an eye for sex appeal, honey.
2-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=excited,I can't get over how cool this is.  You should join our crew with aim like that!
2-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=excited,...That's never going to get old.  It's brilliant to watch!
2-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=excited,The skill is one thing, but the <i>daring</i>!  You're not scared at all!
2-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=excited,This is unreal.  I never knew Earth women could be so <i>cool</i>!  Or daring!  Or spunky!
2-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=excited,Every bullet looks like it's going to hit you, and then it just grazes!  It's spectacular!  Can it be taught?
2-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=seductive,Could you shoot my dress off, too?  Not that I'd <i>want</i> you to, but could you?  Could I <i>learn</i> how to do it?
2-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=excited,Absolutely phenomenal!  And you even manage to look beautiful as you do it!  Could you maybe teach me?
2-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=seductive,I'd be quite the pirate if I could shoot like you!  Can you give me some tips?
2-female_removing_minor,target:misato,targetStage:2=seductive,So what's your story, dear?  Don't you keep going on about "Angels" or something like that?  I'm curious.
2-female_removing_minor,target:misato,targetStage:2=seductive,I keep hearing about these "Angel" attacks.  Are they bad?  Because you came out looking pretty cute.
2-female_removing_minor,target:misato,targetStage:2=vain,Don't you fight "Angels" or something, dear?  I hope you don't mistake <i>me</i> for one...I could understand doing so.
2-female_removing_minor,target:misato,targetStage:2=teasing,So you're all about fighting off "Angels"?  Hey, you're looking at one...<i>don't shoot, darling</i>.
2-female_removed_minor=vain,My Barnette would be nearly out by now.  She only wears, like, three things.
2-female_removed_minor=seductive,I should show you the pictures I took with Ezra's baby.  She's the most <i>adorable</i> thing!
2-female_removed_minor=thinking,Does Parfet wear anything besides that jumpsuit of hers?  Though it <i>is</i> kind of cute.
2-female_removed_minor=interested,So, you represent the pinnacle of Earth fashion, right?
2-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4=laughing,...Hoo.  You are <i>really</i> throwing them back, dear.  Got an extra liver?
2-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4=interested,...Honey, is this typical for you?  Did one of these silly Earth men reject you earlier tonight?  What's with the drinking?
2-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4=interested,You, uh, alright there, Sei?  Because <i>I</i> don't drink that much, and I've got about two feet on you.
2-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4=stretching,It's weird seeing a blue-haired girl knock them back like you do.  Meia never drinks, because she hates fun.
2-female_removed_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2=laughing,<i>Hahahaha</i>!  I <i>knew</i> you had a dirty side, Elizabeth!  No girl that sweet would come here in <i>that</i>.
2-female_removed_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2=laughing,<i>Ha</i>!  You really had me going for a while, dear, but it seems you're just as naughty as the rest of us!  Look at that thing!
2-female_removed_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2=laughing,<i>Pfft</i>.  Why'd you bother with the sweet-and-innocent act when you've got <i>fetish gear</i> underneath?
2-female_removed_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2=teasing,Now I can see what's got you all hot-and-bothered.  You're not sweet--you're just choking yourself, you little nymph!
2-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2=vain,All good now?  Then let's keep it up.  This is fun!
2-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2=seductive,That bodysuit <i>does</i> look comfortable.  Let's make this a good time!
2-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2=laughing,I'm without my boots, and you're without your armor.  They're putting dents in us, Meia--let's pay them back.
2-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2=stretching,Those horrible Earth people have claimed my boots and your armor.  Will their cruelty never end?
2-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=excited,Omigosh, I <i>have</i> to introduce you to Barnette.  She's a total gun nut!
2-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=seductive,My girlfriend <i>loves</i> those old men's weapons.  You've just <i>got</i> to meet her!
2-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=excited,I never knew those clunky old men's weapons could make something so--so <i>beautiful</i>!  Barnette would be so happy to meet you!
2-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=seductive,How can you spend all this time practicing your aim and still be so <i>cute</i>?  Then again, my darling Barnette is the same way.
2-female_removed_minor,target:chell,targetStage:1=laughing,Really sticking to your guns, eh, Miss Motormouth?  Was this always your identity, or did you discover it after a night with duct tape?
2-female_removed_minor,target:chell,targetStage:1=interested,...I really hope you have a hobby, sweetie.  Because this silent treatment isn't much of an identity.
2-female_removed_minor,target:chell,targetStage:1=stretching,You know what kind of woman I like?  Ones who pay me compliments.  Maybe I'd return them.
2-female_removed_minor,target:chell,targetStage:1=smug,At what age did you start worrying your parents, dear?  At least you grew to be a functioning adult despite your disability.
2-female_removed_minor,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:1=teasing,Hey, honey...you can lift me up <i>any</i> time you want.  I don't mind.
2-female_removed_minor,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:1=seductive,I like how strong she is, though.  You look like a chunk of muscle yourself, too!
2-female_removed_minor,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:1=teasing,I can appreciate a woman with muscles...mostly because she could spin me around.  So you two are good in my book.
2-female_removed_minor,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:1=seductive,Hey, you're both pretty cute.  And so strong!  How do you find the time to exercise so much?
2-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1,saidMarker:fama_and_oma=confused,...Wait, what's a mother?  Did I miss something?
2-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1,saidMarker:fama_and_oma=confused,...Your <i>mother</i>?  What's that?  Did I say that?
2-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1,saidMarker:fama_and_oma=awkward,...OK, you lost me.  I called you short, and now...you're talking about your "mother," whatever <i>that</i> is.
2-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1,saidMarker:fama_and_oma=thinking,...What's a <i>mother</i>?  I said <i>Fama</i>.  Oh wait, that's not a thing on Earth, right?  Or...is it?
2-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1=laughing,I don't know, dear.  Did you not have your glasses on when you were looking for your sense of humor?
2-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1=teasing,Hey, at least you've got some fighting spirit!  Pint-sized Hibiki is the same way, so I guess shortness transcends sex.
2-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1=smug,Yeah, can't crack a joke about Hibiki's height without him getting all huffy, either.  You shorties are such hotheads.
2-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1=vain,You Earth girls always call my clothes skimpy, like I'm supposed to be ashamed of my body.  But then, I have a lot more of it.
2-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=shocked,Eep!  A-are you OK, Aimee?  Do you need help?  Is there a doctor in here?
2-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=shocked,Eek!  A-Aimee!  Are you OK?  <i>Say something</i>!
2-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=shocked,A-Aimee!  What's wrong?  Are you hit?  Did someone sabotage you?
2-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=shocked,Ack!  Aimee!  Are you alright?  Is there anything I can get you?  Did the gun misfire?
2-female_removed_minor,target:moon,targetStage:5=annoyed,I'd ask to try it on, but it's probably got lice.  Why infect only one part of your body?
2-female_removed_minor,target:moon,targetStage:5=annoyed,Maybe it's best if you kept it on.  That way you could lose and leave faster.
2-female_removed_minor,target:moon,targetStage:5=annoyed,Don't let us stop you.  You could keep the hat and just strip like you want...on the sidewalk outside.
2-female_removed_minor,target:moon,targetStage:5=angry,Why'd you play this game anyway?  Just strip outside if you're not going to play for the fun of the tease...or talk to any of us.
2-female_removed_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2=seductive,You had a <i>gun</i>?  And it's an old clunky kinetic one--my girlfriend collects those things!  Can I see it?
2-female_removed_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2=seductive,Oh, look at that--a men's kinetic weapon, cleverly concealed!  My girlfriend Barnette has a whole collection!
2-female_removed_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2=smug,You're a <i>spacefarer</i>, and still you cling to old men's guns?  You're just like my girlfriend, though she's just a collector.
2-female_removed_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2=vain,I thought a spacefarer would know better than to rely on mechanical sidearms.  But then, my girlfriend has laser rings and she still likes those things.
2-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=shocked,...<i>Yeah.  Yeah, I understand now.  Sorry</i>.
2-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=shocked,<i>Eeek!  W-what's wrong with your--u-uh, I'm sorry!  It's not so bad, really</i>!
2-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=awkward,...Oh no, they're...interesting.  They look great.  You look great.  It's a style.
2-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=shocked,<i>Eep!  D-don't touch--er, uh, they're--cute!  Yes.  Very cute</i>.
2-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=smug,This isn't exactly Meia's idea of fun like it is mine.  I mean, she <i>likes</i> feeling sexy, but she'd never admit it.
2-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=teasing,Meia's not the type to admit it when she's having fun.  Don't worry, you're good company for her.
2-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=laughing,Don't let Meia fool you into thinking she doesn't like feeling sexy.  Just look at that suit she wears--her butt is constantly on display!
2-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=stretching,Oh, Meia's every bit the sultry young thing I am.  She just likes hiding it and playing hard-to-get.
2-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:1=shocked,Wait, you--you--<i>oh, wow.  You weren't kidding</i>.  Uh...so, uh, what's it like using magic?
2-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:1=shocked,...OK.  Yes.  You're a real witch.  I believe it.  Excellent job.
2-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:1=awkward,Wait, where'd they go?  Did you just make them--<i>vanish</i>?  And I thought what the Paksis did was impressive...
2-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:1=shocked,...OK.  I thought our technology was pretty impressive...but I can't tell what you just did.  That thing looks like a <i>stick</i>!


#lost sleeves
3-male_removing_minor=interested,Giving me yet another illustrative look into men's wardrobes?
3-male_removing_minor=excited,Men and women marry on Earth, right?  Do you go on dates first?  For how long?  Are you monogamous?  How often do you have sex?
3-male_removing_minor=seductive,Won't you <i>please</i> take off some more?  For sweet little Jura?
3-male_removing_minor=thinking,Bart's got his uniform to strip, which could be a lot...somehow the Paksis always makes him naked when he pilots, though.
3-male_removed_minor=teasing,Hey, it's your <i>tube</i> I want to see.  Men's clothes are tacky.
3-male_removed_minor=seductive,Please take off some more, ~name~...I'm <i>so</i> curious about men.
3-male_removed_minor=vain,Tarakkians are so much more bold than you Earth men.  I guess we Mejarians have put them on edge after all these years.
3-male_removed_minor=laughing,Look, men's fashion just doesn't interest me.  Your <i>organs</i>, on the other hand...
3-male_removed_minor,target:link,targetStage:2=annoyed,Seriously, honey, <i>what</i> is the deal with the grunting?  It was funny for five minutes, but now it's embarrassing.
3-male_removed_minor,target:link,targetStage:2=interested,...So this is your identity, huh?  Just going to grunt?  Yeah, I think I'll find a man who's capable of telling me I'm beautiful.
3-male_removed_minor,target:link,targetStage:2=bored,I know you're overcome by my beauty, Elf-man, but this yelping thing is no longer endearing.  <i>Sheesh</i>.
3-male_removed_minor,target:link,targetStage:2=teasing,Maybe you're unaware, Elf-man, but I'm the kind of woman who's into dirty talk...so you're not really being my type at the moment.
3-female_removing_minor=teasing,I'm on the edge of my seat.  What could be hiding under there, a few inches of skin?
3-female_removing_minor=laughing,You tease better than I do, ~name~, and I don't think you're even trying.
3-female_removing_minor=vain,I wonder what Paiway will look like when she's old enough to come here.  Her little nurse outfit is so cute!
3-female_removing_minor=thinking,Barnette barely wears anything, but would she be good at cards?  She must--she takes after Gascogne everywhere else.
3-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:1=seductive,Omigosh, Faye, that jacket is so <i>stylish</i>!  And the way you let it hang there just <i>screams</i> personality.

3-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1=seductive,OK, I think everyone'll be happy with <i>that</i> one.
3-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1=confused,That's more along the lines of what I expected.  Don't freak me out like that, Meia, OK?
3-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1=confused,I guess that armor's a little sentimental, too.  Gee, your outfit's nothing but personal mementos.
3-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1=confused,That's what you're going with?  Didn't you bring a laser ring or something else small?
3-female_removing_minor,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=confused,Hm?  Oh, right, you brought your partner along.  Why isn't <i>she</i> playing?  Or saying anything?

3-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=confused,Oh, you're taking off the gloves now?  I just figured you really liked them.
3-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=confused,Oh, the gloves?  I thought you were just committed to some kind of fashion statement.  Why now?
3-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=confused,Hey, Kyoko, you look mortified.  Something happen?  Bad memories of men resurfacing?
3-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=confused,Hey, Miss Pokerface, you're not really living up the nickname anymore.  What's wrong?
3-female_removing_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:3,marker:planet-countries=vain,Ohhh, so <i>that's</i> what it's called?  Short and simple...and <i>romantic</i>.  And they speak it on Planet France?

3-female_removing_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:3,marker:planet-countries=seductive,And is every woman on Planet France as cute-looking and sounding as you?  It sounds like <i>heaven</i>, then!

3-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=teasing,We <i>are</i> pirates, Elizabeth...but don't worry, you're too much of a sweetheart to kill and rob!
3-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=seductive,Don't you worry your pretty little head off about it, honey.  We may be pirates, but we only attack nasty soldier types.
3-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=vain,Pirates we are, Elizabeth...and we've got <i>so</i> many stories of high adventure and death-defying stunts to tell.
3-female_removed_minor=teasing,Your outfit is all over the place.  Come aboard the Nirvana and I'll give you a full Mejarian makeover!
3-female_removed_minor=confused,Earth women's wardrobes are such a mishmash.  How many competing groups of people live over there, anyway?
3-female_removed_minor=stretching,I guess when you're forced to live inside giant gears, your wardrobe suffers.  Poor Earthlings.
3-female_removed_minor=confused,Have you been with a man, ~name~?  I was told they really don't care about fashion...
3-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:1=shocked,Wait, you--you--<i>oh, wow.  You weren't kidding</i>.  Uh...so, uh, what's it like using magic?
3-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:1=shocked,...OK.  Yes.  You're a real witch.  I believe it.  Excellent job.
3-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:1=awkward,Wait, where'd they go?  Did you just make them--<i>vanish</i>?  And I thought what the Paksis did was impressive...
3-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:1=shocked,...OK.  I thought our technology was pretty impressive...but I can't tell what you just did.  That thing looks like a <i>stick</i>!
3-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=smug,This isn't exactly Meia's idea of fun like it is mine.  I mean, she <i>likes</i> feeling sexy, but she'd never admit it.
3-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=teasing,Meia's not the type to admit it when she's having fun.  Don't worry, you're good company for her.
3-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=laughing,Don't let Meia fool you into thinking she doesn't like feeling sexy.  Just look at that suit she wears--her butt is constantly on display!
3-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=stretching,Oh, Meia's every bit the sultry young thing I am.  She just likes hiding it and playing hard-to-get.
3-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1,saidMarker:fama_and_oma=confused,...Wait, what's a mother?  Did I miss something?
3-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1,saidMarker:fama_and_oma=confused,...Your <i>mother</i>?  What's that?  Did I say that?
3-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1,saidMarker:fama_and_oma=awkward,...OK, you lost me.  I called you short, and now...you're talking about your "mother," whatever <i>that</i> is.
3-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1,saidMarker:fama_and_oma=thinking,...What's a <i>mother</i>?  I said <i>Fama</i>.  Oh wait, that's not a thing on Earth, right?  Or...is it?
3-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=excited,Omigosh, I <i>have</i> to introduce you to Barnette.  She's a total gun nut!
3-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=seductive,My girlfriend <i>loves</i> those old men's weapons.  You've just <i>got</i> to meet her!
3-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=excited,I never knew those clunky old men's weapons could make something so--so <i>beautiful</i>!  Barnette would be so happy to meet you!
3-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=seductive,How can you spend all this time practicing your aim and still be so <i>cute</i>?  Then again, my darling Barnette is the same way.
3-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=shocked,Eep!  A-are you OK, Aimee?  Do you need help?  Is there a doctor in here?
3-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=shocked,Eek!  A-Aimee!  Are you OK?  <i>Say something</i>!
3-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=shocked,A-Aimee!  What's wrong?  Are you hit?  Did someone sabotage you?
3-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=shocked,Ack!  Aimee!  Are you alright?  Is there anything I can get you?  Did the gun misfire?
3-female_removed_minor,target:chell,targetStage:1=laughing,Really sticking to your guns, eh, Miss Motormouth?  Was this always your identity, or did you discover it after a night with duct tape?
3-female_removed_minor,target:chell,targetStage:1=interested,...I really hope you have a hobby, sweetie.  Because this silent treatment isn't much of an identity.
3-female_removed_minor,target:chell,targetStage:1=stretching,You know what kind of woman I like?  Ones who pay me compliments.  Maybe I'd return them.
3-female_removed_minor,target:chell,targetStage:1=smug,At what age did you start worrying your parents, dear?  At least you grew to be a functioning adult despite your disability.
3-female_removed_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2=laughing,<i>Hahahaha</i>!  I <i>knew</i> you had a dirty side, Elizabeth!  No girl that sweet would come here in <i>that</i>.
3-female_removed_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2=laughing,<i>Ha</i>!  You really had me going for a while, dear, but it seems you're just as naughty as the rest of us!  Look at that thing!
3-female_removed_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2=laughing,<i>Pfft</i>.  Why'd you bother with the sweet-and-innocent act when you've got <i>fetish gear</i> underneath?
3-female_removed_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2=teasing,Now I can see what's got you all hot-and-bothered.  You're not sweet--you're just choking yourself, you little nymph!
3-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1=laughing,I don't know, dear.  Did you not have your glasses on when you were looking for your sense of humor?
3-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1=teasing,Hey, at least you've got some fighting spirit!  Pint-sized Hibiki is the same way, so I guess shortness transcends sex.
3-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1=smug,Yeah, can't crack a joke about Hibiki's height without him getting all huffy, either.  You shorties are such hotheads.
3-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1=vain,You Earth girls always call my clothes skimpy, like I'm supposed to be ashamed of my body.  But then, I have a lot more of it.
3-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=shocked,...<i>Yeah.  Yeah, I understand now.  Sorry</i>.
3-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=shocked,<i>Eeek!  W-what's wrong with your--u-uh, I'm sorry!  It's not so bad, really</i>!
3-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=awkward,...Oh no, they're...interesting.  They look great.  You look great.  It's a style.
3-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=shocked,<i>Eep!  D-don't touch--er, uh, they're--cute!  Yes.  Very cute</i>.
3-female_removed_minor,target:moon,targetStage:5=annoyed,I'd ask to try it on, but it's probably got lice.  Why infect only one part of your body?
3-female_removed_minor,target:moon,targetStage:5=annoyed,Maybe it's best if you kept it on.  That way you could lose and leave faster.
3-female_removed_minor,target:moon,targetStage:5=annoyed,Don't let us stop you.  You could keep the hat and just strip like you want...on the sidewalk outside.
3-female_removed_minor,target:moon,targetStage:5=angry,Why'd you play this game anyway?  Just strip outside if you're not going to play for the fun of the tease...or talk to any of us.
3-female_removed_minor,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:1=teasing,Hey, honey...you can lift me up <i>any</i> time you want.  I don't mind.
3-female_removed_minor,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:1=seductive,I like how strong she is, though.  You look like a chunk of muscle yourself, too!
3-female_removed_minor,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:1=teasing,I can appreciate a woman with muscles...mostly because she could spin me around.  So you two are good in my book.
3-female_removed_minor,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:1=seductive,Hey, you're both pretty cute.  And so strong!  How do you find the time to exercise so much?
3-female_removed_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2=seductive,You had a <i>gun</i>?  And it's an old clunky kinetic one--my girlfriend collects those things!  Can I see it?
3-female_removed_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2=seductive,Oh, look at that--a men's kinetic weapon, cleverly concealed!  My girlfriend Barnette has a whole collection!
3-female_removed_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2=smug,You're a <i>spacefarer</i>, and still you cling to old men's guns?  You're just like my girlfriend, though she's just a collector.
3-female_removed_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2=vain,I thought a spacefarer would know better than to rely on mechanical sidearms.  But then, my girlfriend has laser rings and she still likes those things.
3-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4=laughing,...Hoo.  You are <i>really</i> throwing them back, dear.  Got an extra liver?
3-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4=interested,...Honey, is this typical for you?  Did one of these silly Earth men reject you earlier tonight?  What's with the drinking?
3-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4=interested,You, uh, alright there, Sei?  Because <i>I</i> don't drink that much, and I've got about two feet on you.
3-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4=stretching,It's weird seeing a blue-haired girl knock them back like you do.  Meia never drinks, because she hates fun.
3-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2=seductive,See, <i>now</i> you're looking friendlier.  It's poker, not piloting!
3-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2=smug,You didn't need that armor anyway.  I don't think <i>these</i> Earthlings are out to kill us.
3-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2=teasing,This place <i>does</i> look kind of sketchy, but that armor made us seem abrasive, you know?
3-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2=vain,Better off without the armor.  We've got to look friendly, being Mejare's representatives and all.


#lost choker
4-male_removing_minor=teasing,~Clothing~, huh?  Solid choice.  Am <i>I</i> making you solid at all?
4-male_removing_minor=interested,Pretty minor.  I expect bold choices from a man, you know.
4-male_removing_minor=stretching,Guess Tarak didn't invent the whole no-fun-allowed thing for men.
4-male_removing_minor=laughing,What am I to do with such a boring specimen?  I mean, look at all the exciting items I've removed!
4-male_removed_minor=seductive,Didn't think a man would be a tease...at least, not as much as I am.
4-male_removed_minor=seductive,I'm very interested in men...won't you take off more for me, please?
4-male_removed_minor=teasing,Hey.  You're trapped in a small room with a gorgeous foreign young woman.  She <i>desperately</i> wants you take some more clothes off.
4-male_removed_minor=vain,Shame Hibiki's so lousy at cards, or I'd have brought him here.  I mean, he's already so insecure about his height--imagine the rest of him!
4-male_removed_minor,target:link,targetStage:2=annoyed,Seriously, honey, <i>what</i> is the deal with the grunting?  It was funny for five minutes, but now it's embarrassing.
4-male_removed_minor,target:link,targetStage:2=interested,...So this is your identity, huh?  Just going to grunt?  Yeah, I think I'll find a man who's capable of telling me I'm beautiful.
4-male_removed_minor,target:link,targetStage:2=bored,I know you're overcome by my beauty, Elf-man, but this yelping thing is no longer endearing.  <i>Sheesh</i>.
4-male_removed_minor,target:link,targetStage:2=teasing,Maybe you're unaware, Elf-man, but I'm the kind of woman who's into dirty talk...so you're not really being my type at the moment.
4-female_removing_minor=teasing,A boring choice for a boring woman.
4-female_removing_minor=laughing,That alone is probably more than everything I've lost so far.
4-female_removing_minor=bored,This game just isn't grabbing me.  Maybe I'll return to my life as a heroic pilot.
4-female_removing_minor=confused,Does that outfit attract men?  Or are they solely focused on what's underneath?
4-female_removing_minor,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=confused,Hm?  Oh, right, you brought your partner along.  Why isn't <i>she</i> playing?  Or saying anything?
4-female_removing_minor,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=interested,Your partner seems like the strong, silent type.  Not sure which part to emphasize.
4-female_removing_minor,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=laughing,Is that your wrestling partner helping you out?  What a loyal friend...even if she doesn't have much on her mind.
4-female_removing_minor,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=confused,Hey, this table's full!  Oh, she's just helping you...and has little to say about it.
4-female_removing_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:3,marker:planet-countries=vain,Ohhh, so <i>that's</i> what it's called?  Short and simple...and <i>romantic</i>.  And they speak it on Planet France?
4-female_removing_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:3,marker:planet-countries=vain,And is that the official language of Planet France?  I simply <i>have</i> to move there, then!
4-female_removing_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:3,marker:planet-countries=seductive,And is every woman on Planet France as cute-looking and sounding as you?  It sounds like <i>heaven</i>, then!
4-female_removing_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:3,marker:planet-countries=excited,Omigosh, Marinette!  You're from planet "France," right?  And <i>everyone</i> speaks French there?  That's so exciting!
4-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=excited,Every bullet looks like it's going to hit you, and then it just grazes!  It's spectacular!  Can it be taught?
4-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=seductive,Could you shoot my dress off, too?  Not that I'd <i>want</i> you to, but could you?  Could I <i>learn</i> how to do it?
4-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=excited,Absolutely phenomenal!  And you even manage to look beautiful as you do it!  Could you maybe teach me?
4-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=seductive,I'd be quite the pirate if I could shoot like you!  Can you give me some tips?
4-female_removing_minor,target:misato,targetStage:2=seductive,So what's your story, dear?  Don't you keep going on about "Angels" or something like that?  I'm curious.
4-female_removing_minor,target:misato,targetStage:2=seductive,I keep hearing about these "Angel" attacks.  Are they bad?  Because you came out looking pretty cute.
4-female_removing_minor,target:misato,targetStage:2=vain,Don't you fight "Angels" or something, dear?  I hope you don't mistake <i>me</i> for one...I could understand doing so.
4-female_removing_minor,target:misato,targetStage:2=teasing,So you're all about fighting off "Angels"?  Hey, you're looking at one...<i>don't shoot, darling</i>.
4-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=excited,I can't get over how cool this is.  You should join our crew with aim like that!
4-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=excited,...That's never going to get old.  It's brilliant to watch!
4-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=excited,The skill is one thing, but the <i>daring</i>!  You're not scared at all!
4-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=excited,This is unreal.  I never knew Earth women could be so <i>cool</i>!  Or daring!  Or spunky!
4-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=confused,Uh...you alright, Miss Detective?  What's up?
4-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=confused,Oh, you're taking off the gloves now?  I just figured you really liked them.
4-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=confused,Oh, the gloves?  I thought you were just committed to some kind of fashion statement.  Why now?
4-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=confused,Hey, Kyoko, you look mortified.  Something happen?  Bad memories of men resurfacing?
4-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=confused,Hey, Miss Pokerface, you're not really living up the nickname anymore.  What's wrong?
4-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=teasing,That we are, Lizzie!  I'm glad you're so interested in these boring old alien women.
4-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=teasing,We <i>are</i> pirates, Elizabeth...but don't worry, you're too much of a sweetheart to kill and rob!
4-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=seductive,Don't you worry your pretty little head off about it, honey.  We may be pirates, but we only attack nasty soldier types.
4-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=vain,Pirates we are, Elizabeth...and we've got <i>so</i> many stories of high adventure and death-defying stunts to tell.
4-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=stretching,Well, at least you brought your girlfriend to help through this.  I <i>hope</i> Barnette wouldn't be so cowardly.
4-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=seductive,Oh, so you two are lovers?  That's so <i>adorable</i>!  I've been going steady with Barnette for a while now.
4-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10,marker:fama_and_oma=laughing,<i>Teeheehee</i>!  I didn't know you two were <i>that</i> close!  I can tell Florina here is more Fama material, being all demure.
4-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=seductive,<i>Ohhh, I get it</i>!  Lyn's helping you overcome your fears!  What an adorable couple you two are, helping each other out!
4-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1=seductive,This'll cheer you up, right?  Or at least free you up.  Come on, it's not so bad.
4-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1=seductive,It's OK, Meia, come on.  Get into the spirit of things and relax!  Gascogne wouldn't want to see you all embarrassed like this.
4-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1=seductive,That's it.  That armor just reminds you of fighting the Harvest.  Lighten up and enjoy yourself for once!
4-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1=laughing,Don't be sour the <i>whole</i> night.  What will Earth think of Mejare, besides how it's got a pirate problem?
4-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:1=seductive,Omigosh, Faye, that jacket is so <i>stylish</i>!  And the way you let it hang there just <i>screams</i> personality.
4-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:1=vain,I like your style, honey!  A scarlet-red jacket, just draped all sexy-like around your delicate frame...<i>exquisite</i>.
4-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:1=vain,Ooh, that jacket is so <i>cool</i>-looking!  My dress is the only fancy thing I own...such is the life of a pirate.
4-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:1=teasing,Ooh, I barely noticed that thing, the way you draped it around yourself with <i>style</i>!  You've got an eye for sex appeal, honey.
4-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0=laughing,<i>Hahahaha</i>!  Oh, don't take things so seriously!  You're still cute--you're just a little on the short side, that's all!
4-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0=seductive,<i>Oh, relax</i>!  I'm just teasing you, honey--it's not often on Mejare you meet a woman so short!
4-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0=teasing,I'm just teasing, dear!  Don't take it personally--I'm quite used to towering over women.
4-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0=vain,Oh, are you sensitive about your height?  Don't worry, dear--I hear short <i>men</i> get much more flack for it.
4-female_removing_minor,target:moon,targetStage:4=frustrated,Should I ask why you wear so much extra stuff when you just want to take it off in a hurry?
4-female_removing_minor,target:moon,targetStage:4=annoyed,<i>I'm</i> trying to be sensual and fun.  <i>This</i> girl is advertising her diseases.
4-female_removing_minor,target:moon,targetStage:4=awkward,...You all know I'm just flirting, right?  I'm not like this girl, I swear.
4-female_removing_minor,target:moon,targetStage:4=frustrated,I can't believe what I'm hearing.  I was just making jokes about Earth girls being sex fiends thanks to men...and now I meet one.
4-female_removed_minor=smug,So, ~name~, been on a date with a man?  Had sex with one?  I'm curious what Earth girls do with their time.
4-female_removed_minor=teasing,Since your wardrobe is uninteresting, how's your sex life?  Do Earth women sleep with each other?
4-female_removed_minor=smug,You know what clothes of mine I'd consider "minor"?  None of them.  Go for extremes.
4-female_removed_minor=thinking,Meia has that bodysuit she loves so much...but that's really it.  And I doubt there's anything else besides that smock she thinks passes for pajamas.
4-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=smug,This isn't exactly Meia's idea of fun like it is mine.  I mean, she <i>likes</i> feeling sexy, but she'd never admit it.

4-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1,saidMarker:fama_and_oma=awkward,...OK, you lost me.  I called you short, and now...you're talking about your "mother," whatever <i>that</i> is.
4-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1,saidMarker:fama_and_oma=thinking,...What's a <i>mother</i>?  I said <i>Fama</i>.  Oh wait, that's not a thing on Earth, right?  Or...is it?
4-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=excited,Omigosh, I <i>have</i> to introduce you to Barnette.  She's a total gun nut!
4-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=seductive,My girlfriend <i>loves</i> those old men's weapons.  You've just <i>got</i> to meet her!
4-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=excited,I never knew those clunky old men's weapons could make something so--so <i>beautiful</i>!  Barnette would be so happy to meet you!

4-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:1=shocked,...OK.  Yes.  You're a real witch.  I believe it.  Excellent job.
4-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:1=awkward,Wait, where'd they go?  Did you just make them--<i>vanish</i>?  And I thought what the Paksis did was impressive...
4-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:1=shocked,...OK.  I thought our technology was pretty impressive...but I can't tell what you just did.  That thing looks like a <i>stick</i>!
4-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1=laughing,I don't know, dear.  Did you not have your glasses on when you were looking for your sense of humor?
4-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1=teasing,Hey, at least you've got some fighting spirit!  Pint-sized Hibiki is the same way, so I guess shortness transcends sex.
4-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1=smug,Yeah, can't crack a joke about Hibiki's height without him getting all huffy, either.  You shorties are such hotheads.
4-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1=vain,You Earth girls always call my clothes skimpy, like I'm supposed to be ashamed of my body.  But then, I have a lot more of it.
4-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4=laughing,...Hoo.  You are <i>really</i> throwing them back, dear.  Got an extra liver?
4-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4=interested,...Honey, is this typical for you?  Did one of these silly Earth men reject you earlier tonight?  What's with the drinking?
4-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4=interested,You, uh, alright there, Sei?  Because <i>I</i> don't drink that much, and I've got about two feet on you.
4-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4=stretching,It's weird seeing a blue-haired girl knock them back like you do.  Meia never drinks, because she hates fun.
4-female_removed_minor,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,So, ~name~, been on a date with a man?  Had sex with one?  I'm curious what Earth girls do with their time.
4-female_removed_minor,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Since your wardrobe is uninteresting, how's your sex life?  Do Earth women sleep with each other?
4-female_removed_minor,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,You know what clothes of mine I'd consider "minor"?  None of them.  Go for extremes.
4-female_removed_minor,alsoPlaying:meia=stretching,Good thing you're here, Meia.  I wasn't sure how many pieces your outfit was.
4-female_removed_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2=seductive,You had a <i>gun</i>?  And it's an old clunky kinetic one--my girlfriend collects those things!  Can I see it?
4-female_removed_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2=seductive,Oh, look at that--a men's kinetic weapon, cleverly concealed!  My girlfriend Barnette has a whole collection!
4-female_removed_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2=smug,You're a <i>spacefarer</i>, and still you cling to old men's guns?  You're just like my girlfriend, though she's just a collector.
4-female_removed_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2=vain,I thought a spacefarer would know better than to rely on mechanical sidearms.  But then, my girlfriend has laser rings and she still likes those things.
4-female_removed_minor,target:moon,targetStage:5=annoyed,I'd ask to try it on, but it's probably got lice.  Why infect only one part of your body?
4-female_removed_minor,target:moon,targetStage:5=annoyed,Maybe it's best if you kept it on.  That way you could lose and leave faster.
4-female_removed_minor,target:moon,targetStage:5=annoyed,Don't let us stop you.  You could keep the hat and just strip like you want...on the sidewalk outside.
4-female_removed_minor,target:moon,targetStage:5=angry,Why'd you play this game anyway?  Just strip outside if you're not going to play for the fun of the tease...or talk to any of us.
4-female_removed_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2=laughing,<i>Hahahaha</i>!  I <i>knew</i> you had a dirty side, Elizabeth!  No girl that sweet would come here in <i>that</i>.
4-female_removed_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2=laughing,<i>Ha</i>!  You really had me going for a while, dear, but it seems you're just as naughty as the rest of us!  Look at that thing!
4-female_removed_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2=laughing,<i>Pfft</i>.  Why'd you bother with the sweet-and-innocent act when you've got <i>fetish gear</i> underneath?
4-female_removed_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2=teasing,Now I can see what's got you all hot-and-bothered.  You're not sweet--you're just choking yourself, you little nymph!
4-female_removed_minor,target:chell,targetStage:1=laughing,Really sticking to your guns, eh, Miss Motormouth?  Was this always your identity, or did you discover it after a night with duct tape?
4-female_removed_minor,target:chell,targetStage:1=interested,...I really hope you have a hobby, sweetie.  Because this silent treatment isn't much of an identity.
4-female_removed_minor,target:chell,targetStage:1=stretching,You know what kind of woman I like?  Ones who pay me compliments.  Maybe I'd return them.
4-female_removed_minor,target:chell,targetStage:1=smug,At what age did you start worrying your parents, dear?  At least you grew to be a functioning adult despite your disability.
4-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2=teasing,And now without those bulky shoulder pads, we can see that adorable frame of yours!  How <i>svelte</i>.
4-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2=seductive,See?  No more oppressive collar.  Breathe easy and have fun!  I just want my squadron leader to be happy.
4-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2=vain,Isn't that better?  All lithe in your bodysuit.  I don't want my boss to be all pent-up and boil over one day.


#lost dress
5-male_removing_minor=bored,Oh, boo.  I wanted to see you naked!
5-male_removing_minor=frustrated,That's so minor, I would've preferred something smaller.  You're a <i>man</i>, indulge me a little!
5-male_removing_minor=annoyed,What's Duero got under that labcoat of his?  Don't know, but at least he'd <i>show</i> me.
5-male_removing_minor=bored,That bastard Rabat would probably be pretty good at this game.  He's the type to frequent seedy places like this.
5-male_removed_minor=bored,Aren't my breasts enough to make you want to lose a little more?
5-male_removed_minor=seductive,Won't you take off a little more?  For my sake?  <i>Pretty please</i>?
5-male_removed_minor=annoyed,Mr. Earth-man must think he's funny, taunting the Mejarian who just wants to see his tube.
5-male_removed_minor=angry,Just because an Earth man has seen women's breasts before doesn't mean you should taunt me about my inexperience.  <i>Show something good</i>!
5-male_removed_minor,target:link,targetStage:2=annoyed,Seriously, honey, <i>what</i> is the deal with the grunting?  It was funny for five minutes, but now it's embarrassing.
5-male_removed_minor,target:link,targetStage:2=interested,...So this is your identity, huh?  Just going to grunt?  Yeah, I think I'll find a man who's capable of telling me I'm beautiful.
5-male_removed_minor,target:link,targetStage:2=bored,I know you're overcome by my beauty, Elf-man, but this yelping thing is no longer endearing.  <i>Sheesh</i>.
5-male_removed_minor,target:link,targetStage:2=teasing,Maybe you're unaware, Elf-man, but I'm the kind of woman who's into dirty talk...so you're not really being my type at the moment.
5-female_removing_minor=bored,Apparently Earth women subscribe to Meia's idea of fun.
5-female_removing_minor=bored,What a letdown.  I should just masturbate already--that'd be fun, at least.
5-female_removing_minor=annoyed,Yeah, yeah, we get it.  You're a real poker master.  Show some skin already.
5-female_removing_minor=confused,That was all the Mejarian fashion I had to show off.  Is your outfit common on Earth?
5-female_removing_minor,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,Apparently Earth women subscribe to your ideas of fun, Meia.  Well, maybe not the whole Dread-formations thing.
5-female_removing_minor,alsoPlaying:meia=bored,What a letdown.  I should just masturbate already--that'd be fun, at least.
5-female_removing_minor,alsoPlaying:meia=annoyed,Yeah, yeah, we get it.  You're a real poker master.  Show some skin already.
5-female_removing_minor,alsoPlaying:meia=confused,That was all the Mejarian fashion I had to show off.  Is your outfit common on Earth?
5-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1=interested,OK...that's more what I espected.  Don't get all weird on me.
5-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1=seductive,That's better.  Be the Meia I know and love, why don't you?  Just a little sexier.
5-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1=seductive,OK, <i>that</i> I can get behind.  Go back to the Meia I'm used to, please.
5-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1=teasing,There's the Meia I know!  Already taking off the good stuff, and insisting she isn't sexy.
5-female_removing_minor,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=confused,Hm?  Oh, right, you brought your partner along.  Why isn't <i>she</i> playing?  Or saying anything?
5-female_removing_minor,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=interested,Your partner seems like the strong, silent type.  Not sure which part to emphasize.
5-female_removing_minor,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=laughing,Is that your wrestling partner helping you out?  What a loyal friend...even if she doesn't have much on her mind.
5-female_removing_minor,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=confused,Hey, this table's full!  Oh, she's just helping you...and has little to say about it.
5-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=excited,I can't get over how cool this is.  You should join our crew with aim like that!
5-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=excited,...That's never going to get old.  It's brilliant to watch!
5-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=excited,The skill is one thing, but the <i>daring</i>!  You're not scared at all!
5-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=excited,This is unreal.  I never knew Earth women could be so <i>cool</i>!  Or daring!  Or spunky!
5-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=teasing,That we are, Lizzie!  I'm glad you're so interested in these boring old alien women.
5-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=teasing,We <i>are</i> pirates, Elizabeth...but don't worry, you're too much of a sweetheart to kill and rob!
5-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=seductive,Don't you worry your pretty little head off about it, honey.  We may be pirates, but we only attack nasty soldier types.
5-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=vain,Pirates we are, Elizabeth...and we've got <i>so</i> many stories of high adventure and death-defying stunts to tell.
5-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=confused,Uh...you alright, Miss Detective?  What's up?
5-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=confused,Oh, you're taking off the gloves now?  I just figured you really liked them.
5-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=confused,Oh, the gloves?  I thought you were just committed to some kind of fashion statement.  Why now?
5-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=confused,Hey, Kyoko, you look mortified.  Something happen?  Bad memories of men resurfacing?
5-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=confused,Hey, Miss Pokerface, you're not really living up the nickname anymore.  What's wrong?
5-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:1=seductive,Omigosh, Faye, that jacket is so <i>stylish</i>!  And the way you let it hang there just <i>screams</i> personality.
5-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:1=vain,I like your style, honey!  A scarlet-red jacket, just draped all sexy-like around your delicate frame...<i>exquisite</i>.
5-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:1=vain,Ooh, that jacket is so <i>cool</i>-looking!  My dress is the only fancy thing I own...such is the life of a pirate.
5-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:1=teasing,Ooh, I barely noticed that thing, the way you draped it around yourself with <i>style</i>!  You've got an eye for sex appeal, honey.
5-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=excited,Every bullet looks like it's going to hit you, and then it just grazes!  It's spectacular!  Can it be taught?
5-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=seductive,Could you shoot my dress off, too?  Not that I'd <i>want</i> you to, but could you?  Could I <i>learn</i> how to do it?
5-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=excited,Absolutely phenomenal!  And you even manage to look beautiful as you do it!  Could you maybe teach me?
5-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=seductive,I'd be quite the pirate if I could shoot like you!  Can you give me some tips?
5-female_removing_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:3,marker:planet-countries=vain,Ohhh, so <i>that's</i> what it's called?  Short and simple...and <i>romantic</i>.  And they speak it on Planet France?
5-female_removing_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:3,marker:planet-countries=vain,And is that the official language of Planet France?  I simply <i>have</i> to move there, then!
5-female_removing_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:3,marker:planet-countries=seductive,And is every woman on Planet France as cute-looking and sounding as you?  It sounds like <i>heaven</i>, then!
5-female_removing_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:3,marker:planet-countries=excited,Omigosh, Marinette!  You're from planet "France," right?  And <i>everyone</i> speaks French there?  That's so exciting!
5-female_removing_minor,target:moon,targetStage:4=frustrated,Should I ask why you wear so much extra stuff when you just want to take it off in a hurry?
5-female_removing_minor,target:moon,targetStage:4=annoyed,<i>I'm</i> trying to be sensual and fun.  <i>This</i> girl is advertising her diseases.
5-female_removing_minor,target:moon,targetStage:4=awkward,...You all know I'm just flirting, right?  I'm not like this girl, I swear.
5-female_removing_minor,target:moon,targetStage:4=frustrated,I can't believe what I'm hearing.  I was just making jokes about Earth girls being sex fiends thanks to men...and now I meet one.
5-female_removing_minor,target:misato,targetStage:2=seductive,So what's your story, dear?  Don't you keep going on about "Angels" or something like that?  I'm curious.
5-female_removing_minor,target:misato,targetStage:2=seductive,I keep hearing about these "Angel" attacks.  Are they bad?  Because you came out looking pretty cute.
5-female_removing_minor,target:misato,targetStage:2=vain,Don't you fight "Angels" or something, dear?  I hope you don't mistake <i>me</i> for one...I could understand doing so.
5-female_removing_minor,target:misato,targetStage:2=teasing,So you're all about fighting off "Angels"?  Hey, you're looking at one...<i>don't shoot, darling</i>.
5-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0=laughing,<i>Hahahaha</i>!  Oh, don't take things so seriously!  You're still cute--you're just a little on the short side, that's all!
5-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0=seductive,<i>Oh, relax</i>!  I'm just teasing you, honey--it's not often on Mejare you meet a woman so short!
5-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0=teasing,I'm just teasing, dear!  Don't take it personally--I'm quite used to towering over women.
5-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0=vain,Oh, are you sensitive about your height?  Don't worry, dear--I hear short <i>men</i> get much more flack for it.
5-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=stretching,Well, at least you brought your girlfriend to help through this.  I <i>hope</i> Barnette wouldn't be so cowardly.
5-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=seductive,Oh, so you two are lovers?  That's so <i>adorable</i>!  I've been going steady with Barnette for a while now.
5-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10,marker:fama_and_oma=laughing,<i>Teeheehee</i>!  I didn't know you two were <i>that</i> close!  I can tell Florina here is more Fama material, being all demure.
5-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=seductive,<i>Ohhh, I get it</i>!  Lyn's helping you overcome your fears!  What an adorable couple you two are, helping each other out!
5-female_removed_minor=bored,I'd have more fun watching myself strip in front of a mirror.  Better visual reward, too.
5-female_removed_minor=bored,Hey, Barnette would strip if I asked her.  I don't need this.
5-female_removed_minor=vain,My Barnette's more than a pilot...she runs the storage with Gascogne, too.  She's so smart!
5-female_removed_minor=thinking,Honestly, I wear a lot compared to my crewmates.  What's Dita got besides her jacket and skirt?  And her insatiable curiosity about men?
5-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:1=shocked,Wait, you--you--<i>oh, wow.  You weren't kidding</i>.  Uh...so, uh, what's it like using magic?
5-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:1=shocked,...OK.  Yes.  You're a real witch.  I believe it.  Excellent job.
5-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:1=awkward,Wait, where'd they go?  Did you just make them--<i>vanish</i>?  And I thought what the Paksis did was impressive...
5-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:1=shocked,...OK.  I thought our technology was pretty impressive...but I can't tell what you just did.  That thing looks like a <i>stick</i>!
5-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2=stretching,So what's the flight formations schedule tomorrow?  I know that's on your mind.
5-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2=seductive-2,You're not going to lecture me on our flight patterns tomorrow, right?  I know you'd rather be there.
5-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2=confused,Who'd you leave holding down the fort, anyway?  I don't see Barnette wrangling all our pilots without her guns...oh, what's the flight schedule look like tomorrow?
5-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2=seductive,So, uh...how's our flight practice shaping up tomorrow?  Any fancy formations you've dreamed up?
5-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=smug,This isn't exactly Meia's idea of fun like it is mine.  I mean, she <i>likes</i> feeling sexy, but she'd never admit it.
5-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=teasing,Meia's not the type to admit it when she's having fun.  Don't worry, you're good company for her.
5-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=laughing,Don't let Meia fool you into thinking she doesn't like feeling sexy.  Just look at that suit she wears--her butt is constantly on display!
5-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=stretching,Oh, Meia's every bit the sultry young thing I am.  She just likes hiding it and playing hard-to-get.
5-female_removed_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2=laughing,<i>Hahahaha</i>!  I <i>knew</i> you had a dirty side, Elizabeth!  No girl that sweet would come here in <i>that</i>.
5-female_removed_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2=laughing,<i>Ha</i>!  You really had me going for a while, dear, but it seems you're just as naughty as the rest of us!  Look at that thing!

5-female_removed_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2=teasing,Now I can see what's got you all hot-and-bothered.  You're not sweet--you're just choking yourself, you little nymph!
5-female_removed_minor,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:1=teasing,Hey, honey...you can lift me up <i>any</i> time you want.  I don't mind.
5-female_removed_minor,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:1=seductive,I like how strong she is, though.  You look like a chunk of muscle yourself, too!
5-female_removed_minor,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:1=teasing,I can appreciate a woman with muscles...mostly because she could spin me around.  So you two are good in my book.
5-female_removed_minor,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:1=seductive,Hey, you're both pretty cute.  And so strong!  How do you find the time to exercise so much?
5-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4=laughing,...Hoo.  You are <i>really</i> throwing them back, dear.  Got an extra liver?
5-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4=interested,...Honey, is this typical for you?  Did one of these silly Earth men reject you earlier tonight?  What's with the drinking?
5-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4=interested,You, uh, alright there, Sei?  Because <i>I</i> don't drink that much, and I've got about two feet on you.

5-female_removed_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2=seductive,You had a <i>gun</i>?  And it's an old clunky kinetic one--my girlfriend collects those things!  Can I see it?
5-female_removed_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2=seductive,Oh, look at that--a men's kinetic weapon, cleverly concealed!  My girlfriend Barnette has a whole collection!
5-female_removed_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2=smug,You're a <i>spacefarer</i>, and still you cling to old men's guns?  You're just like my girlfriend, though she's just a collector.
5-female_removed_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2=vain,I thought a spacefarer would know better than to rely on mechanical sidearms.  But then, my girlfriend has laser rings and she still likes those things.
5-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1,saidMarker:fama_and_oma=confused,...Wait, what's a mother?  Did I miss something?
5-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1,saidMarker:fama_and_oma=confused,...Your <i>mother</i>?  What's that?  Did I say that?
5-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1,saidMarker:fama_and_oma=awkward,...OK, you lost me.  I called you short, and now...you're talking about your "mother," whatever <i>that</i> is.
5-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1,saidMarker:fama_and_oma=thinking,...What's a <i>mother</i>?  I said <i>Fama</i>.  Oh wait, that's not a thing on Earth, right?  Or...is it?
5-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=shocked,Eep!  A-are you OK, Aimee?  Do you need help?  Is there a doctor in here?
5-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=shocked,Eek!  A-Aimee!  Are you OK?  <i>Say something</i>!
5-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=shocked,A-Aimee!  What's wrong?  Are you hit?  Did someone sabotage you?
5-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=shocked,Ack!  Aimee!  Are you alright?  Is there anything I can get you?  Did the gun misfire?
5-female_removed_minor,target:moon,targetStage:5=annoyed,I'd ask to try it on, but it's probably got lice.  Why infect only one part of your body?
5-female_removed_minor,target:moon,targetStage:5=annoyed,Maybe it's best if you kept it on.  That way you could lose and leave faster.
5-female_removed_minor,target:moon,targetStage:5=annoyed,Don't let us stop you.  You could keep the hat and just strip like you want...on the sidewalk outside.

5-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=shocked,...<i>Yeah.  Yeah, I understand now.  Sorry</i>.
5-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=shocked,<i>Eeek!  W-what's wrong with your--u-uh, I'm sorry!  It's not so bad, really</i>!
5-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=awkward,...Oh no, they're...interesting.  They look great.  You look great.  It's a style.
5-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=shocked,<i>Eep!  D-don't touch--er, uh, they're--cute!  Yes.  Very cute</i>.
5-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=excited,Omigosh, I <i>have</i> to introduce you to Barnette.  She's a total gun nut!
5-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=seductive,My girlfriend <i>loves</i> those old men's weapons.  You've just <i>got</i> to meet her!
5-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=excited,I never knew those clunky old men's weapons could make something so--so <i>beautiful</i>!  Barnette would be so happy to meet you!
5-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=seductive,How can you spend all this time practicing your aim and still be so <i>cute</i>?  Then again, my darling Barnette is the same way.

-3-male_removing_minor=seductive,Hey, ~name~...you feeling <i>daring</i>?
-3-male_removing_minor=teasing,Take off some more, ~name~.  Set my instincts aflame.
-3-male_removing_minor=teasing,Come on, ~name~, I'm a <i>pilot</i>.  Stripping is the only way you can thrill me.
-3-male_removing_minor=annoyed,Forgive me for not being awed by your bold displays of shoulders or whatever.
-3-male_removed_minor=bored,I'm standing here <i>nude</i>.  Don't you want to lose a little more?
-3-male_removed_minor=seductive,Come <i>on</i>, ~name~.  Let's do a dual anatomy investigation.
-3-male_removed_minor=sad,You're making this so hard for me, ~name~.  I'm burning up inside, and all you do is fan the flames...
-3-male_removed_minor=thinking,Bart's such a goofball, but he has his moments.  I wonder if he could muster a poker face if he tried.
-3-male_removed_minor,target:link,targetStage:2=annoyed,Seriously, honey, <i>what</i> is the deal with the grunting?  It was funny for five minutes, but now it's embarrassing.
-3-male_removed_minor,target:link,targetStage:2=interested,...So this is your identity, huh?  Just going to grunt?  Yeah, I think I'll find a man who's capable of telling me I'm beautiful.
-3-male_removed_minor,target:link,targetStage:2=bored,I know you're overcome by my beauty, Elf-man, but this yelping thing is no longer endearing.  <i>Sheesh</i>.
-3-male_removed_minor,target:link,targetStage:2=teasing,Maybe you're unaware, Elf-man, but I'm the kind of woman who's into dirty talk...so you're not really being my type at the moment.
-3-female_removing_minor=bored,Is this what karma feels like?  An irritating groin tingle?
-3-female_removing_minor=bored,Just what I deserve, I guess.  Next time I'll come with just the dress.
-3-female_removing_minor=thinking,Would Parfet be any good at poker?  Nah, total scatterbrain.  And no street smarts.
-3-female_removing_minor=frustrated,What do I have to spread to excite you into taking off more?  Because I don't want to do it with cards anymore.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:3,marker:planet-countries=vain,Ohhh, so <i>that's</i> what it's called?  Short and simple...and <i>romantic</i>.  And they speak it on Planet France?
-3-female_removing_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:3,marker:planet-countries=vain,And is that the official language of Planet France?  I simply <i>have</i> to move there, then!
-3-female_removing_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:3,marker:planet-countries=seductive,And is every woman on Planet France as cute-looking and sounding as you?  It sounds like <i>heaven</i>, then!
-3-female_removing_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:3,marker:planet-countries=excited,Omigosh, Marinette!  You're from planet "France," right?  And <i>everyone</i> speaks French there?  That's so exciting!
-3-female_removing_minor,target:moon,targetStage:4=frustrated,Should I ask why you wear so much extra stuff when you just want to take it off in a hurry?
-3-female_removing_minor,target:moon,targetStage:4=annoyed,<i>I'm</i> trying to be sensual and fun.  <i>This</i> girl is advertising her diseases.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:moon,targetStage:4=awkward,...You all know I'm just flirting, right?  I'm not like this girl, I swear.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:moon,targetStage:4=frustrated,I can't believe what I'm hearing.  I was just making jokes about Earth girls being sex fiends thanks to men...and now I meet one.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=confused,Hm?  Oh, right, you brought your partner along.  Why isn't <i>she</i> playing?  Or saying anything?
-3-female_removing_minor,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=interested,Your partner seems like the strong, silent type.  Not sure which part to emphasize.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=laughing,Is that your wrestling partner helping you out?  What a loyal friend...even if she doesn't have much on her mind.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=confused,Hey, this table's full!  Oh, she's just helping you...and has little to say about it.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=excited,Every bullet looks like it's going to hit you, and then it just grazes!  It's spectacular!  Can it be taught?
-3-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=seductive,Could you shoot my dress off, too?  Not that I'd <i>want</i> you to, but could you?  Could I <i>learn</i> how to do it?
-3-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=excited,Absolutely phenomenal!  And you even manage to look beautiful as you do it!  Could you maybe teach me?
-3-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=seductive,I'd be quite the pirate if I could shoot like you!  Can you give me some tips?
-3-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=confused,Uh...you alright, Miss Detective?  What's up?
-3-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=confused,Oh, you're taking off the gloves now?  I just figured you really liked them.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=confused,Oh, the gloves?  I thought you were just committed to some kind of fashion statement.  Why now?
-3-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=confused,Hey, Kyoko, you look mortified.  Something happen?  Bad memories of men resurfacing?
-3-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=confused,Hey, Miss Pokerface, you're not really living up the nickname anymore.  What's wrong?
-3-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1=teasing,So is that armor actually comfortable?  I'm only second in rank to <i>you</i>, after all.  Might have to wear it soon.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1=confused,Isn't that armor all pressurized?  You poor thing.  You've probably been hoping for this.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1=teasing,That armor looks so uncomfortable.  But you wear it well, because you're such a cutie!
-3-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1=seductive,Feeling better?  I could never pilot the way you do in that bulky armor.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:1=seductive,Omigosh, Faye, that jacket is so <i>stylish</i>!  And the way you let it hang there just <i>screams</i> personality.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:1=vain,I like your style, honey!  A scarlet-red jacket, just draped all sexy-like around your delicate frame...<i>exquisite</i>.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:1=vain,Ooh, that jacket is so <i>cool</i>-looking!  My dress is the only fancy thing I own...such is the life of a pirate.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:1=teasing,Ooh, I barely noticed that thing, the way you draped it around yourself with <i>style</i>!  You've got an eye for sex appeal, honey.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=excited,I can't get over how cool this is.  You should join our crew with aim like that!
-3-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=excited,...That's never going to get old.  It's brilliant to watch!
-3-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=excited,The skill is one thing, but the <i>daring</i>!  You're not scared at all!
-3-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=excited,This is unreal.  I never knew Earth women could be so <i>cool</i>!  Or daring!  Or spunky!
-3-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0=laughing,<i>Hahahaha</i>!  Oh, don't take things so seriously!  You're still cute--you're just a little on the short side, that's all!
-3-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0=seductive,<i>Oh, relax</i>!  I'm just teasing you, honey--it's not often on Mejare you meet a woman so short!
-3-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0=teasing,I'm just teasing, dear!  Don't take it personally--I'm quite used to towering over women.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0=vain,Oh, are you sensitive about your height?  Don't worry, dear--I hear short <i>men</i> get much more flack for it.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=teasing,That we are, Lizzie!  I'm glad you're so interested in these boring old alien women.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=teasing,We <i>are</i> pirates, Elizabeth...but don't worry, you're too much of a sweetheart to kill and rob!
-3-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=seductive,Don't you worry your pretty little head off about it, honey.  We may be pirates, but we only attack nasty soldier types.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=vain,Pirates we are, Elizabeth...and we've got <i>so</i> many stories of high adventure and death-defying stunts to tell.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=stretching,Well, at least you brought your girlfriend to help through this.  I <i>hope</i> Barnette wouldn't be so cowardly.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=seductive,Oh, so you two are lovers?  That's so <i>adorable</i>!  I've been going steady with Barnette for a while now.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10,marker:fama_and_oma=laughing,<i>Teeheehee</i>!  I didn't know you two were <i>that</i> close!  I can tell Florina here is more Fama material, being all demure.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=seductive,<i>Ohhh, I get it</i>!  Lyn's helping you overcome your fears!  What an adorable couple you two are, helping each other out!
-3-female_removing_minor,target:misato,targetStage:2=seductive,So what's your story, dear?  Don't you keep going on about "Angels" or something like that?  I'm curious.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:misato,targetStage:2=seductive,I keep hearing about these "Angel" attacks.  Are they bad?  Because you came out looking pretty cute.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:misato,targetStage:2=vain,Don't you fight "Angels" or something, dear?  I hope you don't mistake <i>me</i> for one...I could understand doing so.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:misato,targetStage:2=teasing,So you're all about fighting off "Angels"?  Hey, you're looking at one...<i>don't shoot, darling</i>.
-3-female_removed_minor=frustrated,<i>Sigh</i>...you're all so boring.
-3-female_removed_minor=vain,Valore's got that same skimpy bodysuit Meia does.  But with that exotic dark skin of hers underneath...
-3-female_removed_minor=bored,What did I do to deserve this?  Besides tease you all mercilessly.
-3-female_removed_minor=thinking,Misty's outfit is a little hard to decipher.  But she's from Pluto, so I guess that makes sense.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2=laughing,<i>Hahahaha</i>!  I <i>knew</i> you had a dirty side, Elizabeth!  No girl that sweet would come here in <i>that</i>.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2=laughing,<i>Ha</i>!  You really had me going for a while, dear, but it seems you're just as naughty as the rest of us!  Look at that thing!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2=laughing,<i>Pfft</i>.  Why'd you bother with the sweet-and-innocent act when you've got <i>fetish gear</i> underneath?
-3-female_removed_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2=teasing,Now I can see what's got you all hot-and-bothered.  You're not sweet--you're just choking yourself, you little nymph!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:1=shocked,Wait, you--you--<i>oh, wow.  You weren't kidding</i>.  Uh...so, uh, what's it like using magic?
-3-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:1=shocked,...OK.  Yes.  You're a real witch.  I believe it.  Excellent job.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:1=awkward,Wait, where'd they go?  Did you just make them--<i>vanish</i>?  And I thought what the Paksis did was impressive...
-3-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:1=shocked,...OK.  I thought our technology was pretty impressive...but I can't tell what you just did.  That thing looks like a <i>stick</i>!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=shocked,...<i>Yeah.  Yeah, I understand now.  Sorry</i>.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=shocked,<i>Eeek!  W-what's wrong with your--u-uh, I'm sorry!  It's not so bad, really</i>!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=awkward,...Oh no, they're...interesting.  They look great.  You look great.  It's a style.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=shocked,<i>Eep!  D-don't touch--er, uh, they're--cute!  Yes.  Very cute</i>.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=shocked,Eep!  A-are you OK, Aimee?  Do you need help?  Is there a doctor in here?
-3-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=shocked,Eek!  A-Aimee!  Are you OK?  <i>Say something</i>!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=shocked,A-Aimee!  What's wrong?  Are you hit?  Did someone sabotage you?
-3-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=shocked,Ack!  Aimee!  Are you alright?  Is there anything I can get you?  Did the gun misfire?
-3-female_removed_minor,target:chell,targetStage:1=laughing,Really sticking to your guns, eh, Miss Motormouth?  Was this always your identity, or did you discover it after a night with duct tape?
-3-female_removed_minor,target:chell,targetStage:1=interested,...I really hope you have a hobby, sweetie.  Because this silent treatment isn't much of an identity.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:chell,targetStage:1=stretching,You know what kind of woman I like?  Ones who pay me compliments.  Maybe I'd return them.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:chell,targetStage:1=smug,At what age did you start worrying your parents, dear?  At least you grew to be a functioning adult despite your disability.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1=laughing,I don't know, dear.  Did you not have your glasses on when you were looking for your sense of humor?
-3-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1=teasing,Hey, at least you've got some fighting spirit!  Pint-sized Hibiki is the same way, so I guess shortness transcends sex.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1=smug,Yeah, can't crack a joke about Hibiki's height without him getting all huffy, either.  You shorties are such hotheads.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1=vain,You Earth girls always call my clothes skimpy, like I'm supposed to be ashamed of my body.  But then, I have a lot more of it.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:1=teasing,Hey, honey...you can lift me up <i>any</i> time you want.  I don't mind.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:1=seductive,I like how strong she is, though.  You look like a chunk of muscle yourself, too!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:1=teasing,I can appreciate a woman with muscles...mostly because she could spin me around.  So you two are good in my book.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:1=seductive,Hey, you're both pretty cute.  And so strong!  How do you find the time to exercise so much?
-3-female_removed_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2=seductive,You had a <i>gun</i>?  And it's an old clunky kinetic one--my girlfriend collects those things!  Can I see it?
-3-female_removed_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2=seductive,Oh, look at that--a men's kinetic weapon, cleverly concealed!  My girlfriend Barnette has a whole collection!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2=smug,You're a <i>spacefarer</i>, and still you cling to old men's guns?  You're just like my girlfriend, though she's just a collector.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2=vain,I thought a spacefarer would know better than to rely on mechanical sidearms.  But then, my girlfriend has laser rings and she still likes those things.
-3-female_removed_minor,alsoPlaying:meia=frustrated,<i>Sigh</i>...you're all so boring.
-3-female_removed_minor,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Valore's got that same skimpy bodysuit you do, Meia.  But with that exotic dark skin of hers underneath...<i>you should ask her out</i>.
-3-female_removed_minor,alsoPlaying:meia=bored,What did I do to deserve this?  Besides tease you all mercilessly.
-3-female_removed_minor,alsoPlaying:meia=thinking,Misty's outfit is a little hard to decipher.  But she's from Pluto, so I guess that makes sense.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:moon,targetStage:5=annoyed,I'd ask to try it on, but it's probably got lice.  Why infect only one part of your body?
-3-female_removed_minor,target:moon,targetStage:5=annoyed,Maybe it's best if you kept it on.  That way you could lose and leave faster.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:moon,targetStage:5=annoyed,Don't let us stop you.  You could keep the hat and just strip like you want...on the sidewalk outside.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:moon,targetStage:5=angry,Why'd you play this game anyway?  Just strip outside if you're not going to play for the fun of the tease...or talk to any of us.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1,saidMarker:fama_and_oma=confused,...Wait, what's a mother?  Did I miss something?
-3-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1,saidMarker:fama_and_oma=confused,...Your <i>mother</i>?  What's that?  Did I say that?
-3-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1,saidMarker:fama_and_oma=awkward,...OK, you lost me.  I called you short, and now...you're talking about your "mother," whatever <i>that</i> is.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1,saidMarker:fama_and_oma=thinking,...What's a <i>mother</i>?  I said <i>Fama</i>.  Oh wait, that's not a thing on Earth, right?  Or...is it?
-3-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2=vain,I bet it's dependable, though.  My dress sure wouldn't deflect any laser shots!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2=laughing,Remember the last raid we staged?  That soldier probably would have tagged you if not for that armor.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2=seductive-2,Dear, dear.  Me naked, you unarmored.  We're not the fierce Mejarian pirates we entered as!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2=seductive-2,As bulky as your armor looks, Meia, it seems pretty snug at the moment.  Some pirate I am.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4=laughing,...Hoo.  You are <i>really</i> throwing them back, dear.  Got an extra liver?
-3-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4=interested,...Honey, is this typical for you?  Did one of these silly Earth men reject you earlier tonight?  What's with the drinking?
-3-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4=interested,You, uh, alright there, Sei?  Because <i>I</i> don't drink that much, and I've got about two feet on you.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4=stretching,It's weird seeing a blue-haired girl knock them back like you do.  Meia never drinks, because she hates fun.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=smug,This isn't exactly Meia's idea of fun like it is mine.  I mean, she <i>likes</i> feeling sexy, but she'd never admit it.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=teasing,Meia's not the type to admit it when she's having fun.  Don't worry, you're good company for her.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=laughing,Don't let Meia fool you into thinking she doesn't like feeling sexy.  Just look at that suit she wears--her butt is constantly on display!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=stretching,Oh, Meia's every bit the sultry young thing I am.  She just likes hiding it and playing hard-to-get.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=excited,Omigosh, I <i>have</i> to introduce you to Barnette.  She's a total gun nut!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=seductive,My girlfriend <i>loves</i> those old men's weapons.  You've just <i>got</i> to meet her!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=excited,I never knew those clunky old men's weapons could make something so--so <i>beautiful</i>!  Barnette would be so happy to meet you!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=seductive,How can you spend all this time practicing your aim and still be so <i>cute</i>?  Then again, my darling Barnette is the same way.

-2-male_removing_minor=interested,Come on, ~name~, can't you help me out a little more than that?
-2-male_removing_minor=seductive,That's pretty insubstantial, ~name~.  You're a man--there's a lot you could show me.
-2-male_removing_minor=bored,Oh, <i>boo</i>.  Men are no fun at all, apparently.
-2-male_removing_minor=annoyed,...You know, I heard there are men who are only attracted to other men.  You must be one of them.
-2-male_removed_minor=annoyed,Guess I'll stick to women.  At least <i>they</i> know how to have a good time.
-2-male_removed_minor=frustrated,Am I really asking for that much from you?  Do men honestly care about nudity?
-2-male_removed_minor=angry,<i>How</i> is this not enough to turn you on?  I'm so <i>beautiful</i>!
-2-male_removed_minor=excited,Gonna let me burn up over here, are you?  You're just making Barnette's night harder, not mine.
-2-female_removing_minor=angry,That's <i>all</i>?  What, are you Earth women shy around each other?  You all have the same parts!
-2-female_removing_minor=bored,I can't take this...you're making it painful.
-2-female_removing_minor=mast-2,...Well, back to thinking about Barnette.
-2-female_removing_minor=annoyed,I don't masturbate often, you know.  I have help the next room over on the ship.  So make this good for me!
-2-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=excited,Every bullet looks like it's going to hit you, and then it just grazes!  It's spectacular!  Can it be taught?
-2-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=seductive,Could you shoot my dress off, too?  Not that I'd <i>want</i> you to, but could you?  Could I <i>learn</i> how to do it?
-2-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=excited,Absolutely phenomenal!  And you even manage to look beautiful as you do it!  Could you maybe teach me?
-2-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=seductive,I'd be quite the pirate if I could shoot like you!  Can you give me some tips?
-2-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1=seductive,That's it!  Wiggle yourself out of that armor and show off your figure!
-2-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1=teasing,You've worked hard to get your figure, right?  Well, don't let that armor hide that tight little bodysuit.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1=seductive,That bulky armor almost makes you look like a man.  Shed it and show off how svelte you can be.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1=interested,That's the way.  Lose the armor...women shouldn't have big, bulky shoulders.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=confused,Uh...you alright, Miss Detective?  What's up?
-2-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=confused,Oh, you're taking off the gloves now?  I just figured you really liked them.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=confused,Oh, the gloves?  I thought you were just committed to some kind of fashion statement.  Why now?
-2-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=confused,Hey, Kyoko, you look mortified.  Something happen?  Bad memories of men resurfacing?
-2-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=confused,Hey, Miss Pokerface, you're not really living up the nickname anymore.  What's wrong?
-2-female_removing_minor,target:misato,targetStage:2=seductive,So what's your story, dear?  Don't you keep going on about "Angels" or something like that?  I'm curious.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:misato,targetStage:2=seductive,I keep hearing about these "Angel" attacks.  Are they bad?  Because you came out looking pretty cute.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:misato,targetStage:2=vain,Don't you fight "Angels" or something, dear?  I hope you don't mistake <i>me</i> for one...I could understand doing so.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:misato,targetStage:2=teasing,So you're all about fighting off "Angels"?  Hey, you're looking at one...<i>don't shoot, darling</i>.

-2-female_removing_minor,target:moon,targetStage:4=annoyed,<i>I'm</i> trying to be sensual and fun.  <i>This</i> girl is advertising her diseases.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:moon,targetStage:4=awkward,...You all know I'm just flirting, right?  I'm not like this girl, I swear.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:moon,targetStage:4=frustrated,I can't believe what I'm hearing.  I was just making jokes about Earth girls being sex fiends thanks to men...and now I meet one.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:3,marker:planet-countries=vain,Ohhh, so <i>that's</i> what it's called?  Short and simple...and <i>romantic</i>.  And they speak it on Planet France?
-2-female_removing_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:3,marker:planet-countries=vain,And is that the official language of Planet France?  I simply <i>have</i> to move there, then!
-2-female_removing_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:3,marker:planet-countries=seductive,And is every woman on Planet France as cute-looking and sounding as you?  It sounds like <i>heaven</i>, then!
-2-female_removing_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:3,marker:planet-countries=excited,Omigosh, Marinette!  You're from planet "France," right?  And <i>everyone</i> speaks French there?  That's so exciting!
-2-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=stretching,Well, at least you brought your girlfriend to help through this.  I <i>hope</i> Barnette wouldn't be so cowardly.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=seductive,Oh, so you two are lovers?  That's so <i>adorable</i>!  I've been going steady with Barnette for a while now.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10,marker:fama_and_oma=laughing,<i>Teeheehee</i>!  I didn't know you two were <i>that</i> close!  I can tell Florina here is more Fama material, being all demure.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=seductive,<i>Ohhh, I get it</i>!  Lyn's helping you overcome your fears!  What an adorable couple you two are, helping each other out!
-2-female_removed_minor=bored,Boring, boring, bo-<i>ring</i>.  Honestly, ~name~, are you <i>always</i> this much of a killjoy?
-2-female_removed_minor=annoyed,Help a fellow woman out and take off something good, would you?  For God's sake...
-2-female_removed_minor=smug,Hey, <i>Mejarians</i> know how to have fun.  Well, maybe not Meia, but still.
-2-female_removed_minor=mast-2,Dita's got a nice figure...eh, I can't masturbate to her.  She's too sweet.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4=laughing,...Hoo.  You are <i>really</i> throwing them back, dear.  Got an extra liver?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4=interested,...Honey, is this typical for you?  Did one of these silly Earth men reject you earlier tonight?  What's with the drinking?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4=interested,You, uh, alright there, Sei?  Because <i>I</i> don't drink that much, and I've got about two feet on you.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4=stretching,It's weird seeing a blue-haired girl knock them back like you do.  Meia never drinks, because she hates fun.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2=interested,Please, Meia.  You're cute, but I just don't see you that way.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2=vain,I just want these poor Earth people to see how cute Mejarians can be.  Is that so wrong?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2=vain,Why, I never!  My heart belongs to Barnette and Barnette alone, Leader.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2=teasing,Don't get too full of yourself, now.  Lots of Mejarians have a great figure...you're just <i>one</i> of them.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2=smug,Oh, don't get all full of yourself.  You'll make a mistake next mission and careen into a Harvest cube.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2=stretching,Oh, don't get full of yourself.  They'll think <i>every</i> Mejarian is as vain as I am.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=shocked,Eep!  A-are you OK, Aimee?  Do you need help?  Is there a doctor in here?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=shocked,Eek!  A-Aimee!  Are you OK?  <i>Say something</i>!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=shocked,A-Aimee!  What's wrong?  Are you hit?  Did someone sabotage you?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=shocked,Ack!  Aimee!  Are you alright?  Is there anything I can get you?  Did the gun misfire?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:moon,targetStage:5=annoyed,I'd ask to try it on, but it's probably got lice.  Why infect only one part of your body?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:moon,targetStage:5=annoyed,Maybe it's best if you kept it on.  That way you could lose and leave faster.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:moon,targetStage:5=annoyed,Don't let us stop you.  You could keep the hat and just strip like you want...on the sidewalk outside.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:moon,targetStage:5=angry,Why'd you play this game anyway?  Just strip outside if you're not going to play for the fun of the tease...or talk to any of us.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=shocked,...<i>Yeah.  Yeah, I understand now.  Sorry</i>.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=shocked,<i>Eeek!  W-what's wrong with your--u-uh, I'm sorry!  It's not so bad, really</i>!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=awkward,...Oh no, they're...interesting.  They look great.  You look great.  It's a style.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=shocked,<i>Eep!  D-don't touch--er, uh, they're--cute!  Yes.  Very cute</i>.
-2-female_removed_minor,alsoPlaying:meia=bored,Boring, boring, bo-<i>ring</i>.  Honestly, ~name~, are you <i>always</i> this much of a killjoy?
-2-female_removed_minor,alsoPlaying:meia=annoyed,Help a fellow woman out and take off something good, would you?  For God's sake...
-2-female_removed_minor,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,Hey, <i>Mejarians</i> know how to have fun.  Well, maybe not my boss over there, but still.
-2-female_removed_minor,alsoPlaying:meia=mast-2,Dita's got a nice figure...eh, I can't masturbate to her.  She's too sweet.

-1-male_removing_minor=annoyed,Would you quit it with the game already?  It's not like there's a prize!
-1-male_removing_minor=bored,...You're just gonna keep this up, aren't you?
-1-male_removing_minor=frustrated,Are you trying to tell me that my little masturbation show did <i>nothing</i> for you?  Men are so weird!
-1-male_removing_minor=confused,Seriously, though, did I turn you on?  I'm still trying to figure out men's sexualities.
-1-male_removed_minor=seductive,Hey, ~name~.  Take off a little more and I'll start up again, <i>just for you</i>.
-1-male_removed_minor=bored,I knew men were competitive, but <i>sheesh</i>.  Give it a rest already.
-1-male_removed_minor=thinking,Duero wouldn't be half bad at this, despite his limited wardrobe.  He's got nothing <i>but</i> a poker face.
-1-male_removed_minor=smug,Gotta hand it to men's poker skills.  Guess they have the brainpower to match shapes and count to ten.
-1-female_removing_minor=bored,You're such a bore, ~name~.  I guess men suck the fun out of a planet.
-1-female_removing_minor=thinking,Maybe I would've enjoyed this game more had I taken it seriously like Meia always says to...seems to be Earthlings' M.O.
-1-female_removing_minor=confused,Is that in style on Earth?  Fashion's the most I can get out of your stripping now...
-1-female_removing_minor=smug,Earth people really <i>are</i> intense.  I mean, I guess the Harvest had taught me that already.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=excited,Every bullet looks like it's going to hit you, and then it just grazes!  It's spectacular!  Can it be taught?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=seductive,Could you shoot my dress off, too?  Not that I'd <i>want</i> you to, but could you?  Could I <i>learn</i> how to do it?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=excited,Absolutely phenomenal!  And you even manage to look beautiful as you do it!  Could you maybe teach me?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=seductive,I'd be quite the pirate if I could shoot like you!  Can you give me some tips?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=stretching,Well, at least you brought your girlfriend to help through this.  I <i>hope</i> Barnette wouldn't be so cowardly.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=seductive,Oh, so you two are lovers?  That's so <i>adorable</i>!  I've been going steady with Barnette for a while now.

-1-female_removing_minor,target:moon,targetStage:4=frustrated,Should I ask why you wear so much extra stuff when you just want to take it off in a hurry?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:moon,targetStage:4=annoyed,<i>I'm</i> trying to be sensual and fun.  <i>This</i> girl is advertising her diseases.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:moon,targetStage:4=awkward,...You all know I'm just flirting, right?  I'm not like this girl, I swear.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:moon,targetStage:4=frustrated,I can't believe what I'm hearing.  I was just making jokes about Earth girls being sex fiends thanks to men...and now I meet one.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1=seductive,That's the way!  It's all big and clunky.  Now you can enjoy yourself in just the bodysuit!
-1-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1=teasing,Now with just the bodysuit, you'll be able to stretch out...like me.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1=seductive,That's more like it.  Just think how cute you'll look in just the bodysuit, especially to these Earth people!
-1-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1=vain,Here comes the good stuff, folks.  Meia's bodysuit is just the cutest thing!
-1-female_removing_minor,target:misato,targetStage:2=seductive,So what's your story, dear?  Don't you keep going on about "Angels" or something like that?  I'm curious.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:misato,targetStage:2=seductive,I keep hearing about these "Angel" attacks.  Are they bad?  Because you came out looking pretty cute.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:misato,targetStage:2=vain,Don't you fight "Angels" or something, dear?  I hope you don't mistake <i>me</i> for one...I could understand doing so.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:misato,targetStage:2=teasing,So you're all about fighting off "Angels"?  Hey, you're looking at one...<i>don't shoot, darling</i>.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=confused,Uh...you alright, Miss Detective?  What's up?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=confused,Oh, you're taking off the gloves now?  I just figured you really liked them.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=confused,Oh, the gloves?  I thought you were just committed to some kind of fashion statement.  Why now?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=confused,Hey, Kyoko, you look mortified.  Something happen?  Bad memories of men resurfacing?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=confused,Hey, Miss Pokerface, you're not really living up the nickname anymore.  What's wrong?
-1-female_removing_minor,alsoPlaying:meia=confused,Is that in style on Earth?  Fashion's the most I can get out of your stripping now...
-1-female_removing_minor,alsoPlaying:meia=bored,You're such a bore, ~name~.  I guess men suck the fun out of a planet.
-1-female_removing_minor,alsoPlaying:meia=thinking,Maybe I would've enjoyed this game more had I taken it seriously...would I have won?
-1-female_removing_minor,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,Earth people really <i>are</i> intense.  I mean, I guess the Harvest had taught me that already.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:3,marker:planet-countries=vain,Ohhh, so <i>that's</i> what it's called?  Short and simple...and <i>romantic</i>.  And they speak it on Planet France?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:3,marker:planet-countries=vain,And is that the official language of Planet France?  I simply <i>have</i> to move there, then!
-1-female_removing_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:3,marker:planet-countries=seductive,And is every woman on Planet France as cute-looking and sounding as you?  It sounds like <i>heaven</i>, then!

-1-female_removed_minor=bored,I really should've been more cunning...and not gotten bored towards the end.
-1-female_removed_minor=bored,Guess it's my own fault for just sort of throwing in the towel.
-1-female_removed_minor=frustrated,I masturbated to completion and everything, and somehow I'm still feeling unsatisfied.
-1-female_removed_minor=interested,You're taking this so seriously.  You must really want that non-existent reward for winning.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=shocked,...<i>Yeah.  Yeah, I understand now.  Sorry</i>.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=shocked,<i>Eeek!  W-what's wrong with your--u-uh, I'm sorry!  It's not so bad, really</i>!

-1-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2=teasing,She won't admit it, but my Leader here's curvy, isn't she?  Her vanity is buried pretty deep.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2=smug,Behold, the only Mejarian without an ounce of vanity.  Well, not about her body, anyway.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2=stretching,Think Meia's not as vain as I am?  Ask her about her piloting skills.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2=teasing,Isn't she so much cuter with <i>feminine</i> shoulders?  Meia's always shooting her looks in the foot...but she's just as proud, if you listen close.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4=laughing,...Hoo.  You are <i>really</i> throwing them back, dear.  Got an extra liver?
-1-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4=interested,...Honey, is this typical for you?  Did one of these silly Earth men reject you earlier tonight?  What's with the drinking?

#OPPONENT REMOVING MAJOR CLOTHING
#Major clothing reveals a significant amount of skin and likely underwear.
#However, as we don't know if the opponent is taking off the top or the bottom, we can't presume that nice abs are showing; maybe she took of her skirt before her shirt.

#fully clothed
0-male_removing_major=laughing,Oh?  Does Mr. ~name~ actually plan on removing something substantial?
0-male_removing_major=interested,Oh?  Is ~name~ about to prove that Earth men are capable of having fun?
0-male_removing_major=teasing,Tarakkians are no fun at all, but I guess we Mejarians made them that way.  Always eating their livers and such.
0-male_removing_major=teasing,I know you're getting antsy, ~name~, but don't forget I'm armed.
0-male_removed_major=laughing,Such a poor show from our male friend here.  Can't you make me <i>work</i> for it?
0-male_removed_major=confused,Earth men are popular with the girls, right?  They just flock right to you?
0-male_removed_major=confused,I read something about how men think about sex nonstop.  Is that true?  I mean, Tarakkians have no outlet for that.
0-male_removed_major=laughing,If Tarakkians weren't brainwashed to fear women, I bet they'd be awful jealous of you Earth guys.  <i>Surrounded</i> by beauties.
0-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:7=laughing,<i>Oh, my</i>!  And I thought men were courageous!  But this mountain of muscles hides his thing from my teeth.
0-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:7=laughing,What's the matter, Cap?  <i>Afraid this Mejarian will just bite it right off</i>?
0-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:7=teasing,Come now, honey--there's no reason to hide bheind your shield.  I don't eat <i>every</i> man's organs.
0-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:7=teasing,Don't be that way, dear.  If I wanted to eat you, I'd go for those delicious shoulder muscles.  So put the shield down.
0-female_removing_major=vain,Already down to your ~clothing~, when I haven't even <i>lost</i>?  Goes to show how refined we Mejarians are.
0-female_removing_major=stretching,Gotta be honest, these Earth wardrobes aren't grabbing my attention.  Let's see if your body does.
0-female_removing_major=vain,Better pick up the pace, dearie.  I've got a lot of clothing to lose, despite appearances.
0-female_removing_major=laughing,What a lovely little item.  <i>Maybe I'll pirate it</i>.
0-female_removing_major,target:aimee,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>No!  Please!  I'm too beautiful to die</i>!
0-female_removing_major,target:aimee,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>Ack!  Don't shoot!  I didn't steal anything!  Honest</i>!
0-female_removing_major,target:aimee,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>Not in the face!  Or the breasts!  Don't ruin my corpse</i>!
0-female_removing_major,target:aimee,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>I-I can't die here!  I have a girlfriend!  And hundreds of admirers</i>!
0-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:4=seductive,Is that your own special die, or does it just work for anyone?  ...Can <i>I</i> try?
0-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:4=vain,So if I rolled that thing, could it give me a whole new outfit?  I mean, I <i>do</i> love my dress, but hey.
0-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:4=confused,Now I'm starting to get curious about that die of yours.  Would it work if <i>I</i> rolled it?
0-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:4=teasing,Does that die work solely for you?  What if I just <i>snatched it</i> like the pirate I am?
0-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:4=smug,You have a <i>secret</i>?  Well, here's your chance to keep me interested, Plain-Jane.
0-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:4=teasing,You haven't impressed so far, Plain-as-Day.  So color me interested with this "secret" of yours.
0-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:4=smug,I'm listening, dearie.  You're so average that I'm honestly willing to buy that you have a "secret."
0-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:4=laughing,Unless your secret is a third breast, I just can't see you wowing me, dear.
0-female_removing_major,target:velma,targetStage:1=interested,Seriously, honey, slow down.  Feeling self-conscious next to me?
0-female_removing_major,target:velma,targetStage:1=smug,Listen, dear--I know I have this effect on women, but there's no reason to be <i>this</i> jealous.
0-female_removing_major,target:velma,targetStage:1=laughing,Just rushing to outdo me, huh?  Sorry, but you're still a little frumpy by comparison.
0-female_removing_major,target:velma,targetStage:1=vain,Feeling inadequate, sweetie?  You should be proud of your body--don't fret about how I'm much more beautiful.
0-female_removing_major,target:velma,targetStage:1=vain,Come on, honey.  Throwing off all your clothes like this reeks of desperation next to a goddess such as myself.
0-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4=seductive,Ooh, that's a nifty trick, dear!  You can bet <i>I'd</i> give it a shot if I could...<i>do you think I should wear a bodysuit</i>?
0-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4=seductive,I've always felt I'm too pillowy and soft for a bodysuit, but you really make it your own!  <i>Could I pull it off, too, sweetie</i>?
0-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4=teasing,Hey, Miss Gravity, I was really like the look of your figure all stuffed into that suit.  Do you think I'd look good in the same thing?
0-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4=vain,Mejare has a thing for bodysuits, you know...I wonder if I should get myself one.  There's just no tease to it, you know?
0-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meia=seductive,Maybe it's just the antigravity, but this girl's lit a fire in my heart, Leader!  Do you think I should wear a suit like yours?
0-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Hey, Leader, this girl's making bodysuits look good even for a woman with some meat on her.  Should I wear one?
0-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,I think you've managed to make bodysuits boring for me, Meia.  This girl is making me want to get one now!
0-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,Maybe I should abandon this silly dress and opt for a bodysuit like yours and Ochako's, Meia--just bare it all!  What do you say?
0-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,I know I'm not as slender and lithe as <i>you</i>, Leader, but neither is Ochako.  Should I get myself a bodysuit?
0-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:2=smug,My, my, another magic trick?  Can't you dazzle us with your own naked body, dear?
0-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:2=interested,This is getting old already, honey.  By all means, show your body instead--<i>that's</i> far more interesting.
0-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:2=smug,You Earth girls and your parlor tricks.  Is this the sort of thing that amuses men and their tiny primate brains?  I'd rather see you naked.
0-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:2=laughing,Can't you just magic-off your whole outfit, dearie?  I'd rather see how far down your makeup goes.
0-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5=seductive,But don't worry about all that!  Let's see what outfit's next, cutie!
0-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5=vain,Another vortex, another wonderful piece of fashion to ogle.  <i>I'm so lucky</i>!
0-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5=vain,You call yourself the lucky one, but I came here <i>hoping</i> to see some cool fashion choices.
0-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5=vain,Simply magical.  My luck that I'd meet you, not these vortices.  <i>Things just work out for me</i>!
0-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=laughing,Oho--and the Masked Woman is revealing herself!  I'm sure she has a good explanation for hiding.
0-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=seductive,What's this, now?  The Masked Woman feels like looking us all in the eye?  I'd love to know why you waited so long.
0-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=teasing,This had better be interesting, dear.  I want a face worth waiting for, because the rest of us are revealing more sensitive areas.
0-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=teasing,Afraid of my evil alien gaze, honey?  How xenophobic--now take off that mask so I can see why you wore it.
0-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=laughing,So soon, dearie?  I guess that "Secret Identity" of yours isn't worth hiding your pleasure from us.
0-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=smug,I guess you'd rather look your admirers in the eyes than conceal you identity any longer than a few rounds.
0-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=laughing,So much for your "Secret Identity," honey.  That's the second thing you're taking off!
0-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=stretching,Oho!  And the mask comes off.  Why you bothered with it at all if it's going this quickly, I'll never understand.
0-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=teasing,Well, look who's overcoming her shyness!  Guess that "Secret Identity" didn't last too long when you could've been nude instead.
0-female_removing_major,target:faye,targetStage:4=laughing,<i>Pfft</i>!  So much for the cool-and-calculated act!  Even <i>I</i> wouldn't stoop that low...maybe.
0-female_removing_major,target:faye,targetStage:4=laughing,There's no need, dear.  You're showing your true colors already.
0-female_removing_major,target:faye,targetStage:4=annoyed,OK, even <i>I</i> wouldn't count my makeup.  It's just luck, honey, don't be so sore about it.
0-female_removing_major,target:faye,targetStage:4=interested,Look, honey, if you have to wear enough makeup that it counts as clothing, it wouldn't save your looks in the first place.
0-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=seductive,<i>Teehee</i>!  I have no clue what you just said, but you've <i>got</i> to teach me, Marinette!  This'll drive my girlfriend <i>wild</i>.
0-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=vain,I can just <i>picture</i> the look on Barnette's face when I start whispering these sweet nothings.  Could you teach me?
0-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=excited,What was that?  Anyway, omigosh, Marinette, you <i>have</i> to give me some French lessons!  Barnette will melt in my arms!
0-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=seductive,Whatever you just said, my girlfriend Barnette would absolutely <i>melt</i>, it's so romantic!  <i>Won't you please teach me</i>?
0-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1=shocked,<i>Ack!  No!  The Paksis!  I should've known this was a dream</i>!
0-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1=shocked,<i>Eeek!  Marinette!  The Harvest has got you!  Nooo</i>!
0-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1=shocked,<i>Aaack!  Don't touch me!  W-what's happening?  Help</i>!
0-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1=shocked,<i>Aaack!  T-the Harvest!  They're here!  Run!  I'm sorry, Ladybug</i>!
0-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1=shocked,<i>Eeek!  No!  Please!  I have a girlfriend!  I can't die here</i>!
0-female_removing_major,target:launch,targetStage:5=bored,...Well, at least you're blonde again.  Blonde's a good color...I can stare at that and tune you out.
0-female_removing_major,target:launch,targetStage:5=bored,At least there's no gun this time.  Now you'll have to make a racket by shouting.
0-female_removing_major,target:launch,targetStage:5=bored,Yeah, yeah, keep on screaming.  I'll just stare at that lovely blonde hair and try to forget what's under it...
0-female_removing_major,target:launch,targetStage:5=frustrated,Your blue version really taught me the value of peace and quiet.
0-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=interested,Can't believe you're down to your <i>underwear</i> already.  Make me <i>lose</i> something, Meia.
0-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=teasing,Feel free to, you know, involve me in this game.  Don't leave your crewmate behind like this.
0-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=interested,I can't believe sourpuss Meia is stealing all the stripping fun for herself.
0-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=laughing,Come on.  I <i>came</i> here to strip, and somehow Miss Pokerface can't make it happen.
0-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:4=seductive,<i>Heeheehee</i>!  What was that again?  <i>Too-ayy-jolee</i>?
0-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:4=teasing,<i>Too--too-ay-julee</i>?  Did I get it right?  Help me out here, cutie.
0-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:4=seductive,<i>Tooayyjolie</i>?  Was that it?  Oh, all your words just melt together into a chocolate fondue of language!
0-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:4=confused,<i>Too--tooayy</i>, uh, what was that?  I mean, it was adorable, but I didn't really catch it.
0-female_removing_major,target:misato,targetStage:3=confused,Oooh, the <i>dress</i>!  Now we're talking!  ...What's the matter, Misato?
0-female_removing_major,target:misato,targetStage:3=seductive,Aww, <i>someone's</i> embarrassed even through the booze!  What's got you all shy suddenly, huh?
0-female_removing_major,target:misato,targetStage:3=laughing,Even half in the bag like this, you're all nervous.  Hiding something under that dress?
0-female_removing_major,target:misato,targetStage:3=interested,Hey, Misato, what's wrong?  You look a little on edge suddenly, even between burps.
0-female_removing_major,target:buffy,targetStage:4=laughing,<i>And what have we here</i>?  Ooh, you're more depraved than I thought, Miss Vampire Hunter.
0-female_removing_major,target:buffy,targetStage:4=laughing,<i>Heeheehee</i>!  Undoing your bra beneath your shirt, you little tease?  A woman after my own heart...if I wore bras.
0-female_removing_major,target:buffy,targetStage:4=smug,That's a sexy little move there, honey.  I'd try it, too, but bras have never been to my tastes in the first place.
0-female_removing_major,target:buffy,targetStage:4=teasing,So are you trying to be fun and sexy, or just throwing us all off?  <i>I'd certainly prefer the former</i>.
0-female_removing_major,target:jasmine,targetStage:1=interested,Wait, <i>what</i>?  I thought you were just dressed in typical overly-conservative Earth wear, but instead you're <i>royalty</i>?
0-female_removing_major,target:jasmine,targetStage:1=laughing,That was a disguise?  Hey, dearie, next time try hiding your <i>face</i>.  That might throw people off the princess's trail.
0-female_removing_major,target:jasmine,targetStage:1=laughing,You were disguised?  You're <i>royalty</i>?  If the commoners can't recognize their princess's face, I can see why you're still in power.
0-female_removing_major,target:jasmine,targetStage:1=laughing,Oh, what's this?  You're <i>nobility</i>?  Well, well, well, honey...<i>you'll make an excellent ransom</i>.
0-female_removing_major,target:moon,targetStage:0=laughing,<i>Whoa</i>.  OK, you meant it.  Can't say I understand the rush, but more power to you.
0-female_removing_major,target:moon,targetStage:0=interested,You're not kidding around, are you, darling?  This your first time stripping for an audience?  Don't overdo things.
0-female_removing_major,target:moon,targetStage:0=stretching,Try to keep the audience interested, honey.  Strippers don't walk out onstage naked for a reason.
0-female_removing_major,target:moon,targetStage:0=teasing,Straight for the bra?  What an amateur...it's shock value.  The tease is half the fun, silly!
0-female_removing_major,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=confused,Uh, I don't know who "Kleese" is, but I'm actually more concerned about that giant syringe you have for an arm.
0-female_removing_major,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=shocked,...So anyway, <i>what the hell is wrong with your arm...syringe...thing</i>?
0-female_removing_major,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=angry,Why do I care?  I don't know who Kleese is, you have pink skin, you're taking your dress off already, and, uh, <i>you have a giant syringe for an arm</i>.
0-female_removing_major,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=confused,...Are you really not aware of how strange you look?  Like, I was nice and didn't immediately comment on your, uh, <i>syringe</i>.
0-female_removing_major,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=frustrated,Well, I care about other things, too, like <i>Oh My God you have a giant gross needle for an arm I hate needles what's going on</i>.
0-female_removed_major=vain,Poor thing.  Now you're realizing I'm just as smart as I am beautiful!
0-female_removed_major=smug,Wow, I really expected a better challenge.  Guess Mejare really <i>is</i> superior.
0-female_removed_major=laughing,You're just falling apart at the seams here.  Literally.
0-female_removed_major=vain,Yeah, Barnette would definitely be naked already at this point.  That girl really bares it all.
0-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6b=teasing,Looking more Mejarian all the time, Vriska!  Skin is always in style where I'm from.
0-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6b=seductive,That's the fashion I know and love!  Less is more on Mejare, as they say...
0-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6b=stretching,Now you're dressing like all the other women I know on Mejare.  <i>Bo-ring</i>.
0-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6b=interested,Nice Mejarian look you're rocking there now.  My girlfriend tends to wear even less than that.
0-female_removed_major,target:moon,targetStage:1=laughing,<i>Jeez</i>.  Way to immediately dispel any notions I had of Earth girls being prudes.
0-female_removed_major,target:moon,targetStage:1=interested,And here I thought Earth girls felt shy about the whole <i>sex</i> thing.  Not you, sweetheart.
0-female_removed_major,target:moon,targetStage:1=smug,And I thought <i>I</i> was eager.  But no, it seems Mejarians are classier as well as more beautiful.
0-female_removed_major,target:moon,targetStage:1=interested,You're something else, Ocean Girl.  Is men's attention <i>that</i> important to you?
0-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=awkward,That's, uh, really...<i>wow</i>.  That is a <i>lot</i> of pubic hair, to be peeking out of your thong like that...are you OK?
0-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=angry,<i>Ew</i>.  Don't you have razors where you live?  I can see your icky pubic hair poking out from here!
0-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=annoyed,...Were you laid up in bed recently?  Because I can see your unshaven hair from behind your thong, and <i>eugh</i>.
0-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=angry,OK, <i>ew</i>.  Don't you <i>shave</i>, Rinkah?  Do Earth men really like all that hair?
0-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=frustrated,...Maybe you're unaware, but Mejare is obsessed with shaving, cleanliness, and smoothness.  <i>So that's really gross</i>.
0-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6a=laughing,...See what I meant?  That die's got it out for you!  Better off stripping like normal, Miss Aquatic.
0-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6a=teasing,That die's not doing you any favors anymore, darling.  Best to just strip like the rest of us...or go for another swim.
0-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6a=laughing,Yeah, I didn't say anything before, but you <i>have</i> been cheating.  Enjoy being all soggy!
0-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6a=laughing,Back from a swim, Vriska?  I'm <i>loving</i> this!  You're too much!
0-female_removed_major,target:ayano,targetStage:6=shocked,Ooh, a swimsuit!  I like the beach, too--wait, are those <i>bloodstains</i>?  Uh--like, they're <i>yours</i>, right?
0-female_removed_major,target:ayano,targetStage:6=laughing,Ouch, honey.  Picked the worst day of the month to go swimming, didn't you?
0-female_removed_major,target:ayano,targetStage:6=awkward,...Those are <i>your</i> bloodstains, right?  Like, from menstrual issues, or something?
0-female_removed_major,target:ayano,targetStage:6=thinking,Seems Earth women haven't quite nailed down how to track their own menstrual cycles.  Why do we have those, anyway?
0-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5c=laughing,Getting a little skimpier than you'd like, honey?  You can't control fate, so just hope for good rolls...and leg coverage.
0-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5c=teasing,Aww, it's not so bad!  Pants are overrated...just look at me.
0-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5c=vain,I bet the breeze feels good on your legs now.  You're starting to see the genius of my fashion choices!
0-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5c=laughing,Why wear pants when your shirt can cover all the essentials?  Now put on a dress and you'll be just like me.
0-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,priority:0=seductive,Ooh, a woman with muscles.  Not all of them can pull that off.
0-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,priority:0=interested,Meia works out <i>all</i> the time.  At least she's got the abs to prove it, like you do.
0-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,priority:0=excited,Barnette could probably pull off abs.  And she'd still look so <i>cute</i>!
0-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,priority:0=laughing,You haven't lived till you've poked Meia's abs and watched her face struggle to express her derision.
0-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:5=interested,<i>Well</i>!  Plain-Jane's not <i>quite</i> so plain after all.  Good show.
0-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:5=laughing,Ha!  Not bad for an Earth girl...at least you really <i>were</i> hiding something.
0-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:5=vain,Earth girls really <i>are</i> nuts...why would you hide those beauties away?  Honestly.
0-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:5=stretching,A plain face and huge breasts?  You're the logical conclusion of Mejare's obsession with chests.
0-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2=awkward,<i>Noooo</i>...what?  You're in street clothes now?  ...What was <i>that</i> all about?
0-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2=angry,...OK.  Yeah.  Would you mind explaining why you just went nuclear, "Ladybug"?
0-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2=shocked,<i>Help!  I--I</i>...OK.  It stopped.  Are you planning on explaining that, "Ladybug"?
0-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,marker:planet-countries=confused,...OK, that's much more...<i>normal</i>.  Is this how people change clothes on Planet France?
0-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5a=laughing,What is <i>that</i> supposed to be?  Look, I don't go for your creepy dungeon play.
0-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5a=laughing,I wasn't aware other planets were into bondage...but Mejare had to get its ideas from somewhere.
0-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5a=laughing,Planning on <i>dominating</i> us later, Vriska?  Don't tie me up for piracy, now!  <i>Heeheehee</i>!
0-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5a=vain,Oh, dear.  That's quite the authoritative outfit for a pirate like me to be comfortable around.
0-female_removed_major,target:faye,targetStage:5=interested,Oh.  Might as well have gone through with it, dearie--you've already embarrassed yourself by trying.
0-female_removed_major,target:faye,targetStage:5=teasing,No use saving face now, honey--unless you think the makeup does that.
0-female_removed_major,target:faye,targetStage:5=smug,Hey, don't let <i>my</i> complaints stop you.  You've already lost the respect of the table, darling.
0-female_removed_major,target:faye,targetStage:5=teasing,What a sore loser.  Can't quite keep up the tease when you've got to answer for it, huh?  <i>Try me</i>.
0-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5b=seductive,That's cute and simple!  Who's Eridan, your girlfriend?
0-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5b=laughing,Stealing clothes from your girlfriend now, Vriska?  Is "Eridan" OK with you rooting through her wardrobe?
0-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5b=seductive,See, that's plain and simple fashion for the masses!  Your girlfriend Eridan has some good taste in outfits.
0-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5b=laughing,Skirt and stockings?  Simple, but sexy!  Tell this "Eridan" I like her style.  She your girlfriend?
0-female_removed_major,target:shego,targetStage:4=seductive,<i>Oh, my</i>!  Way to go above and beyond, honey--I thought the bodysuit was sexy enough already!
0-female_removed_major,target:shego,targetStage:4=laughing,Who exactly are you dressing up for, dear?  This is enough sexy outfits to please an army.
0-female_removed_major,target:shego,targetStage:4=teasing,With <i>that</i> underneath your suit, I'm impressed you can move at all...<i>you must be a real animal in bed</i>.
0-female_removed_major,target:shego,targetStage:4=seductive,There's no stopping <i>your</i> sex appeal, honey--just look at all that!  You put the effort in.
0-female_removed_major,target:shego,targetStage:4=stretching,I'd say you're showing a sexy side, but the suit did that already.
0-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2=teasing,Ooh, you're <i>blonde</i>!  <i>Just what I was hoping for, cutie</i>.
0-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2=vain,Omigosh--you're <i>blonde</i>, and you were hiding it?  What's the matter with you--blonde women are the most beautiful of all!
0-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2=seductive,Hey, hey, hey!  The Masked Woman is <i>blonde</i>?  I <i>love</i> blondes...they remind me of myself.
0-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2=vain,Ooh, a fellow blonde!  Life has truly blessed us with this color--I can't believe you'd go and try to hide it.
0-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:blake,totalMales:1-2=laughing,Hey, honey, why don't we all just cool it?  You're making it clear how this girl's your ladyfriend--leave the men alone.
0-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:blake,totalMales:1-2=seductive,My, my!  Getting a little defensive around men, are we?  I guess you Earth girls have to fight tooth and nail to keep each other.
0-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:blake,totalMales:1-2=teasing,So you two are together, is that it?  And those <i>nasty Earth men</i> want to drive you apart?  Thanks for repping Mejare for me.
0-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:blake,totalMales:1-2=vain,Oh, are you two a couple?  I've been going steady with Barnette for a while...though I don't feel any hatred of men because of it.
0-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:3=vain,Well, would you look at that!  Exactly what I wanted to see.  <i>More, please</i>!
0-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:3=stretching,How about that?  You're finally taking my sage Mejarian advice concerning the female body.
0-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:3=seductive,See?  There you go!  The best kind of magic is the kind that makes women's clothes disappear!
0-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:3=laughing,Hah!  It's good to know you're listening to me.  Now do another trick and make yourself stark-naked!
0-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,alsoPlaying:meia,priority:100=seductive,Ooh, a woman with muscles.  Not all of them can pull that off.
0-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,alsoPlaying:meia,priority:100=interested,Meia works out <i>all</i> the time.  At least she's got the abs to prove it, right?
0-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,alsoPlaying:meia,priority:100=excited,Barnette could probably pull off abs.  And she'd still look so <i>cute</i>!
0-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,alsoPlaying:meia,priority:100=laughing,You haven't lived till you've poked Meia's abs and watched her face struggle to express her derision.  Remember that?
0-female_removed_major,target:misato,targetStage:4=shocked,<i>Eek!  OK!  Never mind!  Sorry!  I shouldn't have made fun</i>!  ...How'd you <i>get</i> that?
0-female_removed_major,target:misato,targetStage:4=awkward,...<i>Oof</i>.  What gave you <i>that</i>?  ...If you don't mind me asking.
0-female_removed_major,target:misato,targetStage:4=confused,...Should I ask what gave you that?  Is that out of line?  Is it from the "Second Impact" thing?
0-female_removed_major,target:misato,targetStage:4=confused,...I got injured once.  No scars, though.  What happened to you, some military mission?
0-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6=bored,<i>Yeesh</i>.  I'm <i>sober</i>, and this girl's making me feel woozy just looking at her.
0-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6=teasing,Hey, honey, a girl's no fun unless she can have fun sober.  Give it a try sometime between shots.
0-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6=confused,Seriously, though, do you have a second liver?  Where's all this booze draining into in that tiny body?
0-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6=smug,Thank your lucky stars you didn't get a table with Meia, dear.  She'd be grilling you <i>nonstop</i> for drinking like this.
0-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:4=shocked,Wha--<i>ew</i>!  Was that in your panties?  That's gross!  Throw it out!
0-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:4=awkward,...You're not going to <i>eat</i> that, right?  After it was in your...nether-regions?
0-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:4=angry,...<i>Ew</i>.  Why are you sticking fruit anywhere but your mouth?  That's not funny!
0-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:4=annoyed,...OK, this whole comedy act of yours is starting to get gross.  What's next, a tampon in your mouth?
0-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3=interested,Looking as svelte as ever, Meia.  But really, the bodysuit showed that off anyway.
0-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3=vain,Just look at those rippling abs!  Sorry to say, but my dress already shows how I don't have any.
0-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3=seductive,All that time in the gym is paying off, hot stuff.  But it looks like you need more poker time with Gascogne, too.
0-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3=vain,Check out that figure!  <i>And the lovely pink skin only accentuates her elegant beauty</i>.
0-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3=teasing,She might be lousy at poker, but can you believe those abs?  She's <i>single</i>, ladies!
0-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3=laughing,Wow.  You really <i>are</i> a blueberry girl, top to bottom.  I can see why you kept the hood on.
0-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3=interested,Just as blue on top, I see.  Maybe you should just put the hood back on until you feel better.
0-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3=laughing,Honey, you can worry about you looks until you're blue in the face, but, uh...<i>well</i>.
0-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3=teasing,Feeling under the weather, Raven?  You're looking a little blue--I guess that's why you had the hood on.
0-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=excited,Wait--you...<i>oh my God</i>.  <i>That's fantastic</i>!
0-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=awkward,<i>I'm sorry!  I'll come quietly</i>!  I--I--wait, did you just shoot your own clothes off?
0-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=excited,I--that's...that's <i>so cool</i>!  Do it again!
0-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=excited,...Omigosh, that's so cool!  How'd you <i>do that</i>?  Can I get your autograph?

1-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:7=laughing,<i>Oh, my</i>!  And I thought men were courageous!  But this mountain of muscles hides his thing from my teeth.
1-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:7=laughing,What's the matter, Cap?  <i>Afraid this Mejarian will just bite it right off</i>?
1-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:7=teasing,Come now, honey--there's no reason to hide bheind your shield.  I don't eat <i>every</i> man's organs.
1-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:7=teasing,Don't be that way, dear.  If I wanted to eat you, I'd go for those delicious shoulder muscles.  So put the shield down.
1-female_removing_major=interested,I've still got plenty of little things to lose, and you're down to <i>that</i>?
1-female_removing_major=laughing,Once there was an Earth woman and a Mejarian.  The Mejarian had a beautiful body, but also the skills to hide it.  The Earth girl had neither.
1-female_removing_major=smug,Well, that didn't take long.  I wonder if your masturbation will.
1-female_removing_major=interested,For <i>shame</i>, Earth girl.  Don't let an alien woman walk all over you like this!
1-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meia=seductive,Maybe it's just the antigravity, but this girl's lit a fire in my heart, Leader!  Do you think I should wear a suit like yours?
1-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Hey, Leader, this girl's making bodysuits look good even for a woman with some meat on her.  Should I wear one?
1-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,I think you've managed to make bodysuits boring for me, Meia.  This girl is making me want to get one now!
1-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,Maybe I should abandon this silly dress and opt for a bodysuit like yours and Ochako's, Meia--just bare it all!  What do you say?
1-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,I know I'm not as slender and lithe as <i>you</i>, Leader, but neither is Ochako.  Should I get myself a bodysuit?
1-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=teasing,Here's the thing:  Meia <i>will not</i> admit that this game is just luck.  Go on, try.
1-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=interested,One of these days you'll realize that there's no strategy here.  Besides "throw away all but the high card," anyway.
1-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=interested,Look, Meia.  If <i>I'm</i> beating you, this is no game of wits.
1-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5=seductive,But don't worry about all that!  Let's see what outfit's next, cutie!
1-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5=vain,Another vortex, another wonderful piece of fashion to ogle.  <i>I'm so lucky</i>!
1-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5=vain,You call yourself the lucky one, but I came here <i>hoping</i> to see some cool fashion choices.
1-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5=vain,Simply magical.  My luck that I'd meet you, not these vortices.  <i>Things just work out for me</i>!
1-female_removing_major,target:aimee,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>No!  Please!  I'm too beautiful to die</i>!
1-female_removing_major,target:aimee,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>Ack!  Don't shoot!  I didn't steal anything!  Honest</i>!
1-female_removing_major,target:aimee,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>Not in the face!  Or the breasts!  Don't ruin my corpse</i>!
1-female_removing_major,target:aimee,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>I-I can't die here!  I have a girlfriend!  And hundreds of admirers</i>!
1-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:4=smug,You have a <i>secret</i>?  Well, here's your chance to keep me interested, Plain-Jane.
1-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:4=teasing,You haven't impressed so far, Plain-as-Day.  So color me interested with this "secret" of yours.
1-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:4=smug,I'm listening, dearie.  You're so average that I'm honestly willing to buy that you have a "secret."
1-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:4=laughing,Unless your secret is a third breast, I just can't see you wowing me, dear.
1-female_removing_major,target:velma,targetStage:1=interested,Seriously, honey, slow down.  Feeling self-conscious next to me?
1-female_removing_major,target:velma,targetStage:1=smug,Listen, dear--I know I have this effect on women, but there's no reason to be <i>this</i> jealous.
1-female_removing_major,target:velma,targetStage:1=laughing,Just rushing to outdo me, huh?  Sorry, but you're still a little frumpy by comparison.
1-female_removing_major,target:velma,targetStage:1=vain,Feeling inadequate, sweetie?  You should be proud of your body--don't fret about how I'm much more beautiful.
1-female_removing_major,target:velma,targetStage:1=vain,Come on, honey.  Throwing off all your clothes like this reeks of desperation next to a goddess such as myself.
1-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4=seductive,Ooh, that's a nifty trick, dear!  You can bet <i>I'd</i> give it a shot if I could...<i>do you think I should wear a bodysuit</i>?
1-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4=seductive,I've always felt I'm too pillowy and soft for a bodysuit, but you really make it your own!  <i>Could I pull it off, too, sweetie</i>?
1-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4=teasing,Hey, Miss Gravity, I was really like the look of your figure all stuffed into that suit.  Do you think I'd look good in the same thing?
1-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4=vain,Mejare has a thing for bodysuits, you know...I wonder if I should get myself one.  There's just no tease to it, you know?
1-female_removing_major,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=confused,Uh, I don't know who "Kleese" is, but I'm actually more concerned about that giant syringe you have for an arm.
1-female_removing_major,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=shocked,...So anyway, <i>what the hell is wrong with your arm...syringe...thing</i>?
1-female_removing_major,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=angry,Why do I care?  I don't know who Kleese is, you have pink skin, you're taking your dress off already, and, uh, <i>you have a giant syringe for an arm</i>.
1-female_removing_major,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=confused,...Are you really not aware of how strange you look?  Like, I was nice and didn't immediately comment on your, uh, <i>syringe</i>.
1-female_removing_major,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=frustrated,Well, I care about other things, too, like <i>Oh My God you have a giant gross needle for an arm I hate needles what's going on</i>.
1-female_removing_major,target:moon,targetStage:0=laughing,<i>Whoa</i>.  OK, you meant it.  Can't say I understand the rush, but more power to you.
1-female_removing_major,target:moon,targetStage:0=interested,You're not kidding around, are you, darling?  This your first time stripping for an audience?  Don't overdo things.
1-female_removing_major,target:moon,targetStage:0=stretching,Try to keep the audience interested, honey.  Strippers don't walk out onstage naked for a reason.
1-female_removing_major,target:moon,targetStage:0=teasing,Straight for the bra?  What an amateur...it's shock value.  The tease is half the fun, silly!
1-female_removing_major,target:buffy,targetStage:4=laughing,<i>And what have we here</i>?  Ooh, you're more depraved than I thought, Miss Vampire Hunter.
1-female_removing_major,target:buffy,targetStage:4=laughing,<i>Heeheehee</i>!  Undoing your bra beneath your shirt, you little tease?  A woman after my own heart...if I wore bras.
1-female_removing_major,target:buffy,targetStage:4=smug,That's a sexy little move there, honey.  I'd try it, too, but bras have never been to my tastes in the first place.
1-female_removing_major,target:buffy,targetStage:4=teasing,So are you trying to be fun and sexy, or just throwing us all off?  <i>I'd certainly prefer the former</i>.
1-female_removing_major,target:misato,targetStage:3=confused,Oooh, the <i>dress</i>!  Now we're talking!  ...What's the matter, Misato?
1-female_removing_major,target:misato,targetStage:3=seductive,Aww, <i>someone's</i> embarrassed even through the booze!  What's got you all shy suddenly, huh?
1-female_removing_major,target:misato,targetStage:3=laughing,Even half in the bag like this, you're all nervous.  Hiding something under that dress?
1-female_removing_major,target:misato,targetStage:3=interested,Hey, Misato, what's wrong?  You look a little on edge suddenly, even between burps.
1-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:4=seductive,Is that your own special die, or does it just work for anyone?  ...Can <i>I</i> try?
1-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:4=vain,So if I rolled that thing, could it give me a whole new outfit?  I mean, I <i>do</i> love my dress, but hey.
1-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:4=confused,Now I'm starting to get curious about that die of yours.  Would it work if <i>I</i> rolled it?
1-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:4=teasing,Does that die work solely for you?  What if I just <i>snatched it</i> like the pirate I am?
1-female_removing_major,target:jasmine,targetStage:1=interested,Wait, <i>what</i>?  I thought you were just dressed in typical overly-conservative Earth wear, but instead you're <i>royalty</i>?
1-female_removing_major,target:jasmine,targetStage:1=laughing,That was a disguise?  Hey, dearie, next time try hiding your <i>face</i>.  That might throw people off the princess's trail.
1-female_removing_major,target:jasmine,targetStage:1=laughing,You were disguised?  You're <i>royalty</i>?  If the commoners can't recognize their princess's face, I can see why you're still in power.
1-female_removing_major,target:jasmine,targetStage:1=laughing,Oh, what's this?  You're <i>nobility</i>?  Well, well, well, honey...<i>you'll make an excellent ransom</i>.
1-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:2=smug,My, my, another magic trick?  Can't you dazzle us with your own naked body, dear?
1-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:2=interested,This is getting old already, honey.  By all means, show your body instead--<i>that's</i> far more interesting.
1-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:2=smug,You Earth girls and your parlor tricks.  Is this the sort of thing that amuses men and their tiny primate brains?  I'd rather see you naked.
1-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:2=laughing,Can't you just magic-off your whole outfit, dearie?  I'd rather see how far down your makeup goes.
1-female_removing_major,target:faye,targetStage:4=laughing,<i>Pfft</i>!  So much for the cool-and-calculated act!  Even <i>I</i> wouldn't stoop that low...maybe.
1-female_removing_major,target:faye,targetStage:4=laughing,There's no need, dear.  You're showing your true colors already.
1-female_removing_major,target:faye,targetStage:4=annoyed,OK, even <i>I</i> wouldn't count my makeup.  It's just luck, honey, don't be so sore about it.
1-female_removing_major,target:faye,targetStage:4=interested,Look, honey, if you have to wear enough makeup that it counts as clothing, it wouldn't save your looks in the first place.
1-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:4=seductive,<i>Heeheehee</i>!  What was that again?  <i>Too-ayy-jolee</i>?
1-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:4=teasing,<i>Too--too-ay-julee</i>?  Did I get it right?  Help me out here, cutie.
1-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:4=seductive,<i>Tooayyjolie</i>?  Was that it?  Oh, all your words just melt together into a chocolate fondue of language!
1-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:4=confused,<i>Too--tooayy</i>, uh, what was that?  I mean, it was adorable, but I didn't really catch it.
1-female_removing_major,target:launch,targetStage:5=bored,...Well, at least you're blonde again.  Blonde's a good color...I can stare at that and tune you out.
1-female_removing_major,target:launch,targetStage:5=bored,At least there's no gun this time.  Now you'll have to make a racket by shouting.
1-female_removing_major,target:launch,targetStage:5=bored,Yeah, yeah, keep on screaming.  I'll just stare at that lovely blonde hair and try to forget what's under it...
1-female_removing_major,target:launch,targetStage:5=frustrated,Your blue version really taught me the value of peace and quiet.
1-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1=shocked,<i>Ack!  No!  The Paksis!  I should've known this was a dream</i>!
1-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1=shocked,<i>Eeek!  Marinette!  The Harvest has got you!  Nooo</i>!
1-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1=shocked,<i>Aaack!  Don't touch me!  W-what's happening?  Help</i>!
1-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1=shocked,<i>Aaack!  T-the Harvest!  They're here!  Run!  I'm sorry, Ladybug</i>!
1-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1=shocked,<i>Eeek!  No!  Please!  I have a girlfriend!  I can't die here</i>!
1-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=seductive,<i>Teehee</i>!  I have no clue what you just said, but you've <i>got</i> to teach me, Marinette!  This'll drive my girlfriend <i>wild</i>.
1-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=vain,I can just <i>picture</i> the look on Barnette's face when I start whispering these sweet nothings.  Could you teach me?
1-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=excited,What was that?  Anyway, omigosh, Marinette, you <i>have</i> to give me some French lessons!  Barnette will melt in my arms!
1-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=seductive,Whatever you just said, my girlfriend Barnette would absolutely <i>melt</i>, it's so romantic!  <i>Won't you please teach me</i>?
1-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=laughing,Oho--and the Masked Woman is revealing herself!  I'm sure she has a good explanation for hiding.
1-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=seductive,What's this, now?  The Masked Woman feels like looking us all in the eye?  I'd love to know why you waited so long.
1-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=teasing,This had better be interesting, dear.  I want a face worth waiting for, because the rest of us are revealing more sensitive areas.
1-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=teasing,Afraid of my evil alien gaze, honey?  How xenophobic--now take off that mask so I can see why you wore it.
1-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=laughing,So soon, dearie?  I guess that "Secret Identity" of yours isn't worth hiding your pleasure from us.
1-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=smug,I guess you'd rather look your admirers in the eyes than conceal you identity any longer than a few rounds.
1-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=laughing,So much for your "Secret Identity," honey.  That's the second thing you're taking off!
1-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=stretching,Oho!  And the mask comes off.  Why you bothered with it at all if it's going this quickly, I'll never understand.
1-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=teasing,Well, look who's overcoming her shyness!  Guess that "Secret Identity" didn't last too long when you could've been nude instead.
1-female_removed_major=seductive,Careful, now.  If I fall under your spell, Barnette won't be happy!
1-female_removed_major=interested,Well, aren't you ravishing.  But my Barnette is still cuter.
1-female_removed_major=seductive,It might be instinct to go after men, but I'll always have an eye for beautiful women.
1-female_removed_major=seductive,Going to make this Mejarian fall for you, ~name~?
1-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:3=vain,Well, would you look at that!  Exactly what I wanted to see.  <i>More, please</i>!
1-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:3=stretching,How about that?  You're finally taking my sage Mejarian advice concerning the female body.
1-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:3=seductive,See?  There you go!  The best kind of magic is the kind that makes women's clothes disappear!
1-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:3=laughing,Hah!  It's good to know you're listening to me.  Now do another trick and make yourself stark-naked!
1-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:4=shocked,Wha--<i>ew</i>!  Was that in your panties?  That's gross!  Throw it out!
1-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:4=awkward,...You're not going to <i>eat</i> that, right?  After it was in your...nether-regions?
1-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:4=angry,...<i>Ew</i>.  Why are you sticking fruit anywhere but your mouth?  That's not funny!
1-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:4=annoyed,...OK, this whole comedy act of yours is starting to get gross.  What's next, a tampon in your mouth?
1-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=awkward,That's, uh, really...<i>wow</i>.  That is a <i>lot</i> of pubic hair, to be peeking out of your thong like that...are you OK?
1-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=angry,<i>Ew</i>.  Don't you have razors where you live?  I can see your icky pubic hair poking out from here!
1-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=annoyed,...Were you laid up in bed recently?  Because I can see your unshaven hair from behind your thong, and <i>eugh</i>.
1-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=angry,OK, <i>ew</i>.  Don't you <i>shave</i>, Rinkah?  Do Earth men really like all that hair?
1-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=frustrated,...Maybe you're unaware, but Mejare is obsessed with shaving, cleanliness, and smoothness.  <i>So that's really gross</i>.
1-female_removed_major,target:moon,targetStage:1=laughing,<i>Jeez</i>.  Way to immediately dispel any notions I had of Earth girls being prudes.
1-female_removed_major,target:moon,targetStage:1=interested,And here I thought Earth girls felt shy about the whole <i>sex</i> thing.  Not you, sweetheart.
1-female_removed_major,target:moon,targetStage:1=smug,And I thought <i>I</i> was eager.  But no, it seems Mejarians are classier as well as more beautiful.
1-female_removed_major,target:moon,targetStage:1=interested,You're something else, Ocean Girl.  Is men's attention <i>that</i> important to you?
1-female_removed_major,target:shego,targetStage:4=seductive,<i>Oh, my</i>!  Way to go above and beyond, honey--I thought the bodysuit was sexy enough already!
1-female_removed_major,target:shego,targetStage:4=laughing,Who exactly are you dressing up for, dear?  This is enough sexy outfits to please an army.
1-female_removed_major,target:shego,targetStage:4=teasing,With <i>that</i> underneath your suit, I'm impressed you can move at all...<i>you must be a real animal in bed</i>.
1-female_removed_major,target:shego,targetStage:4=seductive,There's no stopping <i>your</i> sex appeal, honey--just look at all that!  You put the effort in.
1-female_removed_major,target:shego,targetStage:4=stretching,I'd say you're showing a sexy side, but the suit did that already.
1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2=awkward,<i>Noooo</i>...what?  You're in street clothes now?  ...What was <i>that</i> all about?
1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2=angry,...OK.  Yeah.  Would you mind explaining why you just went nuclear, "Ladybug"?
1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2=shocked,<i>Help!  I--I</i>...OK.  It stopped.  Are you planning on explaining that, "Ladybug"?
1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,marker:planet-countries=confused,...OK, that's much more...<i>normal</i>.  Is this how people change clothes on Planet France?
1-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,alsoPlaying:meia,priority:100=teasing,Oh look, an athletic girl.  You pull off muscles a lot better than me, Meia--abs would ruin the way my dress hugs my body.
1-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,alsoPlaying:meia,priority:100=vain,Could my Barnette use some muscle?  Maybe.  But she's cute just the way she is!
1-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,alsoPlaying:meia,priority:100=teasing,Hey now, exercise makes a good body great...but a bad body's beyond saving.
1-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,alsoPlaying:meia,priority:100=vain,How am I supposed to exercise without tearing my wonderful dress?
1-female_removed_major,target:misato,targetStage:4=shocked,<i>Eek!  OK!  Never mind!  Sorry!  I shouldn't have made fun</i>!  ...How'd you <i>get</i> that?
1-female_removed_major,target:misato,targetStage:4=awkward,...<i>Oof</i>.  What gave you <i>that</i>?  ...If you don't mind me asking.
1-female_removed_major,target:misato,targetStage:4=confused,...Should I ask what gave you that?  Is that out of line?  Is it from the "Second Impact" thing?
1-female_removed_major,target:misato,targetStage:4=confused,...I got injured once.  No scars, though.  What happened to you, some military mission?
1-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3=seductive,Hate to be beating you like this, but you look so good!  All that exercise is paying off, cutie.
1-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3=seductive,<i>You're</i> the winner here, Meia.  Now you get to show off those abs you work so hard for!
1-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3=teasing,A body to be proud of, hot stuff.  You work a lot harder, even if I'm a little more buxom.
1-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3=teasing,Good thing I have a body that doesn't need any exercise to look good...not that you weren't cute in the first place.
1-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6=bored,<i>Yeesh</i>.  I'm <i>sober</i>, and this girl's making me feel woozy just looking at her.
1-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6=teasing,Hey, honey, a girl's no fun unless she can have fun sober.  Give it a try sometime between shots.
1-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6=confused,Seriously, though, do you have a second liver?  Where's all this booze draining into in that tiny body?
1-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6=smug,Thank your lucky stars you didn't get a table with Meia, dear.  She'd be grilling you <i>nonstop</i> for drinking like this.
1-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=excited,Wait--you...<i>oh my God</i>.  <i>That's fantastic</i>!
1-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=awkward,<i>I'm sorry!  I'll come quietly</i>!  I--I--wait, did you just shoot your own clothes off?
1-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=excited,I--that's...that's <i>so cool</i>!  Do it again!
1-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=excited,...Omigosh, that's so cool!  How'd you <i>do that</i>?  Can I get your autograph?
1-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3=laughing,Wow.  You really <i>are</i> a blueberry girl, top to bottom.  I can see why you kept the hood on.
1-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3=interested,Just as blue on top, I see.  Maybe you should just put the hood back on until you feel better.
1-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3=laughing,Honey, you can worry about you looks until you're blue in the face, but, uh...<i>well</i>.
1-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3=teasing,Feeling under the weather, Raven?  You're looking a little blue--I guess that's why you had the hood on.
1-female_removed_major,target:faye,targetStage:5=interested,Oh.  Might as well have gone through with it, dearie--you've already embarrassed yourself by trying.
1-female_removed_major,target:faye,targetStage:5=teasing,No use saving face now, honey--unless you think the makeup does that.
1-female_removed_major,target:faye,targetStage:5=smug,Hey, don't let <i>my</i> complaints stop you.  You've already lost the respect of the table, darling.
1-female_removed_major,target:faye,targetStage:5=teasing,What a sore loser.  Can't quite keep up the tease when you've got to answer for it, huh?  <i>Try me</i>.
1-female_removed_major,target:ayano,targetStage:6=shocked,Ooh, a swimsuit!  I like the beach, too--wait, are those <i>bloodstains</i>?  Uh--like, they're <i>yours</i>, right?
1-female_removed_major,target:ayano,targetStage:6=laughing,Ouch, honey.  Picked the worst day of the month to go swimming, didn't you?
1-female_removed_major,target:ayano,targetStage:6=awkward,...Those are <i>your</i> bloodstains, right?  Like, from menstrual issues, or something?
1-female_removed_major,target:ayano,targetStage:6=thinking,Seems Earth women haven't quite nailed down how to track their own menstrual cycles.  Why do we have those, anyway?
1-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5a=laughing,What is <i>that</i> supposed to be?  Look, I don't go for your creepy dungeon play.
1-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5a=laughing,I wasn't aware other planets were into bondage...but Mejare had to get its ideas from somewhere.
1-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5a=laughing,Planning on <i>dominating</i> us later, Vriska?  Don't tie me up for piracy, now!  <i>Heeheehee</i>!
1-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5a=vain,Oh, dear.  That's quite the authoritative outfit for a pirate like me to be comfortable around.
1-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5c=laughing,Getting a little skimpier than you'd like, honey?  You can't control fate, so just hope for good rolls...and leg coverage.
1-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5c=teasing,Aww, it's not so bad!  Pants are overrated...just look at me.
1-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5c=vain,I bet the breeze feels good on your legs now.  You're starting to see the genius of my fashion choices!
1-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5c=laughing,Why wear pants when your shirt can cover all the essentials?  Now put on a dress and you'll be just like me.
1-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6a=laughing,...See what I meant?  That die's got it out for you!  Better off stripping like normal, Miss Aquatic.
1-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6a=teasing,That die's not doing you any favors anymore, darling.  Best to just strip like the rest of us...or go for another swim.
1-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6a=laughing,Yeah, I didn't say anything before, but you <i>have</i> been cheating.  Enjoy being all soggy!
1-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6a=laughing,Back from a swim, Vriska?  I'm <i>loving</i> this!  You're too much!
1-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2=teasing,Ooh, you're <i>blonde</i>!  <i>Just what I was hoping for, cutie</i>.
1-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2=vain,Omigosh--you're <i>blonde</i>, and you were hiding it?  What's the matter with you--blonde women are the most beautiful of all!
1-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2=seductive,Hey, hey, hey!  The Masked Woman is <i>blonde</i>?  I <i>love</i> blondes...they remind me of myself.
1-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2=vain,Ooh, a fellow blonde!  Life has truly blessed us with this color--I can't believe you'd go and try to hide it.
1-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5b=seductive,That's cute and simple!  Who's Eridan, your girlfriend?
1-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5b=laughing,Stealing clothes from your girlfriend now, Vriska?  Is "Eridan" OK with you rooting through her wardrobe?
1-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5b=seductive,See, that's plain and simple fashion for the masses!  Your girlfriend Eridan has some good taste in outfits.
1-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5b=laughing,Skirt and stockings?  Simple, but sexy!  Tell this "Eridan" I like her style.  She your girlfriend?
1-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:blake,totalMales:1-2=laughing,Hey, honey, why don't we all just cool it?  You're making it clear how this girl's your ladyfriend--leave the men alone.
1-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:blake,totalMales:1-2=seductive,My, my!  Getting a little defensive around men, are we?  I guess you Earth girls have to fight tooth and nail to keep each other.
1-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:blake,totalMales:1-2=teasing,So you two are together, is that it?  And those <i>nasty Earth men</i> want to drive you apart?  Thanks for repping Mejare for me.
1-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:blake,totalMales:1-2=vain,Oh, are you two a couple?  I've been going steady with Barnette for a while...though I don't feel any hatred of men because of it.
1-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6b=teasing,Looking more Mejarian all the time, Vriska!  Skin is always in style where I'm from.
1-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6b=seductive,That's the fashion I know and love!  Less is more on Mejare, as they say...
1-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6b=stretching,Now you're dressing like all the other women I know on Mejare.  <i>Bo-ring</i>.
1-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6b=interested,Nice Mejarian look you're rocking there now.  My girlfriend tends to wear even less than that.
1-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:5=interested,<i>Well</i>!  Plain-Jane's not <i>quite</i> so plain after all.  Good show.
1-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:5=laughing,Ha!  Not bad for an Earth girl...at least you really <i>were</i> hiding something.
1-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:5=vain,Earth girls really <i>are</i> nuts...why would you hide those beauties away?  Honestly.
1-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:5=stretching,A plain face and huge breasts?  You're the logical conclusion of Mejare's obsession with chests.
1-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,priority:0=teasing,Meia's actually got some muscle to her.  She's pretty cute, too--abs would ruin the way my dress hugs my body.
1-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,priority:0=vain,Could my Barnette use some muscle?  Maybe.  But she's cute just the way she is!
1-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,priority:0=teasing,Hey now, exercise makes a good body great...but a bad body's beyond saving.
1-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,priority:0=vain,How am I supposed to exercise without tearing my wonderful dress?


#lost boots
2-male_removing_major=interested,<i>Well, now</i>!  Finally, a real development.
2-male_removing_major=seductive,Finally, a hint of fun from a man.  You <i>do</i> have a heart!
2-male_removing_major=excited,Ooh, I can't <i>wait</i>, ~name~.
2-male_removing_major=teasing,Looks like all my teasing finally got to you.
2-male_removed_major=seductive,You've been around the bend with Earth girls, right?  Well...Mejarians are <i>goddesses</i> by comparison.
2-male_removed_major=teasing,What's the Earth dating scene like?  Any girls like <i>me</i>?
2-male_removed_major=vain,I hope Barnette won't mind if I'm spellbound by your manly charms.
2-male_removed_major=smug,And I stripped you <i>all by myself</i>.  Pilots tend to need teamwork.
2-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:7=laughing,<i>Oh, my</i>!  And I thought men were courageous!  But this mountain of muscles hides his thing from my teeth.
2-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:7=laughing,What's the matter, Cap?  <i>Afraid this Mejarian will just bite it right off</i>?
2-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:7=teasing,Come now, honey--there's no reason to hide bheind your shield.  I don't eat <i>every</i> man's organs.
2-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:7=teasing,Don't be that way, dear.  If I wanted to eat you, I'd go for those delicious shoulder muscles.  So put the shield down.
2-female_removing_major=vain,Meia would be really wiping the floor with you right now.  I've never beaten her.
2-female_removing_major=teasing,What a sad display.  <i>You shame your home planet</i>!
2-female_removing_major=laughing,<i>Where's your focus</i>?  <i>Strategy is key</i>!  That's how Meia sounds.
2-female_removing_major=vain,Dita would bring that cute little crop-top jacket of hers...and probably that alien antennae headband, too.
2-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:2=smug,My, my, another magic trick?  Can't you dazzle us with your own naked body, dear?
2-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:2=interested,This is getting old already, honey.  By all means, show your body instead--<i>that's</i> far more interesting.
2-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:2=smug,You Earth girls and your parlor tricks.  Is this the sort of thing that amuses men and their tiny primate brains?  I'd rather see you naked.
2-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:2=laughing,Can't you just magic-off your whole outfit, dearie?  I'd rather see how far down your makeup goes.
2-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=laughing,Oho--and the Masked Woman is revealing herself!  I'm sure she has a good explanation for hiding.
2-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=seductive,What's this, now?  The Masked Woman feels like looking us all in the eye?  I'd love to know why you waited so long.
2-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=teasing,This had better be interesting, dear.  I want a face worth waiting for, because the rest of us are revealing more sensitive areas.
2-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=teasing,Afraid of my evil alien gaze, honey?  How xenophobic--now take off that mask so I can see why you wore it.
2-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=laughing,So soon, dearie?  I guess that "Secret Identity" of yours isn't worth hiding your pleasure from us.
2-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=smug,I guess you'd rather look your admirers in the eyes than conceal you identity any longer than a few rounds.
2-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=laughing,So much for your "Secret Identity," honey.  That's the second thing you're taking off!
2-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=stretching,Oho!  And the mask comes off.  Why you bothered with it at all if it's going this quickly, I'll never understand.
2-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=teasing,Well, look who's overcoming her shyness!  Guess that "Secret Identity" didn't last too long when you could've been nude instead.
2-female_removing_major,target:jasmine,targetStage:1=interested,Wait, <i>what</i>?  I thought you were just dressed in typical overly-conservative Earth wear, but instead you're <i>royalty</i>?
2-female_removing_major,target:jasmine,targetStage:1=laughing,That was a disguise?  Hey, dearie, next time try hiding your <i>face</i>.  That might throw people off the princess's trail.
2-female_removing_major,target:jasmine,targetStage:1=laughing,You were disguised?  You're <i>royalty</i>?  If the commoners can't recognize their princess's face, I can see why you're still in power.
2-female_removing_major,target:jasmine,targetStage:1=laughing,Oh, what's this?  You're <i>nobility</i>?  Well, well, well, honey...<i>you'll make an excellent ransom</i>.
2-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=seductive,<i>Teehee</i>!  I have no clue what you just said, but you've <i>got</i> to teach me, Marinette!  This'll drive my girlfriend <i>wild</i>.
2-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=vain,I can just <i>picture</i> the look on Barnette's face when I start whispering these sweet nothings.  Could you teach me?
2-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=excited,What was that?  Anyway, omigosh, Marinette, you <i>have</i> to give me some French lessons!  Barnette will melt in my arms!
2-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=seductive,Whatever you just said, my girlfriend Barnette would absolutely <i>melt</i>, it's so romantic!  <i>Won't you please teach me</i>?
2-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:4=seductive,<i>Heeheehee</i>!  What was that again?  <i>Too-ayy-jolee</i>?
2-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:4=teasing,<i>Too--too-ay-julee</i>?  Did I get it right?  Help me out here, cutie.
2-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:4=seductive,<i>Tooayyjolie</i>?  Was that it?  Oh, all your words just melt together into a chocolate fondue of language!
2-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:4=confused,<i>Too--tooayy</i>, uh, what was that?  I mean, it was adorable, but I didn't really catch it.
2-female_removing_major,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=confused,Uh, I don't know who "Kleese" is, but I'm actually more concerned about that giant syringe you have for an arm.
2-female_removing_major,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=shocked,...So anyway, <i>what the hell is wrong with your arm...syringe...thing</i>?
2-female_removing_major,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=angry,Why do I care?  I don't know who Kleese is, you have pink skin, you're taking your dress off already, and, uh, <i>you have a giant syringe for an arm</i>.
2-female_removing_major,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=confused,...Are you really not aware of how strange you look?  Like, I was nice and didn't immediately comment on your, uh, <i>syringe</i>.
2-female_removing_major,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=frustrated,Well, I care about other things, too, like <i>Oh My God you have a giant gross needle for an arm I hate needles what's going on</i>.
2-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1=shocked,<i>Ack!  No!  The Paksis!  I should've known this was a dream</i>!
2-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1=shocked,<i>Eeek!  Marinette!  The Harvest has got you!  Nooo</i>!
2-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1=shocked,<i>Aaack!  Don't touch me!  W-what's happening?  Help</i>!
2-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1=shocked,<i>Aaack!  T-the Harvest!  They're here!  Run!  I'm sorry, Ladybug</i>!
2-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1=shocked,<i>Eeek!  No!  Please!  I have a girlfriend!  I can't die here</i>!
2-female_removing_major,target:launch,targetStage:5=bored,...Well, at least you're blonde again.  Blonde's a good color...I can stare at that and tune you out.
2-female_removing_major,target:launch,targetStage:5=bored,At least there's no gun this time.  Now you'll have to make a racket by shouting.
2-female_removing_major,target:launch,targetStage:5=bored,Yeah, yeah, keep on screaming.  I'll just stare at that lovely blonde hair and try to forget what's under it...
2-female_removing_major,target:launch,targetStage:5=frustrated,Your blue version really taught me the value of peace and quiet.
2-female_removing_major,target:buffy,targetStage:4=laughing,<i>And what have we here</i>?  Ooh, you're more depraved than I thought, Miss Vampire Hunter.
2-female_removing_major,target:buffy,targetStage:4=laughing,<i>Heeheehee</i>!  Undoing your bra beneath your shirt, you little tease?  A woman after my own heart...if I wore bras.
2-female_removing_major,target:buffy,targetStage:4=smug,That's a sexy little move there, honey.  I'd try it, too, but bras have never been to my tastes in the first place.
2-female_removing_major,target:buffy,targetStage:4=teasing,So are you trying to be fun and sexy, or just throwing us all off?  <i>I'd certainly prefer the former</i>.
2-female_removing_major,target:faye,targetStage:4=laughing,<i>Pfft</i>!  So much for the cool-and-calculated act!  Even <i>I</i> wouldn't stoop that low...maybe.
2-female_removing_major,target:faye,targetStage:4=laughing,There's no need, dear.  You're showing your true colors already.
2-female_removing_major,target:faye,targetStage:4=annoyed,OK, even <i>I</i> wouldn't count my makeup.  It's just luck, honey, don't be so sore about it.
2-female_removing_major,target:faye,targetStage:4=interested,Look, honey, if you have to wear enough makeup that it counts as clothing, it wouldn't save your looks in the first place.
2-female_removing_major,target:misato,targetStage:3=confused,Oooh, the <i>dress</i>!  Now we're talking!  ...What's the matter, Misato?
2-female_removing_major,target:misato,targetStage:3=seductive,Aww, <i>someone's</i> embarrassed even through the booze!  What's got you all shy suddenly, huh?
2-female_removing_major,target:misato,targetStage:3=laughing,Even half in the bag like this, you're all nervous.  Hiding something under that dress?
2-female_removing_major,target:misato,targetStage:3=interested,Hey, Misato, what's wrong?  You look a little on edge suddenly, even between burps.
2-female_removing_major,target:moon,targetStage:0=laughing,<i>Whoa</i>.  OK, you meant it.  Can't say I understand the rush, but more power to you.
2-female_removing_major,target:moon,targetStage:0=interested,You're not kidding around, are you, darling?  This your first time stripping for an audience?  Don't overdo things.
2-female_removing_major,target:moon,targetStage:0=stretching,Try to keep the audience interested, honey.  Strippers don't walk out onstage naked for a reason.
2-female_removing_major,target:moon,targetStage:0=teasing,Straight for the bra?  What an amateur...it's shock value.  The tease is half the fun, silly!
2-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meia=seductive,Maybe it's just the antigravity, but this girl's lit a fire in my heart, Leader!  Do you think I should wear a suit like yours?
2-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Hey, Leader, this girl's making bodysuits look good even for a woman with some meat on her.  Should I wear one?
2-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,I think you've managed to make bodysuits boring for me, Meia.  This girl is making me want to get one now!
2-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,Maybe I should abandon this silly dress and opt for a bodysuit like yours and Ochako's, Meia--just bare it all!  What do you say?
2-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,I know I'm not as slender and lithe as <i>you</i>, Leader, but neither is Ochako.  Should I get myself a bodysuit?
2-female_removing_major,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,What a sad display.  <i>You shame your home planet</i>!
2-female_removing_major,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,<i>Where's your focus</i>?  <i>Strategy is key</i>!  That's how you sound, Meia.
2-female_removing_major,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,Dita would bring that cute little crop-top jacket of hers...and probably that alien antennae headband, too.
2-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=vain,Yeah, folks, it's all one piece.  I <i>said</i> she didn't wear much...but isn't it sexier that way?
2-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=laughing,And there it goes.  But what a dazzling move, zipping it all down in one stroke!
2-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=vain,Like a beautiful butterfly emerging from her cocoon.  And all at once, too!
2-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=seductive,I wonder if I can make my dress come off all at once like that...it's bold and sexy.
2-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5=seductive,But don't worry about all that!  Let's see what outfit's next, cutie!
2-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5=vain,Another vortex, another wonderful piece of fashion to ogle.  <i>I'm so lucky</i>!
2-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5=vain,You call yourself the lucky one, but I came here <i>hoping</i> to see some cool fashion choices.
2-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5=vain,Simply magical.  My luck that I'd meet you, not these vortices.  <i>Things just work out for me</i>!
2-female_removing_major,target:aimee,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>No!  Please!  I'm too beautiful to die</i>!
2-female_removing_major,target:aimee,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>Ack!  Don't shoot!  I didn't steal anything!  Honest</i>!
2-female_removing_major,target:aimee,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>Not in the face!  Or the breasts!  Don't ruin my corpse</i>!
2-female_removing_major,target:aimee,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>I-I can't die here!  I have a girlfriend!  And hundreds of admirers</i>!
2-female_removing_major,target:velma,targetStage:1=interested,Seriously, honey, slow down.  Feeling self-conscious next to me?
2-female_removing_major,target:velma,targetStage:1=smug,Listen, dear--I know I have this effect on women, but there's no reason to be <i>this</i> jealous.
2-female_removing_major,target:velma,targetStage:1=laughing,Just rushing to outdo me, huh?  Sorry, but you're still a little frumpy by comparison.
2-female_removing_major,target:velma,targetStage:1=vain,Feeling inadequate, sweetie?  You should be proud of your body--don't fret about how I'm much more beautiful.
2-female_removing_major,target:velma,targetStage:1=vain,Come on, honey.  Throwing off all your clothes like this reeks of desperation next to a goddess such as myself.
2-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:4=seductive,Is that your own special die, or does it just work for anyone?  ...Can <i>I</i> try?
2-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:4=vain,So if I rolled that thing, could it give me a whole new outfit?  I mean, I <i>do</i> love my dress, but hey.
2-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:4=confused,Now I'm starting to get curious about that die of yours.  Would it work if <i>I</i> rolled it?
2-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:4=teasing,Does that die work solely for you?  What if I just <i>snatched it</i> like the pirate I am?
2-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4=seductive,Ooh, that's a nifty trick, dear!  You can bet <i>I'd</i> give it a shot if I could...<i>do you think I should wear a bodysuit</i>?
2-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4=seductive,I've always felt I'm too pillowy and soft for a bodysuit, but you really make it your own!  <i>Could I pull it off, too, sweetie</i>?
2-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4=teasing,Hey, Miss Gravity, I was really like the look of your figure all stuffed into that suit.  Do you think I'd look good in the same thing?
2-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4=vain,Mejare has a thing for bodysuits, you know...I wonder if I should get myself one.  There's just no tease to it, you know?
2-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:4=smug,You have a <i>secret</i>?  Well, here's your chance to keep me interested, Plain-Jane.
2-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:4=teasing,You haven't impressed so far, Plain-as-Day.  So color me interested with this "secret" of yours.
2-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:4=smug,I'm listening, dearie.  You're so average that I'm honestly willing to buy that you have a "secret."
2-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:4=laughing,Unless your secret is a third breast, I just can't see you wowing me, dear.
2-female_removed_major=vain,You want a <i>real</i> challenge?  Try getting Meia to admit this game is luck.
2-female_removed_major=vain,A strip worthy of Ezra.  She dresses so conservatively--but I guess being a Fama does that to you.
2-female_removed_major=interested,Hey, you can always count on the crew of the Nirvana to bounce back from a crisis.  How about you?
2-female_removed_major=stretching,Don't act so wounded.  I've <i>been</i> wounded, and I was back in my Dread within hours!  With some painkillers.
2-female_removed_major,target:faye,targetStage:5=interested,Oh.  Might as well have gone through with it, dearie--you've already embarrassed yourself by trying.
2-female_removed_major,target:faye,targetStage:5=teasing,No use saving face now, honey--unless you think the makeup does that.
2-female_removed_major,target:faye,targetStage:5=smug,Hey, don't let <i>my</i> complaints stop you.  You've already lost the respect of the table, darling.
2-female_removed_major,target:faye,targetStage:5=teasing,What a sore loser.  Can't quite keep up the tease when you've got to answer for it, huh?  <i>Try me</i>.
2-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,priority:0=vain,Meia's actually got some muscle to her.  She's pretty cute for being so stoic.
2-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,priority:0=vain,Meia's actually got some muscle to her.  She's pretty cute...or she <i>would</i> be, if she smiled more.
2-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,priority:0=stretching,I think Meia's gym clothes are the one outfit I can't pull off.
2-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,priority:0=excited,All those muscles!  I can appreciate women who stay fit--I just don't want to put the effort in.
2-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3=laughing,Wow.  You really <i>are</i> a blueberry girl, top to bottom.  I can see why you kept the hood on.
2-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3=interested,Just as blue on top, I see.  Maybe you should just put the hood back on until you feel better.
2-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3=laughing,Honey, you can worry about you looks until you're blue in the face, but, uh...<i>well</i>.
2-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3=teasing,Feeling under the weather, Raven?  You're looking a little blue--I guess that's why you had the hood on.
2-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6b=teasing,Looking more Mejarian all the time, Vriska!  Skin is always in style where I'm from.
2-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6b=seductive,That's the fashion I know and love!  Less is more on Mejare, as they say...
2-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6b=stretching,Now you're dressing like all the other women I know on Mejare.  <i>Bo-ring</i>.
2-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6b=interested,Nice Mejarian look you're rocking there now.  My girlfriend tends to wear even less than that.
2-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2=teasing,Ooh, you're <i>blonde</i>!  <i>Just what I was hoping for, cutie</i>.
2-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2=vain,Omigosh--you're <i>blonde</i>, and you were hiding it?  What's the matter with you--blonde women are the most beautiful of all!
2-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2=seductive,Hey, hey, hey!  The Masked Woman is <i>blonde</i>?  I <i>love</i> blondes...they remind me of myself.
2-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2=vain,Ooh, a fellow blonde!  Life has truly blessed us with this color--I can't believe you'd go and try to hide it.
2-female_removed_major,target:moon,targetStage:1=laughing,<i>Jeez</i>.  Way to immediately dispel any notions I had of Earth girls being prudes.
2-female_removed_major,target:moon,targetStage:1=interested,And here I thought Earth girls felt shy about the whole <i>sex</i> thing.  Not you, sweetheart.
2-female_removed_major,target:moon,targetStage:1=smug,And I thought <i>I</i> was eager.  But no, it seems Mejarians are classier as well as more beautiful.
2-female_removed_major,target:moon,targetStage:1=interested,You're something else, Ocean Girl.  Is men's attention <i>that</i> important to you?
2-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5a=laughing,What is <i>that</i> supposed to be?  Look, I don't go for your creepy dungeon play.
2-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5a=laughing,I wasn't aware other planets were into bondage...but Mejare had to get its ideas from somewhere.
2-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5a=laughing,Planning on <i>dominating</i> us later, Vriska?  Don't tie me up for piracy, now!  <i>Heeheehee</i>!
2-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5a=vain,Oh, dear.  That's quite the authoritative outfit for a pirate like me to be comfortable around.
2-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2=awkward,<i>Noooo</i>...what?  You're in street clothes now?  ...What was <i>that</i> all about?
2-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2=angry,...OK.  Yeah.  Would you mind explaining why you just went nuclear, "Ladybug"?
2-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2=shocked,<i>Help!  I--I</i>...OK.  It stopped.  Are you planning on explaining that, "Ladybug"?
2-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,marker:planet-countries=confused,...OK, that's much more...<i>normal</i>.  Is this how people change clothes on Planet France?
2-female_removed_major,target:ayano,targetStage:6=shocked,Ooh, a swimsuit!  I like the beach, too--wait, are those <i>bloodstains</i>?  Uh--like, they're <i>yours</i>, right?
2-female_removed_major,target:ayano,targetStage:6=laughing,Ouch, honey.  Picked the worst day of the month to go swimming, didn't you?
2-female_removed_major,target:ayano,targetStage:6=awkward,...Those are <i>your</i> bloodstains, right?  Like, from menstrual issues, or something?
2-female_removed_major,target:ayano,targetStage:6=thinking,Seems Earth women haven't quite nailed down how to track their own menstrual cycles.  Why do we have those, anyway?
2-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:blake,totalMales:1-2=laughing,Hey, honey, why don't we all just cool it?  You're making it clear how this girl's your ladyfriend--leave the men alone.
2-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:blake,totalMales:1-2=seductive,My, my!  Getting a little defensive around men, are we?  I guess you Earth girls have to fight tooth and nail to keep each other.
2-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:blake,totalMales:1-2=teasing,So you two are together, is that it?  And those <i>nasty Earth men</i> want to drive you apart?  Thanks for repping Mejare for me.
2-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:blake,totalMales:1-2=vain,Oh, are you two a couple?  I've been going steady with Barnette for a while...though I don't feel any hatred of men because of it.
2-female_removed_major,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,You want a <i>real</i> challenge?  Try getting Meia here to admit this game is luck.  Can't be done.
2-female_removed_major,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,A strip worthy of Ezra.  She dresses so conservatively--but I guess being a Fama does that to you.
2-female_removed_major,alsoPlaying:meia=interested,Hey, you can always count on the crew of the Nirvana to bounce back from a crisis.  How about you?
2-female_removed_major,alsoPlaying:meia=stretching,Don't act so wounded.  I've <i>been</i> wounded, and I was back in my Dread within hours!  With some painkillers.
2-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=awkward,That's, uh, really...<i>wow</i>.  That is a <i>lot</i> of pubic hair, to be peeking out of your thong like that...are you OK?
2-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=angry,<i>Ew</i>.  Don't you have razors where you live?  I can see your icky pubic hair poking out from here!
2-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=annoyed,...Were you laid up in bed recently?  Because I can see your unshaven hair from behind your thong, and <i>eugh</i>.
2-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=angry,OK, <i>ew</i>.  Don't you <i>shave</i>, Rinkah?  Do Earth men really like all that hair?
2-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=frustrated,...Maybe you're unaware, but Mejare is obsessed with shaving, cleanliness, and smoothness.  <i>So that's really gross</i>.
2-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6a=laughing,...See what I meant?  That die's got it out for you!  Better off stripping like normal, Miss Aquatic.
2-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6a=teasing,That die's not doing you any favors anymore, darling.  Best to just strip like the rest of us...or go for another swim.
2-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6a=laughing,Yeah, I didn't say anything before, but you <i>have</i> been cheating.  Enjoy being all soggy!
2-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6a=laughing,Back from a swim, Vriska?  I'm <i>loving</i> this!  You're too much!
2-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5b=seductive,That's cute and simple!  Who's Eridan, your girlfriend?
2-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5b=laughing,Stealing clothes from your girlfriend now, Vriska?  Is "Eridan" OK with you rooting through her wardrobe?
2-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5b=seductive,See, that's plain and simple fashion for the masses!  Your girlfriend Eridan has some good taste in outfits.
2-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5b=laughing,Skirt and stockings?  Simple, but sexy!  Tell this "Eridan" I like her style.  She your girlfriend?
2-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=excited,Wait--you...<i>oh my God</i>.  <i>That's fantastic</i>!
2-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=awkward,<i>I'm sorry!  I'll come quietly</i>!  I--I--wait, did you just shoot your own clothes off?
2-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=excited,I--that's...that's <i>so cool</i>!  Do it again!
2-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=excited,...Omigosh, that's so cool!  How'd you <i>do that</i>?  Can I get your autograph?
2-female_removed_major,target:misato,targetStage:4=shocked,<i>Eek!  OK!  Never mind!  Sorry!  I shouldn't have made fun</i>!  ...How'd you <i>get</i> that?
2-female_removed_major,target:misato,targetStage:4=awkward,...<i>Oof</i>.  What gave you <i>that</i>?  ...If you don't mind me asking.
2-female_removed_major,target:misato,targetStage:4=confused,...Should I ask what gave you that?  Is that out of line?  Is it from the "Second Impact" thing?
2-female_removed_major,target:misato,targetStage:4=confused,...I got injured once.  No scars, though.  What happened to you, some military mission?
2-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:4=shocked,Wha--<i>ew</i>!  Was that in your panties?  That's gross!  Throw it out!
2-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:4=awkward,...You're not going to <i>eat</i> that, right?  After it was in your...nether-regions?
2-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:4=angry,...<i>Ew</i>.  Why are you sticking fruit anywhere but your mouth?  That's not funny!
2-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:4=annoyed,...OK, this whole comedy act of yours is starting to get gross.  What's next, a tampon in your mouth?
2-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:5=interested,<i>Well</i>!  Plain-Jane's not <i>quite</i> so plain after all.  Good show.
2-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:5=laughing,Ha!  Not bad for an Earth girl...at least you really <i>were</i> hiding something.
2-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:5=vain,Earth girls really <i>are</i> nuts...why would you hide those beauties away?  Honestly.
2-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:5=stretching,A plain face and huge breasts?  You're the logical conclusion of Mejare's obsession with chests.
2-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5c=laughing,Getting a little skimpier than you'd like, honey?  You can't control fate, so just hope for good rolls...and leg coverage.
2-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5c=teasing,Aww, it's not so bad!  Pants are overrated...just look at me.
2-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5c=vain,I bet the breeze feels good on your legs now.  You're starting to see the genius of my fashion choices!
2-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5c=laughing,Why wear pants when your shirt can cover all the essentials?  Now put on a dress and you'll be just like me.
2-female_removed_major,target:shego,targetStage:4=seductive,<i>Oh, my</i>!  Way to go above and beyond, honey--I thought the bodysuit was sexy enough already!
2-female_removed_major,target:shego,targetStage:4=laughing,Who exactly are you dressing up for, dear?  This is enough sexy outfits to please an army.
2-female_removed_major,target:shego,targetStage:4=teasing,With <i>that</i> underneath your suit, I'm impressed you can move at all...<i>you must be a real animal in bed</i>.
2-female_removed_major,target:shego,targetStage:4=seductive,There's no stopping <i>your</i> sex appeal, honey--just look at all that!  You put the effort in.
2-female_removed_major,target:shego,targetStage:4=stretching,I'd say you're showing a sexy side, but the suit did that already.
2-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,alsoPlaying:meia,priority:100=teasing,Ooh, you've got muscles too, Meia!  You're pretty cute for being so stoic.
2-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,alsoPlaying:meia,priority:100=vain,You've actually got some muscle to you, right, Meia?  Your pretty cute...or you <i>would</i> be, if you smiled more.
2-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,alsoPlaying:meia,priority:100=stretching,Look, Meia, this girl's fit.  I think your gym clothes are the one outfit I can't pull off.
2-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,alsoPlaying:meia,priority:100=excited,All those muscles!  I can appreciate women who stay fit--I just don't want to put the effort in.
2-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6=bored,<i>Yeesh</i>.  I'm <i>sober</i>, and this girl's making me feel woozy just looking at her.
2-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6=teasing,Hey, honey, a girl's no fun unless she can have fun sober.  Give it a try sometime between shots.
2-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6=confused,Seriously, though, do you have a second liver?  Where's all this booze draining into in that tiny body?
2-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6=smug,Thank your lucky stars you didn't get a table with Meia, dear.  She'd be grilling you <i>nonstop</i> for drinking like this.
2-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3=stretching,Your gym clothes are your <i>underwear</i>, too?  I swear, you're a slave to practicality.
2-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3=interested,That might be a cute set of underwear if I didn't already know you exercised in it.
2-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3=laughing,It's nothing but training and exercise with you, Meia.  Those are your <i>underwear</i>, too?
2-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3=laughing,Oh, <i>look!</i>  She wears her gym clothes as underwear.  How adorably modest.
2-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:3=vain,Well, would you look at that!  Exactly what I wanted to see.  <i>More, please</i>!
2-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:3=stretching,How about that?  You're finally taking my sage Mejarian advice concerning the female body.
2-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:3=seductive,See?  There you go!  The best kind of magic is the kind that makes women's clothes disappear!
2-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:3=laughing,Hah!  It's good to know you're listening to me.  Now do another trick and make yourself stark-naked!


#lost sleeves
3-male_removing_major=vain,Oh, I just can't <i>take</i> this!  So much male skin!
3-male_removing_major=teasing,Bring it on, ~name~.  My hear can take it.
3-male_removing_major=excited,<i>That's</i> a whole lot better.  Take off some more.
3-male_removing_major=seductive,Hey, ~name~...finish the job, and maybe <i>I</i> will.
3-male_removed_major=teasing,Forgive me if I get a little too excited.  I've never seen a man quite like this!
3-male_removed_major=seductive,I was taught as a little girl that men's hides were all rough and scaly, you know.  Doesn't look that way.
3-male_removed_major=teasing,If you think your manly appeal will so easily sway me from Barnette, you should know she's a pilot <i>and</i> a great cook.
3-male_removed_major=teasing,Duero's a smart cookie, but I guess he's the exception among men.
3-male_removed_major=stretching,I wonder if Paiway's hitting puberty.  Better keep her away from men's degenerate influences.
3-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:7=laughing,<i>Oh, my</i>!  And I thought men were courageous!  But this mountain of muscles hides his thing from my teeth.
3-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:7=laughing,What's the matter, Cap?  <i>Afraid this Mejarian will just bite it right off</i>?
3-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:7=teasing,Come now, honey--there's no reason to hide bheind your shield.  I don't eat <i>every</i> man's organs.
3-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:7=teasing,Don't be that way, dear.  If I wanted to eat you, I'd go for those delicious shoulder muscles.  So put the shield down.
3-female_removing_major=smug,Good thing you're losing your clothes, because I'm not impressed with what Earth women wear.
3-female_removing_major=laughing,So soon?  I'm not down to my dress yet, you know.  <i>Or am I</i>?
3-female_removing_major=stretching,Good thing you're from Earth, or maybe you'd be onto how this Mejarian layers.
3-female_removing_major=confused,I think I've got Earth women's wardrobes figured out now.  But your sex lives are still a mystery.
3-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meia=seductive,Maybe it's just the antigravity, but this girl's lit a fire in my heart, Leader!  Do you think I should wear a suit like yours?
3-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Hey, Leader, this girl's making bodysuits look good even for a woman with some meat on her.  Should I wear one?
3-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,I think you've managed to make bodysuits boring for me, Meia.  This girl is making me want to get one now!
3-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,Maybe I should abandon this silly dress and opt for a bodysuit like yours and Ochako's, Meia--just bare it all!  What do you say?
3-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,I know I'm not as slender and lithe as <i>you</i>, Leader, but neither is Ochako.  Should I get myself a bodysuit?
3-female_removing_major,target:buffy,targetStage:4=laughing,<i>And what have we here</i>?  Ooh, you're more depraved than I thought, Miss Vampire Hunter.
3-female_removing_major,target:buffy,targetStage:4=laughing,<i>Heeheehee</i>!  Undoing your bra beneath your shirt, you little tease?  A woman after my own heart...if I wore bras.
3-female_removing_major,target:buffy,targetStage:4=smug,That's a sexy little move there, honey.  I'd try it, too, but bras have never been to my tastes in the first place.
3-female_removing_major,target:buffy,targetStage:4=teasing,So are you trying to be fun and sexy, or just throwing us all off?  <i>I'd certainly prefer the former</i>.
3-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:4=seductive,<i>Heeheehee</i>!  What was that again?  <i>Too-ayy-jolee</i>?
3-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:4=teasing,<i>Too--too-ay-julee</i>?  Did I get it right?  Help me out here, cutie.
3-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:4=seductive,<i>Tooayyjolie</i>?  Was that it?  Oh, all your words just melt together into a chocolate fondue of language!
3-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:4=confused,<i>Too--tooayy</i>, uh, what was that?  I mean, it was adorable, but I didn't really catch it.
3-female_removing_major,target:misato,targetStage:3=confused,Oooh, the <i>dress</i>!  Now we're talking!  ...What's the matter, Misato?
3-female_removing_major,target:misato,targetStage:3=seductive,Aww, <i>someone's</i> embarrassed even through the booze!  What's got you all shy suddenly, huh?
3-female_removing_major,target:misato,targetStage:3=laughing,Even half in the bag like this, you're all nervous.  Hiding something under that dress?
3-female_removing_major,target:misato,targetStage:3=interested,Hey, Misato, what's wrong?  You look a little on edge suddenly, even between burps.
3-female_removing_major,target:faye,targetStage:4=laughing,<i>Pfft</i>!  So much for the cool-and-calculated act!  Even <i>I</i> wouldn't stoop that low...maybe.
3-female_removing_major,target:faye,targetStage:4=laughing,There's no need, dear.  You're showing your true colors already.
3-female_removing_major,target:faye,targetStage:4=annoyed,OK, even <i>I</i> wouldn't count my makeup.  It's just luck, honey, don't be so sore about it.
3-female_removing_major,target:faye,targetStage:4=interested,Look, honey, if you have to wear enough makeup that it counts as clothing, it wouldn't save your looks in the first place.
3-female_removing_major,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=confused,Uh, I don't know who "Kleese" is, but I'm actually more concerned about that giant syringe you have for an arm.
3-female_removing_major,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=shocked,...So anyway, <i>what the hell is wrong with your arm...syringe...thing</i>?
3-female_removing_major,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=angry,Why do I care?  I don't know who Kleese is, you have pink skin, you're taking your dress off already, and, uh, <i>you have a giant syringe for an arm</i>.
3-female_removing_major,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=confused,...Are you really not aware of how strange you look?  Like, I was nice and didn't immediately comment on your, uh, <i>syringe</i>.
3-female_removing_major,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=frustrated,Well, I care about other things, too, like <i>Oh My God you have a giant gross needle for an arm I hate needles what's going on</i>.
3-female_removing_major,target:moon,targetStage:0=laughing,<i>Whoa</i>.  OK, you meant it.  Can't say I understand the rush, but more power to you.
3-female_removing_major,target:moon,targetStage:0=interested,You're not kidding around, are you, darling?  This your first time stripping for an audience?  Don't overdo things.
3-female_removing_major,target:moon,targetStage:0=stretching,Try to keep the audience interested, honey.  Strippers don't walk out onstage naked for a reason.
3-female_removing_major,target:moon,targetStage:0=teasing,Straight for the bra?  What an amateur...it's shock value.  The tease is half the fun, silly!
3-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1=shocked,<i>Ack!  No!  The Paksis!  I should've known this was a dream</i>!
3-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1=shocked,<i>Eeek!  Marinette!  The Harvest has got you!  Nooo</i>!
3-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1=shocked,<i>Aaack!  Don't touch me!  W-what's happening?  Help</i>!
3-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1=shocked,<i>Aaack!  T-the Harvest!  They're here!  Run!  I'm sorry, Ladybug</i>!
3-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1=shocked,<i>Eeek!  No!  Please!  I have a girlfriend!  I can't die here</i>!
3-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4=seductive,Ooh, that's a nifty trick, dear!  You can bet <i>I'd</i> give it a shot if I could...<i>do you think I should wear a bodysuit</i>?
3-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4=seductive,I've always felt I'm too pillowy and soft for a bodysuit, but you really make it your own!  <i>Could I pull it off, too, sweetie</i>?
3-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4=teasing,Hey, Miss Gravity, I was really like the look of your figure all stuffed into that suit.  Do you think I'd look good in the same thing?
3-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4=vain,Mejare has a thing for bodysuits, you know...I wonder if I should get myself one.  There's just no tease to it, you know?
3-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:4=smug,You have a <i>secret</i>?  Well, here's your chance to keep me interested, Plain-Jane.
3-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:4=teasing,You haven't impressed so far, Plain-as-Day.  So color me interested with this "secret" of yours.
3-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:4=smug,I'm listening, dearie.  You're so average that I'm honestly willing to buy that you have a "secret."
3-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:4=laughing,Unless your secret is a third breast, I just can't see you wowing me, dear.
3-female_removing_major,target:velma,targetStage:1=interested,Seriously, honey, slow down.  Feeling self-conscious next to me?
3-female_removing_major,target:velma,targetStage:1=smug,Listen, dear--I know I have this effect on women, but there's no reason to be <i>this</i> jealous.
3-female_removing_major,target:velma,targetStage:1=laughing,Just rushing to outdo me, huh?  Sorry, but you're still a little frumpy by comparison.
3-female_removing_major,target:velma,targetStage:1=vain,Feeling inadequate, sweetie?  You should be proud of your body--don't fret about how I'm much more beautiful.
3-female_removing_major,target:velma,targetStage:1=vain,Come on, honey.  Throwing off all your clothes like this reeks of desperation next to a goddess such as myself.
3-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=seductive,<i>Teehee</i>!  I have no clue what you just said, but you've <i>got</i> to teach me, Marinette!  This'll drive my girlfriend <i>wild</i>.
3-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=vain,I can just <i>picture</i> the look on Barnette's face when I start whispering these sweet nothings.  Could you teach me?
3-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=excited,What was that?  Anyway, omigosh, Marinette, you <i>have</i> to give me some French lessons!  Barnette will melt in my arms!
3-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=seductive,Whatever you just said, my girlfriend Barnette would absolutely <i>melt</i>, it's so romantic!  <i>Won't you please teach me</i>?
3-female_removing_major,target:launch,targetStage:5=bored,...Well, at least you're blonde again.  Blonde's a good color...I can stare at that and tune you out.
3-female_removing_major,target:launch,targetStage:5=bored,At least there's no gun this time.  Now you'll have to make a racket by shouting.
3-female_removing_major,target:launch,targetStage:5=bored,Yeah, yeah, keep on screaming.  I'll just stare at that lovely blonde hair and try to forget what's under it...
3-female_removing_major,target:launch,targetStage:5=frustrated,Your blue version really taught me the value of peace and quiet.
3-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=laughing,Oho--and the Masked Woman is revealing herself!  I'm sure she has a good explanation for hiding.
3-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=seductive,What's this, now?  The Masked Woman feels like looking us all in the eye?  I'd love to know why you waited so long.
3-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=teasing,This had better be interesting, dear.  I want a face worth waiting for, because the rest of us are revealing more sensitive areas.
3-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=teasing,Afraid of my evil alien gaze, honey?  How xenophobic--now take off that mask so I can see why you wore it.
3-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=laughing,So soon, dearie?  I guess that "Secret Identity" of yours isn't worth hiding your pleasure from us.
3-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=smug,I guess you'd rather look your admirers in the eyes than conceal you identity any longer than a few rounds.
3-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=laughing,So much for your "Secret Identity," honey.  That's the second thing you're taking off!
3-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=stretching,Oho!  And the mask comes off.  Why you bothered with it at all if it's going this quickly, I'll never understand.
3-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=teasing,Well, look who's overcoming her shyness!  Guess that "Secret Identity" didn't last too long when you could've been nude instead.
3-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=vain,Avert your eyes, ladies--a whole lot of lovely Mejarian skin is about to hit them all at once.
3-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=teasing,Prepare yourselves, mortals--that bodysuit's all one piece.  <i>She's down to underwear already</i>!
3-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=teasing,Try not to lose control of yourselves.  Meia's about to drop that whole suit in one sexy little move!
3-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=seductive,Everyone got their pacemakers primed?  That suit's one piece, so you're about to get an eyeful of Meia's figure.
3-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=vain,Ever seen a woman with abs?  Ever seen a <i>Mejarian</i> with abs?  You're about to.
3-female_removing_major,target:aimee,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>No!  Please!  I'm too beautiful to die</i>!
3-female_removing_major,target:aimee,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>Ack!  Don't shoot!  I didn't steal anything!  Honest</i>!
3-female_removing_major,target:aimee,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>Not in the face!  Or the breasts!  Don't ruin my corpse</i>!
3-female_removing_major,target:aimee,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>I-I can't die here!  I have a girlfriend!  And hundreds of admirers</i>!
3-female_removing_major,target:jasmine,targetStage:1=interested,Wait, <i>what</i>?  I thought you were just dressed in typical overly-conservative Earth wear, but instead you're <i>royalty</i>?
3-female_removing_major,target:jasmine,targetStage:1=laughing,That was a disguise?  Hey, dearie, next time try hiding your <i>face</i>.  That might throw people off the princess's trail.
3-female_removing_major,target:jasmine,targetStage:1=laughing,You were disguised?  You're <i>royalty</i>?  If the commoners can't recognize their princess's face, I can see why you're still in power.
3-female_removing_major,target:jasmine,targetStage:1=laughing,Oh, what's this?  You're <i>nobility</i>?  Well, well, well, honey...<i>you'll make an excellent ransom</i>.
3-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:4=seductive,Is that your own special die, or does it just work for anyone?  ...Can <i>I</i> try?
3-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:4=vain,So if I rolled that thing, could it give me a whole new outfit?  I mean, I <i>do</i> love my dress, but hey.
3-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:4=confused,Now I'm starting to get curious about that die of yours.  Would it work if <i>I</i> rolled it?
3-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:4=teasing,Does that die work solely for you?  What if I just <i>snatched it</i> like the pirate I am?
3-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5=seductive,But don't worry about all that!  Let's see what outfit's next, cutie!
3-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5=vain,Another vortex, another wonderful piece of fashion to ogle.  <i>I'm so lucky</i>!
3-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5=vain,You call yourself the lucky one, but I came here <i>hoping</i> to see some cool fashion choices.
3-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5=vain,Simply magical.  My luck that I'd meet you, not these vortices.  <i>Things just work out for me</i>!
3-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:2=smug,My, my, another magic trick?  Can't you dazzle us with your own naked body, dear?
3-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:2=interested,This is getting old already, honey.  By all means, show your body instead--<i>that's</i> far more interesting.
3-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:2=smug,You Earth girls and your parlor tricks.  Is this the sort of thing that amuses men and their tiny primate brains?  I'd rather see you naked.
3-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:2=laughing,Can't you just magic-off your whole outfit, dearie?  I'd rather see how far down your makeup goes.
3-female_removed_major=teasing,You really need some Mejarian flair to your look.  We're the experts!
3-female_removed_major=vain,Such an easy win.  Reminds me of when I saved an entire planet with my Vandread--oh, wait, I do that <i>all</i> the time!
3-female_removed_major=vain,Gascogne's so good at cards.  Meia is always going on about that, as if she doesn't even run the regisystem.
3-female_removed_major=smug,Like Christmas in July.  You know, Tarak only has made-up military holidays where they celebrate being manly.
3-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=awkward,That's, uh, really...<i>wow</i>.  That is a <i>lot</i> of pubic hair, to be peeking out of your thong like that...are you OK?
3-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=angry,<i>Ew</i>.  Don't you have razors where you live?  I can see your icky pubic hair poking out from here!
3-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=annoyed,...Were you laid up in bed recently?  Because I can see your unshaven hair from behind your thong, and <i>eugh</i>.
3-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=angry,OK, <i>ew</i>.  Don't you <i>shave</i>, Rinkah?  Do Earth men really like all that hair?
3-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=frustrated,...Maybe you're unaware, but Mejare is obsessed with shaving, cleanliness, and smoothness.  <i>So that's really gross</i>.
3-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5c=laughing,Getting a little skimpier than you'd like, honey?  You can't control fate, so just hope for good rolls...and leg coverage.
3-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5c=teasing,Aww, it's not so bad!  Pants are overrated...just look at me.
3-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5c=vain,I bet the breeze feels good on your legs now.  You're starting to see the genius of my fashion choices!
3-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5c=laughing,Why wear pants when your shirt can cover all the essentials?  Now put on a dress and you'll be just like me.
3-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:4=shocked,Wha--<i>ew</i>!  Was that in your panties?  That's gross!  Throw it out!
3-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:4=awkward,...You're not going to <i>eat</i> that, right?  After it was in your...nether-regions?
3-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:4=angry,...<i>Ew</i>.  Why are you sticking fruit anywhere but your mouth?  That's not funny!
3-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:4=annoyed,...OK, this whole comedy act of yours is starting to get gross.  What's next, a tampon in your mouth?
3-female_removed_major,target:misato,targetStage:4=shocked,<i>Eek!  OK!  Never mind!  Sorry!  I shouldn't have made fun</i>!  ...How'd you <i>get</i> that?
3-female_removed_major,target:misato,targetStage:4=awkward,...<i>Oof</i>.  What gave you <i>that</i>?  ...If you don't mind me asking.
3-female_removed_major,target:misato,targetStage:4=confused,...Should I ask what gave you that?  Is that out of line?  Is it from the "Second Impact" thing?
3-female_removed_major,target:misato,targetStage:4=confused,...I got injured once.  No scars, though.  What happened to you, some military mission?
3-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5b=seductive,That's cute and simple!  Who's Eridan, your girlfriend?
3-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5b=laughing,Stealing clothes from your girlfriend now, Vriska?  Is "Eridan" OK with you rooting through her wardrobe?
3-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5b=seductive,See, that's plain and simple fashion for the masses!  Your girlfriend Eridan has some good taste in outfits.
3-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5b=laughing,Skirt and stockings?  Simple, but sexy!  Tell this "Eridan" I like her style.  She your girlfriend?
3-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:blake,totalMales:1-2=laughing,Hey, honey, why don't we all just cool it?  You're making it clear how this girl's your ladyfriend--leave the men alone.
3-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:blake,totalMales:1-2=seductive,My, my!  Getting a little defensive around men, are we?  I guess you Earth girls have to fight tooth and nail to keep each other.
3-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:blake,totalMales:1-2=teasing,So you two are together, is that it?  And those <i>nasty Earth men</i> want to drive you apart?  Thanks for repping Mejare for me.
3-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:blake,totalMales:1-2=vain,Oh, are you two a couple?  I've been going steady with Barnette for a while...though I don't feel any hatred of men because of it.
3-female_removed_major,target:moon,targetStage:1=laughing,<i>Jeez</i>.  Way to immediately dispel any notions I had of Earth girls being prudes.
3-female_removed_major,target:moon,targetStage:1=interested,And here I thought Earth girls felt shy about the whole <i>sex</i> thing.  Not you, sweetheart.
3-female_removed_major,target:moon,targetStage:1=smug,And I thought <i>I</i> was eager.  But no, it seems Mejarians are classier as well as more beautiful.
3-female_removed_major,target:moon,targetStage:1=interested,You're something else, Ocean Girl.  Is men's attention <i>that</i> important to you?
3-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,alsoPlaying:meia,priority:100=interested,Meia's got muscle like you.  Speaking of which, Meia, you need to stop trying to convince me <i>I</i> need it, too.
3-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,alsoPlaying:meia,priority:100=vain,I'd exercise, too, but it'd ruin my makeup.
3-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,alsoPlaying:meia,priority:100=vain,Parfet could really use the kind of exercise you get, ~name~.  She's such a bookworm.
3-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,alsoPlaying:meia,priority:100=stretching,There's nothing like a nice healthy run or swim.  That's why I let Barnette do it, while I relax at the spa.
3-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3=laughing,Wow.  You really <i>are</i> a blueberry girl, top to bottom.  I can see why you kept the hood on.
3-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3=interested,Just as blue on top, I see.  Maybe you should just put the hood back on until you feel better.
3-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3=laughing,Honey, you can worry about you looks until you're blue in the face, but, uh...<i>well</i>.
3-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3=teasing,Feeling under the weather, Raven?  You're looking a little blue--I guess that's why you had the hood on.
3-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5a=laughing,What is <i>that</i> supposed to be?  Look, I don't go for your creepy dungeon play.
3-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5a=laughing,I wasn't aware other planets were into bondage...but Mejare had to get its ideas from somewhere.
3-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5a=laughing,Planning on <i>dominating</i> us later, Vriska?  Don't tie me up for piracy, now!  <i>Heeheehee</i>!
3-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5a=vain,Oh, dear.  That's quite the authoritative outfit for a pirate like me to be comfortable around.
3-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,priority:0=thinking,Meia's actually got some muscle to her.  She keeps trying to convince me <i>I</i> need it, too.
3-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,priority:0=vain,I'd exercise, too, but it'd ruin my makeup.
3-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,priority:0=vain,Parfet could really use the kind of exercise you get, ~name~.  She's such a bookworm.
3-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,priority:0=stretching,There's nothing like a nice healthy run or swim.  That's why I let Barnette do it, while I relax at the spa.
3-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3=seductive,Isn't Meia a sweetheart?  Look how she just drops the whole thing!  I'm not so generous.
3-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3=laughing,See?  Meia's not a trickster like little old me.  Right to the good stuff!
3-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3=laughing,See, Meia's not the type to jerk you around like I am.  She just likes to bark orders instead.
3-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3=smug,See, if <i>I</i> were wearing that, I'd zip it down it three different stages.
3-female_removed_major,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,You really need some Mejarian flair to your look.  We're the experts!
3-female_removed_major,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,Such an easy win.  Reminds me of when I saved an entire planet with my Vandread--oh, wait, I do that <i>all</i> the time!
3-female_removed_major,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,Gascogne's so good at cards.  Perhaps I should take lessons from her, like Meia here tries to.
3-female_removed_major,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,Like Christmas in July.  You know, Tarak only has made-up military holidays where they celebrate being manly.
3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2=awkward,<i>Noooo</i>...what?  You're in street clothes now?  ...What was <i>that</i> all about?
3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2=angry,...OK.  Yeah.  Would you mind explaining why you just went nuclear, "Ladybug"?
3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2=shocked,<i>Help!  I--I</i>...OK.  It stopped.  Are you planning on explaining that, "Ladybug"?
3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,marker:planet-countries=confused,...OK, that's much more...<i>normal</i>.  Is this how people change clothes on Planet France?
3-female_removed_major,target:ayano,targetStage:6=shocked,Ooh, a swimsuit!  I like the beach, too--wait, are those <i>bloodstains</i>?  Uh--like, they're <i>yours</i>, right?
3-female_removed_major,target:ayano,targetStage:6=laughing,Ouch, honey.  Picked the worst day of the month to go swimming, didn't you?
3-female_removed_major,target:ayano,targetStage:6=awkward,...Those are <i>your</i> bloodstains, right?  Like, from menstrual issues, or something?
3-female_removed_major,target:ayano,targetStage:6=thinking,Seems Earth women haven't quite nailed down how to track their own menstrual cycles.  Why do we have those, anyway?
3-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6b=teasing,Looking more Mejarian all the time, Vriska!  Skin is always in style where I'm from.
3-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6b=seductive,That's the fashion I know and love!  Less is more on Mejare, as they say...
3-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6b=stretching,Now you're dressing like all the other women I know on Mejare.  <i>Bo-ring</i>.
3-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6b=interested,Nice Mejarian look you're rocking there now.  My girlfriend tends to wear even less than that.
3-female_removed_major,target:shego,targetStage:4=seductive,<i>Oh, my</i>!  Way to go above and beyond, honey--I thought the bodysuit was sexy enough already!
3-female_removed_major,target:shego,targetStage:4=laughing,Who exactly are you dressing up for, dear?  This is enough sexy outfits to please an army.
3-female_removed_major,target:shego,targetStage:4=teasing,With <i>that</i> underneath your suit, I'm impressed you can move at all...<i>you must be a real animal in bed</i>.
3-female_removed_major,target:shego,targetStage:4=seductive,There's no stopping <i>your</i> sex appeal, honey--just look at all that!  You put the effort in.
3-female_removed_major,target:shego,targetStage:4=stretching,I'd say you're showing a sexy side, but the suit did that already.
3-female_removed_major,target:faye,targetStage:5=interested,Oh.  Might as well have gone through with it, dearie--you've already embarrassed yourself by trying.
3-female_removed_major,target:faye,targetStage:5=teasing,No use saving face now, honey--unless you think the makeup does that.
3-female_removed_major,target:faye,targetStage:5=smug,Hey, don't let <i>my</i> complaints stop you.  You've already lost the respect of the table, darling.
3-female_removed_major,target:faye,targetStage:5=teasing,What a sore loser.  Can't quite keep up the tease when you've got to answer for it, huh?  <i>Try me</i>.
3-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6a=laughing,...See what I meant?  That die's got it out for you!  Better off stripping like normal, Miss Aquatic.
3-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6a=teasing,That die's not doing you any favors anymore, darling.  Best to just strip like the rest of us...or go for another swim.
3-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6a=laughing,Yeah, I didn't say anything before, but you <i>have</i> been cheating.  Enjoy being all soggy!
3-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6a=laughing,Back from a swim, Vriska?  I'm <i>loving</i> this!  You're too much!
3-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6=bored,<i>Yeesh</i>.  I'm <i>sober</i>, and this girl's making me feel woozy just looking at her.
3-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6=teasing,Hey, honey, a girl's no fun unless she can have fun sober.  Give it a try sometime between shots.
3-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6=confused,Seriously, though, do you have a second liver?  Where's all this booze draining into in that tiny body?
3-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6=smug,Thank your lucky stars you didn't get a table with Meia, dear.  She'd be grilling you <i>nonstop</i> for drinking like this.
3-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:5=interested,<i>Well</i>!  Plain-Jane's not <i>quite</i> so plain after all.  Good show.
3-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:5=laughing,Ha!  Not bad for an Earth girl...at least you really <i>were</i> hiding something.
3-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:5=vain,Earth girls really <i>are</i> nuts...why would you hide those beauties away?  Honestly.
3-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:5=stretching,A plain face and huge breasts?  You're the logical conclusion of Mejare's obsession with chests.
3-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2=teasing,Ooh, you're <i>blonde</i>!  <i>Just what I was hoping for, cutie</i>.
3-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2=vain,Omigosh--you're <i>blonde</i>, and you were hiding it?  What's the matter with you--blonde women are the most beautiful of all!
3-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2=seductive,Hey, hey, hey!  The Masked Woman is <i>blonde</i>?  I <i>love</i> blondes...they remind me of myself.
3-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2=vain,Ooh, a fellow blonde!  Life has truly blessed us with this color--I can't believe you'd go and try to hide it.
3-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=excited,Wait--you...<i>oh my God</i>.  <i>That's fantastic</i>!
3-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=awkward,<i>I'm sorry!  I'll come quietly</i>!  I--I--wait, did you just shoot your own clothes off?
3-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=excited,I--that's...that's <i>so cool</i>!  Do it again!
3-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=excited,...Omigosh, that's so cool!  How'd you <i>do that</i>?  Can I get your autograph?
3-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:3=vain,Well, would you look at that!  Exactly what I wanted to see.  <i>More, please</i>!
3-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:3=stretching,How about that?  You're finally taking my sage Mejarian advice concerning the female body.
3-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:3=seductive,See?  There you go!  The best kind of magic is the kind that makes women's clothes disappear!
3-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:3=laughing,Hah!  It's good to know you're listening to me.  Now do another trick and make yourself stark-naked!


#lost choker
4-male_removing_major=teasing,Hey, now we're getting somewhere.  And I'd like to get there with <i>you</i>, ~name~.
4-male_removing_major=teasing,That's more like it.  Show me <i>every inch</i> of a man's body.
4-male_removing_major=seductive,Men are so <i>gross</i>.  But I better see more to be sure.
4-male_removing_major=vain,Oh, my.  I think the Harvest is coming for me, the way my heart is beating.
4-male_removed_major=interested,I thought men were brave.  Just going to stop there?
4-male_removed_major=smug,I should've brought Duero.  He's handsome <i>and</i> he'd be naked by now.
4-male_removed_major=teasing,You're leaving me hanging, ~name~.  Think my breasts'll hang next?
4-male_removed_major=interested,Shame, but it looks like Hibiki and Bart's intelligence is about the benchmark for men.  You know, lovable idiots.
4-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:7=laughing,<i>Oh, my</i>!  And I thought men were courageous!  But this mountain of muscles hides his thing from my teeth.
4-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:7=laughing,What's the matter, Cap?  <i>Afraid this Mejarian will just bite it right off</i>?
4-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:7=teasing,Come now, honey--there's no reason to hide bheind your shield.  I don't eat <i>every</i> man's organs.
4-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:7=teasing,Don't be that way, dear.  If I wanted to eat you, I'd go for those delicious shoulder muscles.  So put the shield down.
4-female_removing_major=seductive,Oh, my, ~name~.  I think our relationship is moving too fast.
4-female_removing_major=thinking,B.C. might be good at this game, being our commander and all.  But I don't think she'd want to reveal her body...not her groin, anyway.
4-female_removing_major=laughing,Just <i>what</i> could an Earth woman be hiding?  Tangled messes of hair?  Shiny green skin?  Tentacles?
4-female_removing_major=vain,Big reveal.  I might be close to one myself.
4-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5=seductive,But don't worry about all that!  Let's see what outfit's next, cutie!
4-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5=vain,Another vortex, another wonderful piece of fashion to ogle.  <i>I'm so lucky</i>!
4-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5=vain,You call yourself the lucky one, but I came here <i>hoping</i> to see some cool fashion choices.
4-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5=vain,Simply magical.  My luck that I'd meet you, not these vortices.  <i>Things just work out for me</i>!
4-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4=seductive,Ooh, that's a nifty trick, dear!  You can bet <i>I'd</i> give it a shot if I could...<i>do you think I should wear a bodysuit</i>?
4-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4=seductive,I've always felt I'm too pillowy and soft for a bodysuit, but you really make it your own!  <i>Could I pull it off, too, sweetie</i>?
4-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4=teasing,Hey, Miss Gravity, I was really like the look of your figure all stuffed into that suit.  Do you think I'd look good in the same thing?
4-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4=vain,Mejare has a thing for bodysuits, you know...I wonder if I should get myself one.  There's just no tease to it, you know?
4-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:4=seductive,Is that your own special die, or does it just work for anyone?  ...Can <i>I</i> try?
4-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:4=vain,So if I rolled that thing, could it give me a whole new outfit?  I mean, I <i>do</i> love my dress, but hey.
4-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:4=confused,Now I'm starting to get curious about that die of yours.  Would it work if <i>I</i> rolled it?
4-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:4=teasing,Does that die work solely for you?  What if I just <i>snatched it</i> like the pirate I am?
4-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:2=smug,My, my, another magic trick?  Can't you dazzle us with your own naked body, dear?
4-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:2=interested,This is getting old already, honey.  By all means, show your body instead--<i>that's</i> far more interesting.
4-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:2=smug,You Earth girls and your parlor tricks.  Is this the sort of thing that amuses men and their tiny primate brains?  I'd rather see you naked.
4-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:2=laughing,Can't you just magic-off your whole outfit, dearie?  I'd rather see how far down your makeup goes.
4-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=laughing,Oho--and the Masked Woman is revealing herself!  I'm sure she has a good explanation for hiding.
4-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=seductive,What's this, now?  The Masked Woman feels like looking us all in the eye?  I'd love to know why you waited so long.
4-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=teasing,This had better be interesting, dear.  I want a face worth waiting for, because the rest of us are revealing more sensitive areas.
4-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=teasing,Afraid of my evil alien gaze, honey?  How xenophobic--now take off that mask so I can see why you wore it.
4-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=laughing,So soon, dearie?  I guess that "Secret Identity" of yours isn't worth hiding your pleasure from us.
4-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=smug,I guess you'd rather look your admirers in the eyes than conceal you identity any longer than a few rounds.
4-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=laughing,So much for your "Secret Identity," honey.  That's the second thing you're taking off!
4-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=stretching,Oho!  And the mask comes off.  Why you bothered with it at all if it's going this quickly, I'll never understand.
4-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=teasing,Well, look who's overcoming her shyness!  Guess that "Secret Identity" didn't last too long when you could've been nude instead.
4-female_removing_major,target:aimee,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>No!  Please!  I'm too beautiful to die</i>!
4-female_removing_major,target:aimee,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>Ack!  Don't shoot!  I didn't steal anything!  Honest</i>!
4-female_removing_major,target:aimee,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>Not in the face!  Or the breasts!  Don't ruin my corpse</i>!
4-female_removing_major,target:aimee,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>I-I can't die here!  I have a girlfriend!  And hundreds of admirers</i>!
4-female_removing_major,target:launch,targetStage:5=bored,...Well, at least you're blonde again.  Blonde's a good color...I can stare at that and tune you out.
4-female_removing_major,target:launch,targetStage:5=bored,At least there's no gun this time.  Now you'll have to make a racket by shouting.
4-female_removing_major,target:launch,targetStage:5=bored,Yeah, yeah, keep on screaming.  I'll just stare at that lovely blonde hair and try to forget what's under it...
4-female_removing_major,target:launch,targetStage:5=frustrated,Your blue version really taught me the value of peace and quiet.
4-female_removing_major,target:velma,targetStage:1=interested,Seriously, honey, slow down.  Feeling self-conscious next to me?
4-female_removing_major,target:velma,targetStage:1=smug,Listen, dear--I know I have this effect on women, but there's no reason to be <i>this</i> jealous.
4-female_removing_major,target:velma,targetStage:1=laughing,Just rushing to outdo me, huh?  Sorry, but you're still a little frumpy by comparison.
4-female_removing_major,target:velma,targetStage:1=vain,Feeling inadequate, sweetie?  You should be proud of your body--don't fret about how I'm much more beautiful.
4-female_removing_major,target:velma,targetStage:1=vain,Come on, honey.  Throwing off all your clothes like this reeks of desperation next to a goddess such as myself.
4-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:4=smug,You have a <i>secret</i>?  Well, here's your chance to keep me interested, Plain-Jane.
4-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:4=teasing,You haven't impressed so far, Plain-as-Day.  So color me interested with this "secret" of yours.
4-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:4=smug,I'm listening, dearie.  You're so average that I'm honestly willing to buy that you have a "secret."
4-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:4=laughing,Unless your secret is a third breast, I just can't see you wowing me, dear.
4-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meia=seductive,Maybe it's just the antigravity, but this girl's lit a fire in my heart, Leader!  Do you think I should wear a suit like yours?
4-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Hey, Leader, this girl's making bodysuits look good even for a woman with some meat on her.  Should I wear one?
4-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,I think you've managed to make bodysuits boring for me, Meia.  This girl is making me want to get one now!
4-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,Maybe I should abandon this silly dress and opt for a bodysuit like yours and Ochako's, Meia--just bare it all!  What do you say?
4-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,I know I'm not as slender and lithe as <i>you</i>, Leader, but neither is Ochako.  Should I get myself a bodysuit?
4-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=vain,As you can see, folks, I was a real sweetheart bringing Meia here.  That suit's all one piece!
4-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=teasing,Meia here is good at cards, but she doesn't have the wardrobe to last around here.  Down to underwear already!
4-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=laughing,Aren't I great bringing Meia here?  Look how little she wears.  Not that that bodysuit left anything to the imagination.
4-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=teasing,Meia barely wears anything, as you can see.  <i>I think she secretly likes the hungry looks the other pilots give her</i>.
4-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=seductive,<i>Teehee</i>!  I have no clue what you just said, but you've <i>got</i> to teach me, Marinette!  This'll drive my girlfriend <i>wild</i>.
4-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=vain,I can just <i>picture</i> the look on Barnette's face when I start whispering these sweet nothings.  Could you teach me?
4-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=excited,What was that?  Anyway, omigosh, Marinette, you <i>have</i> to give me some French lessons!  Barnette will melt in my arms!
4-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=seductive,Whatever you just said, my girlfriend Barnette would absolutely <i>melt</i>, it's so romantic!  <i>Won't you please teach me</i>?
4-female_removing_major,target:misato,targetStage:3=confused,Oooh, the <i>dress</i>!  Now we're talking!  ...What's the matter, Misato?
4-female_removing_major,target:misato,targetStage:3=seductive,Aww, <i>someone's</i> embarrassed even through the booze!  What's got you all shy suddenly, huh?
4-female_removing_major,target:misato,targetStage:3=laughing,Even half in the bag like this, you're all nervous.  Hiding something under that dress?
4-female_removing_major,target:misato,targetStage:3=interested,Hey, Misato, what's wrong?  You look a little on edge suddenly, even between burps.
4-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1=shocked,<i>Ack!  No!  The Paksis!  I should've known this was a dream</i>!
4-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1=shocked,<i>Eeek!  Marinette!  The Harvest has got you!  Nooo</i>!
4-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1=shocked,<i>Aaack!  Don't touch me!  W-what's happening?  Help</i>!
4-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1=shocked,<i>Aaack!  T-the Harvest!  They're here!  Run!  I'm sorry, Ladybug</i>!
4-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1=shocked,<i>Eeek!  No!  Please!  I have a girlfriend!  I can't die here</i>!
4-female_removing_major,target:faye,targetStage:4=laughing,<i>Pfft</i>!  So much for the cool-and-calculated act!  Even <i>I</i> wouldn't stoop that low...maybe.
4-female_removing_major,target:faye,targetStage:4=laughing,There's no need, dear.  You're showing your true colors already.
4-female_removing_major,target:faye,targetStage:4=annoyed,OK, even <i>I</i> wouldn't count my makeup.  It's just luck, honey, don't be so sore about it.
4-female_removing_major,target:faye,targetStage:4=interested,Look, honey, if you have to wear enough makeup that it counts as clothing, it wouldn't save your looks in the first place.
4-female_removing_major,target:buffy,targetStage:4=laughing,<i>And what have we here</i>?  Ooh, you're more depraved than I thought, Miss Vampire Hunter.
4-female_removing_major,target:buffy,targetStage:4=laughing,<i>Heeheehee</i>!  Undoing your bra beneath your shirt, you little tease?  A woman after my own heart...if I wore bras.
4-female_removing_major,target:buffy,targetStage:4=smug,That's a sexy little move there, honey.  I'd try it, too, but bras have never been to my tastes in the first place.
4-female_removing_major,target:buffy,targetStage:4=teasing,So are you trying to be fun and sexy, or just throwing us all off?  <i>I'd certainly prefer the former</i>.
4-female_removing_major,target:moon,targetStage:0=laughing,<i>Whoa</i>.  OK, you meant it.  Can't say I understand the rush, but more power to you.
4-female_removing_major,target:moon,targetStage:0=interested,You're not kidding around, are you, darling?  This your first time stripping for an audience?  Don't overdo things.
4-female_removing_major,target:moon,targetStage:0=stretching,Try to keep the audience interested, honey.  Strippers don't walk out onstage naked for a reason.
4-female_removing_major,target:moon,targetStage:0=teasing,Straight for the bra?  What an amateur...it's shock value.  The tease is half the fun, silly!
4-female_removing_major,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=confused,Uh, I don't know who "Kleese" is, but I'm actually more concerned about that giant syringe you have for an arm.
4-female_removing_major,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=shocked,...So anyway, <i>what the hell is wrong with your arm...syringe...thing</i>?
4-female_removing_major,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=angry,Why do I care?  I don't know who Kleese is, you have pink skin, you're taking your dress off already, and, uh, <i>you have a giant syringe for an arm</i>.
4-female_removing_major,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=confused,...Are you really not aware of how strange you look?  Like, I was nice and didn't immediately comment on your, uh, <i>syringe</i>.
4-female_removing_major,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=frustrated,Well, I care about other things, too, like <i>Oh My God you have a giant gross needle for an arm I hate needles what's going on</i>.
4-female_removing_major,target:jasmine,targetStage:1=interested,Wait, <i>what</i>?  I thought you were just dressed in typical overly-conservative Earth wear, but instead you're <i>royalty</i>?
4-female_removing_major,target:jasmine,targetStage:1=laughing,That was a disguise?  Hey, dearie, next time try hiding your <i>face</i>.  That might throw people off the princess's trail.
4-female_removing_major,target:jasmine,targetStage:1=laughing,You were disguised?  You're <i>royalty</i>?  If the commoners can't recognize their princess's face, I can see why you're still in power.
4-female_removing_major,target:jasmine,targetStage:1=laughing,Oh, what's this?  You're <i>nobility</i>?  Well, well, well, honey...<i>you'll make an excellent ransom</i>.
4-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:4=seductive,<i>Heeheehee</i>!  What was that again?  <i>Too-ayy-jolee</i>?
4-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:4=teasing,<i>Too--too-ay-julee</i>?  Did I get it right?  Help me out here, cutie.
4-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:4=seductive,<i>Tooayyjolie</i>?  Was that it?  Oh, all your words just melt together into a chocolate fondue of language!
4-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:4=confused,<i>Too--tooayy</i>, uh, what was that?  I mean, it was adorable, but I didn't really catch it.
4-female_removed_major=vain,You're pretty cute, ~name~.  What a shame I belong to Barnette...
4-female_removed_major=teasing,Hey, ~name~...I like men <i>and</i> women.
4-female_removed_major=teasing,Hey, you think <i>this</i> is hard?  Try getting Meia to crack a smile.
4-female_removed_major=vain,Don't think you'll win me over just like that.  My Barnette's a pilot <i>and</i> a great cook!
4-female_removed_major,target:misato,targetStage:4=shocked,<i>Eek!  OK!  Never mind!  Sorry!  I shouldn't have made fun</i>!  ...How'd you <i>get</i> that?
4-female_removed_major,target:misato,targetStage:4=awkward,...<i>Oof</i>.  What gave you <i>that</i>?  ...If you don't mind me asking.
4-female_removed_major,target:misato,targetStage:4=confused,...Should I ask what gave you that?  Is that out of line?  Is it from the "Second Impact" thing?
4-female_removed_major,target:misato,targetStage:4=confused,...I got injured once.  No scars, though.  What happened to you, some military mission?
4-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=excited,Wait--you...<i>oh my God</i>.  <i>That's fantastic</i>!
4-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=awkward,<i>I'm sorry!  I'll come quietly</i>!  I--I--wait, did you just shoot your own clothes off?
4-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=excited,I--that's...that's <i>so cool</i>!  Do it again!
4-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=excited,...Omigosh, that's so cool!  How'd you <i>do that</i>?  Can I get your autograph?
4-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5a=laughing,What is <i>that</i> supposed to be?  Look, I don't go for your creepy dungeon play.
4-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5a=laughing,I wasn't aware other planets were into bondage...but Mejare had to get its ideas from somewhere.
4-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5a=laughing,Planning on <i>dominating</i> us later, Vriska?  Don't tie me up for piracy, now!  <i>Heeheehee</i>!
4-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5a=vain,Oh, dear.  That's quite the authoritative outfit for a pirate like me to be comfortable around.
4-female_removed_major,target:moon,targetStage:1=laughing,<i>Jeez</i>.  Way to immediately dispel any notions I had of Earth girls being prudes.
4-female_removed_major,target:moon,targetStage:1=interested,And here I thought Earth girls felt shy about the whole <i>sex</i> thing.  Not you, sweetheart.
4-female_removed_major,target:moon,targetStage:1=smug,And I thought <i>I</i> was eager.  But no, it seems Mejarians are classier as well as more beautiful.
4-female_removed_major,target:moon,targetStage:1=interested,You're something else, Ocean Girl.  Is men's attention <i>that</i> important to you?
4-female_removed_major,target:ayano,targetStage:6=shocked,Ooh, a swimsuit!  I like the beach, too--wait, are those <i>bloodstains</i>?  Uh--like, they're <i>yours</i>, right?
4-female_removed_major,target:ayano,targetStage:6=laughing,Ouch, honey.  Picked the worst day of the month to go swimming, didn't you?
4-female_removed_major,target:ayano,targetStage:6=awkward,...Those are <i>your</i> bloodstains, right?  Like, from menstrual issues, or something?
4-female_removed_major,target:ayano,targetStage:6=thinking,Seems Earth women haven't quite nailed down how to track their own menstrual cycles.  Why do we have those, anyway?
4-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:3=vain,Well, would you look at that!  Exactly what I wanted to see.  <i>More, please</i>!
4-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:3=stretching,How about that?  You're finally taking my sage Mejarian advice concerning the female body.
4-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:3=seductive,See?  There you go!  The best kind of magic is the kind that makes women's clothes disappear!
4-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:3=laughing,Hah!  It's good to know you're listening to me.  Now do another trick and make yourself stark-naked!
4-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6a=laughing,...See what I meant?  That die's got it out for you!  Better off stripping like normal, Miss Aquatic.
4-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6a=teasing,That die's not doing you any favors anymore, darling.  Best to just strip like the rest of us...or go for another swim.
4-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6a=laughing,Yeah, I didn't say anything before, but you <i>have</i> been cheating.  Enjoy being all soggy!
4-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6a=laughing,Back from a swim, Vriska?  I'm <i>loving</i> this!  You're too much!
4-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:5=interested,<i>Well</i>!  Plain-Jane's not <i>quite</i> so plain after all.  Good show.
4-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:5=laughing,Ha!  Not bad for an Earth girl...at least you really <i>were</i> hiding something.
4-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:5=vain,Earth girls really <i>are</i> nuts...why would you hide those beauties away?  Honestly.
4-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:5=stretching,A plain face and huge breasts?  You're the logical conclusion of Mejare's obsession with chests.
4-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=awkward,That's, uh, really...<i>wow</i>.  That is a <i>lot</i> of pubic hair, to be peeking out of your thong like that...are you OK?
4-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=angry,<i>Ew</i>.  Don't you have razors where you live?  I can see your icky pubic hair poking out from here!
4-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=annoyed,...Were you laid up in bed recently?  Because I can see your unshaven hair from behind your thong, and <i>eugh</i>.
4-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=angry,OK, <i>ew</i>.  Don't you <i>shave</i>, Rinkah?  Do Earth men really like all that hair?
4-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=frustrated,...Maybe you're unaware, but Mejare is obsessed with shaving, cleanliness, and smoothness.  <i>So that's really gross</i>.
4-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5c=laughing,Getting a little skimpier than you'd like, honey?  You can't control fate, so just hope for good rolls...and leg coverage.
4-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5c=teasing,Aww, it's not so bad!  Pants are overrated...just look at me.
4-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5c=vain,I bet the breeze feels good on your legs now.  You're starting to see the genius of my fashion choices!
4-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5c=laughing,Why wear pants when your shirt can cover all the essentials?  Now put on a dress and you'll be just like me.
4-female_removed_major,target:faye,targetStage:5=interested,Oh.  Might as well have gone through with it, dearie--you've already embarrassed yourself by trying.
4-female_removed_major,target:faye,targetStage:5=teasing,No use saving face now, honey--unless you think the makeup does that.
4-female_removed_major,target:faye,targetStage:5=smug,Hey, don't let <i>my</i> complaints stop you.  You've already lost the respect of the table, darling.
4-female_removed_major,target:faye,targetStage:5=teasing,What a sore loser.  Can't quite keep up the tease when you've got to answer for it, huh?  <i>Try me</i>.
4-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:4=shocked,Wha--<i>ew</i>!  Was that in your panties?  That's gross!  Throw it out!
4-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:4=awkward,...You're not going to <i>eat</i> that, right?  After it was in your...nether-regions?
4-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:4=angry,...<i>Ew</i>.  Why are you sticking fruit anywhere but your mouth?  That's not funny!
4-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:4=annoyed,...OK, this whole comedy act of yours is starting to get gross.  What's next, a tampon in your mouth?
4-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5b=seductive,That's cute and simple!  Who's Eridan, your girlfriend?
4-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5b=laughing,Stealing clothes from your girlfriend now, Vriska?  Is "Eridan" OK with you rooting through her wardrobe?
4-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5b=seductive,See, that's plain and simple fashion for the masses!  Your girlfriend Eridan has some good taste in outfits.
4-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5b=laughing,Skirt and stockings?  Simple, but sexy!  Tell this "Eridan" I like her style.  She your girlfriend?
4-female_removed_major,target:shego,targetStage:4=seductive,<i>Oh, my</i>!  Way to go above and beyond, honey--I thought the bodysuit was sexy enough already!
4-female_removed_major,target:shego,targetStage:4=laughing,Who exactly are you dressing up for, dear?  This is enough sexy outfits to please an army.
4-female_removed_major,target:shego,targetStage:4=teasing,With <i>that</i> underneath your suit, I'm impressed you can move at all...<i>you must be a real animal in bed</i>.
4-female_removed_major,target:shego,targetStage:4=seductive,There's no stopping <i>your</i> sex appeal, honey--just look at all that!  You put the effort in.
4-female_removed_major,target:shego,targetStage:4=stretching,I'd say you're showing a sexy side, but the suit did that already.
4-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6=bored,<i>Yeesh</i>.  I'm <i>sober</i>, and this girl's making me feel woozy just looking at her.
4-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6=teasing,Hey, honey, a girl's no fun unless she can have fun sober.  Give it a try sometime between shots.
4-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6=confused,Seriously, though, do you have a second liver?  Where's all this booze draining into in that tiny body?
4-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6=smug,Thank your lucky stars you didn't get a table with Meia, dear.  She'd be grilling you <i>nonstop</i> for drinking like this.
4-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3=laughing,Wow.  You really <i>are</i> a blueberry girl, top to bottom.  I can see why you kept the hood on.
4-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3=interested,Just as blue on top, I see.  Maybe you should just put the hood back on until you feel better.
4-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3=laughing,Honey, you can worry about you looks until you're blue in the face, but, uh...<i>well</i>.
4-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3=teasing,Feeling under the weather, Raven?  You're looking a little blue--I guess that's why you had the hood on.
4-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:blake,totalMales:1-2=laughing,Hey, honey, why don't we all just cool it?  You're making it clear how this girl's your ladyfriend--leave the men alone.
4-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:blake,totalMales:1-2=seductive,My, my!  Getting a little defensive around men, are we?  I guess you Earth girls have to fight tooth and nail to keep each other.
4-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:blake,totalMales:1-2=teasing,So you two are together, is that it?  And those <i>nasty Earth men</i> want to drive you apart?  Thanks for repping Mejare for me.
4-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:blake,totalMales:1-2=vain,Oh, are you two a couple?  I've been going steady with Barnette for a while...though I don't feel any hatred of men because of it.
4-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2=teasing,Ooh, you're <i>blonde</i>!  <i>Just what I was hoping for, cutie</i>.
4-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2=vain,Omigosh--you're <i>blonde</i>, and you were hiding it?  What's the matter with you--blonde women are the most beautiful of all!
4-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2=seductive,Hey, hey, hey!  The Masked Woman is <i>blonde</i>?  I <i>love</i> blondes...they remind me of myself.
4-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2=vain,Ooh, a fellow blonde!  Life has truly blessed us with this color--I can't believe you'd go and try to hide it.
4-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,alsoPlaying:meia,priority:100=vain,Women don't wear muscle as well as men, but you're still pretty cute.
4-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,alsoPlaying:meia,priority:100=interested,You need beauty sleep, Meia.  This girl works out all the time, and she's still healthy.
4-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,alsoPlaying:meia,priority:100=frustrated,You work out?  I hate getting all sweaty.  It ruins my makeup.
4-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,alsoPlaying:meia,priority:100=teasing,You work out?  Hey, Meia's right here.  She's <i>always</i> in the gym.
4-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6b=teasing,Looking more Mejarian all the time, Vriska!  Skin is always in style where I'm from.
4-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6b=seductive,That's the fashion I know and love!  Less is more on Mejare, as they say...
4-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6b=stretching,Now you're dressing like all the other women I know on Mejare.  <i>Bo-ring</i>.
4-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6b=interested,Nice Mejarian look you're rocking there now.  My girlfriend tends to wear even less than that.
4-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2=awkward,<i>Noooo</i>...what?  You're in street clothes now?  ...What was <i>that</i> all about?
4-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2=angry,...OK.  Yeah.  Would you mind explaining why you just went nuclear, "Ladybug"?
4-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2=shocked,<i>Help!  I--I</i>...OK.  It stopped.  Are you planning on explaining that, "Ladybug"?
4-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,marker:planet-countries=confused,...OK, that's much more...<i>normal</i>.  Is this how people change clothes on Planet France?
4-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,priority:0=vain,Meia's actually got some muscle to her.  Women don't wear it as well as men, but she's still pretty cute.
4-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,priority:0=thinking,I swear, Meia's never anywhere but the gym or the hangar.  That girl needs her beauty sleep.
4-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,priority:0=frustrated,You work out?  I hate getting all sweaty.  It ruins my makeup.
4-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,priority:0=interested,You work out?  You should've played with Meia.  She's <i>always</i> in the gym.
4-female_removed_major,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,You're pretty cute, ~name~.  What a shame I belong to Barnette...
4-female_removed_major,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Hey, ~name~...I like men <i>and</i> women.
4-female_removed_major,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Hey, you think <i>this</i> is hard?  Try getting Meia to crack a smile...and during this game doesn't count.
4-female_removed_major,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,Don't think you'll win me over just like that.  My Barnette's a pilot <i>and</i> and great cook!
4-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3=teasing,<i>Just look at those curves</i>!  She works night and day in the gym to maintain them, you know.
4-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3=seductive,Don't feel bad, Meia.  Your body looks great from all that exercise!  Plus, that suit wasn't hiding anything in the first place.
4-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3=vain,What a class act.  So toned and beautifully pale, yet so modest and steadfast.
4-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3=teasing,My Leader's so adorably fit.  She thinks she needs all that exercise, too!  Talk about self-doubt.

5-male_removing_major=teasing,What's that?  Is the man not so sure about his lead anymore?
5-male_removing_major=teasing,Oho.  Is the man starting to sweat a little?
5-male_removing_major=laughing,Thought I'd just roll over and die?  Well, I might roll over and <i>masturbate</i>.
5-male_removing_major=seductive-2,Oh, dear.  I'm so embarrassed already, and now a man is taking off the good stuff.
5-male_removed_major=teasing,Not too far behind me after all, huh?
5-male_removed_major=vain,Jura Basil Elden doesn't go down <i>that</i> easy.
5-male_removed_major=laughing,Getting worried, ~name~?  Men should <i>always</i> worry around Mejarians.
5-male_removed_major=seductive,I like what I see, ~name~.  But I could always see more, if you'd be so kind.
5-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:7=laughing,<i>Oh, my</i>!  And I thought men were courageous!  But this mountain of muscles hides his thing from my teeth.
5-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:7=laughing,What's the matter, Cap?  <i>Afraid this Mejarian will just bite it right off</i>?
5-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:7=teasing,Come now, honey--there's no reason to hide bheind your shield.  I don't eat <i>every</i> man's organs.
5-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:7=teasing,Don't be that way, dear.  If I wanted to eat you, I'd go for those delicious shoulder muscles.  So put the shield down.
5-female_removing_major=seductive,I'm no stranger to nude women.  Feel free to go all the way.
5-female_removing_major=thinking,Would Dita be doing any better?  That girl can barely keep her head on straight when she pilots, but I guess this is easier.
5-female_removing_major=interested,You want to see wardrobe variety?  Take a look at Celtic sometime.  She had a different costume on every day for a while!
5-female_removing_major=vain,Feeling shy, ~name~?  Take a Mejarian's advice--flaunt what you've got, and sweep the girls off their feet.
5-female_removing_major,target:jasmine,targetStage:1=interested,Wait, <i>what</i>?  I thought you were just dressed in typical overly-conservative Earth wear, but instead you're <i>royalty</i>?
5-female_removing_major,target:jasmine,targetStage:1=laughing,That was a disguise?  Hey, dearie, next time try hiding your <i>face</i>.  That might throw people off the princess's trail.
5-female_removing_major,target:jasmine,targetStage:1=laughing,You were disguised?  You're <i>royalty</i>?  If the commoners can't recognize their princess's face, I can see why you're still in power.
5-female_removing_major,target:jasmine,targetStage:1=laughing,Oh, what's this?  You're <i>nobility</i>?  Well, well, well, honey...<i>you'll make an excellent ransom</i>.
5-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:4=seductive,Is that your own special die, or does it just work for anyone?  ...Can <i>I</i> try?
5-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:4=vain,So if I rolled that thing, could it give me a whole new outfit?  I mean, I <i>do</i> love my dress, but hey.
5-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:4=confused,Now I'm starting to get curious about that die of yours.  Would it work if <i>I</i> rolled it?
5-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:4=teasing,Does that die work solely for you?  What if I just <i>snatched it</i> like the pirate I am?
5-female_removing_major,target:faye,targetStage:4=laughing,<i>Pfft</i>!  So much for the cool-and-calculated act!  Even <i>I</i> wouldn't stoop that low...maybe.
5-female_removing_major,target:faye,targetStage:4=laughing,There's no need, dear.  You're showing your true colors already.
5-female_removing_major,target:faye,targetStage:4=annoyed,OK, even <i>I</i> wouldn't count my makeup.  It's just luck, honey, don't be so sore about it.
5-female_removing_major,target:faye,targetStage:4=interested,Look, honey, if you have to wear enough makeup that it counts as clothing, it wouldn't save your looks in the first place.
5-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:4=smug,You have a <i>secret</i>?  Well, here's your chance to keep me interested, Plain-Jane.
5-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:4=teasing,You haven't impressed so far, Plain-as-Day.  So color me interested with this "secret" of yours.
5-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:4=smug,I'm listening, dearie.  You're so average that I'm honestly willing to buy that you have a "secret."
5-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:4=laughing,Unless your secret is a third breast, I just can't see you wowing me, dear.
5-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4=seductive,Ooh, that's a nifty trick, dear!  You can bet <i>I'd</i> give it a shot if I could...<i>do you think I should wear a bodysuit</i>?
5-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4=seductive,I've always felt I'm too pillowy and soft for a bodysuit, but you really make it your own!  <i>Could I pull it off, too, sweetie</i>?
5-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4=teasing,Hey, Miss Gravity, I was really like the look of your figure all stuffed into that suit.  Do you think I'd look good in the same thing?
5-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4=vain,Mejare has a thing for bodysuits, you know...I wonder if I should get myself one.  There's just no tease to it, you know?
5-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=seductive,<i>Teehee</i>!  I have no clue what you just said, but you've <i>got</i> to teach me, Marinette!  This'll drive my girlfriend <i>wild</i>.
5-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=vain,I can just <i>picture</i> the look on Barnette's face when I start whispering these sweet nothings.  Could you teach me?
5-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=excited,What was that?  Anyway, omigosh, Marinette, you <i>have</i> to give me some French lessons!  Barnette will melt in my arms!
5-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=seductive,Whatever you just said, my girlfriend Barnette would absolutely <i>melt</i>, it's so romantic!  <i>Won't you please teach me</i>?
5-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:4=seductive,<i>Heeheehee</i>!  What was that again?  <i>Too-ayy-jolee</i>?
5-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:4=teasing,<i>Too--too-ay-julee</i>?  Did I get it right?  Help me out here, cutie.
5-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:4=seductive,<i>Tooayyjolie</i>?  Was that it?  Oh, all your words just melt together into a chocolate fondue of language!
5-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:4=confused,<i>Too--tooayy</i>, uh, what was that?  I mean, it was adorable, but I didn't really catch it.
5-female_removing_major,target:moon,targetStage:0=laughing,<i>Whoa</i>.  OK, you meant it.  Can't say I understand the rush, but more power to you.
5-female_removing_major,target:moon,targetStage:0=interested,You're not kidding around, are you, darling?  This your first time stripping for an audience?  Don't overdo things.
5-female_removing_major,target:moon,targetStage:0=stretching,Try to keep the audience interested, honey.  Strippers don't walk out onstage naked for a reason.
5-female_removing_major,target:moon,targetStage:0=teasing,Straight for the bra?  What an amateur...it's shock value.  The tease is half the fun, silly!
5-female_removing_major,target:launch,targetStage:5=bored,...Well, at least you're blonde again.  Blonde's a good color...I can stare at that and tune you out.
5-female_removing_major,target:launch,targetStage:5=bored,At least there's no gun this time.  Now you'll have to make a racket by shouting.
5-female_removing_major,target:launch,targetStage:5=bored,Yeah, yeah, keep on screaming.  I'll just stare at that lovely blonde hair and try to forget what's under it...
5-female_removing_major,target:launch,targetStage:5=frustrated,Your blue version really taught me the value of peace and quiet.
5-female_removing_major,target:velma,targetStage:1=interested,Seriously, honey, slow down.  Feeling self-conscious next to me?
5-female_removing_major,target:velma,targetStage:1=smug,Listen, dear--I know I have this effect on women, but there's no reason to be <i>this</i> jealous.
5-female_removing_major,target:velma,targetStage:1=laughing,Just rushing to outdo me, huh?  Sorry, but you're still a little frumpy by comparison.
5-female_removing_major,target:velma,targetStage:1=vain,Feeling inadequate, sweetie?  You should be proud of your body--don't fret about how I'm much more beautiful.
5-female_removing_major,target:velma,targetStage:1=vain,Come on, honey.  Throwing off all your clothes like this reeks of desperation next to a goddess such as myself.
5-female_removing_major,target:aimee,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>No!  Please!  I'm too beautiful to die</i>!
5-female_removing_major,target:aimee,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>Ack!  Don't shoot!  I didn't steal anything!  Honest</i>!
5-female_removing_major,target:aimee,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>Not in the face!  Or the breasts!  Don't ruin my corpse</i>!
5-female_removing_major,target:aimee,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>I-I can't die here!  I have a girlfriend!  And hundreds of admirers</i>!
5-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1=shocked,<i>Ack!  No!  The Paksis!  I should've known this was a dream</i>!
5-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1=shocked,<i>Eeek!  Marinette!  The Harvest has got you!  Nooo</i>!
5-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1=shocked,<i>Aaack!  Don't touch me!  W-what's happening?  Help</i>!
5-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1=shocked,<i>Aaack!  T-the Harvest!  They're here!  Run!  I'm sorry, Ladybug</i>!
5-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1=shocked,<i>Eeek!  No!  Please!  I have a girlfriend!  I can't die here</i>!
5-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5=seductive,But don't worry about all that!  Let's see what outfit's next, cutie!
5-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5=vain,Another vortex, another wonderful piece of fashion to ogle.  <i>I'm so lucky</i>!
5-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5=vain,You call yourself the lucky one, but I came here <i>hoping</i> to see some cool fashion choices.
5-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5=vain,Simply magical.  My luck that I'd meet you, not these vortices.  <i>Things just work out for me</i>!
5-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=teasing,No one get excited.  Meia wears underwear beneath that sexy little suit of hers.
5-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=interested,This is just a tease.  Big zipdown, sure, but she's got underwear.  It's the most Meia will jerk you around, though.
5-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=laughing,Keep your heart rates in check, ladies.  Meia's too prude to not have underwear beneath that suit, sexier as that might make her.
5-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=seductive-2,Don't let yourselves get all aflutter.  She wears underwear, and it's probably boring.
5-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meia=seductive,Maybe it's just the antigravity, but this girl's lit a fire in my heart, Leader!  Do you think I should wear a suit like yours?
5-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Hey, Leader, this girl's making bodysuits look good even for a woman with some meat on her.  Should I wear one?
5-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,I think you've managed to make bodysuits boring for me, Meia.  This girl is making me want to get one now!
5-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,Maybe I should abandon this silly dress and opt for a bodysuit like yours and Ochako's, Meia--just bare it all!  What do you say?
5-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,I know I'm not as slender and lithe as <i>you</i>, Leader, but neither is Ochako.  Should I get myself a bodysuit?
5-female_removing_major,target:misato,targetStage:3=confused,Oooh, the <i>dress</i>!  Now we're talking!  ...What's the matter, Misato?
5-female_removing_major,target:misato,targetStage:3=seductive,Aww, <i>someone's</i> embarrassed even through the booze!  What's got you all shy suddenly, huh?
5-female_removing_major,target:misato,targetStage:3=laughing,Even half in the bag like this, you're all nervous.  Hiding something under that dress?
5-female_removing_major,target:misato,targetStage:3=interested,Hey, Misato, what's wrong?  You look a little on edge suddenly, even between burps.
5-female_removing_major,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=confused,Uh, I don't know who "Kleese" is, but I'm actually more concerned about that giant syringe you have for an arm.
5-female_removing_major,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=shocked,...So anyway, <i>what the hell is wrong with your arm...syringe...thing</i>?
5-female_removing_major,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=angry,Why do I care?  I don't know who Kleese is, you have pink skin, you're taking your dress off already, and, uh, <i>you have a giant syringe for an arm</i>.
5-female_removing_major,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=confused,...Are you really not aware of how strange you look?  Like, I was nice and didn't immediately comment on your, uh, <i>syringe</i>.
5-female_removing_major,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=frustrated,Well, I care about other things, too, like <i>Oh My God you have a giant gross needle for an arm I hate needles what's going on</i>.
5-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:2=smug,My, my, another magic trick?  Can't you dazzle us with your own naked body, dear?
5-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:2=interested,This is getting old already, honey.  By all means, show your body instead--<i>that's</i> far more interesting.
5-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:2=smug,You Earth girls and your parlor tricks.  Is this the sort of thing that amuses men and their tiny primate brains?  I'd rather see you naked.
5-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:2=laughing,Can't you just magic-off your whole outfit, dearie?  I'd rather see how far down your makeup goes.
5-female_removing_major,target:buffy,targetStage:4=laughing,<i>And what have we here</i>?  Ooh, you're more depraved than I thought, Miss Vampire Hunter.
5-female_removing_major,target:buffy,targetStage:4=laughing,<i>Heeheehee</i>!  Undoing your bra beneath your shirt, you little tease?  A woman after my own heart...if I wore bras.
5-female_removing_major,target:buffy,targetStage:4=smug,That's a sexy little move there, honey.  I'd try it, too, but bras have never been to my tastes in the first place.
5-female_removing_major,target:buffy,targetStage:4=teasing,So are you trying to be fun and sexy, or just throwing us all off?  <i>I'd certainly prefer the former</i>.
5-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=laughing,Oho--and the Masked Woman is revealing herself!  I'm sure she has a good explanation for hiding.
5-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=seductive,What's this, now?  The Masked Woman feels like looking us all in the eye?  I'd love to know why you waited so long.
5-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=teasing,This had better be interesting, dear.  I want a face worth waiting for, because the rest of us are revealing more sensitive areas.
5-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=teasing,Afraid of my evil alien gaze, honey?  How xenophobic--now take off that mask so I can see why you wore it.
5-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=laughing,So soon, dearie?  I guess that "Secret Identity" of yours isn't worth hiding your pleasure from us.
5-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=smug,I guess you'd rather look your admirers in the eyes than conceal you identity any longer than a few rounds.
5-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=laughing,So much for your "Secret Identity," honey.  That's the second thing you're taking off!
5-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=stretching,Oho!  And the mask comes off.  Why you bothered with it at all if it's going this quickly, I'll never understand.
5-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=teasing,Well, look who's overcoming her shyness!  Guess that "Secret Identity" didn't last too long when you could've been nude instead.
5-female_removed_major=teasing,Hey, ~name~...Mejare is nothing but women.  <i>I'm pretty good with my fingers.</i>
5-female_removed_major=teasing,Hey, ~name~...take off some more and maybe I'll show you how a Mejarian pleases a woman.
5-female_removed_major=seductive-2,Something on your mind, ~name~?  Maybe...<i>two things</i>?
5-female_removed_major=teasing,I know, ~name~.  Seeing my breasts has gotten your competitive instincts going.
5-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:3=vain,Well, would you look at that!  Exactly what I wanted to see.  <i>More, please</i>!
5-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:3=stretching,How about that?  You're finally taking my sage Mejarian advice concerning the female body.
5-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:3=seductive,See?  There you go!  The best kind of magic is the kind that makes women's clothes disappear!
5-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:3=laughing,Hah!  It's good to know you're listening to me.  Now do another trick and make yourself stark-naked!
5-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5b=seductive,That's cute and simple!  Who's Eridan, your girlfriend?
5-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5b=laughing,Stealing clothes from your girlfriend now, Vriska?  Is "Eridan" OK with you rooting through her wardrobe?
5-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5b=seductive,See, that's plain and simple fashion for the masses!  Your girlfriend Eridan has some good taste in outfits.
5-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5b=laughing,Skirt and stockings?  Simple, but sexy!  Tell this "Eridan" I like her style.  She your girlfriend?
5-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6a=laughing,...See what I meant?  That die's got it out for you!  Better off stripping like normal, Miss Aquatic.
5-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6a=teasing,That die's not doing you any favors anymore, darling.  Best to just strip like the rest of us...or go for another swim.
5-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6a=laughing,Yeah, I didn't say anything before, but you <i>have</i> been cheating.  Enjoy being all soggy!
5-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6a=laughing,Back from a swim, Vriska?  I'm <i>loving</i> this!  You're too much!
5-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:4=shocked,Wha--<i>ew</i>!  Was that in your panties?  That's gross!  Throw it out!
5-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:4=awkward,...You're not going to <i>eat</i> that, right?  After it was in your...nether-regions?
5-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:4=angry,...<i>Ew</i>.  Why are you sticking fruit anywhere but your mouth?  That's not funny!
5-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:4=annoyed,...OK, this whole comedy act of yours is starting to get gross.  What's next, a tampon in your mouth?
5-female_removed_major,target:shego,targetStage:4=seductive,<i>Oh, my</i>!  Way to go above and beyond, honey--I thought the bodysuit was sexy enough already!
5-female_removed_major,target:shego,targetStage:4=laughing,Who exactly are you dressing up for, dear?  This is enough sexy outfits to please an army.
5-female_removed_major,target:shego,targetStage:4=teasing,With <i>that</i> underneath your suit, I'm impressed you can move at all...<i>you must be a real animal in bed</i>.
5-female_removed_major,target:shego,targetStage:4=seductive,There's no stopping <i>your</i> sex appeal, honey--just look at all that!  You put the effort in.
5-female_removed_major,target:shego,targetStage:4=stretching,I'd say you're showing a sexy side, but the suit did that already.
5-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=awkward,That's, uh, really...<i>wow</i>.  That is a <i>lot</i> of pubic hair, to be peeking out of your thong like that...are you OK?
5-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=angry,<i>Ew</i>.  Don't you have razors where you live?  I can see your icky pubic hair poking out from here!
5-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=annoyed,...Were you laid up in bed recently?  Because I can see your unshaven hair from behind your thong, and <i>eugh</i>.
5-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=angry,OK, <i>ew</i>.  Don't you <i>shave</i>, Rinkah?  Do Earth men really like all that hair?
5-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=frustrated,...Maybe you're unaware, but Mejare is obsessed with shaving, cleanliness, and smoothness.  <i>So that's really gross</i>.
5-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3=laughing,Wow.  You really <i>are</i> a blueberry girl, top to bottom.  I can see why you kept the hood on.
5-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3=interested,Just as blue on top, I see.  Maybe you should just put the hood back on until you feel better.
5-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3=laughing,Honey, you can worry about you looks until you're blue in the face, but, uh...<i>well</i>.
5-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3=teasing,Feeling under the weather, Raven?  You're looking a little blue--I guess that's why you had the hood on.
5-female_removed_major,target:misato,targetStage:4=shocked,<i>Eek!  OK!  Never mind!  Sorry!  I shouldn't have made fun</i>!  ...How'd you <i>get</i> that?
5-female_removed_major,target:misato,targetStage:4=awkward,...<i>Oof</i>.  What gave you <i>that</i>?  ...If you don't mind me asking.
5-female_removed_major,target:misato,targetStage:4=confused,...Should I ask what gave you that?  Is that out of line?  Is it from the "Second Impact" thing?
5-female_removed_major,target:misato,targetStage:4=confused,...I got injured once.  No scars, though.  What happened to you, some military mission?
5-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6b=teasing,Looking more Mejarian all the time, Vriska!  Skin is always in style where I'm from.
5-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6b=seductive,That's the fashion I know and love!  Less is more on Mejare, as they say...
5-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6b=stretching,Now you're dressing like all the other women I know on Mejare.  <i>Bo-ring</i>.
5-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6b=interested,Nice Mejarian look you're rocking there now.  My girlfriend tends to wear even less than that.
5-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5a=laughing,What is <i>that</i> supposed to be?  Look, I don't go for your creepy dungeon play.
5-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5a=laughing,I wasn't aware other planets were into bondage...but Mejare had to get its ideas from somewhere.
5-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5a=laughing,Planning on <i>dominating</i> us later, Vriska?  Don't tie me up for piracy, now!  <i>Heeheehee</i>!
5-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5a=vain,Oh, dear.  That's quite the authoritative outfit for a pirate like me to be comfortable around.
5-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2=awkward,<i>Noooo</i>...what?  You're in street clothes now?  ...What was <i>that</i> all about?
5-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2=angry,...OK.  Yeah.  Would you mind explaining why you just went nuclear, "Ladybug"?
5-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2=shocked,<i>Help!  I--I</i>...OK.  It stopped.  Are you planning on explaining that, "Ladybug"?
5-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,marker:planet-countries=confused,...OK, that's much more...<i>normal</i>.  Is this how people change clothes on Planet France?
5-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2=teasing,Ooh, you're <i>blonde</i>!  <i>Just what I was hoping for, cutie</i>.
5-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2=vain,Omigosh--you're <i>blonde</i>, and you were hiding it?  What's the matter with you--blonde women are the most beautiful of all!
5-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2=seductive,Hey, hey, hey!  The Masked Woman is <i>blonde</i>?  I <i>love</i> blondes...they remind me of myself.
5-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2=vain,Ooh, a fellow blonde!  Life has truly blessed us with this color--I can't believe you'd go and try to hide it.
5-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:blake,totalMales:1-2=laughing,Hey, honey, why don't we all just cool it?  You're making it clear how this girl's your ladyfriend--leave the men alone.
5-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:blake,totalMales:1-2=seductive,My, my!  Getting a little defensive around men, are we?  I guess you Earth girls have to fight tooth and nail to keep each other.
5-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:blake,totalMales:1-2=teasing,So you two are together, is that it?  And those <i>nasty Earth men</i> want to drive you apart?  Thanks for repping Mejare for me.
5-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:blake,totalMales:1-2=vain,Oh, are you two a couple?  I've been going steady with Barnette for a while...though I don't feel any hatred of men because of it.
5-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6=bored,<i>Yeesh</i>.  I'm <i>sober</i>, and this girl's making me feel woozy just looking at her.
5-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6=teasing,Hey, honey, a girl's no fun unless she can have fun sober.  Give it a try sometime between shots.
5-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6=confused,Seriously, though, do you have a second liver?  Where's all this booze draining into in that tiny body?
5-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6=smug,Thank your lucky stars you didn't get a table with Meia, dear.  She'd be grilling you <i>nonstop</i> for drinking like this.
5-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,priority:0=smug,Meia's actually got some muscle to her.  She tries to be modest about it, though.  Tries.
5-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,priority:0=laughing,Meia's got some muscles like you.  She can be pretty svelte in that bodysuit...you know, when she accidentally makes a sexy turn.
5-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,priority:0=vain,Ezra should get to exercising like you.  Gotta burn off all that baby fat!
5-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,priority:0=vain,You look like you exercise, ~name~.  Me?  I sweat away all my fat in the hot springs.
5-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3=teasing,All at once, straight and to the point.  Try as you might to avoid it, Meia, you're just so <i>lovable</i>!
5-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3=teasing,Watching the suit just fall off your hips like that is pretty titillating.  You just can't help how cute you are, sourpuss.
5-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3=vain,Dropping the whole outfit?  Just like me.  I guess it's just in a Mejarian's nature to show all our beautiful pale skin at once!
5-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3=vain,Look at us.  Two gorgeous Mejarian women in their underwear!  This should be planetary news.
5-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=excited,Wait--you...<i>oh my God</i>.  <i>That's fantastic</i>!
5-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=awkward,<i>I'm sorry!  I'll come quietly</i>!  I--I--wait, did you just shoot your own clothes off?
5-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=excited,I--that's...that's <i>so cool</i>!  Do it again!
5-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=excited,...Omigosh, that's so cool!  How'd you <i>do that</i>?  Can I get your autograph?
5-female_removed_major,target:faye,targetStage:5=interested,Oh.  Might as well have gone through with it, dearie--you've already embarrassed yourself by trying.
5-female_removed_major,target:faye,targetStage:5=teasing,No use saving face now, honey--unless you think the makeup does that.
5-female_removed_major,target:faye,targetStage:5=smug,Hey, don't let <i>my</i> complaints stop you.  You've already lost the respect of the table, darling.
5-female_removed_major,target:faye,targetStage:5=teasing,What a sore loser.  Can't quite keep up the tease when you've got to answer for it, huh?  <i>Try me</i>.
5-female_removed_major,target:moon,targetStage:1=laughing,<i>Jeez</i>.  Way to immediately dispel any notions I had of Earth girls being prudes.
5-female_removed_major,target:moon,targetStage:1=interested,And here I thought Earth girls felt shy about the whole <i>sex</i> thing.  Not you, sweetheart.
5-female_removed_major,target:moon,targetStage:1=smug,And I thought <i>I</i> was eager.  But no, it seems Mejarians are classier as well as more beautiful.
5-female_removed_major,target:moon,targetStage:1=interested,You're something else, Ocean Girl.  Is men's attention <i>that</i> important to you?
5-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:5=interested,<i>Well</i>!  Plain-Jane's not <i>quite</i> so plain after all.  Good show.
5-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:5=laughing,Ha!  Not bad for an Earth girl...at least you really <i>were</i> hiding something.
5-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:5=vain,Earth girls really <i>are</i> nuts...why would you hide those beauties away?  Honestly.
5-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:5=stretching,A plain face and huge breasts?  You're the logical conclusion of Mejare's obsession with chests.
5-female_removed_major,target:ayano,targetStage:6=shocked,Ooh, a swimsuit!  I like the beach, too--wait, are those <i>bloodstains</i>?  Uh--like, they're <i>yours</i>, right?
5-female_removed_major,target:ayano,targetStage:6=laughing,Ouch, honey.  Picked the worst day of the month to go swimming, didn't you?
5-female_removed_major,target:ayano,targetStage:6=awkward,...Those are <i>your</i> bloodstains, right?  Like, from menstrual issues, or something?
5-female_removed_major,target:ayano,targetStage:6=thinking,Seems Earth women haven't quite nailed down how to track their own menstrual cycles.  Why do we have those, anyway?
5-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,alsoPlaying:meia,priority:100=smug,Meia here's got some muscles, too, but she tries to be modest about it.  Tries.
5-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,alsoPlaying:meia,priority:100=laughing,Look, Meia, this girl's got muscles like you do.  You can be pretty svelte in that bodysuit...you know, when you accidentally make a sexy turn.
5-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,alsoPlaying:meia,priority:100=vain,Ezra should get to exercising like you.  Gotta burn off all that baby fat!
5-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,alsoPlaying:meia,priority:100=vain,You look like you exercise, ~name~.  Me?  I sweat away all my fat in the hot springs.
5-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5c=laughing,Getting a little skimpier than you'd like, honey?  You can't control fate, so just hope for good rolls...and leg coverage.
5-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5c=teasing,Aww, it's not so bad!  Pants are overrated...just look at me.
5-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5c=vain,I bet the breeze feels good on your legs now.  You're starting to see the genius of my fashion choices!
5-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5c=laughing,Why wear pants when your shirt can cover all the essentials?  Now put on a dress and you'll be just like me.

-3-male_removing_major=teasing,That's more like it, ~name~.  Show me what a man likes to hide.
-3-male_removing_major=interested,Hey, ~name~, you don't strike as tougher to handle than Tarakkian soldiers.  Though I'm usually clothed when I deal with <i>them</i>.
-3-male_removing_major=seductive,That's the spirit, ~name~.  I'm glad you're starting to work with me here.
-3-male_removing_major=teasing,Trust me, ~name~.  You're gonna want to be naked when I start going at it...and I want to see how you react.
-3-male_removed_major=vain,Jura Basil Elden doesn't go down <i>that</i> easy...unless your name is Barnette Orangello.
-3-male_removed_major=teasing,Beautiful as I am, sir, don't forget I'm also a cunning pilot.
-3-male_removed_major=seductive-2,Catching up to me?  I'm so flattered, sir.
-3-male_removed_major=seductive-2,<i>I just don't know how to react.  Men are so frightening</i>!
-3-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:7=laughing,<i>Oh, my</i>!  And I thought men were courageous!  But this mountain of muscles hides his thing from my teeth.
-3-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:7=laughing,What's the matter, Cap?  <i>Afraid this Mejarian will just bite it right off</i>?
-3-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:7=teasing,Come now, honey--there's no reason to hide bheind your shield.  I don't eat <i>every</i> man's organs.
-3-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:7=teasing,Don't be that way, dear.  If I wanted to eat you, I'd go for those delicious shoulder muscles.  So put the shield down.
-3-female_removing_major=seductive,You've seen what a Mejarian looks like.  Can I get a peek at an Earth woman?
-3-female_removing_major=stretching,Thought you could toss me aside?  Well, I'm kinda checked out, so you still might.
-3-female_removing_major=interested,Maybe Earth girls aren't such prudes after all.  Glad to see it!
-3-female_removing_major=vain,B.C.'s outfit isn't all that complicated...guess her assets were hiding in plain sight.
-3-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5=seductive,But don't worry about all that!  Let's see what outfit's next, cutie!
-3-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5=vain,Another vortex, another wonderful piece of fashion to ogle.  <i>I'm so lucky</i>!
-3-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5=vain,You call yourself the lucky one, but I came here <i>hoping</i> to see some cool fashion choices.
-3-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5=vain,Simply magical.  My luck that I'd meet you, not these vortices.  <i>Things just work out for me</i>!
-3-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:4=seductive,Is that your own special die, or does it just work for anyone?  ...Can <i>I</i> try?
-3-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:4=vain,So if I rolled that thing, could it give me a whole new outfit?  I mean, I <i>do</i> love my dress, but hey.
-3-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:4=confused,Now I'm starting to get curious about that die of yours.  Would it work if <i>I</i> rolled it?
-3-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:4=teasing,Does that die work solely for you?  What if I just <i>snatched it</i> like the pirate I am?
-3-female_removing_major,target:velma,targetStage:1=interested,Seriously, honey, slow down.  Feeling self-conscious next to me?
-3-female_removing_major,target:velma,targetStage:1=smug,Listen, dear--I know I have this effect on women, but there's no reason to be <i>this</i> jealous.
-3-female_removing_major,target:velma,targetStage:1=laughing,Just rushing to outdo me, huh?  Sorry, but you're still a little frumpy by comparison.
-3-female_removing_major,target:velma,targetStage:1=vain,Feeling inadequate, sweetie?  You should be proud of your body--don't fret about how I'm much more beautiful.
-3-female_removing_major,target:velma,targetStage:1=vain,Come on, honey.  Throwing off all your clothes like this reeks of desperation next to a goddess such as myself.
-3-female_removing_major,target:aimee,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>No!  Please!  I'm too beautiful to die</i>!
-3-female_removing_major,target:aimee,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>Ack!  Don't shoot!  I didn't steal anything!  Honest</i>!
-3-female_removing_major,target:aimee,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>Not in the face!  Or the breasts!  Don't ruin my corpse</i>!
-3-female_removing_major,target:aimee,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>I-I can't die here!  I have a girlfriend!  And hundreds of admirers</i>!
-3-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=seductive,<i>Teehee</i>!  I have no clue what you just said, but you've <i>got</i> to teach me, Marinette!  This'll drive my girlfriend <i>wild</i>.
-3-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=vain,I can just <i>picture</i> the look on Barnette's face when I start whispering these sweet nothings.  Could you teach me?
-3-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=excited,What was that?  Anyway, omigosh, Marinette, you <i>have</i> to give me some French lessons!  Barnette will melt in my arms!
-3-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=seductive,Whatever you just said, my girlfriend Barnette would absolutely <i>melt</i>, it's so romantic!  <i>Won't you please teach me</i>?
-3-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4=seductive,Ooh, that's a nifty trick, dear!  You can bet <i>I'd</i> give it a shot if I could...<i>do you think I should wear a bodysuit</i>?
-3-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4=seductive,I've always felt I'm too pillowy and soft for a bodysuit, but you really make it your own!  <i>Could I pull it off, too, sweetie</i>?
-3-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4=teasing,Hey, Miss Gravity, I was really like the look of your figure all stuffed into that suit.  Do you think I'd look good in the same thing?
-3-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4=vain,Mejare has a thing for bodysuits, you know...I wonder if I should get myself one.  There's just no tease to it, you know?
-3-female_removing_major,target:launch,targetStage:5=bored,...Well, at least you're blonde again.  Blonde's a good color...I can stare at that and tune you out.
-3-female_removing_major,target:launch,targetStage:5=bored,At least there's no gun this time.  Now you'll have to make a racket by shouting.
-3-female_removing_major,target:launch,targetStage:5=bored,Yeah, yeah, keep on screaming.  I'll just stare at that lovely blonde hair and try to forget what's under it...
-3-female_removing_major,target:launch,targetStage:5=frustrated,Your blue version really taught me the value of peace and quiet.
-3-female_removing_major,target:faye,targetStage:4=laughing,<i>Pfft</i>!  So much for the cool-and-calculated act!  Even <i>I</i> wouldn't stoop that low...maybe.
-3-female_removing_major,target:faye,targetStage:4=laughing,There's no need, dear.  You're showing your true colors already.
-3-female_removing_major,target:faye,targetStage:4=annoyed,OK, even <i>I</i> wouldn't count my makeup.  It's just luck, honey, don't be so sore about it.
-3-female_removing_major,target:faye,targetStage:4=interested,Look, honey, if you have to wear enough makeup that it counts as clothing, it wouldn't save your looks in the first place.
-3-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:4=smug,You have a <i>secret</i>?  Well, here's your chance to keep me interested, Plain-Jane.
-3-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:4=teasing,You haven't impressed so far, Plain-as-Day.  So color me interested with this "secret" of yours.
-3-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:4=smug,I'm listening, dearie.  You're so average that I'm honestly willing to buy that you have a "secret."
-3-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:4=laughing,Unless your secret is a third breast, I just can't see you wowing me, dear.
-3-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:2=smug,My, my, another magic trick?  Can't you dazzle us with your own naked body, dear?
-3-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:2=interested,This is getting old already, honey.  By all means, show your body instead--<i>that's</i> far more interesting.
-3-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:2=smug,You Earth girls and your parlor tricks.  Is this the sort of thing that amuses men and their tiny primate brains?  I'd rather see you naked.
-3-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:2=laughing,Can't you just magic-off your whole outfit, dearie?  I'd rather see how far down your makeup goes.
-3-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meia=seductive,Maybe it's just the antigravity, but this girl's lit a fire in my heart, Leader!  Do you think I should wear a suit like yours?
-3-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Hey, Leader, this girl's making bodysuits look good even for a woman with some meat on her.  Should I wear one?
-3-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,I think you've managed to make bodysuits boring for me, Meia.  This girl is making me want to get one now!
-3-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,Maybe I should abandon this silly dress and opt for a bodysuit like yours and Ochako's, Meia--just bare it all!  What do you say?
-3-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,I know I'm not as slender and lithe as <i>you</i>, Leader, but neither is Ochako.  Should I get myself a bodysuit?
-3-female_removing_major,target:moon,targetStage:0=laughing,<i>Whoa</i>.  OK, you meant it.  Can't say I understand the rush, but more power to you.
-3-female_removing_major,target:moon,targetStage:0=interested,You're not kidding around, are you, darling?  This your first time stripping for an audience?  Don't overdo things.
-3-female_removing_major,target:moon,targetStage:0=stretching,Try to keep the audience interested, honey.  Strippers don't walk out onstage naked for a reason.
-3-female_removing_major,target:moon,targetStage:0=teasing,Straight for the bra?  What an amateur...it's shock value.  The tease is half the fun, silly!
-3-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=laughing,Oho--and the Masked Woman is revealing herself!  I'm sure she has a good explanation for hiding.
-3-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=seductive,What's this, now?  The Masked Woman feels like looking us all in the eye?  I'd love to know why you waited so long.
-3-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=teasing,This had better be interesting, dear.  I want a face worth waiting for, because the rest of us are revealing more sensitive areas.
-3-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=teasing,Afraid of my evil alien gaze, honey?  How xenophobic--now take off that mask so I can see why you wore it.
-3-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=laughing,So soon, dearie?  I guess that "Secret Identity" of yours isn't worth hiding your pleasure from us.
-3-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=smug,I guess you'd rather look your admirers in the eyes than conceal you identity any longer than a few rounds.
-3-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=laughing,So much for your "Secret Identity," honey.  That's the second thing you're taking off!
-3-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=stretching,Oho!  And the mask comes off.  Why you bothered with it at all if it's going this quickly, I'll never understand.
-3-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=teasing,Well, look who's overcoming her shyness!  Guess that "Secret Identity" didn't last too long when you could've been nude instead.
-3-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:4=seductive,<i>Heeheehee</i>!  What was that again?  <i>Too-ayy-jolee</i>?
-3-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:4=teasing,<i>Too--too-ay-julee</i>?  Did I get it right?  Help me out here, cutie.
-3-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:4=seductive,<i>Tooayyjolie</i>?  Was that it?  Oh, all your words just melt together into a chocolate fondue of language!
-3-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:4=confused,<i>Too--tooayy</i>, uh, what was that?  I mean, it was adorable, but I didn't really catch it.
-3-female_removing_major,target:misato,targetStage:3=confused,Oooh, the <i>dress</i>!  Now we're talking!  ...What's the matter, Misato?
-3-female_removing_major,target:misato,targetStage:3=seductive,Aww, <i>someone's</i> embarrassed even through the booze!  What's got you all shy suddenly, huh?
-3-female_removing_major,target:misato,targetStage:3=laughing,Even half in the bag like this, you're all nervous.  Hiding something under that dress?
-3-female_removing_major,target:misato,targetStage:3=interested,Hey, Misato, what's wrong?  You look a little on edge suddenly, even between burps.
-3-female_removing_major,target:buffy,targetStage:4=laughing,<i>And what have we here</i>?  Ooh, you're more depraved than I thought, Miss Vampire Hunter.
-3-female_removing_major,target:buffy,targetStage:4=laughing,<i>Heeheehee</i>!  Undoing your bra beneath your shirt, you little tease?  A woman after my own heart...if I wore bras.
-3-female_removing_major,target:buffy,targetStage:4=smug,That's a sexy little move there, honey.  I'd try it, too, but bras have never been to my tastes in the first place.
-3-female_removing_major,target:buffy,targetStage:4=teasing,So are you trying to be fun and sexy, or just throwing us all off?  <i>I'd certainly prefer the former</i>.
-3-female_removing_major,target:jasmine,targetStage:1=interested,Wait, <i>what</i>?  I thought you were just dressed in typical overly-conservative Earth wear, but instead you're <i>royalty</i>?
-3-female_removing_major,target:jasmine,targetStage:1=laughing,That was a disguise?  Hey, dearie, next time try hiding your <i>face</i>.  That might throw people off the princess's trail.
-3-female_removing_major,target:jasmine,targetStage:1=laughing,You were disguised?  You're <i>royalty</i>?  If the commoners can't recognize their princess's face, I can see why you're still in power.
-3-female_removing_major,target:jasmine,targetStage:1=laughing,Oh, what's this?  You're <i>nobility</i>?  Well, well, well, honey...<i>you'll make an excellent ransom</i>.
-3-female_removing_major,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=confused,Uh, I don't know who "Kleese" is, but I'm actually more concerned about that giant syringe you have for an arm.
-3-female_removing_major,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=shocked,...So anyway, <i>what the hell is wrong with your arm...syringe...thing</i>?
-3-female_removing_major,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=angry,Why do I care?  I don't know who Kleese is, you have pink skin, you're taking your dress off already, and, uh, <i>you have a giant syringe for an arm</i>.
-3-female_removing_major,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=confused,...Are you really not aware of how strange you look?  Like, I was nice and didn't immediately comment on your, uh, <i>syringe</i>.
-3-female_removing_major,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=frustrated,Well, I care about other things, too, like <i>Oh My God you have a giant gross needle for an arm I hate needles what's going on</i>.
-3-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=vain,As you can see, my boss isn't the type to pull her punches.  All in one go, just like I did!
-3-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=teasing,Meia Gisborn isn't the type to tease you, as you can see.  Quick and to the point!
-3-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=seductive-2,Meia's so sweet compared to me and my teasing ways.  Barely lost at all, and she's showing off her cute underwear!
-3-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=interested,The whole suit in one go?  You're awfully nice to these Earth people even though they've tried kill us.
-3-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=seductive-2,The whole suit?  That makes me feel a bit better about being naked.  This is very embarrassing, you know.
-3-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1=shocked,<i>Ack!  No!  The Paksis!  I should've known this was a dream</i>!
-3-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1=shocked,<i>Eeek!  Marinette!  The Harvest has got you!  Nooo</i>!
-3-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1=shocked,<i>Aaack!  Don't touch me!  W-what's happening?  Help</i>!
-3-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1=shocked,<i>Aaack!  T-the Harvest!  They're here!  Run!  I'm sorry, Ladybug</i>!
-3-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1=shocked,<i>Eeek!  No!  Please!  I have a girlfriend!  I can't die here</i>!
-3-female_removed_major=interested,Hey, you think <i>this</i> is hard?  Try getting Meia to smile.  Unless you're Ezra's baby, it's not happening.
-3-female_removed_major=seductive-2,Careful how much skin you show.  Sometimes I can't control myself around a beautiful woman.
-3-female_removed_major=thinking,Would Meia be doing better than me?  Yeah, nudity wouldn't make her crack.
-3-female_removed_major=frustrated,I bet the Captain would do well at cards, but <i>ugh</i>, that wrinkly old body.  No thanks.
-3-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3=interested,Did you seriously just wear your gym clothes here?  <i>Please</i> tell me you actually own something sexy.
-3-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3=laughing,Don't tell me your <i>gym clothes</i> are your underwear!  This is why you don't have a girlfriend, Meia.
-3-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3=laughing,You can't be serious, Meia.  <i>That's</i> your underwear?  You work out in that, I've seen you!
-3-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3=interested,Gym clothes as underwear?  You're a machine, boss.  Nothing if not efficient...and emotionless.
-3-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3=interested,I've already lost my adorable little thong, and then you break out your sweaty gym stuff.  Have some showmanship, Meia.
-3-female_removed_major,target:ayano,targetStage:6=shocked,Ooh, a swimsuit!  I like the beach, too--wait, are those <i>bloodstains</i>?  Uh--like, they're <i>yours</i>, right?
-3-female_removed_major,target:ayano,targetStage:6=laughing,Ouch, honey.  Picked the worst day of the month to go swimming, didn't you?
-3-female_removed_major,target:ayano,targetStage:6=awkward,...Those are <i>your</i> bloodstains, right?  Like, from menstrual issues, or something?
-3-female_removed_major,target:ayano,targetStage:6=thinking,Seems Earth women haven't quite nailed down how to track their own menstrual cycles.  Why do we have those, anyway?
-3-female_removed_major,target:faye,targetStage:5=interested,Oh.  Might as well have gone through with it, dearie--you've already embarrassed yourself by trying.
-3-female_removed_major,target:faye,targetStage:5=teasing,No use saving face now, honey--unless you think the makeup does that.
-3-female_removed_major,target:faye,targetStage:5=smug,Hey, don't let <i>my</i> complaints stop you.  You've already lost the respect of the table, darling.
-3-female_removed_major,target:faye,targetStage:5=teasing,What a sore loser.  Can't quite keep up the tease when you've got to answer for it, huh?  <i>Try me</i>.
-3-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,priority:0=seductive-2,Meia's actually got some muscle to her.  She's pretty cute--but don't tell her I said that!
-3-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,priority:0=vain,B.C. doesn't have that many muscles, but she sure is athletic.  Guess being a man does that for you.
-3-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,priority:0=interested,The Nirvana's got quite the gym room, if you want to put yourself to the test.
-3-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,priority:0=laughing,You might be able to challenge our crew's physical records.  Meia holds most of them...most of us don't bother.
-3-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2=teasing,Ooh, you're <i>blonde</i>!  <i>Just what I was hoping for, cutie</i>.
-3-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2=vain,Omigosh--you're <i>blonde</i>, and you were hiding it?  What's the matter with you--blonde women are the most beautiful of all!
-3-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2=seductive,Hey, hey, hey!  The Masked Woman is <i>blonde</i>?  I <i>love</i> blondes...they remind me of myself.
-3-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2=vain,Ooh, a fellow blonde!  Life has truly blessed us with this color--I can't believe you'd go and try to hide it.
-3-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6=bored,<i>Yeesh</i>.  I'm <i>sober</i>, and this girl's making me feel woozy just looking at her.
-3-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6=teasing,Hey, honey, a girl's no fun unless she can have fun sober.  Give it a try sometime between shots.
-3-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6=confused,Seriously, though, do you have a second liver?  Where's all this booze draining into in that tiny body?
-3-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6=smug,Thank your lucky stars you didn't get a table with Meia, dear.  She'd be grilling you <i>nonstop</i> for drinking like this.
-3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2=awkward,<i>Noooo</i>...what?  You're in street clothes now?  ...What was <i>that</i> all about?
-3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2=angry,...OK.  Yeah.  Would you mind explaining why you just went nuclear, "Ladybug"?
-3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2=shocked,<i>Help!  I--I</i>...OK.  It stopped.  Are you planning on explaining that, "Ladybug"?
-3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,marker:planet-countries=confused,...OK, that's much more...<i>normal</i>.  Is this how people change clothes on Planet France?
-3-female_removed_major,alsoPlaying:meia=seductive-2,Careful how much skin you show.  Sometimes I can't control myself around a beautiful woman.
-3-female_removed_major,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Nudity can't make <i>you</i> crack, right, Leader?  I'm kinda checked out, honestly.
-3-female_removed_major,alsoPlaying:meia=frustrated,I bet the Captain would do well at cards, but <i>ugh</i>, that wrinkly old body.  No thanks.
-3-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,alsoPlaying:meia,priority:100=seductive-2,Hey, Meia, this girl's actually got some muscle to her.  You're pretty cute--<i>oops, I said that out loud</i>!
-3-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,alsoPlaying:meia,priority:100=vain,B.C. doesn't have that many muscles, but she sure is athletic.  Guess being a man does that for you.
-3-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,alsoPlaying:meia,priority:100=interested,The Nirvana's got quite the gym room, if you want to put yourself to the test.
-3-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,alsoPlaying:meia,priority:100=laughing,You might be able to challenge our crew's physical records.  Meia holds most of them, right?  Undisputed.
-3-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3=laughing,Wow.  You really <i>are</i> a blueberry girl, top to bottom.  I can see why you kept the hood on.
-3-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3=interested,Just as blue on top, I see.  Maybe you should just put the hood back on until you feel better.
-3-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3=laughing,Honey, you can worry about you looks until you're blue in the face, but, uh...<i>well</i>.
-3-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3=teasing,Feeling under the weather, Raven?  You're looking a little blue--I guess that's why you had the hood on.
-3-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=awkward,That's, uh, really...<i>wow</i>.  That is a <i>lot</i> of pubic hair, to be peeking out of your thong like that...are you OK?
-3-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=angry,<i>Ew</i>.  Don't you have razors where you live?  I can see your icky pubic hair poking out from here!
-3-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=annoyed,...Were you laid up in bed recently?  Because I can see your unshaven hair from behind your thong, and <i>eugh</i>.
-3-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=angry,OK, <i>ew</i>.  Don't you <i>shave</i>, Rinkah?  Do Earth men really like all that hair?
-3-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=frustrated,...Maybe you're unaware, but Mejare is obsessed with shaving, cleanliness, and smoothness.  <i>So that's really gross</i>.
-3-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:4=shocked,Wha--<i>ew</i>!  Was that in your panties?  That's gross!  Throw it out!
-3-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:4=awkward,...You're not going to <i>eat</i> that, right?  After it was in your...nether-regions?
-3-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:4=angry,...<i>Ew</i>.  Why are you sticking fruit anywhere but your mouth?  That's not funny!
-3-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:4=annoyed,...OK, this whole comedy act of yours is starting to get gross.  What's next, a tampon in your mouth?
-3-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:3=vain,Well, would you look at that!  Exactly what I wanted to see.  <i>More, please</i>!
-3-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:3=stretching,How about that?  You're finally taking my sage Mejarian advice concerning the female body.
-3-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:3=seductive,See?  There you go!  The best kind of magic is the kind that makes women's clothes disappear!
-3-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:3=laughing,Hah!  It's good to know you're listening to me.  Now do another trick and make yourself stark-naked!
-3-female_removed_major,target:misato,targetStage:4=shocked,<i>Eek!  OK!  Never mind!  Sorry!  I shouldn't have made fun</i>!  ...How'd you <i>get</i> that?
-3-female_removed_major,target:misato,targetStage:4=awkward,...<i>Oof</i>.  What gave you <i>that</i>?  ...If you don't mind me asking.
-3-female_removed_major,target:misato,targetStage:4=confused,...Should I ask what gave you that?  Is that out of line?  Is it from the "Second Impact" thing?
-3-female_removed_major,target:misato,targetStage:4=confused,...I got injured once.  No scars, though.  What happened to you, some military mission?
-3-female_removed_major,target:moon,targetStage:1=laughing,<i>Jeez</i>.  Way to immediately dispel any notions I had of Earth girls being prudes.
-3-female_removed_major,target:moon,targetStage:1=interested,And here I thought Earth girls felt shy about the whole <i>sex</i> thing.  Not you, sweetheart.
-3-female_removed_major,target:moon,targetStage:1=smug,And I thought <i>I</i> was eager.  But no, it seems Mejarians are classier as well as more beautiful.
-3-female_removed_major,target:moon,targetStage:1=interested,You're something else, Ocean Girl.  Is men's attention <i>that</i> important to you?
-3-female_removed_major,target:shego,targetStage:4=seductive,<i>Oh, my</i>!  Way to go above and beyond, honey--I thought the bodysuit was sexy enough already!
-3-female_removed_major,target:shego,targetStage:4=laughing,Who exactly are you dressing up for, dear?  This is enough sexy outfits to please an army.
-3-female_removed_major,target:shego,targetStage:4=teasing,With <i>that</i> underneath your suit, I'm impressed you can move at all...<i>you must be a real animal in bed</i>.
-3-female_removed_major,target:shego,targetStage:4=seductive,There's no stopping <i>your</i> sex appeal, honey--just look at all that!  You put the effort in.
-3-female_removed_major,target:shego,targetStage:4=stretching,I'd say you're showing a sexy side, but the suit did that already.
-3-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5b=seductive,That's cute and simple!  Who's Eridan, your girlfriend?
-3-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5b=laughing,Stealing clothes from your girlfriend now, Vriska?  Is "Eridan" OK with you rooting through her wardrobe?
-3-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5b=seductive,See, that's plain and simple fashion for the masses!  Your girlfriend Eridan has some good taste in outfits.
-3-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5b=laughing,Skirt and stockings?  Simple, but sexy!  Tell this "Eridan" I like her style.  She your girlfriend?
-3-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5c=laughing,Getting a little skimpier than you'd like, honey?  You can't control fate, so just hope for good rolls...and leg coverage.
-3-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5c=teasing,Aww, it's not so bad!  Pants are overrated...just look at me.
-3-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5c=vain,I bet the breeze feels good on your legs now.  You're starting to see the genius of my fashion choices!
-3-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5c=laughing,Why wear pants when your shirt can cover all the essentials?  Now put on a dress and you'll be just like me.
-3-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6a=laughing,...See what I meant?  That die's got it out for you!  Better off stripping like normal, Miss Aquatic.
-3-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6a=teasing,That die's not doing you any favors anymore, darling.  Best to just strip like the rest of us...or go for another swim.
-3-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6a=laughing,Yeah, I didn't say anything before, but you <i>have</i> been cheating.  Enjoy being all soggy!
-3-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6a=laughing,Back from a swim, Vriska?  I'm <i>loving</i> this!  You're too much!
-3-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5a=laughing,What is <i>that</i> supposed to be?  Look, I don't go for your creepy dungeon play.
-3-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5a=laughing,I wasn't aware other planets were into bondage...but Mejare had to get its ideas from somewhere.
-3-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5a=laughing,Planning on <i>dominating</i> us later, Vriska?  Don't tie me up for piracy, now!  <i>Heeheehee</i>!
-3-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5a=vain,Oh, dear.  That's quite the authoritative outfit for a pirate like me to be comfortable around.
-3-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6b=teasing,Looking more Mejarian all the time, Vriska!  Skin is always in style where I'm from.
-3-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6b=seductive,That's the fashion I know and love!  Less is more on Mejare, as they say...
-3-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6b=stretching,Now you're dressing like all the other women I know on Mejare.  <i>Bo-ring</i>.
-3-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6b=interested,Nice Mejarian look you're rocking there now.  My girlfriend tends to wear even less than that.
-3-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:5=interested,<i>Well</i>!  Plain-Jane's not <i>quite</i> so plain after all.  Good show.
-3-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:5=laughing,Ha!  Not bad for an Earth girl...at least you really <i>were</i> hiding something.
-3-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:5=vain,Earth girls really <i>are</i> nuts...why would you hide those beauties away?  Honestly.
-3-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:5=stretching,A plain face and huge breasts?  You're the logical conclusion of Mejare's obsession with chests.
-3-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:blake,totalMales:1-2=laughing,Hey, honey, why don't we all just cool it?  You're making it clear how this girl's your ladyfriend--leave the men alone.
-3-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:blake,totalMales:1-2=seductive,My, my!  Getting a little defensive around men, are we?  I guess you Earth girls have to fight tooth and nail to keep each other.
-3-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:blake,totalMales:1-2=teasing,So you two are together, is that it?  And those <i>nasty Earth men</i> want to drive you apart?  Thanks for repping Mejare for me.
-3-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:blake,totalMales:1-2=vain,Oh, are you two a couple?  I've been going steady with Barnette for a while...though I don't feel any hatred of men because of it.
-3-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=excited,Wait--you...<i>oh my God</i>.  <i>That's fantastic</i>!
-3-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=awkward,<i>I'm sorry!  I'll come quietly</i>!  I--I--wait, did you just shoot your own clothes off?
-3-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=excited,I--that's...that's <i>so cool</i>!  Do it again!
-3-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=excited,...Omigosh, that's so cool!  How'd you <i>do that</i>?  Can I get your autograph?

-2-male_removing_major=interested,<i>Now</i> you're on a roll, ~name~!  Keep it up!
-2-male_removing_major=excited,This has been good for me, ~name~.  Now make it <i>great</i>.
-2-male_removing_major=stretching,About time!  Let's see if your body is as bristly as they say.
-2-male_removing_major=smug,Just what I've been looking for.  Well, I guess your tube would be a <i>liiiiiittle</i> better...
-2-male_removed_major=excited,What <i>else</i> is a man hiding away?  Got to be something worth seeing for this Mejarian, right?
-2-male_removed_major=interested,<i>Finally</i>, something good from you.  Took you long enough, handsome.
-2-male_removed_major=angry,I don't mind men watching me do this...except for Rabat, that jerk.  He's so gross!
-2-male_removed_major=teasing,I'm on the edge of my seat, ~name~.  And at another edge, too.
-2-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:7=laughing,<i>Oh, my</i>!  And I thought men were courageous!  But this mountain of muscles hides his thing from my teeth.
-2-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:7=laughing,What's the matter, Cap?  <i>Afraid this Mejarian will just bite it right off</i>?
-2-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:7=teasing,Come now, honey--there's no reason to hide bheind your shield.  I don't eat <i>every</i> man's organs.
-2-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:7=teasing,Don't be that way, dear.  If I wanted to eat you, I'd go for those delicious shoulder muscles.  So put the shield down.
-2-female_removing_major=smug,What's this?  Did the Earth girl learn how to have fun?
-2-female_removing_major=stretching,Done taking your "fun" lessons from Meia, have you?
-2-female_removing_major=vain,I'll show whatever you want...it's my duty as a Mejarian to pry you away from these beastly Earth men.
-2-female_removing_major=interested,Can an Earth girl ever really learn to love a woman's touch?  Maybe we should put it to the test.
-2-female_removing_major,target:misato,targetStage:3=confused,Oooh, the <i>dress</i>!  Now we're talking!  ...What's the matter, Misato?
-2-female_removing_major,target:misato,targetStage:3=seductive,Aww, <i>someone's</i> embarrassed even through the booze!  What's got you all shy suddenly, huh?
-2-female_removing_major,target:misato,targetStage:3=laughing,Even half in the bag like this, you're all nervous.  Hiding something under that dress?
-2-female_removing_major,target:misato,targetStage:3=interested,Hey, Misato, what's wrong?  You look a little on edge suddenly, even between burps.
-2-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=seductive,<i>Teehee</i>!  I have no clue what you just said, but you've <i>got</i> to teach me, Marinette!  This'll drive my girlfriend <i>wild</i>.
-2-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=vain,I can just <i>picture</i> the look on Barnette's face when I start whispering these sweet nothings.  Could you teach me?
-2-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=excited,What was that?  Anyway, omigosh, Marinette, you <i>have</i> to give me some French lessons!  Barnette will melt in my arms!
-2-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=seductive,Whatever you just said, my girlfriend Barnette would absolutely <i>melt</i>, it's so romantic!  <i>Won't you please teach me</i>?
-2-female_removing_major,target:buffy,targetStage:4=laughing,<i>And what have we here</i>?  Ooh, you're more depraved than I thought, Miss Vampire Hunter.
-2-female_removing_major,target:buffy,targetStage:4=laughing,<i>Heeheehee</i>!  Undoing your bra beneath your shirt, you little tease?  A woman after my own heart...if I wore bras.
-2-female_removing_major,target:buffy,targetStage:4=smug,That's a sexy little move there, honey.  I'd try it, too, but bras have never been to my tastes in the first place.
-2-female_removing_major,target:buffy,targetStage:4=teasing,So are you trying to be fun and sexy, or just throwing us all off?  <i>I'd certainly prefer the former</i>.
-2-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:4=seductive,<i>Heeheehee</i>!  What was that again?  <i>Too-ayy-jolee</i>?
-2-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:4=teasing,<i>Too--too-ay-julee</i>?  Did I get it right?  Help me out here, cutie.
-2-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:4=seductive,<i>Tooayyjolie</i>?  Was that it?  Oh, all your words just melt together into a chocolate fondue of language!
-2-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:4=confused,<i>Too--tooayy</i>, uh, what was that?  I mean, it was adorable, but I didn't really catch it.
-2-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4=seductive,Ooh, that's a nifty trick, dear!  You can bet <i>I'd</i> give it a shot if I could...<i>do you think I should wear a bodysuit</i>?
-2-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4=seductive,I've always felt I'm too pillowy and soft for a bodysuit, but you really make it your own!  <i>Could I pull it off, too, sweetie</i>?
-2-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4=teasing,Hey, Miss Gravity, I was really like the look of your figure all stuffed into that suit.  Do you think I'd look good in the same thing?
-2-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4=vain,Mejare has a thing for bodysuits, you know...I wonder if I should get myself one.  There's just no tease to it, you know?
-2-female_removing_major,target:faye,targetStage:4=laughing,<i>Pfft</i>!  So much for the cool-and-calculated act!  Even <i>I</i> wouldn't stoop that low...maybe.
-2-female_removing_major,target:faye,targetStage:4=laughing,There's no need, dear.  You're showing your true colors already.
-2-female_removing_major,target:faye,targetStage:4=annoyed,OK, even <i>I</i> wouldn't count my makeup.  It's just luck, honey, don't be so sore about it.
-2-female_removing_major,target:faye,targetStage:4=interested,Look, honey, if you have to wear enough makeup that it counts as clothing, it wouldn't save your looks in the first place.
-2-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:2=smug,My, my, another magic trick?  Can't you dazzle us with your own naked body, dear?
-2-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:2=interested,This is getting old already, honey.  By all means, show your body instead--<i>that's</i> far more interesting.
-2-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:2=smug,You Earth girls and your parlor tricks.  Is this the sort of thing that amuses men and their tiny primate brains?  I'd rather see you naked.
-2-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:2=laughing,Can't you just magic-off your whole outfit, dearie?  I'd rather see how far down your makeup goes.
-2-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:4=seductive,Is that your own special die, or does it just work for anyone?  ...Can <i>I</i> try?
-2-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:4=vain,So if I rolled that thing, could it give me a whole new outfit?  I mean, I <i>do</i> love my dress, but hey.
-2-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:4=confused,Now I'm starting to get curious about that die of yours.  Would it work if <i>I</i> rolled it?
-2-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:4=teasing,Does that die work solely for you?  What if I just <i>snatched it</i> like the pirate I am?
-2-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meia=seductive,Maybe it's just the antigravity, but this girl's lit a fire in my heart, Leader!  Do you think I should wear a suit like yours?
-2-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Hey, Leader, this girl's making bodysuits look good even for a woman with some meat on her.  Should I wear one?
-2-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,I think you've managed to make bodysuits boring for me, Meia.  This girl is making me want to get one now!
-2-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,Maybe I should abandon this silly dress and opt for a bodysuit like yours and Ochako's, Meia--just bare it all!  What do you say?
-2-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,I know I'm not as slender and lithe as <i>you</i>, Leader, but neither is Ochako.  Should I get myself a bodysuit?
-2-female_removing_major,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,What's this?  Did the Earth girl learn how to have fun?
-2-female_removing_major,alsoPlaying:meia=stretching,Finally, something worthwhile.  I'm busy, Meia, go thank her.
-2-female_removing_major,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,I'll show whatever you want...it's my duty as a Mejarian to pry you away from these beastly Earth men.
-2-female_removing_major,alsoPlaying:meia=interested,Can an Earth girl ever really learn to love a woman's touch?  Maybe we should put it to the test.
-2-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:4=smug,You have a <i>secret</i>?  Well, here's your chance to keep me interested, Plain-Jane.
-2-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:4=teasing,You haven't impressed so far, Plain-as-Day.  So color me interested with this "secret" of yours.
-2-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:4=smug,I'm listening, dearie.  You're so average that I'm honestly willing to buy that you have a "secret."
-2-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:4=laughing,Unless your secret is a third breast, I just can't see you wowing me, dear.
-2-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5=seductive,But don't worry about all that!  Let's see what outfit's next, cutie!
-2-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5=vain,Another vortex, another wonderful piece of fashion to ogle.  <i>I'm so lucky</i>!
-2-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5=vain,You call yourself the lucky one, but I came here <i>hoping</i> to see some cool fashion choices.
-2-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5=vain,Simply magical.  My luck that I'd meet you, not these vortices.  <i>Things just work out for me</i>!
-2-female_removing_major,target:launch,targetStage:5=bored,...Well, at least you're blonde again.  Blonde's a good color...I can stare at that and tune you out.
-2-female_removing_major,target:launch,targetStage:5=bored,At least there's no gun this time.  Now you'll have to make a racket by shouting.
-2-female_removing_major,target:launch,targetStage:5=bored,Yeah, yeah, keep on screaming.  I'll just stare at that lovely blonde hair and try to forget what's under it...
-2-female_removing_major,target:launch,targetStage:5=frustrated,Your blue version really taught me the value of peace and quiet.
-2-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=smug,Nothing I don't see when you hit the showers, right?  If anything, now I'm out of your way.
-2-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=vain,Don't mind me.  I'll just ogle my boss from afar, in my defeated little huddle.
-2-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=smug,Zip it off in one go...for the others, of course.  <i>I'm</i> not interested.
-2-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=seductive,You'll have to excuse my interest.  Who knew my cold little squadron leader was so <i>cute</i>?
-2-female_removed_major=interested,<i>Here</i> we go.  What I need is a <i>woman</i>'s touch.
-2-female_removed_major=seductive-2,What <i>is</i> it that makes women so much better?  The delicateness?  The ferocity underneath?  The breasts?
-2-female_removed_major=excited,Come on, ~name~.  This is as compromising as it gets...and I'm <i>loving</i> it.
-2-female_removed_major=teasing,I understand, ~name~.  You're finally beginning to appreciate Mejarian beauty...and you want some for yourself.
-2-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3=sad,All that lovely pale skin...I should stay inside more.  I think I'm getting too much of a tan.
-2-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3=seductive,How do you keep your skin so pale and pristine with all that sweating you do in the gym?
-2-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3=stretching,Never noticed how pale you were...Barnette's rather tan.  But that's cute, too!
-2-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3=vain,As fair as Mejare is beautiful...so with a rather nasty interior.
-2-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3=seductive,Some women may like those muscles.  Me?  Your skin is so wonderfully <i>fair</i>.
-2-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5a=laughing,What is <i>that</i> supposed to be?  Look, I don't go for your creepy dungeon play.
-2-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5a=laughing,I wasn't aware other planets were into bondage...but Mejare had to get its ideas from somewhere.
-2-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5a=laughing,Planning on <i>dominating</i> us later, Vriska?  Don't tie me up for piracy, now!  <i>Heeheehee</i>!
-2-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5a=vain,Oh, dear.  That's quite the authoritative outfit for a pirate like me to be comfortable around.
-2-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:blake,totalMales:1-2=laughing,Hey, honey, why don't we all just cool it?  You're making it clear how this girl's your ladyfriend--leave the men alone.
-2-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:blake,totalMales:1-2=seductive,My, my!  Getting a little defensive around men, are we?  I guess you Earth girls have to fight tooth and nail to keep each other.
-2-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:blake,totalMales:1-2=teasing,So you two are together, is that it?  And those <i>nasty Earth men</i> want to drive you apart?  Thanks for repping Mejare for me.
-2-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:blake,totalMales:1-2=vain,Oh, are you two a couple?  I've been going steady with Barnette for a while...though I don't feel any hatred of men because of it.
-2-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3=laughing,Wow.  You really <i>are</i> a blueberry girl, top to bottom.  I can see why you kept the hood on.
-2-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3=interested,Just as blue on top, I see.  Maybe you should just put the hood back on until you feel better.
-2-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3=laughing,Honey, you can worry about you looks until you're blue in the face, but, uh...<i>well</i>.
-2-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3=teasing,Feeling under the weather, Raven?  You're looking a little blue--I guess that's why you had the hood on.
-2-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:4=shocked,Wha--<i>ew</i>!  Was that in your panties?  That's gross!  Throw it out!
-2-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:4=awkward,...You're not going to <i>eat</i> that, right?  After it was in your...nether-regions?
-2-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:4=angry,...<i>Ew</i>.  Why are you sticking fruit anywhere but your mouth?  That's not funny!
-2-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:4=annoyed,...OK, this whole comedy act of yours is starting to get gross.  What's next, a tampon in your mouth?
-2-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6=bored,<i>Yeesh</i>.  I'm <i>sober</i>, and this girl's making me feel woozy just looking at her.
-2-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6=teasing,Hey, honey, a girl's no fun unless she can have fun sober.  Give it a try sometime between shots.
-2-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6=confused,Seriously, though, do you have a second liver?  Where's all this booze draining into in that tiny body?
-2-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6=smug,Thank your lucky stars you didn't get a table with Meia, dear.  She'd be grilling you <i>nonstop</i> for drinking like this.
-2-female_removed_major,target:misato,targetStage:4=shocked,<i>Eek!  OK!  Never mind!  Sorry!  I shouldn't have made fun</i>!  ...How'd you <i>get</i> that?
-2-female_removed_major,target:misato,targetStage:4=awkward,...<i>Oof</i>.  What gave you <i>that</i>?  ...If you don't mind me asking.
-2-female_removed_major,target:misato,targetStage:4=confused,...Should I ask what gave you that?  Is that out of line?  Is it from the "Second Impact" thing?
-2-female_removed_major,target:misato,targetStage:4=confused,...I got injured once.  No scars, though.  What happened to you, some military mission?
-2-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5b=seductive,That's cute and simple!  Who's Eridan, your girlfriend?
-2-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5b=laughing,Stealing clothes from your girlfriend now, Vriska?  Is "Eridan" OK with you rooting through her wardrobe?
-2-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5b=seductive,See, that's plain and simple fashion for the masses!  Your girlfriend Eridan has some good taste in outfits.
-2-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5b=laughing,Skirt and stockings?  Simple, but sexy!  Tell this "Eridan" I like her style.  She your girlfriend?
-2-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,alsoPlaying:meia,priority:100=vain,Ooh, a woman with muscles.  Now, they wouldn't look good on me, but...
-2-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,alsoPlaying:meia,priority:100=teasing,I can't do muscles...hey, Leader, sometimes <i>your</i> abs look pretty juicy, all covered in sweat.  Is that out of line for me to say?
-2-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,alsoPlaying:meia,priority:100=seductive,You exercise a lot, too, Meia...but you're so cute already!  You don't need it...
-2-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,alsoPlaying:meia,priority:100=teasing,I want to see that body in action...because it looks like it sees a lot of action.
-2-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6b=teasing,Looking more Mejarian all the time, Vriska!  Skin is always in style where I'm from.
-2-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6b=seductive,That's the fashion I know and love!  Less is more on Mejare, as they say...
-2-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6b=stretching,Now you're dressing like all the other women I know on Mejare.  <i>Bo-ring</i>.
-2-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6b=interested,Nice Mejarian look you're rocking there now.  My girlfriend tends to wear even less than that.
-2-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:5=interested,<i>Well</i>!  Plain-Jane's not <i>quite</i> so plain after all.  Good show.
-2-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:5=laughing,Ha!  Not bad for an Earth girl...at least you really <i>were</i> hiding something.
-2-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:5=vain,Earth girls really <i>are</i> nuts...why would you hide those beauties away?  Honestly.
-2-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:5=stretching,A plain face and huge breasts?  You're the logical conclusion of Mejare's obsession with chests.
-2-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=awkward,That's, uh, really...<i>wow</i>.  That is a <i>lot</i> of pubic hair, to be peeking out of your thong like that...are you OK?
-2-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=angry,<i>Ew</i>.  Don't you have razors where you live?  I can see your icky pubic hair poking out from here!
-2-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=annoyed,...Were you laid up in bed recently?  Because I can see your unshaven hair from behind your thong, and <i>eugh</i>.
-2-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=angry,OK, <i>ew</i>.  Don't you <i>shave</i>, Rinkah?  Do Earth men really like all that hair?
-2-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=frustrated,...Maybe you're unaware, but Mejare is obsessed with shaving, cleanliness, and smoothness.  <i>So that's really gross</i>.
-2-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,priority:0=vain,Ooh, a woman with muscles.  Now, they wouldn't look good on me, but...
-2-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,priority:0=stretching,I can't do muscles...sometimes Meia's abs look pretty juicy, though, all covered in sweat.
-2-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,priority:0=vain,Meia exercises a lot, too...don't know why.  She's so cute already!
-2-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,priority:0=teasing,I want to see that body in action...because it looks like it sees a lot of action.
-2-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6a=laughing,...See what I meant?  That die's got it out for you!  Better off stripping like normal, Miss Aquatic.
-2-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6a=teasing,That die's not doing you any favors anymore, darling.  Best to just strip like the rest of us...or go for another swim.
-2-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6a=laughing,Yeah, I didn't say anything before, but you <i>have</i> been cheating.  Enjoy being all soggy!
-2-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6a=laughing,Back from a swim, Vriska?  I'm <i>loving</i> this!  You're too much!
-2-female_removed_major,target:faye,targetStage:5=interested,Oh.  Might as well have gone through with it, dearie--you've already embarrassed yourself by trying.
-2-female_removed_major,target:faye,targetStage:5=teasing,No use saving face now, honey--unless you think the makeup does that.
-2-female_removed_major,target:faye,targetStage:5=smug,Hey, don't let <i>my</i> complaints stop you.  You've already lost the respect of the table, darling.
-2-female_removed_major,target:faye,targetStage:5=teasing,What a sore loser.  Can't quite keep up the tease when you've got to answer for it, huh?  <i>Try me</i>.
-2-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5c=laughing,Getting a little skimpier than you'd like, honey?  You can't control fate, so just hope for good rolls...and leg coverage.
-2-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5c=teasing,Aww, it's not so bad!  Pants are overrated...just look at me.
-2-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5c=vain,I bet the breeze feels good on your legs now.  You're starting to see the genius of my fashion choices!
-2-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5c=laughing,Why wear pants when your shirt can cover all the essentials?  Now put on a dress and you'll be just like me.
-2-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:3=vain,Well, would you look at that!  Exactly what I wanted to see.  <i>More, please</i>!
-2-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:3=stretching,How about that?  You're finally taking my sage Mejarian advice concerning the female body.
-2-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:3=seductive,See?  There you go!  The best kind of magic is the kind that makes women's clothes disappear!
-2-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:3=laughing,Hah!  It's good to know you're listening to me.  Now do another trick and make yourself stark-naked!
-2-female_removed_major,target:ayano,targetStage:6=shocked,Ooh, a swimsuit!  I like the beach, too--wait, are those <i>bloodstains</i>?  Uh--like, they're <i>yours</i>, right?
-2-female_removed_major,target:ayano,targetStage:6=laughing,Ouch, honey.  Picked the worst day of the month to go swimming, didn't you?
-2-female_removed_major,target:ayano,targetStage:6=awkward,...Those are <i>your</i> bloodstains, right?  Like, from menstrual issues, or something?
-2-female_removed_major,target:ayano,targetStage:6=thinking,Seems Earth women haven't quite nailed down how to track their own menstrual cycles.  Why do we have those, anyway?
-2-female_removed_major,target:shego,targetStage:4=seductive,<i>Oh, my</i>!  Way to go above and beyond, honey--I thought the bodysuit was sexy enough already!
-2-female_removed_major,target:shego,targetStage:4=laughing,Who exactly are you dressing up for, dear?  This is enough sexy outfits to please an army.
-2-female_removed_major,target:shego,targetStage:4=teasing,With <i>that</i> underneath your suit, I'm impressed you can move at all...<i>you must be a real animal in bed</i>.
-2-female_removed_major,target:shego,targetStage:4=seductive,There's no stopping <i>your</i> sex appeal, honey--just look at all that!  You put the effort in.
-2-female_removed_major,target:shego,targetStage:4=stretching,I'd say you're showing a sexy side, but the suit did that already.

-1-male_removing_major=seductive-2,What's this?  A man showing skin?  Hide your Mejarians!
-1-male_removing_major=laughing,That's quite the choice.  <i>I hope you don't regret it later</i>.
-1-male_removing_major=teasing,I've already gone over the edge...but who knows?  Maybe there's another one you can push me past.
-1-male_removing_major=seductive-2,Oh, I just can't take this!  A man leering at my defeated nude body, stripping himself down...it's enough to make the hardiest Mejarians swoon.
-1-male_removed_major=seductive,Don't stop there, ~name~.  I'm sure a man exposing himself would be enough to make me go another round.
-1-male_removed_major=vain,Men's bodies are so fascinating.  How <i>do</i> they balance themselves out without the extra...<i>assets</i>?
-1-male_removed_major=teasing,Little Hibiki's got the moxie to make up for his size.  How do <i>you</i> compensate...and for <i>what</i>?
-1-male_removed_major=teasing,The men in my life are a fascinating bunch.  But now you're starting to catch up to them in that regard.
-1-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:7=laughing,<i>Oh, my</i>!  And I thought men were courageous!  But this mountain of muscles hides his thing from my teeth.
-1-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:7=laughing,What's the matter, Cap?  <i>Afraid this Mejarian will just bite it right off</i>?
-1-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:7=teasing,Come now, honey--there's no reason to hide bheind your shield.  I don't eat <i>every</i> man's organs.
-1-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:7=teasing,Don't be that way, dear.  If I wanted to eat you, I'd go for those delicious shoulder muscles.  So put the shield down.
-1-female_removing_major=teasing,Let's see some skin, ~name~.  Earth men know all about you anyway, right?
-1-female_removing_major=smug,Don't Earth women strip down all the time?  I thought men were insatiable sex-fiends, after all.
-1-female_removing_major=stretching,You know, after masturbating in public, this just doesn't seem like a fair tradeoff to me.
-1-female_removing_major=vain,That's the way, ~name~.  Remember, it's the <i>losers</i> who get a reward here.
-1-female_removing_major,target:faye,targetStage:4=laughing,<i>Pfft</i>!  So much for the cool-and-calculated act!  Even <i>I</i> wouldn't stoop that low...maybe.
-1-female_removing_major,target:faye,targetStage:4=laughing,There's no need, dear.  You're showing your true colors already.
-1-female_removing_major,target:faye,targetStage:4=annoyed,OK, even <i>I</i> wouldn't count my makeup.  It's just luck, honey, don't be so sore about it.
-1-female_removing_major,target:faye,targetStage:4=interested,Look, honey, if you have to wear enough makeup that it counts as clothing, it wouldn't save your looks in the first place.
-1-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:4=smug,You have a <i>secret</i>?  Well, here's your chance to keep me interested, Plain-Jane.
-1-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:4=teasing,You haven't impressed so far, Plain-as-Day.  So color me interested with this "secret" of yours.
-1-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:4=smug,I'm listening, dearie.  You're so average that I'm honestly willing to buy that you have a "secret."
-1-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:4=laughing,Unless your secret is a third breast, I just can't see you wowing me, dear.
-1-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5=seductive,But don't worry about all that!  Let's see what outfit's next, cutie!
-1-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5=vain,Another vortex, another wonderful piece of fashion to ogle.  <i>I'm so lucky</i>!
-1-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5=vain,You call yourself the lucky one, but I came here <i>hoping</i> to see some cool fashion choices.
-1-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5=vain,Simply magical.  My luck that I'd meet you, not these vortices.  <i>Things just work out for me</i>!
-1-female_removing_major,target:launch,targetStage:5=bored,...Well, at least you're blonde again.  Blonde's a good color...I can stare at that and tune you out.
-1-female_removing_major,target:launch,targetStage:5=bored,At least there's no gun this time.  Now you'll have to make a racket by shouting.
-1-female_removing_major,target:launch,targetStage:5=bored,Yeah, yeah, keep on screaming.  I'll just stare at that lovely blonde hair and try to forget what's under it...
-1-female_removing_major,target:launch,targetStage:5=frustrated,Your blue version really taught me the value of peace and quiet.
-1-female_removing_major,target:buffy,targetStage:4=laughing,<i>And what have we here</i>?  Ooh, you're more depraved than I thought, Miss Vampire Hunter.
-1-female_removing_major,target:buffy,targetStage:4=laughing,<i>Heeheehee</i>!  Undoing your bra beneath your shirt, you little tease?  A woman after my own heart...if I wore bras.
-1-female_removing_major,target:buffy,targetStage:4=smug,That's a sexy little move there, honey.  I'd try it, too, but bras have never been to my tastes in the first place.
-1-female_removing_major,target:buffy,targetStage:4=teasing,So are you trying to be fun and sexy, or just throwing us all off?  <i>I'd certainly prefer the former</i>.
-1-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:4=seductive,Is that your own special die, or does it just work for anyone?  ...Can <i>I</i> try?
-1-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:4=vain,So if I rolled that thing, could it give me a whole new outfit?  I mean, I <i>do</i> love my dress, but hey.
-1-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:4=confused,Now I'm starting to get curious about that die of yours.  Would it work if <i>I</i> rolled it?
-1-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:4=teasing,Does that die work solely for you?  What if I just <i>snatched it</i> like the pirate I am?
-1-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:4=seductive,<i>Heeheehee</i>!  What was that again?  <i>Too-ayy-jolee</i>?
-1-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:4=teasing,<i>Too--too-ay-julee</i>?  Did I get it right?  Help me out here, cutie.
-1-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:4=seductive,<i>Tooayyjolie</i>?  Was that it?  Oh, all your words just melt together into a chocolate fondue of language!
-1-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:4=confused,<i>Too--tooayy</i>, uh, what was that?  I mean, it was adorable, but I didn't really catch it.
-1-female_removing_major,target:misato,targetStage:3=confused,Oooh, the <i>dress</i>!  Now we're talking!  ...What's the matter, Misato?
-1-female_removing_major,target:misato,targetStage:3=seductive,Aww, <i>someone's</i> embarrassed even through the booze!  What's got you all shy suddenly, huh?
-1-female_removing_major,target:misato,targetStage:3=laughing,Even half in the bag like this, you're all nervous.  Hiding something under that dress?
-1-female_removing_major,target:misato,targetStage:3=interested,Hey, Misato, what's wrong?  You look a little on edge suddenly, even between burps.
-1-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=seductive,<i>Teehee</i>!  I have no clue what you just said, but you've <i>got</i> to teach me, Marinette!  This'll drive my girlfriend <i>wild</i>.
-1-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=vain,I can just <i>picture</i> the look on Barnette's face when I start whispering these sweet nothings.  Could you teach me?
-1-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=excited,What was that?  Anyway, omigosh, Marinette, you <i>have</i> to give me some French lessons!  Barnette will melt in my arms!
-1-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=seductive,Whatever you just said, my girlfriend Barnette would absolutely <i>melt</i>, it's so romantic!  <i>Won't you please teach me</i>?
-1-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:2=smug,My, my, another magic trick?  Can't you dazzle us with your own naked body, dear?
-1-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:2=interested,This is getting old already, honey.  By all means, show your body instead--<i>that's</i> far more interesting.
-1-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:2=smug,You Earth girls and your parlor tricks.  Is this the sort of thing that amuses men and their tiny primate brains?  I'd rather see you naked.
-1-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:2=laughing,Can't you just magic-off your whole outfit, dearie?  I'd rather see how far down your makeup goes.
-1-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4=seductive,Ooh, that's a nifty trick, dear!  You can bet <i>I'd</i> give it a shot if I could...<i>do you think I should wear a bodysuit</i>?
-1-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4=seductive,I've always felt I'm too pillowy and soft for a bodysuit, but you really make it your own!  <i>Could I pull it off, too, sweetie</i>?
-1-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4=teasing,Hey, Miss Gravity, I was really like the look of your figure all stuffed into that suit.  Do you think I'd look good in the same thing?
-1-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4=vain,Mejare has a thing for bodysuits, you know...I wonder if I should get myself one.  There's just no tease to it, you know?
-1-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=teasing,Where would you say you rank on our crew, Meia?  I hear some of the low-rankers whisper about how they have a crush on you.
-1-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=smug,You try to act all modest, but you <i>are</i> our leader.  You love the spotlight...and our crewmates love <i>you</i>.
-1-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=seductive,You know Valore's head-over-heels for you, right?  She was <i>so worried</i> about you while we were gone.
-1-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=teasing,You're too lovable for your own good, Meia.  I think a lot of our pilots <i>like</i> how cold you are with them!
-1-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=laughing,Do you have <i>any</i> idea how many of our crewmates would kill to see you zip that thing off up close and personal?
-1-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meia=seductive,Maybe it's just the antigravity, but this girl's lit a fire in my heart, Leader!  Do you think I should wear a suit like yours?
-1-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Hey, Leader, this girl's making bodysuits look good even for a woman with some meat on her.  Should I wear one?
-1-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,I think you've managed to make bodysuits boring for me, Meia.  This girl is making me want to get one now!
-1-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,Maybe I should abandon this silly dress and opt for a bodysuit like yours and Ochako's, Meia--just bare it all!  What do you say?
-1-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,I know I'm not as slender and lithe as <i>you</i>, Leader, but neither is Ochako.  Should I get myself a bodysuit?
-1-female_removed_major=teasing,Hey, ~name~, maybe I'm not out of steam after all.
-1-female_removed_major=stretching,This is saucy, even by Mejare's standards.  Not by Barnette's, though.
-1-female_removed_major=teasing,You'll have to reveal more than that to get <i>me</i> going.  Barnette dresses like skin's going out of style.
-1-female_removed_major=teasing,<i>Now</i> you're dressing like a Mejarian.  But we can lose some more, can't we?
-1-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3=laughing,Wow.  You really <i>are</i> a blueberry girl, top to bottom.  I can see why you kept the hood on.
-1-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3=interested,Just as blue on top, I see.  Maybe you should just put the hood back on until you feel better.
-1-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3=laughing,Honey, you can worry about you looks until you're blue in the face, but, uh...<i>well</i>.
-1-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3=teasing,Feeling under the weather, Raven?  You're looking a little blue--I guess that's why you had the hood on.
-1-female_removed_major,target:shego,targetStage:4=seductive,<i>Oh, my</i>!  Way to go above and beyond, honey--I thought the bodysuit was sexy enough already!
-1-female_removed_major,target:shego,targetStage:4=laughing,Who exactly are you dressing up for, dear?  This is enough sexy outfits to please an army.
-1-female_removed_major,target:shego,targetStage:4=teasing,With <i>that</i> underneath your suit, I'm impressed you can move at all...<i>you must be a real animal in bed</i>.
-1-female_removed_major,target:shego,targetStage:4=seductive,There's no stopping <i>your</i> sex appeal, honey--just look at all that!  You put the effort in.
-1-female_removed_major,target:shego,targetStage:4=stretching,I'd say you're showing a sexy side, but the suit did that already.
-1-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=awkward,That's, uh, really...<i>wow</i>.  That is a <i>lot</i> of pubic hair, to be peeking out of your thong like that...are you OK?
-1-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=angry,<i>Ew</i>.  Don't you have razors where you live?  I can see your icky pubic hair poking out from here!
-1-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=annoyed,...Were you laid up in bed recently?  Because I can see your unshaven hair from behind your thong, and <i>eugh</i>.
-1-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=angry,OK, <i>ew</i>.  Don't you <i>shave</i>, Rinkah?  Do Earth men really like all that hair?
-1-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=frustrated,...Maybe you're unaware, but Mejare is obsessed with shaving, cleanliness, and smoothness.  <i>So that's really gross</i>.
-1-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:blake,totalMales:1-2=laughing,Hey, honey, why don't we all just cool it?  You're making it clear how this girl's your ladyfriend--leave the men alone.
-1-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:blake,totalMales:1-2=seductive,My, my!  Getting a little defensive around men, are we?  I guess you Earth girls have to fight tooth and nail to keep each other.
-1-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:blake,totalMales:1-2=teasing,So you two are together, is that it?  And those <i>nasty Earth men</i> want to drive you apart?  Thanks for repping Mejare for me.
-1-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:blake,totalMales:1-2=vain,Oh, are you two a couple?  I've been going steady with Barnette for a while...though I don't feel any hatred of men because of it.
-1-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6=bored,<i>Yeesh</i>.  I'm <i>sober</i>, and this girl's making me feel woozy just looking at her.
-1-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6=teasing,Hey, honey, a girl's no fun unless she can have fun sober.  Give it a try sometime between shots.
-1-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6=confused,Seriously, though, do you have a second liver?  Where's all this booze draining into in that tiny body?
-1-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6=smug,Thank your lucky stars you didn't get a table with Meia, dear.  She'd be grilling you <i>nonstop</i> for drinking like this.
-1-female_removed_major,target:misato,targetStage:4=shocked,<i>Eek!  OK!  Never mind!  Sorry!  I shouldn't have made fun</i>!  ...How'd you <i>get</i> that?
-1-female_removed_major,target:misato,targetStage:4=awkward,...<i>Oof</i>.  What gave you <i>that</i>?  ...If you don't mind me asking.
-1-female_removed_major,target:misato,targetStage:4=confused,...Should I ask what gave you that?  Is that out of line?  Is it from the "Second Impact" thing?
-1-female_removed_major,target:misato,targetStage:4=confused,...I got injured once.  No scars, though.  What happened to you, some military mission?
-1-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,priority:0=stretching,Nice figure.  Exercise can do you the favors genetics didn't.
-1-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,priority:0=smug,I'd admire your muscles, but really, I'm a little tapped out at present.
-1-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,priority:0=stretching,Thinking of all that exercise you must get really makes me want to...sleep.
-1-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,priority:0=teasing,Judging by that figure of yours, you really know how to get the blood pumping.
-1-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5a=laughing,What is <i>that</i> supposed to be?  Look, I don't go for your creepy dungeon play.
-1-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5a=laughing,I wasn't aware other planets were into bondage...but Mejare had to get its ideas from somewhere.
-1-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5a=laughing,Planning on <i>dominating</i> us later, Vriska?  Don't tie me up for piracy, now!  <i>Heeheehee</i>!
-1-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5a=vain,Oh, dear.  That's quite the authoritative outfit for a pirate like me to be comfortable around.
-1-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:4=shocked,Wha--<i>ew</i>!  Was that in your panties?  That's gross!  Throw it out!
-1-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:4=awkward,...You're not going to <i>eat</i> that, right?  After it was in your...nether-regions?
-1-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:4=angry,...<i>Ew</i>.  Why are you sticking fruit anywhere but your mouth?  That's not funny!
-1-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:4=annoyed,...OK, this whole comedy act of yours is starting to get gross.  What's next, a tampon in your mouth?
-1-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5b=seductive,That's cute and simple!  Who's Eridan, your girlfriend?
-1-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5b=laughing,Stealing clothes from your girlfriend now, Vriska?  Is "Eridan" OK with you rooting through her wardrobe?
-1-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5b=seductive,See, that's plain and simple fashion for the masses!  Your girlfriend Eridan has some good taste in outfits.
-1-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5b=laughing,Skirt and stockings?  Simple, but sexy!  Tell this "Eridan" I like her style.  She your girlfriend?
-1-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:3=vain,Well, would you look at that!  Exactly what I wanted to see.  <i>More, please</i>!
-1-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:3=stretching,How about that?  You're finally taking my sage Mejarian advice concerning the female body.
-1-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:3=seductive,See?  There you go!  The best kind of magic is the kind that makes women's clothes disappear!
-1-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:3=laughing,Hah!  It's good to know you're listening to me.  Now do another trick and make yourself stark-naked!
-1-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5c=laughing,Getting a little skimpier than you'd like, honey?  You can't control fate, so just hope for good rolls...and leg coverage.
-1-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5c=teasing,Aww, it's not so bad!  Pants are overrated...just look at me.
-1-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5c=vain,I bet the breeze feels good on your legs now.  You're starting to see the genius of my fashion choices!
-1-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5c=laughing,Why wear pants when your shirt can cover all the essentials?  Now put on a dress and you'll be just like me.
-1-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6a=laughing,...See what I meant?  That die's got it out for you!  Better off stripping like normal, Miss Aquatic.
-1-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6a=teasing,That die's not doing you any favors anymore, darling.  Best to just strip like the rest of us...or go for another swim.
-1-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6a=laughing,Yeah, I didn't say anything before, but you <i>have</i> been cheating.  Enjoy being all soggy!
-1-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6a=laughing,Back from a swim, Vriska?  I'm <i>loving</i> this!  You're too much!
-1-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:5=interested,<i>Well</i>!  Plain-Jane's not <i>quite</i> so plain after all.  Good show.
-1-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:5=laughing,Ha!  Not bad for an Earth girl...at least you really <i>were</i> hiding something.
-1-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:5=vain,Earth girls really <i>are</i> nuts...why would you hide those beauties away?  Honestly.
-1-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:5=stretching,A plain face and huge breasts?  You're the logical conclusion of Mejare's obsession with chests.
-1-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6b=teasing,Looking more Mejarian all the time, Vriska!  Skin is always in style where I'm from.
-1-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6b=seductive,That's the fashion I know and love!  Less is more on Mejare, as they say...
-1-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6b=stretching,Now you're dressing like all the other women I know on Mejare.  <i>Bo-ring</i>.
-1-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6b=interested,Nice Mejarian look you're rocking there now.  My girlfriend tends to wear even less than that.
-1-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3=stretching,Zipping off that bodysuit leaves you looking a little mundane, doesn't it?  You walked in here all armored up and spacey-looking.
-1-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3=seductive-2,We're not quite as exotic without our fancy Mejarian outfits, are we?  My dress and your suit.
-1-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3=interested,Sweaty gym underwear doesn't scream "exotic" in quite the same way as your suit, does it?
-1-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3=vain,Stripped down like this, neither of us aliens really projects the same mystery, do we?
-1-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3=seductive-2,Guess Mejarian and Earth women really aren't that different.  Sorry we spoiled the mystery, friends.
-1-female_removed_major,target:ayano,targetStage:6=shocked,Ooh, a swimsuit!  I like the beach, too--wait, are those <i>bloodstains</i>?  Uh--like, they're <i>yours</i>, right?
-1-female_removed_major,target:ayano,targetStage:6=laughing,Ouch, honey.  Picked the worst day of the month to go swimming, didn't you?
-1-female_removed_major,target:ayano,targetStage:6=awkward,...Those are <i>your</i> bloodstains, right?  Like, from menstrual issues, or something?
-1-female_removed_major,target:ayano,targetStage:6=thinking,Seems Earth women haven't quite nailed down how to track their own menstrual cycles.  Why do we have those, anyway?
-1-female_removed_major,target:faye,targetStage:5=interested,Oh.  Might as well have gone through with it, dearie--you've already embarrassed yourself by trying.
-1-female_removed_major,target:faye,targetStage:5=teasing,No use saving face now, honey--unless you think the makeup does that.
-1-female_removed_major,target:faye,targetStage:5=smug,Hey, don't let <i>my</i> complaints stop you.  You've already lost the respect of the table, darling.
-1-female_removed_major,target:faye,targetStage:5=teasing,What a sore loser.  Can't quite keep up the tease when you've got to answer for it, huh?  <i>Try me</i>.

0-male_chest_will_be_visible=seductive,Now <i>this</i> I came to see.  A man's <i>muscles</i>...
0-male_chest_will_be_visible=interested,Now <i>here's</i> a reveal worth coming to see.  Women's chests are all too familiar to me.
0-male_chest_will_be_visible=teasing,The men I know are soldiers, ~name~.  So your muscles better measure up to my standards.
0-male_chest_will_be_visible=laughing,I hear men have it so easy getting in shape...mostly from Meia, with a jealous look in her eye.
0-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:link=bored,...<i>Nin-ten-doh</i>?  <i>Character</i>?  This guy's <i>nuts</i>...I better avoid his seed.
0-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:link=interested,...That was a <i>character</i>?  Yeah, I can see why you're playing to strangers in a dump like this.
0-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:link=laughing,You were doing a <i>character</i>?  Is that what men connect to, a grunting buffoon?
0-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:link=laughing,I'm sorry, you <i>broke</i> character?  That implies there <i>was</i> one, dear.  You know, with emotions and speech.
0-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=interested,Ooh, does little Angel-boy want to go topless?  I hear you men don't treat that with quite the concern <i>we</i> do.
0-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=seductive,I've <i>never</i> seen men naked before, Pit...<i>won't you get your chest out</i>?  I hear men don't care about that anyway.
0-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=teasing,Is it true that men get topless all the time?  I want to see if Mr. Angel is rocking any <i>muscles</i> beneath his stammering.
0-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=seductive,Oh, please, Mr. Angel, I'm <i>desperate</i> to see a man nude...can't you show me your chest?  Men don't mind that, right?
0-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=teasing,So, Little Dungeon Bot...are you built <i>exactly</i> like a man?
0-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=seductive,I'm so dreadfully uninformed about men's bodies, 9S.  Is your artificial body a good enough substitute?
0-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=teasing,You're a little shy about being fake, right?  Well...here's your chance to show me you're a <i>real</i> boy.
0-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=seductive,Can an android really satisfy my unending curiosity about men's muscles?  Give it a shot, honey.
0-male_chest_will_be_visible,alsoPlaying:meia=seductive,Now <i>this</i> I came to see.  A man's <i>muscles</i>...
0-male_chest_will_be_visible,alsoPlaying:meia=interested,Now <i>here's</i> a reveal worth coming to see.  Women's chests are all too familiar to me.
0-male_chest_will_be_visible,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,The men I know are soldiers, ~name~.  So your muscles better measure up to my standards.
0-male_chest_will_be_visible,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Don't men have an easy time getting in shape?  That makes Meia here <i>quite</i> incensed, with how hard she works in the gym.
0-male_chest_is_visible=teasing,Ooh, you didn't disappoint, ~name~!  Men gain muscle like it's nothing.
0-male_chest_is_visible=confused,So what's with the nipples?  I mean, I can't picture a man breastfeeding.
0-male_chest_is_visible=vain,I don't think women <i>have</i> those muscles.  Good show.
0-male_chest_is_visible=laughing,So what else is on the menu for me?  That tube of yours, I hope.
0-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=confused,...Wait, I thought men had nipples.  Did I read that wrong?  I was mostly staring at their abs.
0-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=angry,...Are you pulling my leg?  Do men have nipples or not?  Did your makers just forget them?
0-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=confused,...Did your creators run out of budget when it came to your nipples, or do men just not have them?
0-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=confused,Uh, you seem to be missing something there, dear.  Or...do men not have nipples?  How do they breastfeed?
0-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=confused,Oh, men wear the same underwear we do?  Well, why won't our prisoners show me theirs, then?
0-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=confused,...Are you <i>sure</i> you're not a woman, dear?  Because that underwear looks pretty feminine...unless men and women share styles.
0-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=laughing,Uh...wow.  I really thought men and women would wear different underwear.  Women know better than to tear it up, you know?
0-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=vain,Do men really wear the same underwear women do?  Not that <i>I</i> own any lingerie...pirates can't afford much.
0-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=smug,Interesting choice of underwear, sweetheart.  <i>Women</i> wear that...I wouldn't think men would.  Too delicate for them.
0-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=teasing,Oh, that's...not so bad!  About as many muscles as they had in that book I read...though your height leaves something to be desired.
0-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=teasing,Not bad, honey, but I expected a little better from such a tiny man.  Doesn't being short make gaining muscle easier?
0-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=vain,Oh, don't feel <i>too</i> bad.  Hibiki is short, and he's not too ripped either...even though he'd be much more handsome that way.
0-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=stretching,Nothing to be embarrassed about, dear.  Well, maybe your <i>height</i> is.  Work on that instead.
0-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=confused,...OK, now I'm <i>really</i> confused.  Men can have breasts?  You're not all that fat.
0-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=bored,...I don't think you're a person at this point.  A man with breasts?  What a horrifying sight...
0-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=angry,OK, seriously.  Breasts on a man?  What the hell are you?  Besides totally gross.
0-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=frustrated,...I really thought breasts separated men and women pretty cleanly.  Then again, you don't seem human at all.
0-male_crotch_will_be_visible=stretching,Dear, dear.  A man's penis on display.  The scandal of it all!
0-male_crotch_will_be_visible=teasing,You can't faze <i>me</i>, Earth-man.  I've read books about your little friend!
0-male_crotch_will_be_visible=teasing,I've been wanting to see this all game.  Best I could get out of it, with you losing so badly.
0-male_crotch_will_be_visible=laughing,See, <i>this</i> is the beauty of this game.  I get to see a man's tube hassle-free!
0-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pit=seductive,Omigosh, Pit, are you showing your tube?  It's not a little tiny thing, is it?  I hear they can get pretty big!
0-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pit=seductive,Hey, Angel-boy...do you have a <i>man</i>-sized tube?  If so, I might just fall for your cute little winged self.
0-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pit=teasing,Normally I go for tall, strong men...but Hibiki's short like you, and he's kind of cute like you, too.  Do you have a decent-sized tube?
0-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pit=teasing,It's my understanding men's tubes can vary in size, Pit.  I'm willing to overlook shortness in a man if he puts his girth elsewhere.
0-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=stretching,Well, since you're not exactly fully equipped up above, I'm not expecting much.
0-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=smug,Did your creators spend any more time developing a full tube for you, dear?  I hope so.
0-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=teasing,I've learned not to trust androids' anatomy, considering last time.  What's your situation <i>downstairs</i>?
0-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=seductive,I know you're artificial, but <i>please</i> try to teach me something about men this time, OK?
0-male_small_crotch_is_visible=awkward,Uh...you're <i>unusually</i> small, right?
0-male_small_crotch_is_visible=thinking,I wonder if Hibiki is that small.  Would explain why he never flirts back with me...
0-male_small_crotch_is_visible=angry,...Are Earth girls into that size?  Because I'm not.
0-male_small_crotch_is_visible=laughing,Awww...it's like a little Hibiki all in itself!
0-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=excited,Ooh, it's so weird-looking...but <i>cool</i>.
0-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=laughing,It's like a funny-looking mushroom!  So <i>adorable</i>.
0-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=vain,What a weird organ.  Men just don't have the anatomical harmony that makes women such works of art.
0-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=vain,So would my nude body make your thing stand up?  Or are you actually above your instincts a little?
0-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s=seductive,Ohh, that's cute!  So it's actually accurate?  <i>Interesting</i>...
0-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s=seductive,Ooh, that <i>does</i> match what I've seen!  Maybe what I really needed from a man was some <i>artificiality</i>...
0-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s=seductive,Oho!  And it <i>works</i>?  Perhaps a <i>mechanical</i> man is what I've been searching for this whole time.
0-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s=teasing,Ooh, maybe <i>human</i> men are overrated.  What do you think, dear?  Could you satisfy a woman?
0-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=teasing,I don't have a frame of reference myself, but...that looks pretty good!  A comfortable fit...<i>if you think you can convince me</i>.
0-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=seductive,Hey, I'm not going to pretend to be an expert--and that doesn't look half bad!  Maybe I'll collect <i>your</i> seed, cutie.
0-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=seductive,Ooh, that looks perfectly manageable!  As much as I'm drawn to the burly types, you are just <i>so</i> cute...I'm considering.
0-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=vain,Looks like a decent fit, darling...maybe <i>you'll</i> give me my baby.  She'll be such a cute little girl!
0-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=seductive,Oh, that looks OK!  I'm delicate, so I was worried it might be painful to stuff inside me...<i>God</i>, you're so adorable.
0-male_large_crotch_is_visible=shocked,A--agh!  T-they're not <i>all</i> that big, right?
0-male_large_crotch_is_visible=shocked,I--uh...uh...<i>I don't think that would fit in me</i>.
0-male_large_crotch_is_visible=confused,...Have you been with Earth girls before, ~name~?  ...Are they still alive?
0-male_large_crotch_is_visible=shocked,Eep!  There's a weird growth on your tube!  ...<i>That's</i> your tube?
0-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=awkward,...You're an <i>outlier</i>, right, Ryu?  Or does all that fighting make a man's thing grow?
0-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=shocked,<i>Eek!  I--I take it back!  Don't touch me with that thing--I don't care about your muscles</i>!
0-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=shocked,<i>Eek</i>!  Y-you can't put that thing inside me!  It'd kill me before your muscles did!
0-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=awkward,That's, uh...a little oversized.  Maybe you could just squeeze me with your muscles and we could have sex that way?
0-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=angry,...OK, I know how big it's <i>supposed</i> to be.  You're just a weird freak imitation of a man.
0-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=shocked,<i>Aaaack!  Help!  W-what is that thing?  That's not a--a tube, a penis, whatever</i>!
0-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=bored,...You're <i>definitely</i> not a man.  I come from a planet of women, and still I know that for sure.
0-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=shocked,<i>Eeeek!  Y-you're a monster, not a man!  G-get away from me!  Keep your tube</i>!
0-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=frustrated,...Are you the <i>average</i> size?  Because I retract anything I said about having sex with men, then.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible=stretching,Come on, ~name~.  Mine are pretty much on display all the time.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible=laughing,Don't you feel ashamed, reprsenting your home planet so poorly in this game of wits?
0-female_chest_will_be_visible=stretching,Oh look, a woman's breasts.  Never seen <i>those</i> before.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible=stretching,Could it be?  A woman's bare breasts?  How exotic.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=laughing,<i>Well, Meia?  Are you going to do it, with my hungry eyes boring into you</i>?
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=interested,You heard Elizabeth, Leader.  Are you going to show your breasts to your second-in-command?
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=stretching,Liz is right, Meia--this is very awkward.  It's only, what, the hundredth time I've seen you naked?
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=stretching,<i>Oh, my!  Not Meia's breasts!  Oh, Elizabeth, why must you remind me of this horror</i>?
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=bored,...Or she's just going to strip part of the stems.  Apparently this place has no rules at all.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=bored,...Or that could happen.  I swear, you could count each of your fingers as a layer in this dump...
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=annoyed,...I doll myself up for this evening on a foreign planet, and Little Miss Forest Sprite goes around counting flowers as layers.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=frustrated,...OK, yeah.  It was funny for one round, but that's not clothing.  This girl's a bigger tease than I am.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=smug,With my pilot's keen eye for patterns, I'm guessing the bra isn't coming off <i>this</i> time, either.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=teasing,My instincts are finely honed from piloting, you know.  I see those little things you still have!
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=stretching,Oh, please.  You've got that hat, the nose, the tie, and you think I'm buying the bra after <i>last</i> time?
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=stretching,Just get the trick over with, Whiteface.  I see about three different ways you could avoid the bra, and I'm just glancing.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=stretching,Should have expected as much from Miss Grape-flavored over here.  She's going to strip totally backwards, isn't she?
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=teasing,I don't know what I expected.  Your stripping order's got us all on the edge of our seats!
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=stretching,I like to tease...Miss Grape-flavored here just likes to get to the point.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=laughing,Men seem pretty simple and stupid.  I bet they like how you just skip to the good stuff.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:felicia=shocked,Wait, you really <i>are</i> a cat?  Like, that's <i>fur</i>?
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:felicia=shocked,Wait, you're <i>real</i>?  H-how does that work?  Did Earth crossbreed cats and women?
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:felicia=shocked,<i>Eeek</i>!  T-that's <i>real</i> fur?  You're a cat?  Omigosh!
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:felicia=shocked,Wait, I thought that was just skimpy clothing?  You're <i>really</i> a cat?  And it's fur?  B-but how?
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=interested,I guess firing straight up makes it a little easier to hit your mark.  Must be a breeze for you.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=seductive,You sure are confident.  I know I <i>act</i> that way, but you really put your money where your mouth is.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=vain,I'm really no good with weapons at all...ground combat is an awful mess.  That's why my Dread is so fun to pilot!
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=teasing,You're still so cool.  But with this sort of thing, maybe it's best not to push your luck...
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=interested,What are you planning, Miss Pixie?  You've got a mischievous look in your eye...well, more mischievous than usual.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=interested,You look like you're plotting something, Kyu.  Mind making it known to the rest of us?
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=teasing,Hey, Miss Pixie.  Stop going on about nonsense like usual and show those cute fairy breasts of yours.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=smug,What are you on about now?  Stop stalling for time and show your chest, Miss Pixie.  I don't have all evening.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=laughing,Wait, your breasts are out already?  Even <i>I</i> brought some accessories to stave it off!
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=interested,Wow, you athletes get straight to the point, don't you?  This is your second loss!
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=interested,I know you're proud of your strength, honey, but wearing a lot of clothes is what wins games here.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=stretching,Well, that was fast.  Not wearing much?  I guess athletes can't help but try to set new best times.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:vriska=stretching,There she goes again.  Some girls never learn...even if they've got magical dice.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:vriska=interested,The gimmick's played out, honey.  You can just be normal like the rest of us.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:vriska=teasing,It doesn't matter how brilliant your light show is, darling...people only get dazzled once.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:vriska=smug,You'd be surprised what humans can get used to, dear.  This isn't impressive anymore.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=annoyed,Wonderful.  Yes.  Worth the wait.  I've never seen breasts before.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=awkward,Those...actually look pretty normal.  I'm surprised.  I thought they'd have teeth marks.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=awkward,...OK.  Maybe you were just kidding about that public-use stuff.  Those look fine...
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=angry,I was worried there...OK.  So you were mostly kidding about getting screwed in public.  That's not funny!
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia=laughing,I can only imagine how embarrassing this must be.  Losing <i>and</i> having to show off the breasts you're so neurotic about.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia=vain,Well, hey, Meia.  At least <i>mine</i> haven't wowed everyone yet.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia=laughing,You going to be OK, Meia?  I know how much you hate losing...and your chest size.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia=interested,Feeling insecure?  I mean, you shouldn't be, but this is <i>you</i> we're talking about.
0-female_small_chest_is_visible=seductive,Well, aren't those just the cutest little things!  How'd a kid like you sneak in here, anyway?
0-female_small_chest_is_visible=awkward,Wow.  Earth girls <i>get</i> that small?  Now I just feel bad for you.
0-female_small_chest_is_visible=laughing,Just as big as Paiway's.  You know, our eleven-year-old nurse.
0-female_small_chest_is_visible=interested,Wow, you're a kid and you snuck in here?  The Nirvana could use gutsy girls like you.
0-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:videl=laughing,Using your hair to cover them?  That gives me an idea...but it's not quite what <i>you</i> came up with.
0-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:videl=stretching,Come on, sweetie, those are cute!  Don't cover them up with your hair...actually, that gives me an idea.
0-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:videl=vain,Is that why you have those cute little pigtails?  Modesty just holds the strong woman back...and you've just given me an idea.
0-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:videl=seductive,Oh, are you using your pigtails to cover them?  Clever...and it's just made me think of a great little maneuver of my own.
0-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:7b=interested,Something the matter, dear?  Run out of cute outfits to hide your...well, <i>lack</i> of breasts?
0-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:7b=laughing,...Yeah, I'd try not to strip normally if <i>those</i> were all I had.
0-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:7b=laughing,Aww, don't feel bad.  Those pants are cute...they clash with the blue of your flat chest.
0-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:7b=vain,Well, now I can see why you were shy.  But a woman should stand proud!  ...Hard to say that when there's no flat Mejarians.
0-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:7a=laughing,You roll a die that could give you an outfit like <i>that</i>, and you get embarrassed?  Honestly...
0-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:7a=laughing,Aww, what are you so embarrassed about, darling?  Well, I guess that bikini is supposed to be stretched a little.
0-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:7a=interested,Not filling up that bikini quite how you want to, dear?  Is that why you're blushing?
0-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:7a=laughing,Cute little blue nipples you've got there.  Too bad you don't have the breasts behind them to fill that bikini.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible=vain,A healthy size...you know, for an Earth woman.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible=stretching,<i>Ho-hum</i>.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible=interested,Just gonna let them dangle like you don't know what to do with them?  Earth girls have to learn how get women going.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible=vain,Barnette's are about the same...but hers are filled with <i>love</i>.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia=vain,Aren't they wonderful?  Not that you'll ever admit it, but then you're all incensed about losing.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia=interested,I really didn't picture this at all.  I figured I'd lose, you'd maybe get tagged once or twice, and we'd see a man nude and go home.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia=stretching,I feel really bad about you losing like this.  I swear I didn't set this up as a prank or anything.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia=laughing,Didn't picture you getting nude, Meia, or at least me being clothed when you did.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=teasing,I'm telling you, Barnette is <i>always</i> dragging me to the firing range.  You two would be smitten!  ...Maybe I better keep her away from you.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=smug,It's nothing but <i>guns this, ammo that</i> with my girlfriend.  I better not bring you to the Nirvana, or she'll leave me for you.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=interested,I better engage more with Barnette's gun hobby.  One look at you and she'd toss me to the curb.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=vain,Maybe I should try to have more in common with Barnette.  She loves those icky men's guns as much as you do...she's got a whole collection.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=bored,And she just keeps prattling on...<i>mine</i> are much better.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=bored,Should I stop teasing with her around, or just do it harder so she knows how to do it properly?
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=annoyed,...Look, they're not <i>that</i> great, OK?  Just shut up already...
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=annoyed,And they say <i>I</i> have an ego.  Mine are bigger than that and I don't go on about them this much!
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=excited,Wha--<i>oh my gosh</i>!  <i>Magic</i>?  Do it again!  That was so cool!
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=excited,What did you--<i>ooh!  Ooh</i>!  You really <i>are</i> a fairy!  Show me some more magic!
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=excited,Omigosh!  You weren't kidding around!  Magic is so cool!  Do something else!
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=teasing,...Oh my God.  <i>Magic</i>?  Well, then...what <i>else</i> can you do, hm?
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:6=awkward,...Huh.  At this point I really have no clue what you're going for.  Maybe I'd understand if Mejare had clowns.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:6=bored,...This <i>clowning</i> business is strange.  No wonder the colonists didn't want any on Mejare.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:6=frustrated,...Clowns really are full of surprises...but I'm more baffled than entertained.  If only I grew up around some.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:6=bored,...You should know that, on the planet I come from, clowns seem to be extinct.  Just some...food for thought.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=teasing,Oh!  Well, that's as good as the alternative, I suppose.  <i>I'm starting to see through the pretenses here</i>.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=smug,These tricks are really getting desperate, dear.  But hey, I think I'm starting to get what your <i>real</i> job is.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=laughing,Hey, I know what a stripper is.  If clown is just a fancy term for that on Earth, this is all going to make more sense.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=interested,...Honey, are you just a stripper in fancy makeup?  You'd be much better off dropping these silly tricks and just moving your hips a little.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=interested,How many times do you plan on revealing those things before it takes?  They're just breasts, woman.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=frustrated,You're more neurotic than even Meia when it comes to those things.  Practically had to hold you down to get you to show them.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=interested,At least they're finally out.  With how you've been acting, I thought you had a chunk of them missing or something.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=vain,Earth girls are so ridiculously conservative.  I've got breasts just like you, and you're worried about me seeing the damn things.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=laughing,<i>Awww, is Little Miss Princess embarrassed?  Should I get you some warm milk and a servant girl</i>?
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=interested,Is something the matter, honey?  Are your delicate princess breasts all mangled up by men?
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=teasing,Got something to hide, Princess Dearest?  Afraid to bare them to the big, bad pirate lady?
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=laughing,What's the matter, darling?  Afraid this pirate will take your breasts and put up a ransom?
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=smug,I don't have to, dear.  Meia's already convinced they do.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=interested,It doesn't matter how many compliments you pay to her breasts, honey.  She's a total head case about them.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=stretching,Oh, I've told her many times that her breasts are just fine.  Nothing penetrates her ridiculuous neuroses.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=smug,If I did, I'd just be confirming what Meia already inexplicably believes.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=interested,You really like showing off the goods, don't you?  Going to cover them up with other things so you can keep on doing it?
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=laughing,It's the exposure you prefer more than the exhibitionism, isn't it?  You just like the reveal!
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=stretching,There's just no stopping you, honey...well, maybe when you run out of clothes.  How tragic will <i>that</i> be?
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=laughing,What is <i>up</i> with this girl?  You really know how to blow through an audience's attention.
0-female_large_chest_is_visible=vain,Mine have the <i>shape</i> to match their wonderful size.
0-female_large_chest_is_visible=interested,You're a regular Mejarian with a chest like <i>that</i>, ~name~.
0-female_large_chest_is_visible=seductive,People treat you so much better with breasts like ours, wouldn't you agree, ~name~?
0-female_large_chest_is_visible=teasing,Nothing gets you quite so far in life like a wonderful pair of breasts.  Oops, don't tell Meia I said that.
0-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:velma=laughing,<i>Aww, is someone blind without her glasses</i>?  Just crawl on the floor until you find them, then.
0-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:velma=smug,Don't worry, dear, I won't get in the way.  You can crawl around <i>all you want</i> as you search for them.
0-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:velma=teasing,The game must go on, dearie!  Don't worry, I'll enjoy the view of your butt sticking out as you search the floor.
0-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:velma=teasing,Yeah, Parfet needs her glasses, too.  She's in better shape, though--go get some exercise crawling around looking for them.
0-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=teasing,I see you're lugging quite a lot in back, too.  Must make your legs pretty strong!
0-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=seductive,<i>Well, now</i>!  I can see why you wanted to be naked--just look at the size of that thing!  But you wear it well.
0-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=smug,Yeah, yeah.  You've got enough in back for a whole extra woman, honey...but it's pretty fantastic, I'll concede.
0-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=seductive,<i>Oh, my</i>!  You could stare at that thing for hours and find new details.  Is it all muscle or all fat?
0-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=laughing,I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and guess that thing's from squatting, not too much candy.
0-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia=shocked,Mejare only has animals in zoos--I guess they never wanted us to see them breed with the males.  This is crazy!
0-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia=seductive,I've...never seen a cat up close.  Are those claws real, too?  Where'd you come from?
0-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia=excited,Seeing a real cat is...it's nuts!  Mejare has almost no animals at all!
0-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia=excited,Omigosh, omigosh, omigosh!  Cats are so cool--I've never seen one until now, not up close!
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible=teasing,So, does living around Earth men and their tubes loosen you up at all?
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible=teasing,Not sure I want to see a vagina those boorish men have regular access to.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible=teasing,Come on, ~name~, give us a show that'd send a hundred Tarakkians running for the hills.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible=laughing,The big reveal...and a Tarakkian's worst nightmare.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=vain,I can respect a woman going bottomless.  Bare breasts have a tendency to just swing around all ungainly-like...tough for an athlete.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=teasing,Bottomless first?  Yeah, that fits your athletic attitude to keep your breasts all wrapped up tight.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=stretching,You gym rats and your worries about your breasts hitting you in the face or something.  Exercise ruins everything!
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=smug,Of course the athlete goes bottomless.  She's worried her bare breasts will throw her off-balance.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:vriska=stretching,But maybe you'll prove us all wrong.  Go right ahead.  More fashion for me.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:vriska=teasing,I'm waiting for you to stick it to me, Vriska.  I certainly <i>want</i> to see more cute outfits.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:vriska=teasing,Going to prove my predictions wrong?  If so, more fashion for me...I win either way.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:vriska=vain,By all means, deliver more adorable outfits upon me.  I don't care if you win.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=laughing,Oh, we've seen each other naked once or twice.  A day.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=interested,Well, Meia?  Have I seen your <i>you-know-what</i>?  Or do you not know what <i>it</i> is?
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=laughing,Don't ask me how you managed to come here if you can barely spit out the word <i>vagina</i>.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=interested,The most important question of the night, isn't it, Leader?  Your <i>you-know-what</i> is such a mystery.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato=seductive,You're my kind of woman, Misato...sexually confident.  Can you teach me about men sometime?
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato=seductive,You really know your way around Earth men, Misato--you're not shy at all!  You've got to teach me.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato=vain,Not to call you <i>easy</i>, dear, but you seem pretty experienced with these men...and confident.  <i>Teach me your ways</i>.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato=seductive,I can never get a man to like me, and yet you seem so experienced and confident.  What's your secret, Miss Military?
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=seductive,I'll freely admit to being enchanted--mostly from those flowers.  You only ever see that stuff in gardens on Mejare.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=vain,Must be nice sprouting flowers wherever you go.  They're so rare on Mejare...I wish I could give some to Barnette.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=vain,Flowers are so romantic and sweet-smelling...maybe you're too accustomed to it, but they're a rarity on Mejare.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=vain,You Earth girls are so spoiled when it comes to flowers.  You know how hard it is to start up a garden on Mejare?  We barely have plants!
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=laughing,Whoa, whoa, whoa, <i>what</i>?  Honey, that comes at the <i>end</i>!  Give us something to look forward to!
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=interested,Uh...honey, that comes last, usually.  Were you raised in isolation?  Do you not know what audiences like?
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=interested,...You're supposed to keep the audience guessing, dear.  This is certainly a curveball, but now you've got no surprises.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=laughing,Wait, <i>what</i>?  Hey, are you trying to be boring for the rest of the game?  Have some suspense!
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=vain,Thinking about this again, I don't think I'd want to learn how to shoot like you do...or at least destroy my outfits with it.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=thinking,Do I <i>have</i> an outfit I'd be willing to destroy just for the spectacle?  I'd have to buy some rags for the occasion.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=stretching,I think I'd just <i>die</i> if I tried this.  Not from the bullets, but from seeing my wonderful dress in tatters.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=vain,You really are something else, Aimee.  You'd never catch <i>me</i> tearing up my beautiful wardrobe like that.  I'd have to steal more!
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=seductive,Oh, good.  Now you'd fit right in where I'm from!  Shaved is so much cuter.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=vain,Well, you might be a kitty-cat, but at least you know when enough is enough.  See, Mejare likes to be smooth and sleek.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=teasing,Cleanliness is a virtue on my planet!  So I like this shaving approach, Miss Kitty.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=laughing,Hey, take all the hair away!  This kitty needs to see the sun, after all.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=laughing,Well, that seals it.  You're a total nymph...disguised as an innocent little dork.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=stretching,It's always the dorky ones, isn't it?  I bet Parfet's a real wild child...Barnette and I are so dreadfully vanilla.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=vain,Being all sheltered must do this to nerdy types.  Barnette and I just kiss and hold hands like the pure angels we are.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=interested,This must be the only thrill you've gotten in years.  You nerdy types are so predictably dirty.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=vain,Reading too much must mess with nerd girls' sexualities.  One medical book got me obsessed with men, after all.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=vain,Panties first, you dorky little thing?  This must be thrilling for you...<i>I</i> can appreciate the warmth of a loving relationship.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia=smug,At least you're not bitter about it.  Even <i>I'd</i> be, a little bit.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia=smug,Good to see you taking this in stride.  Gotta keep a cool head out there, what with the Harvest and all.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia=vain,Guess we can always count on you to keep your composure, Meia.  <i>You're so cool</i>!
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia=teasing,Even as you strip in public, you keep your head on straight.  <i>That's our Leader</i>!
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=teasing,Ooh, <i>bottomless</i>?  Maybe Earth women value their breasts more than I thought they did.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=vain,Breasts out last, huh, Mia?  I guess you Earth girls want to protect them...we Mejarians feel the same way about our wombs.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=vain,Oh, are you saving the chest for last?  I can understand...my breasts mean a lot to me, too.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=interested,Anything we should know about your breasts, dear?  You seem desperate to protect them.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=teasing,Well, how's <i>that</i> for karma?  Cover your breasts, and fate demands you show your cute little rear!  But of course, you wanted to.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=seductive,Ooh, what an adorable little behind!  Don't go and cover it, now!  <i>I know you don't really want to</i>.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=teasing,Nice and tight--you're just a tiny vixen of a girl, aren't you?  <i>Desperate</i> to strut your stuff.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=laughing,<i>Heeheeheehee</i>!  Seems fate would have you baring it all--that's what you want anyway, right?
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=shocked,Wha--<i>ew!  Ew!  EW!  What's the matter with you</i>?
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=shocked,...<i>Where's all the color</i>?
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=shocked,...What <i>are</i> you?  You need a hospital!  You need <i>Mejarian</i> medicine!
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=shocked,<i>Ack!  Ew!  Wha--what is that thing?  Ew!  Help!  Stop</i>!
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=laughing,You know you have a mask, right?  Or is Miss Wrestler actually a little shy about showing her whole face?
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=smug,I guess you're more proud of your thighs than your face, because you still have a mask.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=stretching,You really want to be naked, don't you?  Hell, you're just skipping the mask altogether.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=vain,I just realized you still have the mask.  Is it <i>that</i> important to your image?  I understand, then.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=awkward,Hey, what are you two...<i>oh, my</i>.  That might be a little much even for me and Barnette.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=shocked,Hey, are you going to put those webs to...<i>use</i>.  Oh, dear.  Barnette might not go for that.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=awkward,That... looks like a lot of rope.  I might have to rethink inviting you over for some time with me and Barnette.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=awkward,...<i>Ooh</i>.  At first I thought your webs sounded cool, but...I'm not sure Barnette would like <i>this</i> much of them.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=stretching,Honestly, dear, what was your reason for wearing that leotard?  ...Well, I guess Barnette's pretty similar.  Must be how it feels.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=teasing,That leotard's pretty <i>tight</i>, honey.  Just digging up into you...my Barnette dresses the same way.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=vain,I can understand loving the way leotards feel downstairs.  My girlfriend wears something <i>just</i> like it.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=teasing,I <i>may</i> have tried on Barnette's outfit once...so I know how that leotard must be digging into your nether regions.
0-female_crotch_is_visible=vain,Ah, women's groins.  The great equalizer, provided you bathe regularly.
0-female_crotch_is_visible=teasing,Not half bad.  Any idea how to treat it right, though?
0-female_crotch_is_visible=smug,Stay beautiful, ~name~.  Best advice there is to give.
0-female_crotch_is_visible=thinking,I wonder if Dita shaves hers?  Never got a good look, but she certainly idolizes those hairy alien men.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=shocked,Oh my God.  You weren't kidding.  You really <i>are</i> some kind of public whore.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=frustrated,...I'm gonna go home now and tell Barnette I love her.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=frustrated,...Earth is a scary planet.  I just wanted to have a little fun.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=shocked,...I swear I don't act like this.  I just think flirting is fun!  I have a girlfriend, honest!
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=seductive,Still as cute as a button!  Why you'd want to hide that body, I can only wonder...
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=teasing,Must be the neuroses of a royal that made you ashamed of your body.  No other explanation...you're <i>cute</i>.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=seductive,Ohhh, you're like a little chestnut of adorableness!  Why'd you hide your body from me, huh, sweetie?
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=seductive,You barely look a day into womanhood, darling.  It's hard to find you erotic when I just want to <i>squeeze</i> you instead!
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:0-9=vain,I should hope so!  She doesn't do all those squats in the gym because she thinks it's fun...or maybe she does, who knows.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:0-9=vain,Of course I would.  My Leader is more of a steal than she cares to admit!
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:0-9=teasing,Hey, it's not a lack of beauty that keeps Meia single--it's a lack of smiling.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:0-9=stretching,Of course I agree, honey.  The trouble is getting <i>Meia</i> to do so, the neurotic little thing she is.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=shocked,<i>Eek!  No!  I-I was just joking!  Don't use your magic</i>!
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=shocked,<i>Ack!  M-magic?  I'm sorry I made fun of you</i>!
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=shocked,<i>Wait, no!  You're very decent!  Extremely decent!  I'm sorry</i>!
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=shocked,<i>Wait!  Stop!  D-don't shoot, or cast anything, or whatever</i>!
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma=smug,Maybe I'm judging you too harshly.  <i>I've</i> considered going commando beneath the dress...
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma=interested,I guess I'm not much more covered under the dress, huh?  Perhaps we're more similar than I realized.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma=smug,Yeah, this is definitely giving you a thrill.  I wonder if <i>I'd</i> get the same sensation walking around in just the dress.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma=teasing,My dress is pretty much the only thing that covers me, too...<i>maybe we should swap</i>.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=awkward,What are you--oh, dear.  That's <i>one</i> way to get off.  Is this how your "darlin'" does it?
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=interested,I have a "darlin'," too...her name is Barnette.  And she doesn't ask me to graze her crotch with bullets.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=laughing,I guess when you can shoot your own clothes off, this is the kind of thing you need to do to reach orgasm.  Is your "darlin'" a good shot, too?
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=laughing,These Earth girls just keep getting more depraved.  Your "darlin'" being a man must have done this to you, you poor thing.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia=laughing,What would Valore think of you, exposing yourself like this?
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia=laughing,I don't think Valore would have such a crush on you if she knew you were an exhibitionist, Meia.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia=teasing,Hey, Meia, I hear Valore is single, too...I bet <i>she'd</i> like a good look at you right now.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia=laughing,Good enough for Valore's standards, you think?  She's totally got a crush on you.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=seductive,Well, now!  We Mejarians like our hair...but not <i>there</i>.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=laughing,Hey, I wear my hair pretty long...but it doesn't go <i>that</i> far down.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=interested,Don't your teeth get tangled in all that?  Oh, wait, men probably don't even bother with that, do they?
0-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=interested,Pubic hair?  Wasn't expecting <i>that</i> from our Earthling sisters.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:vriska=laughing,<i>Come now, darling</i>!  I think that suits you just fine...technically covered, but people can see right past.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:vriska=interested,You're not <i>complaining</i> now, are you?  What, because you have to play fair like the rest of us?
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:vriska=teasing,I thank you once again for the wonderful look at outfits across the universe.  But this pirate's done with you now.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:vriska=teasing,That's what happens when you play against a pirate, sweetie.  She strips you down eventually.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=interested,Oh hey, your partner's stripping, too.  Just here for moral support, or are you two lovers?
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=teasing,Did you really need help stripping, dear?  Or did you <i>want</i> her to strip you, you little lovebird?
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=vain,So you've totally got a crush on this girl, right?  I get it...I would've asked Barnette to strip me if she were here.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=thinking,Maybe I should've brought <i>my</i> girlfriend here with me, too...nah, she wouldn't have gone for it.  She needs to lighten up.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=interested,Nothing else, huh?  Why'd you even play this game without dressing up?
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=smug,Well, that didn't take long.  One wonders why you came to a strip poker joint just to practice personal hygiene.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=seductive,And...everything else is part of your body?  Absolutely crazy...but kind of cute.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=interested,You're a weird one, dear.  Let your hair grow out, then shave it...come to strip poker, don't wear anything.


#lost rapier
1-male_chest_will_be_visible=seductive,You know, ~name~, ever since I got a hold of that medical book, I've been <i>very</i> interested in men...
1-male_chest_will_be_visible=teasing,I hear men can get pretty buff...pretty easily.  Are you any proof of that?
1-male_chest_will_be_visible=interested,Is this what men spend all their time improving?  Their muscles instead of their brains?
1-male_chest_will_be_visible=laughing,As titillating as it is, shouldn't you have gotten me naked so I could enjoy it better?
1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=teasing,So, Little Dungeon Bot...are you built <i>exactly</i> like a man?
1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=seductive,I'm so dreadfully uninformed about men's bodies, 9S.  Is your artificial body a good enough substitute?
1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=teasing,You're a little shy about being fake, right?  Well...here's your chance to show me you're a <i>real</i> boy.
1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=seductive,Can an android really satisfy my unending curiosity about men's muscles?  Give it a shot, honey.
1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:link=bored,...<i>Nin-ten-doh</i>?  <i>Character</i>?  This guy's <i>nuts</i>...I better avoid his seed.
1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:link=interested,...That was a <i>character</i>?  Yeah, I can see why you're playing to strangers in a dump like this.
1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:link=laughing,You were doing a <i>character</i>?  Is that what men connect to, a grunting buffoon?
1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:link=laughing,I'm sorry, you <i>broke</i> character?  That implies there <i>was</i> one, dear.  You know, with emotions and speech.
1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=interested,Ooh, does little Angel-boy want to go topless?  I hear you men don't treat that with quite the concern <i>we</i> do.
1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=seductive,I've <i>never</i> seen men naked before, Pit...<i>won't you get your chest out</i>?  I hear men don't care about that anyway.
1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=teasing,Is it true that men get topless all the time?  I want to see if Mr. Angel is rocking any <i>muscles</i> beneath his stammering.
1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=seductive,Oh, please, Mr. Angel, I'm <i>desperate</i> to see a man nude...can't you show me your chest?  Men don't mind that, right?
1-male_chest_is_visible=seductive,Ooh...I bet Duero looks like that, too, being a soldier and all.
1-male_chest_is_visible=seductive,Ooh...I think Bart looks like that, too.  Sometimes you can catch glimpses of him naked when he's piloting.
1-male_chest_is_visible=seductive,I bet you could lift a lot...could you lift <i>me</i>?
1-male_chest_is_visible=excited,Mmm...can't even think of anything coy to say.
1-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=teasing,Oh, that's...not so bad!  About as many muscles as they had in that book I read...though your height leaves something to be desired.
1-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=teasing,Not bad, honey, but I expected a little better from such a tiny man.  Doesn't being short make gaining muscle easier?
1-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=vain,Oh, don't feel <i>too</i> bad.  Hibiki is short, and he's not too ripped either...even though he'd be much more handsome that way.
1-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=stretching,Nothing to be embarrassed about, dear.  Well, maybe your <i>height</i> is.  Work on that instead.
1-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=confused,Oh, men wear the same underwear we do?  Well, why won't our prisoners show me theirs, then?
1-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=confused,...Are you <i>sure</i> you're not a woman, dear?  Because that underwear looks pretty feminine...unless men and women share styles.
1-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=laughing,Uh...wow.  I really thought men and women would wear different underwear.  Women know better than to tear it up, you know?
1-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=vain,Do men really wear the same underwear women do?  Not that <i>I</i> own any lingerie...pirates can't afford much.
1-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=smug,Interesting choice of underwear, sweetheart.  <i>Women</i> wear that...I wouldn't think men would.  Too delicate for them.
1-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=confused,...Wait, I thought men had nipples.  Did I read that wrong?  I was mostly staring at their abs.
1-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=angry,...Are you pulling my leg?  Do men have nipples or not?  Did your makers just forget them?
1-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=confused,...Did your creators run out of budget when it came to your nipples, or do men just not have them?
1-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=confused,Uh, you seem to be missing something there, dear.  Or...do men not have nipples?  How do they breastfeed?
1-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=confused,...OK, now I'm <i>really</i> confused.  Men can have breasts?  You're not all that fat.
1-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=bored,...I don't think you're a person at this point.  A man with breasts?  What a horrifying sight...
1-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=angry,OK, seriously.  Breasts on a man?  What the hell are you?  Besides totally gross.
1-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=frustrated,...I really thought breasts separated men and women pretty cleanly.  Then again, you don't seem human at all.
1-male_crotch_will_be_visible=seductive,Showing your penis on <i>my</i> account?  Earth men are so sweet.
1-male_crotch_will_be_visible=laughing,Definitely the easy way to see a man's tube.  The others include pinning Hibiki down or capturing a screaming Tarakkian.
1-male_crotch_will_be_visible=vain,Most Mejarians would flee in terror at this prospect.  But Jura Basil Elden is not your average Mejarian!
1-male_crotch_will_be_visible=interested,I really thought you'd make me work for this.  Instead I get an easy victory, and a wonderful anatomy lesson.
1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=stretching,Well, since you're not exactly fully equipped up above, I'm not expecting much.
1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=smug,Did your creators spend any more time developing a full tube for you, dear?  I hope so.
1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=teasing,I've learned not to trust androids' anatomy, considering last time.  What's your situation <i>downstairs</i>?
1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=seductive,I know you're artificial, but <i>please</i> try to teach me something about men this time, OK?
1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pit=seductive,Omigosh, Pit, are you showing your tube?  It's not a little tiny thing, is it?  I hear they can get pretty big!
1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pit=seductive,Hey, Angel-boy...do you have a <i>man</i>-sized tube?  If so, I might just fall for your cute little winged self.
1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pit=teasing,Normally I go for tall, strong men...but Hibiki's short like you, and he's kind of cute like you, too.  Do you have a decent-sized tube?
1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pit=teasing,It's my understanding men's tubes can vary in size, Pit.  I'm willing to overlook shortness in a man if he puts his girth elsewhere.
1-male_small_crotch_is_visible=thinking,I wonder if Hibiki's is that small.  Would certainly match the rest of him.
1-male_small_crotch_is_visible=awkward,...Are you a <i>fully-grown</i> man?  I mean, I'm no expert on how long that takes.
1-male_small_crotch_is_visible=angry,Seriously?  That thing isn't even long enough to get me pregnant!  ...I think.
1-male_small_crotch_is_visible=annoyed,...If you're the average, men are a pretty sorry species.  Where's the visual flair?
1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=seductive,Men's tubes are so bizarre-looking...but in a very <i>good</i> way.
1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=seductive,Oh, it just stands up on its own!  So much energy in that thing...
1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=confused,So what are the egg-things in the back for?  Just to play with?
1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=laughing,Oh, my, ~name~.  How unfair of you to rob me of my sword and then unveil one of your own.
1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=teasing,I don't have a frame of reference myself, but...that looks pretty good!  A comfortable fit...<i>if you think you can convince me</i>.
1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=seductive,Hey, I'm not going to pretend to be an expert--and that doesn't look half bad!  Maybe I'll collect <i>your</i> seed, cutie.
1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=seductive,Ooh, that looks perfectly manageable!  As much as I'm drawn to the burly types, you are just <i>so</i> cute...I'm considering.
1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=vain,Looks like a decent fit, darling...maybe <i>you'll</i> give me my baby.  She'll be such a cute little girl!
1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=seductive,Oh, that looks OK!  I'm delicate, so I was worried it might be painful to stuff inside me...<i>God</i>, you're so adorable.
1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s=seductive,Ohh, that's cute!  So it's actually accurate?  <i>Interesting</i>...
1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s=seductive,Ooh, that <i>does</i> match what I've seen!  Maybe what I really needed from a man was some <i>artificiality</i>...
1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s=seductive,Oho!  And it <i>works</i>?  Perhaps a <i>mechanical</i> man is what I've been searching for this whole time.
1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s=teasing,Ooh, maybe <i>human</i> men are overrated.  What do you think, dear?  Could you satisfy a woman?
1-male_large_crotch_is_visible=shocked,I--uh--uh--you--well, I, uh...
1-male_large_crotch_is_visible=awkward,...I was teasing in expectation of something a little more manageable-looking.
1-male_large_crotch_is_visible=awkward,...Hey, I'm pretty tall, but...could that thing really fit inside me?
1-male_large_crotch_is_visible=excited,Where do you <i>get</i> all the blood for that thing?
1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=awkward,...You're an <i>outlier</i>, right, Ryu?  Or does all that fighting make a man's thing grow?
1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=shocked,<i>Eek!  I--I take it back!  Don't touch me with that thing--I don't care about your muscles</i>!
1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=shocked,<i>Eek</i>!  Y-you can't put that thing inside me!  It'd kill me before your muscles did!
1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=awkward,That's, uh...a little oversized.  Maybe you could just squeeze me with your muscles and we could have sex that way?
1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=angry,...OK, I know how big it's <i>supposed</i> to be.  You're just a weird freak imitation of a man.
1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=shocked,<i>Aaaack!  Help!  W-what is that thing?  That's not a--a tube, a penis, whatever</i>!
1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=bored,...You're <i>definitely</i> not a man.  I come from a planet of women, and still I know that for sure.
1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=shocked,<i>Eeeek!  Y-you're a monster, not a man!  G-get away from me!  Keep your tube</i>!
1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=frustrated,...Are you the <i>average</i> size?  Because I retract anything I said about having sex with men, then.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible=vain,Time to let the girls free, ~name~.  Nothing else feels quite so satisfying.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible=teasing,I know I'm a long way from doing the same, but cleavage counts for something, right?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible=vain,Oh, they're just breasts.  Quite common on Mejare, as you might imagine.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible=teasing,Don't be so dramatic.  I'm sure you're beautiful--in a way only an Earth woman can be.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:vriska=stretching,There she goes again.  Some girls never learn...even if they've got magical dice.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:vriska=interested,The gimmick's played out, honey.  You can just be normal like the rest of us.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:vriska=teasing,It doesn't matter how brilliant your light show is, darling...people only get dazzled once.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:vriska=smug,You'd be surprised what humans can get used to, dear.  This isn't impressive anymore.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=laughing,Wait, your breasts are out already?  Even <i>I</i> brought some accessories to stave it off!
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=interested,Wow, you athletes get straight to the point, don't you?  This is your second loss!
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=interested,I know you're proud of your strength, honey, but wearing a lot of clothes is what wins games here.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=stretching,Well, that was fast.  Not wearing much?  I guess athletes can't help but try to set new best times.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=annoyed,Wonderful.  Yes.  Worth the wait.  I've never seen breasts before.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=awkward,Those...actually look pretty normal.  I'm surprised.  I thought they'd have teeth marks.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=awkward,...OK.  Maybe you were just kidding about that public-use stuff.  Those look fine...
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=angry,I was worried there...OK.  So you were mostly kidding about getting screwed in public.  That's not funny!
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=interested,I guess firing straight up makes it a little easier to hit your mark.  Must be a breeze for you.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=seductive,You sure are confident.  I know I <i>act</i> that way, but you really put your money where your mouth is.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=vain,I'm really no good with weapons at all...ground combat is an awful mess.  That's why my Dread is so fun to pilot!
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=teasing,You're still so cool.  But with this sort of thing, maybe it's best not to push your luck...
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:felicia=shocked,Wait, you really <i>are</i> a cat?  Like, that's <i>fur</i>?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:felicia=shocked,Wait, you're <i>real</i>?  H-how does that work?  Did Earth crossbreed cats and women?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:felicia=shocked,<i>Eeek</i>!  T-that's <i>real</i> fur?  You're a cat?  Omigosh!
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:felicia=shocked,Wait, I thought that was just skimpy clothing?  You're <i>really</i> a cat?  And it's fur?  B-but how?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=stretching,Should have expected as much from Miss Grape-flavored over here.  She's going to strip totally backwards, isn't she?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=teasing,I don't know what I expected.  Your stripping order's got us all on the edge of our seats!
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=stretching,I like to tease...Miss Grape-flavored here just likes to get to the point.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=laughing,Men seem pretty simple and stupid.  I bet they like how you just skip to the good stuff.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=smug,With my pilot's keen eye for patterns, I'm guessing the bra isn't coming off <i>this</i> time, either.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=teasing,My instincts are finely honed from piloting, you know.  I see those little things you still have!
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=stretching,Oh, please.  You've got that hat, the nose, the tie, and you think I'm buying the bra after <i>last</i> time?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=stretching,Just get the trick over with, Whiteface.  I see about three different ways you could avoid the bra, and I'm just glancing.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=bored,...Or she's just going to strip part of the stems.  Apparently this place has no rules at all.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=bored,...Or that could happen.  I swear, you could count each of your fingers as a layer in this dump...
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=annoyed,...I doll myself up for this evening on a foreign planet, and Little Miss Forest Sprite goes around counting flowers as layers.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=frustrated,...OK, yeah.  It was funny for one round, but that's not clothing.  This girl's a bigger tease than I am.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=laughing,<i>Well, Meia?  Are you going to do it, with my hungry eyes boring into you</i>?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=interested,You heard Elizabeth, Leader.  Are you going to show your breasts to your second-in-command?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=stretching,Liz is right, Meia--this is very awkward.  It's only, what, the hundredth time I've seen you naked?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=stretching,<i>Oh, my!  Not Meia's breasts!  Oh, Elizabeth, why must you remind me of this horror</i>?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia=laughing,I can't wait.  Even in the spa, you never give us a good look.  Uncomfortable around me?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia=interested,Let me guess.  You'd rather be on patrol duty right now?  Come on, we're crewmates...be comfortable.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia=teasing,Come on, now.  You wouldn't have come here if you weren't comfortable stripping nude around me...or anyone else.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia=teasing,Your crewmate being here doesn't make you <i>uncomfortable</i>, right?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=interested,What are you planning, Miss Pixie?  You've got a mischievous look in your eye...well, more mischievous than usual.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=interested,You look like you're plotting something, Kyu.  Mind making it known to the rest of us?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=teasing,Hey, Miss Pixie.  Stop going on about nonsense like usual and show those cute fairy breasts of yours.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=smug,What are you on about now?  Stop stalling for time and show your chest, Miss Pixie.  I don't have all evening.
1-female_small_chest_is_visible=confused,...Hey, I thought kids weren't allowed here.
1-female_small_chest_is_visible=confused,Oh, so you're a man!  Why didn't you say so?
1-female_small_chest_is_visible=confused,...A man disguised as a girl?  Guess B.C.'s not the only example.
1-female_small_chest_is_visible=interested,Are you <i>sure</i> you're a woman, ~name~?  Women have <i>breasts</i>.
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:7a=laughing,You roll a die that could give you an outfit like <i>that</i>, and you get embarrassed?  Honestly...
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:7a=laughing,Aww, what are you so embarrassed about, darling?  Well, I guess that bikini is supposed to be stretched a little.
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:7a=interested,Not filling up that bikini quite how you want to, dear?  Is that why you're blushing?
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:7a=laughing,Cute little blue nipples you've got there.  Too bad you don't have the breasts behind them to fill that bikini.
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:7b=interested,Something the matter, dear?  Run out of cute outfits to hide your...well, <i>lack</i> of breasts?
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:7b=laughing,...Yeah, I'd try not to strip normally if <i>those</i> were all I had.
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:7b=laughing,Aww, don't feel bad.  Those pants are cute...they clash with the blue of your flat chest.
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:7b=vain,Well, now I can see why you were shy.  But a woman should stand proud!  ...Hard to say that when there's no flat Mejarians.
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:videl=laughing,Using your hair to cover them?  That gives me an idea...but it's not quite what <i>you</i> came up with.
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:videl=stretching,Come on, sweetie, those are cute!  Don't cover them up with your hair...actually, that gives me an idea.
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:videl=vain,Is that why you have those cute little pigtails?  Modesty just holds the strong woman back...and you've just given me an idea.
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:videl=seductive,Oh, are you using your pigtails to cover them?  Clever...and it's just made me think of a great little maneuver of my own.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible=seductive,Oh...they're the same size as my darling Barnette's.  She's such a blessing!
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible=vain,Pretty healthy for Mejarian standards.  And we hold ourselves to high standards, as you can see.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible=smug,Pretty healthy for Mejarian standards.  Of course, Meia is so hung up about those...
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible=thinking,About the same size as Meia's...that girl is just <i>determined</i> to hate her breasts.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=interested,How many times do you plan on revealing those things before it takes?  They're just breasts, woman.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=frustrated,You're more neurotic than even Meia when it comes to those things.  Practically had to hold you down to get you to show them.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=interested,At least they're finally out.  With how you've been acting, I thought you had a chunk of them missing or something.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=vain,Earth girls are so ridiculously conservative.  I've got breasts just like you, and you're worried about me seeing the damn things.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=smug,I don't have to, dear.  Meia's already convinced they do.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=interested,It doesn't matter how many compliments you pay to her breasts, honey.  She's a total head case about them.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=stretching,Oh, I've told her many times that her breasts are just fine.  Nothing penetrates her ridiculuous neuroses.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=smug,If I did, I'd just be confirming what Meia already inexplicably believes.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,alsoPlaying:meia=seductive,Oh...they're the same size as my darling Barnette's.  She's such a blessing!
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,Pretty healthy for Mejarian standards.  And we hold ourselves to high standards, as you can see.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia=seductive,There they are!  So round and healthy.  What's your issue with them again?
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia=stretching,About even with Barnette, wouldn't you say?  <i>She's</i> not all self-conscious, so why are you?
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia=laughing,Any Mejarian would be proud to have those.  Any Mejarian but <i>you</i>, Meia.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia=smug,Your pride is something else, I swear.  Your breasts are <i>fine</i>!
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=excited,Wha--<i>oh my gosh</i>!  <i>Magic</i>?  Do it again!  That was so cool!
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=excited,What did you--<i>ooh!  Ooh</i>!  You really <i>are</i> a fairy!  Show me some more magic!
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=excited,Omigosh!  You weren't kidding around!  Magic is so cool!  Do something else!
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=teasing,...Oh my God.  <i>Magic</i>?  Well, then...what <i>else</i> can you do, hm?
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=teasing,I'm telling you, Barnette is <i>always</i> dragging me to the firing range.  You two would be smitten!  ...Maybe I better keep her away from you.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=smug,It's nothing but <i>guns this, ammo that</i> with my girlfriend.  I better not bring you to the Nirvana, or she'll leave me for you.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=interested,I better engage more with Barnette's gun hobby.  One look at you and she'd toss me to the curb.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=vain,Maybe I should try to have more in common with Barnette.  She loves those icky men's guns as much as you do...she's got a whole collection.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=interested,You really like showing off the goods, don't you?  Going to cover them up with other things so you can keep on doing it?
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=laughing,It's the exposure you prefer more than the exhibitionism, isn't it?  You just like the reveal!
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=stretching,There's just no stopping you, honey...well, maybe when you run out of clothes.  How tragic will <i>that</i> be?
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=laughing,What is <i>up</i> with this girl?  You really know how to blow through an audience's attention.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:6=awkward,...Huh.  At this point I really have no clue what you're going for.  Maybe I'd understand if Mejare had clowns.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:6=bored,...This <i>clowning</i> business is strange.  No wonder the colonists didn't want any on Mejare.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:6=frustrated,...Clowns really are full of surprises...but I'm more baffled than entertained.  If only I grew up around some.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:6=bored,...You should know that, on the planet I come from, clowns seem to be extinct.  Just some...food for thought.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=bored,And she just keeps prattling on...<i>mine</i> are much better.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=bored,Should I stop teasing with her around, or just do it harder so she knows how to do it properly?
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=annoyed,...Look, they're not <i>that</i> great, OK?  Just shut up already...
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=annoyed,And they say <i>I</i> have an ego.  Mine are bigger than that and I don't go on about them this much!
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=laughing,<i>Awww, is Little Miss Princess embarrassed?  Should I get you some warm milk and a servant girl</i>?
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=interested,Is something the matter, honey?  Are your delicate princess breasts all mangled up by men?
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=teasing,Got something to hide, Princess Dearest?  Afraid to bare them to the big, bad pirate lady?
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=laughing,What's the matter, darling?  Afraid this pirate will take your breasts and put up a ransom?
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=teasing,Oh!  Well, that's as good as the alternative, I suppose.  <i>I'm starting to see through the pretenses here</i>.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=smug,These tricks are really getting desperate, dear.  But hey, I think I'm starting to get what your <i>real</i> job is.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=laughing,Hey, I know what a stripper is.  If clown is just a fancy term for that on Earth, this is all going to make more sense.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=interested,...Honey, are you just a stripper in fancy makeup?  You'd be much better off dropping these silly tricks and just moving your hips a little.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible=stretching,Nothing I don't see every morning in the mirror.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible=teasing,Don't play a game with Meia.  One look at those and she'll be giving you the stink-eye all night.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible=seductive,Oh, dear.  You might steal Barnette away from me with those things.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible=vain,Looks like Earth gravity is treating you rather nicely.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=teasing,I see you're lugging quite a lot in back, too.  Must make your legs pretty strong!
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=seductive,<i>Well, now</i>!  I can see why you wanted to be naked--just look at the size of that thing!  But you wear it well.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=smug,Yeah, yeah.  You've got enough in back for a whole extra woman, honey...but it's pretty fantastic, I'll concede.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=seductive,<i>Oh, my</i>!  You could stare at that thing for hours and find new details.  Is it all muscle or all fat?
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=laughing,I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and guess that thing's from squatting, not too much candy.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,alsoPlaying:meia=stretching,Nothing I don't see every morning in the mirror.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Don't mind the stink-eye Meia's giving you.  She's a little insecure...for reasons known only to her.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,alsoPlaying:meia=seductive,Oh, dear.  You might steal Barnette away from me with those things.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,Looks like Earth gravity is treating you rather nicely.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:velma=laughing,<i>Aww, is someone blind without her glasses</i>?  Just crawl on the floor until you find them, then.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:velma=smug,Don't worry, dear, I won't get in the way.  You can crawl around <i>all you want</i> as you search for them.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:velma=teasing,The game must go on, dearie!  Don't worry, I'll enjoy the view of your butt sticking out as you search the floor.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:velma=teasing,Yeah, Parfet needs her glasses, too.  She's in better shape, though--go get some exercise crawling around looking for them.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia=shocked,Mejare only has animals in zoos--I guess they never wanted us to see them breed with the males.  This is crazy!
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia=seductive,I've...never seen a cat up close.  Are those claws real, too?  Where'd you come from?
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia=excited,Seeing a real cat is...it's nuts!  Mejare has almost no animals at all!
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia=excited,Omigosh, omigosh, omigosh!  Cats are so cool--I've never seen one until now, not up close!
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible=vain,Nude already?  Guess Mejarians are superior in quite a few areas...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible=teasing,Hey, I like women that can put up a bit of a fight, being a pirate and all.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible=smug,Is ~name~ naked so soon?  Guess all that piloting has really sharpened my mind.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible=smug,Can't get cocky yet, ladies.  Women are capable of quite a lot when backed into a corner.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=seductive,I'll freely admit to being enchanted--mostly from those flowers.  You only ever see that stuff in gardens on Mejare.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=vain,Must be nice sprouting flowers wherever you go.  They're so rare on Mejare...I wish I could give some to Barnette.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=vain,Flowers are so romantic and sweet-smelling...maybe you're too accustomed to it, but they're a rarity on Mejare.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=vain,You Earth girls are so spoiled when it comes to flowers.  You know how hard it is to start up a garden on Mejare?  We barely have plants!
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=teasing,Well, how's <i>that</i> for karma?  Cover your breasts, and fate demands you show your cute little rear!  But of course, you wanted to.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=seductive,Ooh, what an adorable little behind!  Don't go and cover it, now!  <i>I know you don't really want to</i>.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=teasing,Nice and tight--you're just a tiny vixen of a girl, aren't you?  <i>Desperate</i> to strut your stuff.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=laughing,<i>Heeheeheehee</i>!  Seems fate would have you baring it all--that's what you want anyway, right?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=laughing,Whoa, whoa, whoa, <i>what</i>?  Honey, that comes at the <i>end</i>!  Give us something to look forward to!
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=interested,Uh...honey, that comes last, usually.  Were you raised in isolation?  Do you not know what audiences like?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=interested,...You're supposed to keep the audience guessing, dear.  This is certainly a curveball, but now you've got no surprises.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=laughing,Wait, <i>what</i>?  Hey, are you trying to be boring for the rest of the game?  Have some suspense!
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=awkward,Hey, what are you two...<i>oh, my</i>.  That might be a little much even for me and Barnette.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=shocked,Hey, are you going to put those webs to...<i>use</i>.  Oh, dear.  Barnette might not go for that.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=awkward,That... looks like a lot of rope.  I might have to rethink inviting you over for some time with me and Barnette.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=awkward,...<i>Ooh</i>.  At first I thought your webs sounded cool, but...I'm not sure Barnette would like <i>this</i> much of them.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=vain,Thinking about this again, I don't think I'd want to learn how to shoot like you do...or at least destroy my outfits with it.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=thinking,Do I <i>have</i> an outfit I'd be willing to destroy just for the spectacle?  I'd have to buy some rags for the occasion.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=stretching,I think I'd just <i>die</i> if I tried this.  Not from the bullets, but from seeing my wonderful dress in tatters.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=vain,You really are something else, Aimee.  You'd never catch <i>me</i> tearing up my beautiful wardrobe like that.  I'd have to steal more!
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=seductive,Oh, good.  Now you'd fit right in where I'm from!  Shaved is so much cuter.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=vain,Well, you might be a kitty-cat, but at least you know when enough is enough.  See, Mejare likes to be smooth and sleek.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=teasing,Cleanliness is a virtue on my planet!  So I like this shaving approach, Miss Kitty.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=laughing,Hey, take all the hair away!  This kitty needs to see the sun, after all.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=teasing,Ooh, <i>bottomless</i>?  Maybe Earth women value their breasts more than I thought they did.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=vain,Breasts out last, huh, Mia?  I guess you Earth girls want to protect them...we Mejarians feel the same way about our wombs.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=vain,Oh, are you saving the chest for last?  I can understand...my breasts mean a lot to me, too.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=interested,Anything we should know about your breasts, dear?  You seem desperate to protect them.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=laughing,You know you have a mask, right?  Or is Miss Wrestler actually a little shy about showing her whole face?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=smug,I guess you're more proud of your thighs than your face, because you still have a mask.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=stretching,You really want to be naked, don't you?  Hell, you're just skipping the mask altogether.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=vain,I just realized you still have the mask.  Is it <i>that</i> important to your image?  I understand, then.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=shocked,Wha--<i>ew!  Ew!  EW!  What's the matter with you</i>?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=shocked,...<i>Where's all the color</i>?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=shocked,...What <i>are</i> you?  You need a hospital!  You need <i>Mejarian</i> medicine!
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=shocked,<i>Ack!  Ew!  Wha--what is that thing?  Ew!  Help!  Stop</i>!
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=stretching,Honestly, dear, what was your reason for wearing that leotard?  ...Well, I guess Barnette's pretty similar.  Must be how it feels.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=teasing,That leotard's pretty <i>tight</i>, honey.  Just digging up into you...my Barnette dresses the same way.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=vain,I can understand loving the way leotards feel downstairs.  My girlfriend wears something <i>just</i> like it.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=teasing,I <i>may</i> have tried on Barnette's outfit once...so I know how that leotard must be digging into your nether regions.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=laughing,Well, that seals it.  You're a total nymph...disguised as an innocent little dork.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=stretching,It's always the dorky ones, isn't it?  I bet Parfet's a real wild child...Barnette and I are so dreadfully vanilla.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=vain,Being all sheltered must do this to nerdy types.  Barnette and I just kiss and hold hands like the pure angels we are.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=interested,This must be the only thrill you've gotten in years.  You nerdy types are so predictably dirty.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=vain,Reading too much must mess with nerd girls' sexualities.  One medical book got me obsessed with men, after all.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=vain,Panties first, you dorky little thing?  This must be thrilling for you...<i>I</i> can appreciate the warmth of a loving relationship.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:vriska=stretching,But maybe you'll prove us all wrong.  Go right ahead.  More fashion for me.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:vriska=teasing,I'm waiting for you to stick it to me, Vriska.  I certainly <i>want</i> to see more cute outfits.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:vriska=teasing,Going to prove my predictions wrong?  If so, more fashion for me...I win either way.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:vriska=vain,By all means, deliver more adorable outfits upon me.  I don't care if you win.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=laughing,Oh, we've seen each other naked once or twice.  A day.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=interested,Well, Meia?  Have I seen your <i>you-know-what</i>?  Or do you not know what <i>it</i> is?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=laughing,Don't ask me how you managed to come here if you can barely spit out the word <i>vagina</i>.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=interested,The most important question of the night, isn't it, Leader?  Your <i>you-know-what</i> is such a mystery.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=vain,I can respect a woman going bottomless.  Bare breasts have a tendency to just swing around all ungainly-like...tough for an athlete.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=teasing,Bottomless first?  Yeah, that fits your athletic attitude to keep your breasts all wrapped up tight.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=stretching,You gym rats and your worries about your breasts hitting you in the face or something.  Exercise ruins everything!
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=smug,Of course the athlete goes bottomless.  She's worried her bare breasts will throw her off-balance.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia=teasing,Any fans of hair out there, don't get your hopes up.  Mejarians have certain beauty standards even pirates subscribe to.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia=laughing,Don't get too excited when <i>my</i> time rolls around.  Mejarians all groom the same...or we try to, anyway.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia=teasing,Meia's modest, but she's all sleek and smooth and svelte, like the rest of planet Mejare.  Only hair is on her head--watch!
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia=laughing,Mejarians have hair in exactly <i>one</i> spot.  Oops, guess I just spoiled the surprise for both of us.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato=seductive,You're my kind of woman, Misato...sexually confident.  Can you teach me about men sometime?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato=seductive,You really know your way around Earth men, Misato--you're not shy at all!  You've got to teach me.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato=vain,Not to call you <i>easy</i>, dear, but you seem pretty experienced with these men...and confident.  <i>Teach me your ways</i>.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato=seductive,I can never get a man to like me, and yet you seem so experienced and confident.  What's your secret, Miss Military?
1-female_crotch_is_visible=vain,Is there anything more magnificent than a beautiful woman?  A naked one, I'd say.
1-female_crotch_is_visible=vain,Out of all the universe's miracles, a beautiful woman is the most wonderful.
1-female_crotch_is_visible=laughing,How often do you masturbate, ~name~?  Because I'm about to bring up the average.
1-female_crotch_is_visible=laughing,Tarakkians would have you believe spiked tentacles would burst right out of there.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=interested,Nothing else, huh?  Why'd you even play this game without dressing up?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=smug,Well, that didn't take long.  One wonders why you came to a strip poker joint just to practice personal hygiene.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=seductive,And...everything else is part of your body?  Absolutely crazy...but kind of cute.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=interested,You're a weird one, dear.  Let your hair grow out, then shave it...come to strip poker, don't wear anything.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:0-9=vain,I should hope so!  She doesn't do all those squats in the gym because she thinks it's fun...or maybe she does, who knows.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:0-9=vain,Of course I would.  My Leader is more of a steal than she cares to admit!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:0-9=teasing,Hey, it's not a lack of beauty that keeps Meia single--it's a lack of smiling.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:0-9=stretching,Of course I agree, honey.  The trouble is getting <i>Meia</i> to do so, the neurotic little thing she is.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=awkward,What are you--oh, dear.  That's <i>one</i> way to get off.  Is this how your "darlin'" does it?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=interested,I have a "darlin'," too...her name is Barnette.  And she doesn't ask me to graze her crotch with bullets.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=laughing,I guess when you can shoot your own clothes off, this is the kind of thing you need to do to reach orgasm.  Is your "darlin'" a good shot, too?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=laughing,These Earth girls just keep getting more depraved.  Your "darlin'" being a man must have done this to you, you poor thing.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=seductive,Still as cute as a button!  Why you'd want to hide that body, I can only wonder...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=teasing,Must be the neuroses of a royal that made you ashamed of your body.  No other explanation...you're <i>cute</i>.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=seductive,Ohhh, you're like a little chestnut of adorableness!  Why'd you hide your body from me, huh, sweetie?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=seductive,You barely look a day into womanhood, darling.  It's hard to find you erotic when I just want to <i>squeeze</i> you instead!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=shocked,<i>Eek!  No!  I-I was just joking!  Don't use your magic</i>!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=shocked,<i>Ack!  M-magic?  I'm sorry I made fun of you</i>!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=shocked,<i>Wait, no!  You're very decent!  Extremely decent!  I'm sorry</i>!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=shocked,<i>Wait!  Stop!  D-don't shoot, or cast anything, or whatever</i>!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=awkward,All that hair...Mejarian fashion kind of makes that awkward to live with.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=frustrated,<i>Ew</i>.  Men don't <i>like</i> all that pubic hair, do they?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=annoyed,Hey, I was expecting an Earth woman's vagina.  You'd better not count all that icky hair as a layer.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=frustrated,Ick!  Why don't you <i>shave</i>?  I mean, it gets all sweaty and matted and...<i>ew</i>!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:vriska=laughing,<i>Come now, darling</i>!  I think that suits you just fine...technically covered, but people can see right past.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:vriska=interested,You're not <i>complaining</i> now, are you?  What, because you have to play fair like the rest of us?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:vriska=teasing,I thank you once again for the wonderful look at outfits across the universe.  But this pirate's done with you now.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:vriska=teasing,That's what happens when you play against a pirate, sweetie.  She strips you down eventually.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia=teasing,Just look at that figure.  <i>Don't try to steal me away from Barnette</i>!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia=seductive,Hard work and dedication, folks.  In fact, I think I've never felt this way about you before!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia=laughing,Oh, my!  I'm not sure our relationship can stay totally professional after this, Meia.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia=teasing,I've never had these sorts of feelings about you before, Leader, but seeing you stand all proud like that...<i>my, my</i>.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=shocked,Oh my God.  You weren't kidding.  You really <i>are</i> some kind of public whore.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=frustrated,...I'm gonna go home now and tell Barnette I love her.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=frustrated,...Earth is a scary planet.  I just wanted to have a little fun.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=shocked,...I swear I don't act like this.  I just think flirting is fun!  I have a girlfriend, honest!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma=smug,Maybe I'm judging you too harshly.  <i>I've</i> considered going commando beneath the dress...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma=interested,I guess I'm not much more covered under the dress, huh?  Perhaps we're more similar than I realized.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma=smug,Yeah, this is definitely giving you a thrill.  I wonder if <i>I'd</i> get the same sensation walking around in just the dress.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma=teasing,My dress is pretty much the only thing that covers me, too...<i>maybe we should swap</i>.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=interested,Oh hey, your partner's stripping, too.  Just here for moral support, or are you two lovers?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=teasing,Did you really need help stripping, dear?  Or did you <i>want</i> her to strip you, you little lovebird?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=vain,So you've totally got a crush on this girl, right?  I get it...I would've asked Barnette to strip me if she were here.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=thinking,Maybe I should've brought <i>my</i> girlfriend here with me, too...nah, she wouldn't have gone for it.  She needs to lighten up.


#lost boots
2-male_chest_will_be_visible=seductive,I've heard men are all full of muscles.  Doesn't always look good on a woman, but...
2-male_chest_will_be_visible=laughing,Have you got the build to match your poker skills?  I hope not.
2-male_chest_will_be_visible=thinking,Say what you want about that miserable Rabat...he <i>is</i> built well.
2-male_chest_will_be_visible=interested,Think you could get anything out of the Nirvana's wonderful gym room, Mr. Earth-man?
2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=teasing,So, Little Dungeon Bot...are you built <i>exactly</i> like a man?
2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=seductive,I'm so dreadfully uninformed about men's bodies, 9S.  Is your artificial body a good enough substitute?
2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=teasing,You're a little shy about being fake, right?  Well...here's your chance to show me you're a <i>real</i> boy.
2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=seductive,Can an android really satisfy my unending curiosity about men's muscles?  Give it a shot, honey.
2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:link=bored,...<i>Nin-ten-doh</i>?  <i>Character</i>?  This guy's <i>nuts</i>...I better avoid his seed.
2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:link=interested,...That was a <i>character</i>?  Yeah, I can see why you're playing to strangers in a dump like this.
2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:link=laughing,You were doing a <i>character</i>?  Is that what men connect to, a grunting buffoon?
2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:link=laughing,I'm sorry, you <i>broke</i> character?  That implies there <i>was</i> one, dear.  You know, with emotions and speech.
2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=interested,Ooh, does little Angel-boy want to go topless?  I hear you men don't treat that with quite the concern <i>we</i> do.
2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=seductive,I've <i>never</i> seen men naked before, Pit...<i>won't you get your chest out</i>?  I hear men don't care about that anyway.
2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=teasing,Is it true that men get topless all the time?  I want to see if Mr. Angel is rocking any <i>muscles</i> beneath his stammering.
2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=seductive,Oh, please, Mr. Angel, I'm <i>desperate</i> to see a man nude...can't you show me your chest?  Men don't mind that, right?
2-male_chest_is_visible=excited,You could just lift me up and toss me around, couldn't you?
2-male_chest_is_visible=laughing,Ooh la la, ~name~.  That'e enough muscles to feed <i>five</i> women.
2-male_chest_is_visible=laughing,What delicious-looking muscles you have.  Maybe I'll have my Barnette put you on a rotisserie.
2-male_chest_is_visible=excited,Finally, a good male specimen.  Maybe <i>you'll</i> give me my baby.
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=confused,...OK, now I'm <i>really</i> confused.  Men can have breasts?  You're not all that fat.
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=bored,...I don't think you're a person at this point.  A man with breasts?  What a horrifying sight...
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=angry,OK, seriously.  Breasts on a man?  What the hell are you?  Besides totally gross.
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=frustrated,...I really thought breasts separated men and women pretty cleanly.  Then again, you don't seem human at all.
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=confused,...Wait, I thought men had nipples.  Did I read that wrong?  I was mostly staring at their abs.
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=angry,...Are you pulling my leg?  Do men have nipples or not?  Did your makers just forget them?
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=confused,...Did your creators run out of budget when it came to your nipples, or do men just not have them?
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=confused,Uh, you seem to be missing something there, dear.  Or...do men not have nipples?  How do they breastfeed?
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=confused,Oh, men wear the same underwear we do?  Well, why won't our prisoners show me theirs, then?
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=confused,...Are you <i>sure</i> you're not a woman, dear?  Because that underwear looks pretty feminine...unless men and women share styles.
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=laughing,Uh...wow.  I really thought men and women would wear different underwear.  Women know better than to tear it up, you know?
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=vain,Do men really wear the same underwear women do?  Not that <i>I</i> own any lingerie...pirates can't afford much.
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=smug,Interesting choice of underwear, sweetheart.  <i>Women</i> wear that...I wouldn't think men would.  Too delicate for them.
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=teasing,Oh, that's...not so bad!  About as many muscles as they had in that book I read...though your height leaves something to be desired.
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=teasing,Not bad, honey, but I expected a little better from such a tiny man.  Doesn't being short make gaining muscle easier?
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=vain,Oh, don't feel <i>too</i> bad.  Hibiki is short, and he's not too ripped either...even though he'd be much more handsome that way.
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=stretching,Nothing to be embarrassed about, dear.  Well, maybe your <i>height</i> is.  Work on that instead.
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible=teasing,Watch out, everyone.  A man's about to display his tube-penis-thing.  The horror!
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible=vain,I wonder which of our prisoners' tubes is the biggest.  Hibiki's the smallest everywhere else, but he tends to make up for that.
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible=laughing,Got a tube big enough to replace your brain?  I think we know which one the blood prefers.
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible=teasing,Tonight is an all-new experience for me.  It's just such a hassle to try and convince your male prisoners to strip in front of you, you know?
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=stretching,Well, since you're not exactly fully equipped up above, I'm not expecting much.
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=smug,Did your creators spend any more time developing a full tube for you, dear?  I hope so.
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=teasing,I've learned not to trust androids' anatomy, considering last time.  What's your situation <i>downstairs</i>?
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=seductive,I know you're artificial, but <i>please</i> try to teach me something about men this time, OK?
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pit=seductive,Omigosh, Pit, are you showing your tube?  It's not a little tiny thing, is it?  I hear they can get pretty big!
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pit=seductive,Hey, Angel-boy...do you have a <i>man</i>-sized tube?  If so, I might just fall for your cute little winged self.
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pit=teasing,Normally I go for tall, strong men...but Hibiki's short like you, and he's kind of cute like you, too.  Do you have a decent-sized tube?
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pit=teasing,It's my understanding men's tubes can vary in size, Pit.  I'm willing to overlook shortness in a man if he puts his girth elsewhere.
2-male_small_crotch_is_visible=awkward,Oh, I, uh...shame.  About the size.  I think?  How big are <i>most</i> men?
2-male_small_crotch_is_visible=annoyed,Can that thing even <i>get</i> me pregnant?  Guess I'll have to insert the seed myself...
2-male_small_crotch_is_visible=angry,That's it?  Ugh.  Why do I even <i>bother</i>?
2-male_small_crotch_is_visible=frustrated,Men really <i>are</i> all about efficiency.  No excess whatsoever...but I guess Mejare could learn from that.
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=seductive,Nice tube.  How's your seed?  Nice and fertile?
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=seductive,You know, I'm on the prowl for a suitable man to give me a child...
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=laughing,It's such a funny-looking organ.  Women's vaginas are so elegantly designed, and then men whip out their deformed mushrooms and wrinkled bags.
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=confused,So can it stand up?  Or is it already?  I forget which is which sometimes.  Men are weird...
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=teasing,I don't have a frame of reference myself, but...that looks pretty good!  A comfortable fit...<i>if you think you can convince me</i>.
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=seductive,Hey, I'm not going to pretend to be an expert--and that doesn't look half bad!  Maybe I'll collect <i>your</i> seed, cutie.
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=seductive,Ooh, that looks perfectly manageable!  As much as I'm drawn to the burly types, you are just <i>so</i> cute...I'm considering.
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=vain,Looks like a decent fit, darling...maybe <i>you'll</i> give me my baby.  She'll be such a cute little girl!
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=seductive,Oh, that looks OK!  I'm delicate, so I was worried it might be painful to stuff inside me...<i>God</i>, you're so adorable.
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s=seductive,Ohh, that's cute!  So it's actually accurate?  <i>Interesting</i>...
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s=seductive,Ooh, that <i>does</i> match what I've seen!  Maybe what I really needed from a man was some <i>artificiality</i>...
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s=seductive,Oho!  And it <i>works</i>?  Perhaps a <i>mechanical</i> man is what I've been searching for this whole time.
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s=teasing,Ooh, maybe <i>human</i> men are overrated.  What do you think, dear?  Could you satisfy a woman?
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible=shocked,W-wait!  That can't fit in me!  Forget I was teasing you!
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible=excited,Oh my God...I didn't know men could <i>get</i> that big.
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible=teasing,You're certainly a lot of man, ~name~.  How interesting!
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible=shocked,...That couldn't fit between my <i>breasts</i>, much less me.
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=angry,...OK, I know how big it's <i>supposed</i> to be.  You're just a weird freak imitation of a man.
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=shocked,<i>Aaaack!  Help!  W-what is that thing?  That's not a--a tube, a penis, whatever</i>!
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=bored,...You're <i>definitely</i> not a man.  I come from a planet of women, and still I know that for sure.
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=shocked,<i>Eeeek!  Y-you're a monster, not a man!  G-get away from me!  Keep your tube</i>!
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=frustrated,...Are you the <i>average</i> size?  Because I retract anything I said about having sex with men, then.
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=awkward,...You're an <i>outlier</i>, right, Ryu?  Or does all that fighting make a man's thing grow?
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=shocked,<i>Eek!  I--I take it back!  Don't touch me with that thing--I don't care about your muscles</i>!
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=shocked,<i>Eek</i>!  Y-you can't put that thing inside me!  It'd kill me before your muscles did!
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=awkward,That's, uh...a little oversized.  Maybe you could just squeeze me with your muscles and we could have sex that way?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible=interested,Showing off the girls already?  Earth women aren't much in the way of luck, I guess.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible=vain,Oh, good.  Gotta save the <i>big</i> reveal for the end, I suppose.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible=seductive,Hang in there, ~name~.  I'm a pilot--I handle worse situations all the time, and come out just as beautiful!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible=smug,Lay them out for us, girlie.  They can't be <i>that</i> bad.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia=stretching,Something got you down, Meia?  Showing off the girls should cheer everyone else up, at least.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia=vain,Now I kind of want to join you, depsite how miserable you look.  <i>But I just keep on winning</i>!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia=teasing,Why so glum, Meia?  Your breasts are cute--I can't help but stare in the showers.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia=smug,What's with the sour expression?  Well, sourer than usual, anyway.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=laughing,<i>Well, Meia?  Are you going to do it, with my hungry eyes boring into you</i>?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=interested,You heard Elizabeth, Leader.  Are you going to show your breasts to your second-in-command?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=stretching,Liz is right, Meia--this is very awkward.  It's only, what, the hundredth time I've seen you naked?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=stretching,<i>Oh, my!  Not Meia's breasts!  Oh, Elizabeth, why must you remind me of this horror</i>?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=laughing,Wait, your breasts are out already?  Even <i>I</i> brought some accessories to stave it off!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=interested,Wow, you athletes get straight to the point, don't you?  This is your second loss!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=interested,I know you're proud of your strength, honey, but wearing a lot of clothes is what wins games here.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=stretching,Well, that was fast.  Not wearing much?  I guess athletes can't help but try to set new best times.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=bored,...Or she's just going to strip part of the stems.  Apparently this place has no rules at all.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=bored,...Or that could happen.  I swear, you could count each of your fingers as a layer in this dump...
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=annoyed,...I doll myself up for this evening on a foreign planet, and Little Miss Forest Sprite goes around counting flowers as layers.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=frustrated,...OK, yeah.  It was funny for one round, but that's not clothing.  This girl's a bigger tease than I am.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=smug,With my pilot's keen eye for patterns, I'm guessing the bra isn't coming off <i>this</i> time, either.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=teasing,My instincts are finely honed from piloting, you know.  I see those little things you still have!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=stretching,Oh, please.  You've got that hat, the nose, the tie, and you think I'm buying the bra after <i>last</i> time?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=stretching,Just get the trick over with, Whiteface.  I see about three different ways you could avoid the bra, and I'm just glancing.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:vriska=stretching,There she goes again.  Some girls never learn...even if they've got magical dice.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:vriska=interested,The gimmick's played out, honey.  You can just be normal like the rest of us.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:vriska=teasing,It doesn't matter how brilliant your light show is, darling...people only get dazzled once.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:vriska=smug,You'd be surprised what humans can get used to, dear.  This isn't impressive anymore.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=stretching,Should have expected as much from Miss Grape-flavored over here.  She's going to strip totally backwards, isn't she?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=teasing,I don't know what I expected.  Your stripping order's got us all on the edge of our seats!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=stretching,I like to tease...Miss Grape-flavored here just likes to get to the point.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=laughing,Men seem pretty simple and stupid.  I bet they like how you just skip to the good stuff.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=interested,What are you planning, Miss Pixie?  You've got a mischievous look in your eye...well, more mischievous than usual.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=interested,You look like you're plotting something, Kyu.  Mind making it known to the rest of us?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=teasing,Hey, Miss Pixie.  Stop going on about nonsense like usual and show those cute fairy breasts of yours.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=smug,What are you on about now?  Stop stalling for time and show your chest, Miss Pixie.  I don't have all evening.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=interested,I guess firing straight up makes it a little easier to hit your mark.  Must be a breeze for you.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=seductive,You sure are confident.  I know I <i>act</i> that way, but you really put your money where your mouth is.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=vain,I'm really no good with weapons at all...ground combat is an awful mess.  That's why my Dread is so fun to pilot!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=teasing,You're still so cool.  But with this sort of thing, maybe it's best not to push your luck...
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:felicia=shocked,Wait, you really <i>are</i> a cat?  Like, that's <i>fur</i>?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:felicia=shocked,Wait, you're <i>real</i>?  H-how does that work?  Did Earth crossbreed cats and women?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:felicia=shocked,<i>Eeek</i>!  T-that's <i>real</i> fur?  You're a cat?  Omigosh!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:felicia=shocked,Wait, I thought that was just skimpy clothing?  You're <i>really</i> a cat?  And it's fur?  B-but how?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=annoyed,Wonderful.  Yes.  Worth the wait.  I've never seen breasts before.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=awkward,Those...actually look pretty normal.  I'm surprised.  I thought they'd have teeth marks.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=awkward,...OK.  Maybe you were just kidding about that public-use stuff.  Those look fine...
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=angry,I was worried there...OK.  So you were mostly kidding about getting screwed in public.  That's not funny!
2-female_small_chest_is_visible=interested,Hey, no kids allowed.  If you want games, go play nurse with Paiway.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible=laughing,Pretty crafty, kid, sneaking in here.  What are you, twelve?
2-female_small_chest_is_visible=teasing,No wonder Earth women aren't as curvy.  They don't get enough milk as babies.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible=teasing,I hope you're not planning on becoming a Fama with those things.  Your babies will starve!
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:7b=interested,Something the matter, dear?  Run out of cute outfits to hide your...well, <i>lack</i> of breasts?
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:7b=laughing,...Yeah, I'd try not to strip normally if <i>those</i> were all I had.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:7b=laughing,Aww, don't feel bad.  Those pants are cute...they clash with the blue of your flat chest.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:7b=vain,Well, now I can see why you were shy.  But a woman should stand proud!  ...Hard to say that when there's no flat Mejarians.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:videl=laughing,Using your hair to cover them?  That gives me an idea...but it's not quite what <i>you</i> came up with.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:videl=stretching,Come on, sweetie, those are cute!  Don't cover them up with your hair...actually, that gives me an idea.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:videl=vain,Is that why you have those cute little pigtails?  Modesty just holds the strong woman back...and you've just given me an idea.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:videl=seductive,Oh, are you using your pigtails to cover them?  Clever...and it's just made me think of a great little maneuver of my own.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:7a=laughing,You roll a die that could give you an outfit like <i>that</i>, and you get embarrassed?  Honestly...
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:7a=laughing,Aww, what are you so embarrassed about, darling?  Well, I guess that bikini is supposed to be stretched a little.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:7a=interested,Not filling up that bikini quite how you want to, dear?  Is that why you're blushing?
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:7a=laughing,Cute little blue nipples you've got there.  Too bad you don't have the breasts behind them to fill that bikini.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible=teasing,Not bad for Mejare.  For Earth, even better than that.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible=thinking,I <i>think</i> Parfet's are about that big, but they're always wrapped up in that jumpsuit of hers.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible=seductive,Ooh, not bad, ~name~.  Feel free to accompany me back to the Nirvana's hot springs...I'll introduce you to Barnette.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible=vain,Healthy size for a mother, or whatever you Earth women call it.  Barnette and I are thinking about children...
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=bored,And she just keeps prattling on...<i>mine</i> are much better.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=bored,Should I stop teasing with her around, or just do it harder so she knows how to do it properly?
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=annoyed,...Look, they're not <i>that</i> great, OK?  Just shut up already...
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=annoyed,And they say <i>I</i> have an ego.  Mine are bigger than that and I don't go on about them this much!
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia=laughing,No different than an afternoon in the spa, right?  Except that this isn't comfortable at all.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia=teasing,Tell you what, I'll make sure the spa attendants lavish attention on you when we get back.  Maybe even a breast massage!
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia=stretching,Itching for the spa right about now?  I know I am...oh, hell, I <i>always</i> am.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia=laughing,Not nearly as fun without our darling spa attendants nearby, is it?
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia=vain,Kind of loses its luster when there's no warm spa water wrapped all around you, doesn't it?
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=teasing,I'm telling you, Barnette is <i>always</i> dragging me to the firing range.  You two would be smitten!  ...Maybe I better keep her away from you.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=smug,It's nothing but <i>guns this, ammo that</i> with my girlfriend.  I better not bring you to the Nirvana, or she'll leave me for you.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=interested,I better engage more with Barnette's gun hobby.  One look at you and she'd toss me to the curb.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=vain,Maybe I should try to have more in common with Barnette.  She loves those icky men's guns as much as you do...she's got a whole collection.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=excited,Wha--<i>oh my gosh</i>!  <i>Magic</i>?  Do it again!  That was so cool!
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=excited,What did you--<i>ooh!  Ooh</i>!  You really <i>are</i> a fairy!  Show me some more magic!
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=excited,Omigosh!  You weren't kidding around!  Magic is so cool!  Do something else!
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=teasing,...Oh my God.  <i>Magic</i>?  Well, then...what <i>else</i> can you do, hm?
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=interested,You really like showing off the goods, don't you?  Going to cover them up with other things so you can keep on doing it?
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=laughing,It's the exposure you prefer more than the exhibitionism, isn't it?  You just like the reveal!
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=stretching,There's just no stopping you, honey...well, maybe when you run out of clothes.  How tragic will <i>that</i> be?
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=laughing,What is <i>up</i> with this girl?  You really know how to blow through an audience's attention.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=laughing,<i>Awww, is Little Miss Princess embarrassed?  Should I get you some warm milk and a servant girl</i>?
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=interested,Is something the matter, honey?  Are your delicate princess breasts all mangled up by men?
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=teasing,Got something to hide, Princess Dearest?  Afraid to bare them to the big, bad pirate lady?
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=laughing,What's the matter, darling?  Afraid this pirate will take your breasts and put up a ransom?
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:6=awkward,...Huh.  At this point I really have no clue what you're going for.  Maybe I'd understand if Mejare had clowns.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:6=bored,...This <i>clowning</i> business is strange.  No wonder the colonists didn't want any on Mejare.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:6=frustrated,...Clowns really are full of surprises...but I'm more baffled than entertained.  If only I grew up around some.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:6=bored,...You should know that, on the planet I come from, clowns seem to be extinct.  Just some...food for thought.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=teasing,Oh!  Well, that's as good as the alternative, I suppose.  <i>I'm starting to see through the pretenses here</i>.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=smug,These tricks are really getting desperate, dear.  But hey, I think I'm starting to get what your <i>real</i> job is.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=laughing,Hey, I know what a stripper is.  If clown is just a fancy term for that on Earth, this is all going to make more sense.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=interested,...Honey, are you just a stripper in fancy makeup?  You'd be much better off dropping these silly tricks and just moving your hips a little.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=smug,I don't have to, dear.  Meia's already convinced they do.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=interested,It doesn't matter how many compliments you pay to her breasts, honey.  She's a total head case about them.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=stretching,Oh, I've told her many times that her breasts are just fine.  Nothing penetrates her ridiculuous neuroses.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=smug,If I did, I'd just be confirming what Meia already inexplicably believes.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=interested,How many times do you plan on revealing those things before it takes?  They're just breasts, woman.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=frustrated,You're more neurotic than even Meia when it comes to those things.  Practically had to hold you down to get you to show them.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=interested,At least they're finally out.  With how you've been acting, I thought you had a chunk of them missing or something.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=vain,Earth girls are so ridiculously conservative.  I've got breasts just like you, and you're worried about me seeing the damn things.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible=vain,Meia would be so jealous of you.  She's jealous of <i>me</i>, but she always beats me at cards, which makes her feel better.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible=smug,You should listen to Meia go on about how her breasts are inadequate.  She thinks they're too small to be a Fama!  Honestly.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible=vain,Ah, breasts like those make me feel right at home.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible=teasing,Good to know there's some real winners among Earth girls, if you follow.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:velma=laughing,<i>Aww, is someone blind without her glasses</i>?  Just crawl on the floor until you find them, then.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:velma=smug,Don't worry, dear, I won't get in the way.  You can crawl around <i>all you want</i> as you search for them.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:velma=teasing,The game must go on, dearie!  Don't worry, I'll enjoy the view of your butt sticking out as you search the floor.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:velma=teasing,Yeah, Parfet needs her glasses, too.  She's in better shape, though--go get some exercise crawling around looking for them.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=teasing,I see you're lugging quite a lot in back, too.  Must make your legs pretty strong!
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=seductive,<i>Well, now</i>!  I can see why you wanted to be naked--just look at the size of that thing!  But you wear it well.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=smug,Yeah, yeah.  You've got enough in back for a whole extra woman, honey...but it's pretty fantastic, I'll concede.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=seductive,<i>Oh, my</i>!  You could stare at that thing for hours and find new details.  Is it all muscle or all fat?
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=laughing,I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and guess that thing's from squatting, not too much candy.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,See that look Meia's giving you?  <i>Pure envy</i>.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,alsoPlaying:meia=seductive,A big <i>Earth</i> girl?  I hope this doesn't make you think you can't be a Fama, Meia.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,Ah, breasts like those make me feel right at home.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Good to know there's some real winners among Earth girls, if you follow.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia=shocked,Mejare only has animals in zoos--I guess they never wanted us to see them breed with the males.  This is crazy!
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia=seductive,I've...never seen a cat up close.  Are those claws real, too?  Where'd you come from?
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia=excited,Seeing a real cat is...it's nuts!  Mejare has almost no animals at all!
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia=excited,Omigosh, omigosh, omigosh!  Cats are so cool--I've never seen one until now, not up close!
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible=laughing,Down to nothing already?  Tsk, tsk.  What would your home planet think?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible=teasing,Don't tell me Earth men have turned you into some kind of submissive coward.  Women have to be brave!
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible=teasing,Don't worry, ~name~.  This Mejarian will keep your nude body safe from any vile men lurking around this place.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible=teasing,Don't feel bad.  Barnette would have been naked a long time ago--half of her is nude at any given time.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=seductive,Oh, good.  Now you'd fit right in where I'm from!  Shaved is so much cuter.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=vain,Well, you might be a kitty-cat, but at least you know when enough is enough.  See, Mejare likes to be smooth and sleek.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=teasing,Cleanliness is a virtue on my planet!  So I like this shaving approach, Miss Kitty.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=laughing,Hey, take all the hair away!  This kitty needs to see the sun, after all.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=laughing,You know you have a mask, right?  Or is Miss Wrestler actually a little shy about showing her whole face?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=smug,I guess you're more proud of your thighs than your face, because you still have a mask.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=stretching,You really want to be naked, don't you?  Hell, you're just skipping the mask altogether.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=vain,I just realized you still have the mask.  Is it <i>that</i> important to your image?  I understand, then.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=teasing,Well, how's <i>that</i> for karma?  Cover your breasts, and fate demands you show your cute little rear!  But of course, you wanted to.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=seductive,Ooh, what an adorable little behind!  Don't go and cover it, now!  <i>I know you don't really want to</i>.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=teasing,Nice and tight--you're just a tiny vixen of a girl, aren't you?  <i>Desperate</i> to strut your stuff.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=laughing,<i>Heeheeheehee</i>!  Seems fate would have you baring it all--that's what you want anyway, right?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=shocked,Wha--<i>ew!  Ew!  EW!  What's the matter with you</i>?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=shocked,...<i>Where's all the color</i>?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=shocked,...What <i>are</i> you?  You need a hospital!  You need <i>Mejarian</i> medicine!
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=shocked,<i>Ack!  Ew!  Wha--what is that thing?  Ew!  Help!  Stop</i>!
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=laughing,Oh, we've seen each other naked once or twice.  A day.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=interested,Well, Meia?  Have I seen your <i>you-know-what</i>?  Or do you not know what <i>it</i> is?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=laughing,Don't ask me how you managed to come here if you can barely spit out the word <i>vagina</i>.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=interested,The most important question of the night, isn't it, Leader?  Your <i>you-know-what</i> is such a mystery.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=awkward,Hey, what are you two...<i>oh, my</i>.  That might be a little much even for me and Barnette.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=shocked,Hey, are you going to put those webs to...<i>use</i>.  Oh, dear.  Barnette might not go for that.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=awkward,That... looks like a lot of rope.  I might have to rethink inviting you over for some time with me and Barnette.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=awkward,...<i>Ooh</i>.  At first I thought your webs sounded cool, but...I'm not sure Barnette would like <i>this</i> much of them.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=laughing,Well, that seals it.  You're a total nymph...disguised as an innocent little dork.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=stretching,It's always the dorky ones, isn't it?  I bet Parfet's a real wild child...Barnette and I are so dreadfully vanilla.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=vain,Being all sheltered must do this to nerdy types.  Barnette and I just kiss and hold hands like the pure angels we are.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=interested,This must be the only thrill you've gotten in years.  You nerdy types are so predictably dirty.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=vain,Reading too much must mess with nerd girls' sexualities.  One medical book got me obsessed with men, after all.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=vain,Panties first, you dorky little thing?  This must be thrilling for you...<i>I</i> can appreciate the warmth of a loving relationship.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=teasing,Ooh, <i>bottomless</i>?  Maybe Earth women value their breasts more than I thought they did.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=vain,Breasts out last, huh, Mia?  I guess you Earth girls want to protect them...we Mejarians feel the same way about our wombs.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=vain,Oh, are you saving the chest for last?  I can understand...my breasts mean a lot to me, too.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=interested,Anything we should know about your breasts, dear?  You seem desperate to protect them.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=seductive,I'll freely admit to being enchanted--mostly from those flowers.  You only ever see that stuff in gardens on Mejare.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=vain,Must be nice sprouting flowers wherever you go.  They're so rare on Mejare...I wish I could give some to Barnette.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=vain,Flowers are so romantic and sweet-smelling...maybe you're too accustomed to it, but they're a rarity on Mejare.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=vain,You Earth girls are so spoiled when it comes to flowers.  You know how hard it is to start up a garden on Mejare?  We barely have plants!
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=stretching,Honestly, dear, what was your reason for wearing that leotard?  ...Well, I guess Barnette's pretty similar.  Must be how it feels.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=teasing,That leotard's pretty <i>tight</i>, honey.  Just digging up into you...my Barnette dresses the same way.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=vain,I can understand loving the way leotards feel downstairs.  My girlfriend wears something <i>just</i> like it.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=teasing,I <i>may</i> have tried on Barnette's outfit once...so I know how that leotard must be digging into your nether regions.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=laughing,Whoa, whoa, whoa, <i>what</i>?  Honey, that comes at the <i>end</i>!  Give us something to look forward to!
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=interested,Uh...honey, that comes last, usually.  Were you raised in isolation?  Do you not know what audiences like?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=interested,...You're supposed to keep the audience guessing, dear.  This is certainly a curveball, but now you've got no surprises.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=laughing,Wait, <i>what</i>?  Hey, are you trying to be boring for the rest of the game?  Have some suspense!
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=vain,Thinking about this again, I don't think I'd want to learn how to shoot like you do...or at least destroy my outfits with it.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=thinking,Do I <i>have</i> an outfit I'd be willing to destroy just for the spectacle?  I'd have to buy some rags for the occasion.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=stretching,I think I'd just <i>die</i> if I tried this.  Not from the bullets, but from seeing my wonderful dress in tatters.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=vain,You really are something else, Aimee.  You'd never catch <i>me</i> tearing up my beautiful wardrobe like that.  I'd have to steal more!
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato=seductive,You're my kind of woman, Misato...sexually confident.  Can you teach me about men sometime?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato=seductive,You really know your way around Earth men, Misato--you're not shy at all!  You've got to teach me.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato=vain,Not to call you <i>easy</i>, dear, but you seem pretty experienced with these men...and confident.  <i>Teach me your ways</i>.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato=seductive,I can never get a man to like me, and yet you seem so experienced and confident.  What's your secret, Miss Military?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia=interested,Just the cruel twists of fate, Meia.  Oh wait, you don't believe in that.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia=laughing,Don't resent me...resent your fate.  Your fate of getting nude.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia=stretching,Don't worry so much about how it all turns out.  Just have some fun while it lasts, and leave fate out of it!
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia=vain,Perhaps it was <i>destiny</i> that you're forced to expose yourself like this, while I remain modest and wholesome.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=vain,I can respect a woman going bottomless.  Bare breasts have a tendency to just swing around all ungainly-like...tough for an athlete.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=teasing,Bottomless first?  Yeah, that fits your athletic attitude to keep your breasts all wrapped up tight.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=stretching,You gym rats and your worries about your breasts hitting you in the face or something.  Exercise ruins everything!
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=smug,Of course the athlete goes bottomless.  She's worried her bare breasts will throw her off-balance.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:vriska=stretching,But maybe you'll prove us all wrong.  Go right ahead.  More fashion for me.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:vriska=teasing,I'm waiting for you to stick it to me, Vriska.  I certainly <i>want</i> to see more cute outfits.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:vriska=teasing,Going to prove my predictions wrong?  If so, more fashion for me...I win either way.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:vriska=vain,By all means, deliver more adorable outfits upon me.  I don't care if you win.
2-female_crotch_is_visible=vain,Not much to say.  Take care of yourself, and a groin's a groin.
2-female_crotch_is_visible=vain,Are men really obsessed with women's groins?  They're certainly appealing to <i>me</i>.
2-female_crotch_is_visible=laughing,Heehee.  A Tarakkian would be sweating bullets right now.
2-female_crotch_is_visible=laughing,Cute little flower you've got there.  Good to see those hulking Earth men haven't torn all the petals off.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia=smug,You'd make Mejare proud with that body of yours.  Too bad our profession does the opposite.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia=vain,Well-toned, well-maintained.  I think we've made our case for Mejarian beauty already.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia=teasing,So?  Mejarians are better than any Earth woman, am I right?  And Meia's all modest about it, the class act that she is.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia=teasing,A model Mejarian.  <i>I'm</i> the perfect one, but you could actually attain Meia's body with some effort.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=awkward,What are you--oh, dear.  That's <i>one</i> way to get off.  Is this how your "darlin'" does it?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=interested,I have a "darlin'," too...her name is Barnette.  And she doesn't ask me to graze her crotch with bullets.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=laughing,I guess when you can shoot your own clothes off, this is the kind of thing you need to do to reach orgasm.  Is your "darlin'" a good shot, too?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=laughing,These Earth girls just keep getting more depraved.  Your "darlin'" being a man must have done this to you, you poor thing.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:vriska=laughing,<i>Come now, darling</i>!  I think that suits you just fine...technically covered, but people can see right past.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:vriska=interested,You're not <i>complaining</i> now, are you?  What, because you have to play fair like the rest of us?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:vriska=teasing,I thank you once again for the wonderful look at outfits across the universe.  But this pirate's done with you now.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:vriska=teasing,That's what happens when you play against a pirate, sweetie.  She strips you down eventually.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=shocked,<i>Eek!  No!  I-I was just joking!  Don't use your magic</i>!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=shocked,<i>Ack!  M-magic?  I'm sorry I made fun of you</i>!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=shocked,<i>Wait, no!  You're very decent!  Extremely decent!  I'm sorry</i>!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=shocked,<i>Wait!  Stop!  D-don't shoot, or cast anything, or whatever</i>!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=seductive,Still as cute as a button!  Why you'd want to hide that body, I can only wonder...
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=teasing,Must be the neuroses of a royal that made you ashamed of your body.  No other explanation...you're <i>cute</i>.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=seductive,Ohhh, you're like a little chestnut of adorableness!  Why'd you hide your body from me, huh, sweetie?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=seductive,You barely look a day into womanhood, darling.  It's hard to find you erotic when I just want to <i>squeeze</i> you instead!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma=smug,Maybe I'm judging you too harshly.  <i>I've</i> considered going commando beneath the dress...
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma=interested,I guess I'm not much more covered under the dress, huh?  Perhaps we're more similar than I realized.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma=smug,Yeah, this is definitely giving you a thrill.  I wonder if <i>I'd</i> get the same sensation walking around in just the dress.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma=teasing,My dress is pretty much the only thing that covers me, too...<i>maybe we should swap</i>.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=shocked,Wha--ew!  Ew!  It's all tangly and gross!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=shocked,Eek!  Wh-why don't you shave?  Does Earth not have razors?  Are you OK?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=bored,Ew.  Don't tell me you grew all that out for a <i>man's</i> sake.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=teasing,Pubic hair is just icky.  I mean, wouldn't you rather be all silky-smooth like me?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=interested,Nothing else, huh?  Why'd you even play this game without dressing up?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=smug,Well, that didn't take long.  One wonders why you came to a strip poker joint just to practice personal hygiene.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=seductive,And...everything else is part of your body?  Absolutely crazy...but kind of cute.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=interested,You're a weird one, dear.  Let your hair grow out, then shave it...come to strip poker, don't wear anything.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=shocked,Oh my God.  You weren't kidding.  You really <i>are</i> some kind of public whore.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=frustrated,...I'm gonna go home now and tell Barnette I love her.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=frustrated,...Earth is a scary planet.  I just wanted to have a little fun.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=shocked,...I swear I don't act like this.  I just think flirting is fun!  I have a girlfriend, honest!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:0-9=vain,I should hope so!  She doesn't do all those squats in the gym because she thinks it's fun...or maybe she does, who knows.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:0-9=vain,Of course I would.  My Leader is more of a steal than she cares to admit!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:0-9=teasing,Hey, it's not a lack of beauty that keeps Meia single--it's a lack of smiling.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:0-9=stretching,Of course I agree, honey.  The trouble is getting <i>Meia</i> to do so, the neurotic little thing she is.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=interested,Oh hey, your partner's stripping, too.  Just here for moral support, or are you two lovers?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=teasing,Did you really need help stripping, dear?  Or did you <i>want</i> her to strip you, you little lovebird?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=vain,So you've totally got a crush on this girl, right?  I get it...I would've asked Barnette to strip me if she were here.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=thinking,Maybe I should've brought <i>my</i> girlfriend here with me, too...nah, she wouldn't have gone for it.  She needs to lighten up.


#lost sleeves
3-male_chest_will_be_visible=laughing,What's this?  A <i>man's</i> chest?  Oh, dear, I'm all aflutter!
3-male_chest_will_be_visible=teasing,I hope men have the muscles to make up for their lack of breasts.
3-male_chest_will_be_visible=laughing,Meia's all about muscles and fitness.  If you wanna get in her pants, you're gonna need some...and also a miracle.
3-male_chest_will_be_visible=stretching,Show me something I've never seen before, ~name~.  Unless it's really ugly.
3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=interested,Ooh, does little Angel-boy want to go topless?  I hear you men don't treat that with quite the concern <i>we</i> do.
3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=seductive,I've <i>never</i> seen men naked before, Pit...<i>won't you get your chest out</i>?  I hear men don't care about that anyway.
3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=teasing,Is it true that men get topless all the time?  I want to see if Mr. Angel is rocking any <i>muscles</i> beneath his stammering.
3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=seductive,Oh, please, Mr. Angel, I'm <i>desperate</i> to see a man nude...can't you show me your chest?  Men don't mind that, right?
3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:link=bored,...<i>Nin-ten-doh</i>?  <i>Character</i>?  This guy's <i>nuts</i>...I better avoid his seed.
3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:link=interested,...That was a <i>character</i>?  Yeah, I can see why you're playing to strangers in a dump like this.
3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:link=laughing,You were doing a <i>character</i>?  Is that what men connect to, a grunting buffoon?
3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:link=laughing,I'm sorry, you <i>broke</i> character?  That implies there <i>was</i> one, dear.  You know, with emotions and speech.
3-male_chest_will_be_visible,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,What's this?  A <i>man's</i> chest?  Oh, dear, I'm all aflutter!
3-male_chest_will_be_visible,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,I hope men have the muscles to make up for their lack of breasts.
3-male_chest_will_be_visible,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Hey, handsome...Meia here's all about muscles and fitness.  If you wanna get in her pants, you're gonna need some...and also a miracle.
3-male_chest_will_be_visible,alsoPlaying:meia=stretching,Show me something I've never seen before, ~name~.  Unless it's really ugly.
3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=teasing,So, Little Dungeon Bot...are you built <i>exactly</i> like a man?
3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=seductive,I'm so dreadfully uninformed about men's bodies, 9S.  Is your artificial body a good enough substitute?
3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=teasing,You're a little shy about being fake, right?  Well...here's your chance to show me you're a <i>real</i> boy.
3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=seductive,Can an android really satisfy my unending curiosity about men's muscles?  Give it a shot, honey.
3-male_chest_is_visible=laughing,Hibiki could really use some extra muscles to match his energy...and make up for his height.
3-male_chest_is_visible=thinking,I wonder how many men actually pull off your physique.  Looks tough to maintain.
3-male_chest_is_visible=seductive,You look like you can lift a lot...like my whole body.
3-male_chest_is_visible=vain,Looks tough to maintain all those muscles.  I have it easy--just don't eat too much!
3-male_chest_is_visible=teasing,Men have so many muscles, and they're so much taller and stronger.  Good thing for laser rings!
3-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=teasing,Oh, that's...not so bad!  About as many muscles as they had in that book I read...though your height leaves something to be desired.
3-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=teasing,Not bad, honey, but I expected a little better from such a tiny man.  Doesn't being short make gaining muscle easier?
3-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=vain,Oh, don't feel <i>too</i> bad.  Hibiki is short, and he's not too ripped either...even though he'd be much more handsome that way.
3-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=stretching,Nothing to be embarrassed about, dear.  Well, maybe your <i>height</i> is.  Work on that instead.
3-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=confused,...Wait, I thought men had nipples.  Did I read that wrong?  I was mostly staring at their abs.
3-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=angry,...Are you pulling my leg?  Do men have nipples or not?  Did your makers just forget them?
3-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=confused,...Did your creators run out of budget when it came to your nipples, or do men just not have them?
3-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=confused,Uh, you seem to be missing something there, dear.  Or...do men not have nipples?  How do they breastfeed?
3-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=confused,...OK, now I'm <i>really</i> confused.  Men can have breasts?  You're not all that fat.
3-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=bored,...I don't think you're a person at this point.  A man with breasts?  What a horrifying sight...
3-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=angry,OK, seriously.  Breasts on a man?  What the hell are you?  Besides totally gross.
3-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=frustrated,...I really thought breasts separated men and women pretty cleanly.  Then again, you don't seem human at all.
3-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=confused,Oh, men wear the same underwear we do?  Well, why won't our prisoners show me theirs, then?
3-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=confused,...Are you <i>sure</i> you're not a woman, dear?  Because that underwear looks pretty feminine...unless men and women share styles.
3-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=laughing,Uh...wow.  I really thought men and women would wear different underwear.  Women know better than to tear it up, you know?
3-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=vain,Do men really wear the same underwear women do?  Not that <i>I</i> own any lingerie...pirates can't afford much.
3-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=smug,Interesting choice of underwear, sweetheart.  <i>Women</i> wear that...I wouldn't think men would.  Too delicate for them.
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible=excited,<i>Finally</i>.  I've been waiting all game to see your tube-thing.
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible=confused,What's the word for your tube again?  Pennis?  Pentis?  Penile?
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible=laughing,I'd be lying if I said I wasn't curious.  And Meia would definitely say that.
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible=excited,I just <i>knew</i> this place would finally give me a good look at this mystical tube of men.
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pit=seductive,Omigosh, Pit, are you showing your tube?  It's not a little tiny thing, is it?  I hear they can get pretty big!
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pit=seductive,Hey, Angel-boy...do you have a <i>man</i>-sized tube?  If so, I might just fall for your cute little winged self.
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pit=teasing,Normally I go for tall, strong men...but Hibiki's short like you, and he's kind of cute like you, too.  Do you have a decent-sized tube?
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pit=teasing,It's my understanding men's tubes can vary in size, Pit.  I'm willing to overlook shortness in a man if he puts his girth elsewhere.
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=stretching,Well, since you're not exactly fully equipped up above, I'm not expecting much.
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=smug,Did your creators spend any more time developing a full tube for you, dear?  I hope so.
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=teasing,I've learned not to trust androids' anatomy, considering last time.  What's your situation <i>downstairs</i>?
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=seductive,I know you're artificial, but <i>please</i> try to teach me something about men this time, OK?
3-male_small_crotch_is_visible=awkward,...Well, that's underwhelming.  Most aren't that small, right?
3-male_small_crotch_is_visible=awkward,...Maybe I should rethink this baby-with-a-man thing.
3-male_small_crotch_is_visible=laughing,About as long as Hibiki is tall.
3-male_small_crotch_is_visible=interested,...So you're not an <i>adult</i> man, right?  I mean, come on.
3-male_small_crotch_is_visible=laughing,The book had them pictured a lot bigger.  Guess that makes you an outlier.
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=excited,It's so <i>cool</i>...getting hard all by itself.
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=interested,Kinda looks like a huge clitoris.  Sex must feel great to men.
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=frustrated,And the spheres in back are for--for--damn it, that book was so long and confusing!
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=laughing,Like a little soldier standing at attention.  Hope he's ready to defend his homeland.
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s=seductive,Ohh, that's cute!  So it's actually accurate?  <i>Interesting</i>...
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s=seductive,Ooh, that <i>does</i> match what I've seen!  Maybe what I really needed from a man was some <i>artificiality</i>...
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s=seductive,Oho!  And it <i>works</i>?  Perhaps a <i>mechanical</i> man is what I've been searching for this whole time.
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s=teasing,Ooh, maybe <i>human</i> men are overrated.  What do you think, dear?  Could you satisfy a woman?
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=teasing,I don't have a frame of reference myself, but...that looks pretty good!  A comfortable fit...<i>if you think you can convince me</i>.
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=seductive,Hey, I'm not going to pretend to be an expert--and that doesn't look half bad!  Maybe I'll collect <i>your</i> seed, cutie.
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=seductive,Ooh, that looks perfectly manageable!  As much as I'm drawn to the burly types, you are just <i>so</i> cute...I'm considering.
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=vain,Looks like a decent fit, darling...maybe <i>you'll</i> give me my baby.  She'll be such a cute little girl!
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=seductive,Oh, that looks OK!  I'm delicate, so I was worried it might be painful to stuff inside me...<i>God</i>, you're so adorable.
3-male_large_crotch_is_visible=laughing,Guess we know where all the blood was going--certainly not your brain.
3-male_large_crotch_is_visible=shocked,A-agh!  The book said it was zoomed-in, not <i>out</i>!
3-male_large_crotch_is_visible=shocked,W-wait, I take it back!  That'd split me in two!
3-male_large_crotch_is_visible=awkward,...Honestly, I'm tall, but I don't think that'd fit.
3-male_large_crotch_is_visible=shocked,Eek!  T-that wouldn't fit in my <i>armbands</i>!
3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=awkward,...You're an <i>outlier</i>, right, Ryu?  Or does all that fighting make a man's thing grow?
3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=shocked,<i>Eek!  I--I take it back!  Don't touch me with that thing--I don't care about your muscles</i>!
3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=shocked,<i>Eek</i>!  Y-you can't put that thing inside me!  It'd kill me before your muscles did!
3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=awkward,That's, uh...a little oversized.  Maybe you could just squeeze me with your muscles and we could have sex that way?
3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=angry,...OK, I know how big it's <i>supposed</i> to be.  You're just a weird freak imitation of a man.
3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=shocked,<i>Aaaack!  Help!  W-what is that thing?  That's not a--a tube, a penis, whatever</i>!
3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=bored,...You're <i>definitely</i> not a man.  I come from a planet of women, and still I know that for sure.
3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=shocked,<i>Eeeek!  Y-you're a monster, not a man!  G-get away from me!  Keep your tube</i>!
3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=frustrated,...Are you the <i>average</i> size?  Because I retract anything I said about having sex with men, then.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible=vain,Let's see how you stack up against Mejare's finest, ~name~.  You know, me.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible=teasing,Let them bounce, darling.  If they can.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible=vain,Take pride in your body!  That's the only good advice Mejare ever gave us.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible=smug,Pretty sure Tarakkians think spikes come out of our nipples or something.  Or acid-milk.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=interested,What are you planning, Miss Pixie?  You've got a mischievous look in your eye...well, more mischievous than usual.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=interested,You look like you're plotting something, Kyu.  Mind making it known to the rest of us?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=teasing,Hey, Miss Pixie.  Stop going on about nonsense like usual and show those cute fairy breasts of yours.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=smug,What are you on about now?  Stop stalling for time and show your chest, Miss Pixie.  I don't have all evening.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=interested,I guess firing straight up makes it a little easier to hit your mark.  Must be a breeze for you.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=seductive,You sure are confident.  I know I <i>act</i> that way, but you really put your money where your mouth is.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=vain,I'm really no good with weapons at all...ground combat is an awful mess.  That's why my Dread is so fun to pilot!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=teasing,You're still so cool.  But with this sort of thing, maybe it's best not to push your luck...
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=bored,...Or she's just going to strip part of the stems.  Apparently this place has no rules at all.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=bored,...Or that could happen.  I swear, you could count each of your fingers as a layer in this dump...
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=annoyed,...I doll myself up for this evening on a foreign planet, and Little Miss Forest Sprite goes around counting flowers as layers.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=frustrated,...OK, yeah.  It was funny for one round, but that's not clothing.  This girl's a bigger tease than I am.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=stretching,Should have expected as much from Miss Grape-flavored over here.  She's going to strip totally backwards, isn't she?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=teasing,I don't know what I expected.  Your stripping order's got us all on the edge of our seats!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=stretching,I like to tease...Miss Grape-flavored here just likes to get to the point.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=laughing,Men seem pretty simple and stupid.  I bet they like how you just skip to the good stuff.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=smug,With my pilot's keen eye for patterns, I'm guessing the bra isn't coming off <i>this</i> time, either.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=teasing,My instincts are finely honed from piloting, you know.  I see those little things you still have!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=stretching,Oh, please.  You've got that hat, the nose, the tie, and you think I'm buying the bra after <i>last</i> time?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=stretching,Just get the trick over with, Whiteface.  I see about three different ways you could avoid the bra, and I'm just glancing.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=annoyed,Wonderful.  Yes.  Worth the wait.  I've never seen breasts before.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=awkward,Those...actually look pretty normal.  I'm surprised.  I thought they'd have teeth marks.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=awkward,...OK.  Maybe you were just kidding about that public-use stuff.  Those look fine...
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=angry,I was worried there...OK.  So you were mostly kidding about getting screwed in public.  That's not funny!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=laughing,<i>Well, Meia?  Are you going to do it, with my hungry eyes boring into you</i>?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=interested,You heard Elizabeth, Leader.  Are you going to show your breasts to your second-in-command?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=stretching,Liz is right, Meia--this is very awkward.  It's only, what, the hundredth time I've seen you naked?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=stretching,<i>Oh, my!  Not Meia's breasts!  Oh, Elizabeth, why must you remind me of this horror</i>?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia=teasing,Meia here is one of Mejare's cutest specimens.  But she'd never admit it, the hopeless prude!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia=vain,This'll be more than a handful, but don't get any ideas!  Nobody touches <i>my</i> Leader.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia=laughing,Nice and sexy, Meia.  Oh wait, you don't know what that means, do you?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia=laughing,Not a sexy bone in your body, is there?  Have you just given up on finding a girlfriend?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:felicia=shocked,Wait, you really <i>are</i> a cat?  Like, that's <i>fur</i>?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:felicia=shocked,Wait, you're <i>real</i>?  H-how does that work?  Did Earth crossbreed cats and women?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:felicia=shocked,<i>Eeek</i>!  T-that's <i>real</i> fur?  You're a cat?  Omigosh!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:felicia=shocked,Wait, I thought that was just skimpy clothing?  You're <i>really</i> a cat?  And it's fur?  B-but how?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:vriska=stretching,There she goes again.  Some girls never learn...even if they've got magical dice.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:vriska=interested,The gimmick's played out, honey.  You can just be normal like the rest of us.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:vriska=teasing,It doesn't matter how brilliant your light show is, darling...people only get dazzled once.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:vriska=smug,You'd be surprised what humans can get used to, dear.  This isn't impressive anymore.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=laughing,Wait, your breasts are out already?  Even <i>I</i> brought some accessories to stave it off!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=interested,Wow, you athletes get straight to the point, don't you?  This is your second loss!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=interested,I know you're proud of your strength, honey, but wearing a lot of clothes is what wins games here.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=stretching,Well, that was fast.  Not wearing much?  I guess athletes can't help but try to set new best times.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible=awkward,Oh, just a kid...how disappointing.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible=awkward,That puts a damper on things.  I'm so sorry about your...condition.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible=awkward,This really helps me appreciate the hormones Mejare's government puts in our food.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible=laughing,Must be what Tarakkian food pellets do to a woman.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:7b=interested,Something the matter, dear?  Run out of cute outfits to hide your...well, <i>lack</i> of breasts?
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:7b=laughing,...Yeah, I'd try not to strip normally if <i>those</i> were all I had.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:7b=laughing,Aww, don't feel bad.  Those pants are cute...they clash with the blue of your flat chest.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:7b=vain,Well, now I can see why you were shy.  But a woman should stand proud!  ...Hard to say that when there's no flat Mejarians.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:7a=laughing,You roll a die that could give you an outfit like <i>that</i>, and you get embarrassed?  Honestly...
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:7a=laughing,Aww, what are you so embarrassed about, darling?  Well, I guess that bikini is supposed to be stretched a little.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:7a=interested,Not filling up that bikini quite how you want to, dear?  Is that why you're blushing?
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:7a=laughing,Cute little blue nipples you've got there.  Too bad you don't have the breasts behind them to fill that bikini.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:videl=laughing,Using your hair to cover them?  That gives me an idea...but it's not quite what <i>you</i> came up with.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:videl=stretching,Come on, sweetie, those are cute!  Don't cover them up with your hair...actually, that gives me an idea.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:videl=vain,Is that why you have those cute little pigtails?  Modesty just holds the strong woman back...and you've just given me an idea.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:videl=seductive,Oh, are you using your pigtails to cover them?  Clever...and it's just made me think of a great little maneuver of my own.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible=laughing,Color me impressed.  You know, for an Earth woman.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible=vain,Breasts are so much fun.  Men are reallly missing out!
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible=vain,Breasts are fun <i>and</i> functional.  Is that why Earth men keep you around?
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible=teasing,What a nice pair.  I'm tempted to just throw this dress off and join you...especially if I lose a few more hands.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=smug,I don't have to, dear.  Meia's already convinced they do.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=interested,It doesn't matter how many compliments you pay to her breasts, honey.  She's a total head case about them.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=stretching,Oh, I've told her many times that her breasts are just fine.  Nothing penetrates her ridiculuous neuroses.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=smug,If I did, I'd just be confirming what Meia already inexplicably believes.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=laughing,<i>Awww, is Little Miss Princess embarrassed?  Should I get you some warm milk and a servant girl</i>?
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=interested,Is something the matter, honey?  Are your delicate princess breasts all mangled up by men?
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=teasing,Got something to hide, Princess Dearest?  Afraid to bare them to the big, bad pirate lady?
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=laughing,What's the matter, darling?  Afraid this pirate will take your breasts and put up a ransom?
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=interested,You really like showing off the goods, don't you?  Going to cover them up with other things so you can keep on doing it?
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=laughing,It's the exposure you prefer more than the exhibitionism, isn't it?  You just like the reveal!
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=stretching,There's just no stopping you, honey...well, maybe when you run out of clothes.  How tragic will <i>that</i> be?
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=laughing,What is <i>up</i> with this girl?  You really know how to blow through an audience's attention.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia=stretching,Aren't they nice, everyone?  Yeah, well, try getting <i>her</i> to admit it.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia=laughing,Such cute little things.  Oops, I didn't mean little that way.  Stop glaring.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia=vain,Would you believe she's all neurotic about these things?  Honestly.  I hear there's Earth women who have to get fake ones implanted or something.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia=laughing,Behold, Meia's biggest insecurity...or littlest, technically.  No, I don't get it, either.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=teasing,I'm telling you, Barnette is <i>always</i> dragging me to the firing range.  You two would be smitten!  ...Maybe I better keep her away from you.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=smug,It's nothing but <i>guns this, ammo that</i> with my girlfriend.  I better not bring you to the Nirvana, or she'll leave me for you.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=interested,I better engage more with Barnette's gun hobby.  One look at you and she'd toss me to the curb.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=vain,Maybe I should try to have more in common with Barnette.  She loves those icky men's guns as much as you do...she's got a whole collection.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=excited,Wha--<i>oh my gosh</i>!  <i>Magic</i>?  Do it again!  That was so cool!
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=excited,What did you--<i>ooh!  Ooh</i>!  You really <i>are</i> a fairy!  Show me some more magic!
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=excited,Omigosh!  You weren't kidding around!  Magic is so cool!  Do something else!
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=teasing,...Oh my God.  <i>Magic</i>?  Well, then...what <i>else</i> can you do, hm?
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:6=awkward,...Huh.  At this point I really have no clue what you're going for.  Maybe I'd understand if Mejare had clowns.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:6=bored,...This <i>clowning</i> business is strange.  No wonder the colonists didn't want any on Mejare.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:6=frustrated,...Clowns really are full of surprises...but I'm more baffled than entertained.  If only I grew up around some.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:6=bored,...You should know that, on the planet I come from, clowns seem to be extinct.  Just some...food for thought.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=teasing,Oh!  Well, that's as good as the alternative, I suppose.  <i>I'm starting to see through the pretenses here</i>.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=smug,These tricks are really getting desperate, dear.  But hey, I think I'm starting to get what your <i>real</i> job is.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=laughing,Hey, I know what a stripper is.  If clown is just a fancy term for that on Earth, this is all going to make more sense.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=interested,...Honey, are you just a stripper in fancy makeup?  You'd be much better off dropping these silly tricks and just moving your hips a little.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=interested,How many times do you plan on revealing those things before it takes?  They're just breasts, woman.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=frustrated,You're more neurotic than even Meia when it comes to those things.  Practically had to hold you down to get you to show them.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=interested,At least they're finally out.  With how you've been acting, I thought you had a chunk of them missing or something.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=vain,Earth girls are so ridiculously conservative.  I've got breasts just like you, and you're worried about me seeing the damn things.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=bored,And she just keeps prattling on...<i>mine</i> are much better.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=bored,Should I stop teasing with her around, or just do it harder so she knows how to do it properly?
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=annoyed,...Look, they're not <i>that</i> great, OK?  Just shut up already...
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=annoyed,And they say <i>I</i> have an ego.  Mine are bigger than that and I don't go on about them this much!
3-female_large_chest_is_visible=vain,Large and in charge.  Life is so easy for the well-endowed woman.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible=laughing,Nothing better than a pair of wonderful breasts.  Mine are still a little nicer, though.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible=teasing,Want to compare, ~name~?  Hope your poker skills improve, then.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible=vain,It's great with chests like ours, isn't it?  Turn heads wherever you go, and your back gets so strong!
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=teasing,I see you're lugging quite a lot in back, too.  Must make your legs pretty strong!
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=seductive,<i>Well, now</i>!  I can see why you wanted to be naked--just look at the size of that thing!  But you wear it well.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=smug,Yeah, yeah.  You've got enough in back for a whole extra woman, honey...but it's pretty fantastic, I'll concede.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=seductive,<i>Oh, my</i>!  You could stare at that thing for hours and find new details.  Is it all muscle or all fat?
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=laughing,I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and guess that thing's from squatting, not too much candy.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:velma=laughing,<i>Aww, is someone blind without her glasses</i>?  Just crawl on the floor until you find them, then.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:velma=smug,Don't worry, dear, I won't get in the way.  You can crawl around <i>all you want</i> as you search for them.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:velma=teasing,The game must go on, dearie!  Don't worry, I'll enjoy the view of your butt sticking out as you search the floor.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:velma=teasing,Yeah, Parfet needs her glasses, too.  She's in better shape, though--go get some exercise crawling around looking for them.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia=shocked,Mejare only has animals in zoos--I guess they never wanted us to see them breed with the males.  This is crazy!
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia=seductive,I've...never seen a cat up close.  Are those claws real, too?  Where'd you come from?
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia=excited,Seeing a real cat is...it's nuts!  Mejare has almost no animals at all!
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia=excited,Omigosh, omigosh, omigosh!  Cats are so cool--I've never seen one until now, not up close!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible=interested,Come on, ~name~.  Naked already?  Look how much I'm wearing!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible=smug,Don't you have any fight left in you, ~name~?  Or do men just beat you poor Earth girls down?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible=laughing,A sad display thus far, but this last one could be pretty good.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible=vain,Shame Misty's too young for this place.  I'd like to see what Plutonians look like naked.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=teasing,Ooh, <i>bottomless</i>?  Maybe Earth women value their breasts more than I thought they did.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=vain,Breasts out last, huh, Mia?  I guess you Earth girls want to protect them...we Mejarians feel the same way about our wombs.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=vain,Oh, are you saving the chest for last?  I can understand...my breasts mean a lot to me, too.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=interested,Anything we should know about your breasts, dear?  You seem desperate to protect them.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=vain,Thinking about this again, I don't think I'd want to learn how to shoot like you do...or at least destroy my outfits with it.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=thinking,Do I <i>have</i> an outfit I'd be willing to destroy just for the spectacle?  I'd have to buy some rags for the occasion.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=stretching,I think I'd just <i>die</i> if I tried this.  Not from the bullets, but from seeing my wonderful dress in tatters.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=vain,You really are something else, Aimee.  You'd never catch <i>me</i> tearing up my beautiful wardrobe like that.  I'd have to steal more!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=laughing,Whoa, whoa, whoa, <i>what</i>?  Honey, that comes at the <i>end</i>!  Give us something to look forward to!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=interested,Uh...honey, that comes last, usually.  Were you raised in isolation?  Do you not know what audiences like?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=interested,...You're supposed to keep the audience guessing, dear.  This is certainly a curveball, but now you've got no surprises.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=laughing,Wait, <i>what</i>?  Hey, are you trying to be boring for the rest of the game?  Have some suspense!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=awkward,Hey, what are you two...<i>oh, my</i>.  That might be a little much even for me and Barnette.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=shocked,Hey, are you going to put those webs to...<i>use</i>.  Oh, dear.  Barnette might not go for that.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=awkward,That... looks like a lot of rope.  I might have to rethink inviting you over for some time with me and Barnette.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=awkward,...<i>Ooh</i>.  At first I thought your webs sounded cool, but...I'm not sure Barnette would like <i>this</i> much of them.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:vriska=stretching,But maybe you'll prove us all wrong.  Go right ahead.  More fashion for me.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:vriska=teasing,I'm waiting for you to stick it to me, Vriska.  I certainly <i>want</i> to see more cute outfits.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:vriska=teasing,Going to prove my predictions wrong?  If so, more fashion for me...I win either way.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:vriska=vain,By all means, deliver more adorable outfits upon me.  I don't care if you win.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=seductive,I'll freely admit to being enchanted--mostly from those flowers.  You only ever see that stuff in gardens on Mejare.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=vain,Must be nice sprouting flowers wherever you go.  They're so rare on Mejare...I wish I could give some to Barnette.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=vain,Flowers are so romantic and sweet-smelling...maybe you're too accustomed to it, but they're a rarity on Mejare.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=vain,You Earth girls are so spoiled when it comes to flowers.  You know how hard it is to start up a garden on Mejare?  We barely have plants!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=laughing,Well, that seals it.  You're a total nymph...disguised as an innocent little dork.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=stretching,It's always the dorky ones, isn't it?  I bet Parfet's a real wild child...Barnette and I are so dreadfully vanilla.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=vain,Being all sheltered must do this to nerdy types.  Barnette and I just kiss and hold hands like the pure angels we are.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=interested,This must be the only thrill you've gotten in years.  You nerdy types are so predictably dirty.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=vain,Reading too much must mess with nerd girls' sexualities.  One medical book got me obsessed with men, after all.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=vain,Panties first, you dorky little thing?  This must be thrilling for you...<i>I</i> can appreciate the warmth of a loving relationship.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=vain,I can respect a woman going bottomless.  Bare breasts have a tendency to just swing around all ungainly-like...tough for an athlete.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=teasing,Bottomless first?  Yeah, that fits your athletic attitude to keep your breasts all wrapped up tight.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=stretching,You gym rats and your worries about your breasts hitting you in the face or something.  Exercise ruins everything!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=smug,Of course the athlete goes bottomless.  She's worried her bare breasts will throw her off-balance.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=shocked,Wha--<i>ew!  Ew!  EW!  What's the matter with you</i>?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=shocked,...<i>Where's all the color</i>?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=shocked,...What <i>are</i> you?  You need a hospital!  You need <i>Mejarian</i> medicine!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=shocked,<i>Ack!  Ew!  Wha--what is that thing?  Ew!  Help!  Stop</i>!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=laughing,Oh, we've seen each other naked once or twice.  A day.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=interested,Well, Meia?  Have I seen your <i>you-know-what</i>?  Or do you not know what <i>it</i> is?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=laughing,Don't ask me how you managed to come here if you can barely spit out the word <i>vagina</i>.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=interested,The most important question of the night, isn't it, Leader?  Your <i>you-know-what</i> is such a mystery.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=stretching,Honestly, dear, what was your reason for wearing that leotard?  ...Well, I guess Barnette's pretty similar.  Must be how it feels.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=teasing,That leotard's pretty <i>tight</i>, honey.  Just digging up into you...my Barnette dresses the same way.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=vain,I can understand loving the way leotards feel downstairs.  My girlfriend wears something <i>just</i> like it.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=teasing,I <i>may</i> have tried on Barnette's outfit once...so I know how that leotard must be digging into your nether regions.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=laughing,You know you have a mask, right?  Or is Miss Wrestler actually a little shy about showing her whole face?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=smug,I guess you're more proud of your thighs than your face, because you still have a mask.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=stretching,You really want to be naked, don't you?  Hell, you're just skipping the mask altogether.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=vain,I just realized you still have the mask.  Is it <i>that</i> important to your image?  I understand, then.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=teasing,Well, how's <i>that</i> for karma?  Cover your breasts, and fate demands you show your cute little rear!  But of course, you wanted to.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=seductive,Ooh, what an adorable little behind!  Don't go and cover it, now!  <i>I know you don't really want to</i>.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=teasing,Nice and tight--you're just a tiny vixen of a girl, aren't you?  <i>Desperate</i> to strut your stuff.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=laughing,<i>Heeheeheehee</i>!  Seems fate would have you baring it all--that's what you want anyway, right?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=seductive,Oh, good.  Now you'd fit right in where I'm from!  Shaved is so much cuter.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=vain,Well, you might be a kitty-cat, but at least you know when enough is enough.  See, Mejare likes to be smooth and sleek.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=teasing,Cleanliness is a virtue on my planet!  So I like this shaving approach, Miss Kitty.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=laughing,Hey, take all the hair away!  This kitty needs to see the sun, after all.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia=vain,You're so self-conscious, Meia.  Learn from me for once and appreciate yourself!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia=vain,What are you all embarrased about?  The two of us have enough beauty to fill all of Earth's oceans.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia=laughing,This embarrassment of yours is really a stealth insult to these poor Earth women.  Mangled and torn up by men, with no genetic engineering to save them.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia=smug,Can you <i>believe</i> she's embarrassed?  Talk about setting ridiculous standards for yourself.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato=seductive,You're my kind of woman, Misato...sexually confident.  Can you teach me about men sometime?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato=seductive,You really know your way around Earth men, Misato--you're not shy at all!  You've got to teach me.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato=vain,Not to call you <i>easy</i>, dear, but you seem pretty experienced with these men...and confident.  <i>Teach me your ways</i>.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato=seductive,I can never get a man to like me, and yet you seem so experienced and confident.  What's your secret, Miss Military?
3-female_crotch_is_visible=smug,<i>What an incredibly rare sight for a Mejarian</i>.
3-female_crotch_is_visible=stretching,Meh.  I'd still say Barnette's is cuter.
3-female_crotch_is_visible=vain,Takes some regular maintainence, but a beautiful vagina is a sight unlike any other.
3-female_crotch_is_visible=smug,You won't be seeing <i>mine</i>, girlie.  At least, not until you learn how cards work.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=shocked,<i>Eek!  No!  I-I was just joking!  Don't use your magic</i>!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=shocked,<i>Ack!  M-magic?  I'm sorry I made fun of you</i>!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=shocked,<i>Wait, no!  You're very decent!  Extremely decent!  I'm sorry</i>!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=shocked,<i>Wait!  Stop!  D-don't shoot, or cast anything, or whatever</i>!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:vriska=laughing,<i>Come now, darling</i>!  I think that suits you just fine...technically covered, but people can see right past.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:vriska=interested,You're not <i>complaining</i> now, are you?  What, because you have to play fair like the rest of us?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:vriska=teasing,I thank you once again for the wonderful look at outfits across the universe.  But this pirate's done with you now.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:vriska=teasing,That's what happens when you play against a pirate, sweetie.  She strips you down eventually.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:0-9=vain,I should hope so!  She doesn't do all those squats in the gym because she thinks it's fun...or maybe she does, who knows.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:0-9=vain,Of course I would.  My Leader is more of a steal than she cares to admit!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:0-9=teasing,Hey, it's not a lack of beauty that keeps Meia single--it's a lack of smiling.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:0-9=stretching,Of course I agree, honey.  The trouble is getting <i>Meia</i> to do so, the neurotic little thing she is.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=shocked,Oh my God.  You weren't kidding.  You really <i>are</i> some kind of public whore.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=frustrated,...I'm gonna go home now and tell Barnette I love her.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=frustrated,...Earth is a scary planet.  I just wanted to have a little fun.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=shocked,...I swear I don't act like this.  I just think flirting is fun!  I have a girlfriend, honest!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma=smug,Maybe I'm judging you too harshly.  <i>I've</i> considered going commando beneath the dress...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma=interested,I guess I'm not much more covered under the dress, huh?  Perhaps we're more similar than I realized.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma=smug,Yeah, this is definitely giving you a thrill.  I wonder if <i>I'd</i> get the same sensation walking around in just the dress.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma=teasing,My dress is pretty much the only thing that covers me, too...<i>maybe we should swap</i>.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=smug,Pubic hair?  How gross...must be to attract men, those primal beasts.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=laughing,Pubic hair is so gross...whoops, guess that spoils <i>my</i> situation.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=laughing,You can't have all that hair.  What's your girlfriend supposed to do, come to bed with a machete in hand?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=bored,Gross, gross, <i>gross</i>.  Use some of that fancy Earth technology to <i>shave</i> before making nude public appearances.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia=vain,Oh, sure, maybe you're not as cute as Barnette or me, but you can't always compare yourself to the <i>best</i>.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia=vain,I'm telling you, boss, you're a steal!  Right below me and Barnette, of course.  But we have each other!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia=stretching,Any of these Earth women would be glad to have you.  Mejarians...well, you're in the running.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia=laughing,Hey, you're as cute as any other Mejarian...besides me.  Or Barnette.  Dita's probably got you beat, too.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=interested,Oh hey, your partner's stripping, too.  Just here for moral support, or are you two lovers?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=teasing,Did you really need help stripping, dear?  Or did you <i>want</i> her to strip you, you little lovebird?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=vain,So you've totally got a crush on this girl, right?  I get it...I would've asked Barnette to strip me if she were here.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=thinking,Maybe I should've brought <i>my</i> girlfriend here with me, too...nah, she wouldn't have gone for it.  She needs to lighten up.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=interested,Nothing else, huh?  Why'd you even play this game without dressing up?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=smug,Well, that didn't take long.  One wonders why you came to a strip poker joint just to practice personal hygiene.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=seductive,And...everything else is part of your body?  Absolutely crazy...but kind of cute.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=interested,You're a weird one, dear.  Let your hair grow out, then shave it...come to strip poker, don't wear anything.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=awkward,What are you--oh, dear.  That's <i>one</i> way to get off.  Is this how your "darlin'" does it?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=interested,I have a "darlin'," too...her name is Barnette.  And she doesn't ask me to graze her crotch with bullets.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=laughing,I guess when you can shoot your own clothes off, this is the kind of thing you need to do to reach orgasm.  Is your "darlin'" a good shot, too?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=laughing,These Earth girls just keep getting more depraved.  Your "darlin'" being a man must have done this to you, you poor thing.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=seductive,Still as cute as a button!  Why you'd want to hide that body, I can only wonder...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=teasing,Must be the neuroses of a royal that made you ashamed of your body.  No other explanation...you're <i>cute</i>.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=seductive,Ohhh, you're like a little chestnut of adorableness!  Why'd you hide your body from me, huh, sweetie?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=seductive,You barely look a day into womanhood, darling.  It's hard to find you erotic when I just want to <i>squeeze</i> you instead!


#lost choker
4-male_chest_will_be_visible=interested,Be honest.  You men <i>like</i> stripping in front of women, don't you?
4-male_chest_will_be_visible=laughing,You're braver than a Tarakkian.  They'd want as many layers as possible between them and my teeth.
4-male_chest_will_be_visible=seductive,Careful, ~name~.  Women eat men for dinner, or so Tarakkians think!
4-male_chest_will_be_visible=laughing,I can see that hungry look in your eyes...and a disturbance near your groin.  You're <i>loving</i> this.
4-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:link=bored,...<i>Nin-ten-doh</i>?  <i>Character</i>?  This guy's <i>nuts</i>...I better avoid his seed.
4-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:link=interested,...That was a <i>character</i>?  Yeah, I can see why you're playing to strangers in a dump like this.
4-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:link=laughing,You were doing a <i>character</i>?  Is that what men connect to, a grunting buffoon?
4-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:link=laughing,I'm sorry, you <i>broke</i> character?  That implies there <i>was</i> one, dear.  You know, with emotions and speech.
4-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=teasing,So, Little Dungeon Bot...are you built <i>exactly</i> like a man?
4-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=seductive,I'm so dreadfully uninformed about men's bodies, 9S.  Is your artificial body a good enough substitute?
4-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=teasing,You're a little shy about being fake, right?  Well...here's your chance to show me you're a <i>real</i> boy.
4-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=seductive,Can an android really satisfy my unending curiosity about men's muscles?  Give it a shot, honey.
4-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=interested,Ooh, does little Angel-boy want to go topless?  I hear you men don't treat that with quite the concern <i>we</i> do.
4-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=seductive,I've <i>never</i> seen men naked before, Pit...<i>won't you get your chest out</i>?  I hear men don't care about that anyway.
4-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=teasing,Is it true that men get topless all the time?  I want to see if Mr. Angel is rocking any <i>muscles</i> beneath his stammering.
4-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=seductive,Oh, please, Mr. Angel, I'm <i>desperate</i> to see a man nude...can't you show me your chest?  Men don't mind that, right?
4-male_chest_is_visible=teasing,Men have so many muscles, and they're so much taller and stronger.  Good thing women are smarter!
4-male_chest_is_visible=laughing,Mmm...<i>all those delicious organs for me to gobble up</i>.
4-male_chest_is_visible=excited,All those delicious <i>muscles</i>.  How do men pull it off, when they look so strange on a woman?
4-male_chest_is_visible=teasing,Well, now!  All those muscles.  If you're into exercise, it's the easy way to get on Meia's good side.
4-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=confused,...OK, now I'm <i>really</i> confused.  Men can have breasts?  You're not all that fat.
4-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=bored,...I don't think you're a person at this point.  A man with breasts?  What a horrifying sight...
4-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=angry,OK, seriously.  Breasts on a man?  What the hell are you?  Besides totally gross.
4-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=frustrated,...I really thought breasts separated men and women pretty cleanly.  Then again, you don't seem human at all.
4-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=teasing,Oh, that's...not so bad!  About as many muscles as they had in that book I read...though your height leaves something to be desired.
4-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=teasing,Not bad, honey, but I expected a little better from such a tiny man.  Doesn't being short make gaining muscle easier?
4-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=vain,Oh, don't feel <i>too</i> bad.  Hibiki is short, and he's not too ripped either...even though he'd be much more handsome that way.
4-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=stretching,Nothing to be embarrassed about, dear.  Well, maybe your <i>height</i> is.  Work on that instead.
4-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=confused,...Wait, I thought men had nipples.  Did I read that wrong?  I was mostly staring at their abs.
4-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=angry,...Are you pulling my leg?  Do men have nipples or not?  Did your makers just forget them?
4-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=confused,...Did your creators run out of budget when it came to your nipples, or do men just not have them?
4-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=confused,Uh, you seem to be missing something there, dear.  Or...do men not have nipples?  How do they breastfeed?
4-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=confused,Oh, men wear the same underwear we do?  Well, why won't our prisoners show me theirs, then?
4-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=confused,...Are you <i>sure</i> you're not a woman, dear?  Because that underwear looks pretty feminine...unless men and women share styles.
4-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=laughing,Uh...wow.  I really thought men and women would wear different underwear.  Women know better than to tear it up, you know?
4-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=vain,Do men really wear the same underwear women do?  Not that <i>I</i> own any lingerie...pirates can't afford much.
4-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=smug,Interesting choice of underwear, sweetheart.  <i>Women</i> wear that...I wouldn't think men would.  Too delicate for them.
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible=vain,A man's tube?  <i>My heart's all aflutter.</i>
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible=seductive,I've seen it in Duero's book, but high time I saw the <i>real</i> thing.
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible=laughing,Finally, I get to see a man's tube.  Too bad you couldn't see my breasts first.
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible=vain,Oho!  The most forbidden image on all of Mejare, and I get a front-row seat.  I'm such a rebel!
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=stretching,Well, since you're not exactly fully equipped up above, I'm not expecting much.
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=smug,Did your creators spend any more time developing a full tube for you, dear?  I hope so.
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=teasing,I've learned not to trust androids' anatomy, considering last time.  What's your situation <i>downstairs</i>?
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=seductive,I know you're artificial, but <i>please</i> try to teach me something about men this time, OK?
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pit=seductive,Omigosh, Pit, are you showing your tube?  It's not a little tiny thing, is it?  I hear they can get pretty big!
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pit=seductive,Hey, Angel-boy...do you have a <i>man</i>-sized tube?  If so, I might just fall for your cute little winged self.
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pit=teasing,Normally I go for tall, strong men...but Hibiki's short like you, and he's kind of cute like you, too.  Do you have a decent-sized tube?
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pit=teasing,It's my understanding men's tubes can vary in size, Pit.  I'm willing to overlook shortness in a man if he puts his girth elsewhere.
4-male_small_crotch_is_visible=sad,...Is that really it?  ...<i>Really</i>?
4-male_small_crotch_is_visible=bored,...Hm.  I guess I built it up too much in my mind.
4-male_small_crotch_is_visible=angry,...<i>Seriously</i>?  <i>That's</i> what I got all excited for?
4-male_small_crotch_is_visible=awkward,Wow.  If <i>yours</i> is that small, Hibiki's got no shot at all.
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=awkward,So...what does a girl do with it again?  How's the seed come out?
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=interested,Hibiki is so darn protective of his.  I just want to take a peek...and maybe collect some seed.
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=confused,How's it stand up like that?  Something with blood, right?  Where's the blood come from?
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=interested,It's blood that makes it stand, right?  Mejare's schools teach that men have acid for blood.
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s=seductive,Ohh, that's cute!  So it's actually accurate?  <i>Interesting</i>...
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s=seductive,Ooh, that <i>does</i> match what I've seen!  Maybe what I really needed from a man was some <i>artificiality</i>...
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s=seductive,Oho!  And it <i>works</i>?  Perhaps a <i>mechanical</i> man is what I've been searching for this whole time.
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s=teasing,Ooh, maybe <i>human</i> men are overrated.  What do you think, dear?  Could you satisfy a woman?
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=teasing,I don't have a frame of reference myself, but...that looks pretty good!  A comfortable fit...<i>if you think you can convince me</i>.
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=seductive,Hey, I'm not going to pretend to be an expert--and that doesn't look half bad!  Maybe I'll collect <i>your</i> seed, cutie.
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=seductive,Ooh, that looks perfectly manageable!  As much as I'm drawn to the burly types, you are just <i>so</i> cute...I'm considering.
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=vain,Looks like a decent fit, darling...maybe <i>you'll</i> give me my baby.  She'll be such a cute little girl!
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=seductive,Oh, that looks OK!  I'm delicate, so I was worried it might be painful to stuff inside me...<i>God</i>, you're so adorable.
4-male_large_crotch_is_visible=excited,How's it get so <i>big</i>?  Are they <i>all</i> that big?
4-male_large_crotch_is_visible=seductive,If they're <i>all</i> that big, Mejare's really been missing out all these years.
4-male_large_crotch_is_visible=excited,B.C.'s pretty tall.  If she still has hers, I bet it's big, too...
4-male_large_crotch_is_visible=excited,I see Mejare isn't the <i>only</i> planet that uses genetic engineering for some...enlargement.
4-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=awkward,...You're an <i>outlier</i>, right, Ryu?  Or does all that fighting make a man's thing grow?
4-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=shocked,<i>Eek!  I--I take it back!  Don't touch me with that thing--I don't care about your muscles</i>!
4-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=shocked,<i>Eek</i>!  Y-you can't put that thing inside me!  It'd kill me before your muscles did!
4-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=awkward,That's, uh...a little oversized.  Maybe you could just squeeze me with your muscles and we could have sex that way?
4-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=angry,...OK, I know how big it's <i>supposed</i> to be.  You're just a weird freak imitation of a man.
4-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=shocked,<i>Aaaack!  Help!  W-what is that thing?  That's not a--a tube, a penis, whatever</i>!
4-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=bored,...You're <i>definitely</i> not a man.  I come from a planet of women, and still I know that for sure.
4-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=shocked,<i>Eeeek!  Y-you're a monster, not a man!  G-get away from me!  Keep your tube</i>!
4-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=frustrated,...Are you the <i>average</i> size?  Because I retract anything I said about having sex with men, then.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible=vain,Try not to feel jealous.  I tend to have that effect on women.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible=teasing,It's OK to be jealous.  But know that <i>all</i> breasts are beautiful--mine are just the most!
4-female_chest_will_be_visible=vain,Meia's a total bore, but you can't call her cowardly.  This wouldn't even faze her.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible=interested,Good, some Earth-grown nipples.  Hopefully men's fangs haven't chewed them all up.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia=smug,Everyone give Meia some space.  She's ridiculously neurotic about this for some reason.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia=teasing,I know Meia's false modesty about this might spite you Earth ladies...but she's not malicious, just a head case.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia=laughing,You'll have to excuse my boss's neuroses concerning her chest.  She sees things that aren't there...or the opposite, rather.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia=smug,Oh, here we go again.  Meia's gonna bellyache like there's something wrong with her chest.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,Try not to feel jealous.  I tend to have that effect on women.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,It's OK to be jealous.  But know that <i>all</i> breasts are beautiful--mine are just the most!
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,alsoPlaying:meia=interested,Good, some Earth-grown nipples.  Hopefully men's fangs haven't chewed them all up.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=laughing,<i>Well, Meia?  Are you going to do it, with my hungry eyes boring into you</i>?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=interested,You heard Elizabeth, Leader.  Are you going to show your breasts to your second-in-command?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=stretching,Liz is right, Meia--this is very awkward.  It's only, what, the hundredth time I've seen you naked?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=stretching,<i>Oh, my!  Not Meia's breasts!  Oh, Elizabeth, why must you remind me of this horror</i>?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:vriska=stretching,There she goes again.  Some girls never learn...even if they've got magical dice.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:vriska=interested,The gimmick's played out, honey.  You can just be normal like the rest of us.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:vriska=teasing,It doesn't matter how brilliant your light show is, darling...people only get dazzled once.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:vriska=smug,You'd be surprised what humans can get used to, dear.  This isn't impressive anymore.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=smug,With my pilot's keen eye for patterns, I'm guessing the bra isn't coming off <i>this</i> time, either.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=teasing,My instincts are finely honed from piloting, you know.  I see those little things you still have!
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=stretching,Oh, please.  You've got that hat, the nose, the tie, and you think I'm buying the bra after <i>last</i> time?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=stretching,Just get the trick over with, Whiteface.  I see about three different ways you could avoid the bra, and I'm just glancing.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=stretching,Should have expected as much from Miss Grape-flavored over here.  She's going to strip totally backwards, isn't she?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=teasing,I don't know what I expected.  Your stripping order's got us all on the edge of our seats!
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=stretching,I like to tease...Miss Grape-flavored here just likes to get to the point.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=laughing,Men seem pretty simple and stupid.  I bet they like how you just skip to the good stuff.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=laughing,Wait, your breasts are out already?  Even <i>I</i> brought some accessories to stave it off!
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=interested,Wow, you athletes get straight to the point, don't you?  This is your second loss!
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=interested,I know you're proud of your strength, honey, but wearing a lot of clothes is what wins games here.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=stretching,Well, that was fast.  Not wearing much?  I guess athletes can't help but try to set new best times.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=bored,...Or she's just going to strip part of the stems.  Apparently this place has no rules at all.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=bored,...Or that could happen.  I swear, you could count each of your fingers as a layer in this dump...
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=annoyed,...I doll myself up for this evening on a foreign planet, and Little Miss Forest Sprite goes around counting flowers as layers.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=frustrated,...OK, yeah.  It was funny for one round, but that's not clothing.  This girl's a bigger tease than I am.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=interested,I guess firing straight up makes it a little easier to hit your mark.  Must be a breeze for you.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=seductive,You sure are confident.  I know I <i>act</i> that way, but you really put your money where your mouth is.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=vain,I'm really no good with weapons at all...ground combat is an awful mess.  That's why my Dread is so fun to pilot!
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=teasing,You're still so cool.  But with this sort of thing, maybe it's best not to push your luck...
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=interested,What are you planning, Miss Pixie?  You've got a mischievous look in your eye...well, more mischievous than usual.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=interested,You look like you're plotting something, Kyu.  Mind making it known to the rest of us?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=teasing,Hey, Miss Pixie.  Stop going on about nonsense like usual and show those cute fairy breasts of yours.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=smug,What are you on about now?  Stop stalling for time and show your chest, Miss Pixie.  I don't have all evening.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:felicia=shocked,Wait, you really <i>are</i> a cat?  Like, that's <i>fur</i>?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:felicia=shocked,Wait, you're <i>real</i>?  H-how does that work?  Did Earth crossbreed cats and women?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:felicia=shocked,<i>Eeek</i>!  T-that's <i>real</i> fur?  You're a cat?  Omigosh!
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:felicia=shocked,Wait, I thought that was just skimpy clothing?  You're <i>really</i> a cat?  And it's fur?  B-but how?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=annoyed,Wonderful.  Yes.  Worth the wait.  I've never seen breasts before.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=awkward,Those...actually look pretty normal.  I'm surprised.  I thought they'd have teeth marks.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=awkward,...OK.  Maybe you were just kidding about that public-use stuff.  Those look fine...
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=angry,I was worried there...OK.  So you were mostly kidding about getting screwed in public.  That's not funny!
4-female_small_chest_is_visible=awkward,Uh...so where are they?  You're a <i>woman</i>, right?
4-female_small_chest_is_visible=laughing,I guess Bart isn't the <i>only</i> man to dress up as a woman.
4-female_small_chest_is_visible=awkward,The Nirvana's hot springs make breasts grow, we think...maybe you should give that a shot.
4-female_small_chest_is_visible=awkward,...That's just depressing.  Did your parents not feed you or something?
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:7b=interested,Something the matter, dear?  Run out of cute outfits to hide your...well, <i>lack</i> of breasts?
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:7b=laughing,...Yeah, I'd try not to strip normally if <i>those</i> were all I had.
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:7b=laughing,Aww, don't feel bad.  Those pants are cute...they clash with the blue of your flat chest.
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:7b=vain,Well, now I can see why you were shy.  But a woman should stand proud!  ...Hard to say that when there's no flat Mejarians.
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:7a=laughing,You roll a die that could give you an outfit like <i>that</i>, and you get embarrassed?  Honestly...
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:7a=laughing,Aww, what are you so embarrassed about, darling?  Well, I guess that bikini is supposed to be stretched a little.
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:7a=interested,Not filling up that bikini quite how you want to, dear?  Is that why you're blushing?
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:7a=laughing,Cute little blue nipples you've got there.  Too bad you don't have the breasts behind them to fill that bikini.
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:videl=laughing,Using your hair to cover them?  That gives me an idea...but it's not quite what <i>you</i> came up with.
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:videl=stretching,Come on, sweetie, those are cute!  Don't cover them up with your hair...actually, that gives me an idea.
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:videl=vain,Is that why you have those cute little pigtails?  Modesty just holds the strong woman back...and you've just given me an idea.
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:videl=seductive,Oh, are you using your pigtails to cover them?  Clever...and it's just made me think of a great little maneuver of my own.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible=excited,Ohhhh, they're so <i>cute</i>!
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible=teasing,Healthy size, ~name~.  You'd do well on Mejare.  You know, as a worker or something.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible=stretching,The Nirvana's hot springs have made mine even bigger with their female hormones.  Yet the men still want to go in!
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible=seductive,Not bad at all.  If I didn't have my lovely Barnette waiting for me back on the Nirvana, I might have a closer eye on you.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=teasing,Oh!  Well, that's as good as the alternative, I suppose.  <i>I'm starting to see through the pretenses here</i>.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=smug,These tricks are really getting desperate, dear.  But hey, I think I'm starting to get what your <i>real</i> job is.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=laughing,Hey, I know what a stripper is.  If clown is just a fancy term for that on Earth, this is all going to make more sense.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=interested,...Honey, are you just a stripper in fancy makeup?  You'd be much better off dropping these silly tricks and just moving your hips a little.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=interested,How many times do you plan on revealing those things before it takes?  They're just breasts, woman.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=frustrated,You're more neurotic than even Meia when it comes to those things.  Practically had to hold you down to get you to show them.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=interested,At least they're finally out.  With how you've been acting, I thought you had a chunk of them missing or something.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=vain,Earth girls are so ridiculously conservative.  I've got breasts just like you, and you're worried about me seeing the damn things.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=smug,I don't have to, dear.  Meia's already convinced they do.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=interested,It doesn't matter how many compliments you pay to her breasts, honey.  She's a total head case about them.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=stretching,Oh, I've told her many times that her breasts are just fine.  Nothing penetrates her ridiculuous neuroses.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=smug,If I did, I'd just be confirming what Meia already inexplicably believes.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=interested,You really like showing off the goods, don't you?  Going to cover them up with other things so you can keep on doing it?
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=laughing,It's the exposure you prefer more than the exhibitionism, isn't it?  You just like the reveal!
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=stretching,There's just no stopping you, honey...well, maybe when you run out of clothes.  How tragic will <i>that</i> be?
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=laughing,What is <i>up</i> with this girl?  You really know how to blow through an audience's attention.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=laughing,<i>Awww, is Little Miss Princess embarrassed?  Should I get you some warm milk and a servant girl</i>?
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=interested,Is something the matter, honey?  Are your delicate princess breasts all mangled up by men?
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=teasing,Got something to hide, Princess Dearest?  Afraid to bare them to the big, bad pirate lady?
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=laughing,What's the matter, darling?  Afraid this pirate will take your breasts and put up a ransom?
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:6=awkward,...Huh.  At this point I really have no clue what you're going for.  Maybe I'd understand if Mejare had clowns.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:6=bored,...This <i>clowning</i> business is strange.  No wonder the colonists didn't want any on Mejare.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:6=frustrated,...Clowns really are full of surprises...but I'm more baffled than entertained.  If only I grew up around some.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:6=bored,...You should know that, on the planet I come from, clowns seem to be extinct.  Just some...food for thought.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=excited,Wha--<i>oh my gosh</i>!  <i>Magic</i>?  Do it again!  That was so cool!
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=excited,What did you--<i>ooh!  Ooh</i>!  You really <i>are</i> a fairy!  Show me some more magic!
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=excited,Omigosh!  You weren't kidding around!  Magic is so cool!  Do something else!
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=teasing,...Oh my God.  <i>Magic</i>?  Well, then...what <i>else</i> can you do, hm?
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=bored,And she just keeps prattling on...<i>mine</i> are much better.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=bored,Should I stop teasing with her around, or just do it harder so she knows how to do it properly?
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=annoyed,...Look, they're not <i>that</i> great, OK?  Just shut up already...
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=annoyed,And they say <i>I</i> have an ego.  Mine are bigger than that and I don't go on about them this much!
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia=stretching,See?  Perfectly healthy...plenty big enough to be a Fama.  But she's all bent out of shape about them.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia=interested,You've got to give yourself more credit, Meia.  One day you're going to careen into an asteroid because you're too busy criticizing your piloting efficiency.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia=teasing,You can't even control it!  Stop worrying so much and look at the insect bites these poor Earth girls have to work with.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia=interested,Hey, Earth wants to harvest us for a reason.  So they'd <i>literally</i> kill to have your breasts.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=teasing,I'm telling you, Barnette is <i>always</i> dragging me to the firing range.  You two would be smitten!  ...Maybe I better keep her away from you.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=smug,It's nothing but <i>guns this, ammo that</i> with my girlfriend.  I better not bring you to the Nirvana, or she'll leave me for you.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=interested,I better engage more with Barnette's gun hobby.  One look at you and she'd toss me to the curb.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=vain,Maybe I should try to have more in common with Barnette.  She loves those icky men's guns as much as you do...she's got a whole collection.
4-female_large_chest_is_visible=smug,Forgive me for not being impressed.  I've been looking at breasts that big since I hit puberty.
4-female_large_chest_is_visible=teasing,If you want to break Meia's composure, whip those out.  It's the one thing that always gets her all worked up.
4-female_large_chest_is_visible=vain,Mine are just <i>begging</i> to come loose.  Can't you make it happen?
4-female_large_chest_is_visible=vain,I think Barnette wishes hers were that big.  But I like her just the way she is!
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:velma=laughing,<i>Aww, is someone blind without her glasses</i>?  Just crawl on the floor until you find them, then.
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:velma=smug,Don't worry, dear, I won't get in the way.  You can crawl around <i>all you want</i> as you search for them.
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:velma=teasing,The game must go on, dearie!  Don't worry, I'll enjoy the view of your butt sticking out as you search the floor.
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:velma=teasing,Yeah, Parfet needs her glasses, too.  She's in better shape, though--go get some exercise crawling around looking for them.
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=teasing,I see you're lugging quite a lot in back, too.  Must make your legs pretty strong!
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=seductive,<i>Well, now</i>!  I can see why you wanted to be naked--just look at the size of that thing!  But you wear it well.
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=smug,Yeah, yeah.  You've got enough in back for a whole extra woman, honey...but it's pretty fantastic, I'll concede.
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=seductive,<i>Oh, my</i>!  You could stare at that thing for hours and find new details.  Is it all muscle or all fat?
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=laughing,I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and guess that thing's from squatting, not too much candy.
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,Forgive me for not being impressed.  I've been looking at breasts that big since I hit puberty.
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,See that look on Meia's face?  Busty girls always get to her.
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,Mine are just <i>begging</i> to come loose.  Can't you make it happen?
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,I think Barnette wishes hers were that big.  But I like her just the way she is!
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia=shocked,Mejare only has animals in zoos--I guess they never wanted us to see them breed with the males.  This is crazy!
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia=seductive,I've...never seen a cat up close.  Are those claws real, too?  Where'd you come from?
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia=excited,Seeing a real cat is...it's nuts!  Mejare has almost no animals at all!
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia=excited,Omigosh, omigosh, omigosh!  Cats are so cool--I've never seen one until now, not up close!
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible=laughing,Oooh.  Barnette has the decency to get me out of my dress first.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible=teasing,I hear men can have breasts, too.  Time to prove you're <i>really</i> a woman.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible=teasing,Let's see what Earth men have to work with.  And women, if only you knew better.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible=teasing,Feeling good, ~name~?  Hope you'll enjoy the breeze.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=teasing,Well, how's <i>that</i> for karma?  Cover your breasts, and fate demands you show your cute little rear!  But of course, you wanted to.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=seductive,Ooh, what an adorable little behind!  Don't go and cover it, now!  <i>I know you don't really want to</i>.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=teasing,Nice and tight--you're just a tiny vixen of a girl, aren't you?  <i>Desperate</i> to strut your stuff.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=laughing,<i>Heeheeheehee</i>!  Seems fate would have you baring it all--that's what you want anyway, right?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=awkward,Hey, what are you two...<i>oh, my</i>.  That might be a little much even for me and Barnette.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=shocked,Hey, are you going to put those webs to...<i>use</i>.  Oh, dear.  Barnette might not go for that.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=awkward,That... looks like a lot of rope.  I might have to rethink inviting you over for some time with me and Barnette.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=awkward,...<i>Ooh</i>.  At first I thought your webs sounded cool, but...I'm not sure Barnette would like <i>this</i> much of them.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=laughing,Oh, we've seen each other naked once or twice.  A day.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=interested,Well, Meia?  Have I seen your <i>you-know-what</i>?  Or do you not know what <i>it</i> is?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=laughing,Don't ask me how you managed to come here if you can barely spit out the word <i>vagina</i>.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=interested,The most important question of the night, isn't it, Leader?  Your <i>you-know-what</i> is such a mystery.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=laughing,You know you have a mask, right?  Or is Miss Wrestler actually a little shy about showing her whole face?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=smug,I guess you're more proud of your thighs than your face, because you still have a mask.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=stretching,You really want to be naked, don't you?  Hell, you're just skipping the mask altogether.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=vain,I just realized you still have the mask.  Is it <i>that</i> important to your image?  I understand, then.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=vain,I can respect a woman going bottomless.  Bare breasts have a tendency to just swing around all ungainly-like...tough for an athlete.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=teasing,Bottomless first?  Yeah, that fits your athletic attitude to keep your breasts all wrapped up tight.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=stretching,You gym rats and your worries about your breasts hitting you in the face or something.  Exercise ruins everything!
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=smug,Of course the athlete goes bottomless.  She's worried her bare breasts will throw her off-balance.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:vriska=stretching,But maybe you'll prove us all wrong.  Go right ahead.  More fashion for me.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:vriska=teasing,I'm waiting for you to stick it to me, Vriska.  I certainly <i>want</i> to see more cute outfits.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:vriska=teasing,Going to prove my predictions wrong?  If so, more fashion for me...I win either way.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:vriska=vain,By all means, deliver more adorable outfits upon me.  I don't care if you win.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=laughing,Well, that seals it.  You're a total nymph...disguised as an innocent little dork.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=stretching,It's always the dorky ones, isn't it?  I bet Parfet's a real wild child...Barnette and I are so dreadfully vanilla.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=vain,Being all sheltered must do this to nerdy types.  Barnette and I just kiss and hold hands like the pure angels we are.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=interested,This must be the only thrill you've gotten in years.  You nerdy types are so predictably dirty.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=vain,Reading too much must mess with nerd girls' sexualities.  One medical book got me obsessed with men, after all.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=vain,Panties first, you dorky little thing?  This must be thrilling for you...<i>I</i> can appreciate the warmth of a loving relationship.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia=vain,<i>What would your subordinate pilots think</i>?  The shame of it all...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia=teasing,I shouldn't be seeing my Leader like this.  My brain says no...but your figure tells my heart <i>yes</i>.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia=vain,What is it about this that makes it so much better than the showers or spa?  That you're being forced?  Oh, Leader, <i>you shame us</i>.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia=teasing,I may be losing all respect for you, Leader.  Publicly nude...it's a shameful mark on our fine pirating organization.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=shocked,Wha--<i>ew!  Ew!  EW!  What's the matter with you</i>?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=shocked,...<i>Where's all the color</i>?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=shocked,...What <i>are</i> you?  You need a hospital!  You need <i>Mejarian</i> medicine!
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=shocked,<i>Ack!  Ew!  Wha--what is that thing?  Ew!  Help!  Stop</i>!
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=stretching,Honestly, dear, what was your reason for wearing that leotard?  ...Well, I guess Barnette's pretty similar.  Must be how it feels.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=teasing,That leotard's pretty <i>tight</i>, honey.  Just digging up into you...my Barnette dresses the same way.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=vain,I can understand loving the way leotards feel downstairs.  My girlfriend wears something <i>just</i> like it.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=teasing,I <i>may</i> have tried on Barnette's outfit once...so I know how that leotard must be digging into your nether regions.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=laughing,Whoa, whoa, whoa, <i>what</i>?  Honey, that comes at the <i>end</i>!  Give us something to look forward to!
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=interested,Uh...honey, that comes last, usually.  Were you raised in isolation?  Do you not know what audiences like?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=interested,...You're supposed to keep the audience guessing, dear.  This is certainly a curveball, but now you've got no surprises.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=laughing,Wait, <i>what</i>?  Hey, are you trying to be boring for the rest of the game?  Have some suspense!
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=vain,Thinking about this again, I don't think I'd want to learn how to shoot like you do...or at least destroy my outfits with it.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=thinking,Do I <i>have</i> an outfit I'd be willing to destroy just for the spectacle?  I'd have to buy some rags for the occasion.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=stretching,I think I'd just <i>die</i> if I tried this.  Not from the bullets, but from seeing my wonderful dress in tatters.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=vain,You really are something else, Aimee.  You'd never catch <i>me</i> tearing up my beautiful wardrobe like that.  I'd have to steal more!
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=teasing,Ooh, <i>bottomless</i>?  Maybe Earth women value their breasts more than I thought they did.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=vain,Breasts out last, huh, Mia?  I guess you Earth girls want to protect them...we Mejarians feel the same way about our wombs.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=vain,Oh, are you saving the chest for last?  I can understand...my breasts mean a lot to me, too.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=interested,Anything we should know about your breasts, dear?  You seem desperate to protect them.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato=seductive,You're my kind of woman, Misato...sexually confident.  Can you teach me about men sometime?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato=seductive,You really know your way around Earth men, Misato--you're not shy at all!  You've got to teach me.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato=vain,Not to call you <i>easy</i>, dear, but you seem pretty experienced with these men...and confident.  <i>Teach me your ways</i>.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato=seductive,I can never get a man to like me, and yet you seem so experienced and confident.  What's your secret, Miss Military?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=seductive,Oh, good.  Now you'd fit right in where I'm from!  Shaved is so much cuter.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=vain,Well, you might be a kitty-cat, but at least you know when enough is enough.  See, Mejare likes to be smooth and sleek.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=teasing,Cleanliness is a virtue on my planet!  So I like this shaving approach, Miss Kitty.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=laughing,Hey, take all the hair away!  This kitty needs to see the sun, after all.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=seductive,I'll freely admit to being enchanted--mostly from those flowers.  You only ever see that stuff in gardens on Mejare.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=vain,Must be nice sprouting flowers wherever you go.  They're so rare on Mejare...I wish I could give some to Barnette.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=vain,Flowers are so romantic and sweet-smelling...maybe you're too accustomed to it, but they're a rarity on Mejare.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=vain,You Earth girls are so spoiled when it comes to flowers.  You know how hard it is to start up a garden on Mejare?  We barely have plants!
4-female_crotch_is_visible=vain,Pristine, in your own way.  A woman's body needs to match her personality!
4-female_crotch_is_visible=vain,Meia's all insecure about her breasts.  But her groin?  Proud to display it.
4-female_crotch_is_visible=teasing,How many of my crewmates have snuck a peek at me in the showers?  Enough to be confident in my beauty.
4-female_crotch_is_visible=interested,What a cute little thing.  I guess Earth girls can be delicate after all.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma=smug,Maybe I'm judging you too harshly.  <i>I've</i> considered going commando beneath the dress...
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma=interested,I guess I'm not much more covered under the dress, huh?  Perhaps we're more similar than I realized.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma=smug,Yeah, this is definitely giving you a thrill.  I wonder if <i>I'd</i> get the same sensation walking around in just the dress.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma=teasing,My dress is pretty much the only thing that covers me, too...<i>maybe we should swap</i>.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=interested,Nothing else, huh?  Why'd you even play this game without dressing up?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=smug,Well, that didn't take long.  One wonders why you came to a strip poker joint just to practice personal hygiene.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=seductive,And...everything else is part of your body?  Absolutely crazy...but kind of cute.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=interested,You're a weird one, dear.  Let your hair grow out, then shave it...come to strip poker, don't wear anything.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=shocked,Oh my God.  You weren't kidding.  You really <i>are</i> some kind of public whore.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=frustrated,...I'm gonna go home now and tell Barnette I love her.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=frustrated,...Earth is a scary planet.  I just wanted to have a little fun.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=shocked,...I swear I don't act like this.  I just think flirting is fun!  I have a girlfriend, honest!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=awkward,What are you--oh, dear.  That's <i>one</i> way to get off.  Is this how your "darlin'" does it?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=interested,I have a "darlin'," too...her name is Barnette.  And she doesn't ask me to graze her crotch with bullets.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=laughing,I guess when you can shoot your own clothes off, this is the kind of thing you need to do to reach orgasm.  Is your "darlin'" a good shot, too?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=laughing,These Earth girls just keep getting more depraved.  Your "darlin'" being a man must have done this to you, you poor thing.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=shocked,<i>Eek!  No!  I-I was just joking!  Don't use your magic</i>!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=shocked,<i>Ack!  M-magic?  I'm sorry I made fun of you</i>!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=shocked,<i>Wait, no!  You're very decent!  Extremely decent!  I'm sorry</i>!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=shocked,<i>Wait!  Stop!  D-don't shoot, or cast anything, or whatever</i>!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:vriska=laughing,<i>Come now, darling</i>!  I think that suits you just fine...technically covered, but people can see right past.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:vriska=interested,You're not <i>complaining</i> now, are you?  What, because you have to play fair like the rest of us?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:vriska=teasing,I thank you once again for the wonderful look at outfits across the universe.  But this pirate's done with you now.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:vriska=teasing,That's what happens when you play against a pirate, sweetie.  She strips you down eventually.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,Pristine, in your own way.  A woman's body needs to match her personality!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,Proud to display yours, right, Meia.  Not your breasts, but this is fine?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,How many of my crewmates have I snuck a peek at in the showers?  Enough to be confident in my beauty.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,alsoPlaying:meia=interested,What a cute little thing.  I guess Earth girls can be delicate after all.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy,alsoPlaying:meia,priority:151=vain,All that pubic hair...just gross.  Earth is uninhabitable, Meia!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy,alsoPlaying:meia,priority:151=shocked,Yeah, I--<i>eek</i>!  W-why are you so hairy?  It's gross!  Cover it up!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy,alsoPlaying:meia,priority:151=awkward,...You know, the Nirvana's spa attendants will shave you if you ask.  Maybe you should...look into that?  For my sake?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy,alsoPlaying:meia,priority:151=bored,<i>Ewww</i>...what's with the <i>jungle</i>?  Way to slack off on the hygiene, darling.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=interested,All that pubic hair...<i>that</i> might actually get a reaction from Meia.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=shocked,Yeah, I--<i>eek</i>!  W-why are you so hairy?  It's gross!  Cover it up!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=awkward,...You know, the Nirvana's spa attendants will shave you if you ask.  Maybe you should...look into that?  For my sake?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=bored,<i>Ewww</i>...what's with the <i>jungle</i>?  Way to slack off on the hygiene, darling.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia=laughing,Want me to strip, too?  Just to distract everyone from staring at you?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia=teasing,Hey, everyone...I'm not far off from her situation, in case you want some more Mejarian full-frontal action.  Shall I just get it over with?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia=vain,I can feel my dress slipping off just looking at you.  Want me to do it?  Don't forget I'm taken!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia=teasing,I feel so bad for you, all bare and bashful like that.  <i>Should I strip to make my boss feel better</i>?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:0-9=vain,I should hope so!  She doesn't do all those squats in the gym because she thinks it's fun...or maybe she does, who knows.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:0-9=vain,Of course I would.  My Leader is more of a steal than she cares to admit!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:0-9=teasing,Hey, it's not a lack of beauty that keeps Meia single--it's a lack of smiling.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:0-9=stretching,Of course I agree, honey.  The trouble is getting <i>Meia</i> to do so, the neurotic little thing she is.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=interested,Oh hey, your partner's stripping, too.  Just here for moral support, or are you two lovers?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=teasing,Did you really need help stripping, dear?  Or did you <i>want</i> her to strip you, you little lovebird?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=vain,So you've totally got a crush on this girl, right?  I get it...I would've asked Barnette to strip me if she were here.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=thinking,Maybe I should've brought <i>my</i> girlfriend here with me, too...nah, she wouldn't have gone for it.  She needs to lighten up.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=seductive,Still as cute as a button!  Why you'd want to hide that body, I can only wonder...
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=teasing,Must be the neuroses of a royal that made you ashamed of your body.  No other explanation...you're <i>cute</i>.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=seductive,Ohhh, you're like a little chestnut of adorableness!  Why'd you hide your body from me, huh, sweetie?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=seductive,You barely look a day into womanhood, darling.  It's hard to find you erotic when I just want to <i>squeeze</i> you instead!


#lost dress
5-male_chest_will_be_visible=excited,A man's chest...to match <i>mine</i>.
5-male_chest_will_be_visible=seductive,Only fair, ~name~.  A man's chest for <i>my</i> breasts.
5-male_chest_will_be_visible=interested,Not <i>quite</i> as interesting as your tube, but beggars can't be choosers.
5-male_chest_will_be_visible=vain,I want to see Hibiki's...he's proven before to be more than meets the eye.
5-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=teasing,So, Little Dungeon Bot...are you built <i>exactly</i> like a man?
5-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=seductive,I'm so dreadfully uninformed about men's bodies, 9S.  Is your artificial body a good enough substitute?
5-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=teasing,You're a little shy about being fake, right?  Well...here's your chance to show me you're a <i>real</i> boy.
5-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=seductive,Can an android really satisfy my unending curiosity about men's muscles?  Give it a shot, honey.
5-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=interested,Ooh, does little Angel-boy want to go topless?  I hear you men don't treat that with quite the concern <i>we</i> do.
5-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=seductive,I've <i>never</i> seen men naked before, Pit...<i>won't you get your chest out</i>?  I hear men don't care about that anyway.
5-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=teasing,Is it true that men get topless all the time?  I want to see if Mr. Angel is rocking any <i>muscles</i> beneath his stammering.
5-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=seductive,Oh, please, Mr. Angel, I'm <i>desperate</i> to see a man nude...can't you show me your chest?  Men don't mind that, right?
5-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:link=bored,...<i>Nin-ten-doh</i>?  <i>Character</i>?  This guy's <i>nuts</i>...I better avoid his seed.
5-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:link=interested,...That was a <i>character</i>?  Yeah, I can see why you're playing to strangers in a dump like this.
5-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:link=laughing,You were doing a <i>character</i>?  Is that what men connect to, a grunting buffoon?
5-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:link=laughing,I'm sorry, you <i>broke</i> character?  That implies there <i>was</i> one, dear.  You know, with emotions and speech.
5-male_chest_is_visible=seductive-2,Oh, my.  Will I be able to control myself?
5-male_chest_is_visible=seductive-2,Good thing this thong is impenetrable.  Who knows where my hands might wander?
5-male_chest_is_visible=seductive,Those muscles look capable of ripping this thong right off.  Now, where'd I put my rapier?
5-male_chest_is_visible=teasing,Men are so inconsiderate.  Meia works day and night to get her abs, and you make it look so easy.
5-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=confused,...OK, now I'm <i>really</i> confused.  Men can have breasts?  You're not all that fat.
5-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=bored,...I don't think you're a person at this point.  A man with breasts?  What a horrifying sight...
5-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=angry,OK, seriously.  Breasts on a man?  What the hell are you?  Besides totally gross.
5-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=frustrated,...I really thought breasts separated men and women pretty cleanly.  Then again, you don't seem human at all.
5-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=teasing,Oh, that's...not so bad!  About as many muscles as they had in that book I read...though your height leaves something to be desired.
5-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=teasing,Not bad, honey, but I expected a little better from such a tiny man.  Doesn't being short make gaining muscle easier?
5-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=vain,Oh, don't feel <i>too</i> bad.  Hibiki is short, and he's not too ripped either...even though he'd be much more handsome that way.
5-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=stretching,Nothing to be embarrassed about, dear.  Well, maybe your <i>height</i> is.  Work on that instead.
5-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=confused,Oh, men wear the same underwear we do?  Well, why won't our prisoners show me theirs, then?
5-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=confused,...Are you <i>sure</i> you're not a woman, dear?  Because that underwear looks pretty feminine...unless men and women share styles.
5-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=laughing,Uh...wow.  I really thought men and women would wear different underwear.  Women know better than to tear it up, you know?
5-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=vain,Do men really wear the same underwear women do?  Not that <i>I</i> own any lingerie...pirates can't afford much.
5-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=smug,Interesting choice of underwear, sweetheart.  <i>Women</i> wear that...I wouldn't think men would.  Too delicate for them.
5-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=confused,...Wait, I thought men had nipples.  Did I read that wrong?  I was mostly staring at their abs.
5-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=angry,...Are you pulling my leg?  Do men have nipples or not?  Did your makers just forget them?
5-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=confused,...Did your creators run out of budget when it came to your nipples, or do men just not have them?
5-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=confused,Uh, you seem to be missing something there, dear.  Or...do men not have nipples?  How do they breastfeed?
5-male_crotch_will_be_visible=seductive,And a man's crotch comes out before mine.  Certainly a lot more to display than women have, isn't there?
5-male_crotch_will_be_visible=laughing,Maybe beggars can't be choosers, but pirates can.  Drop 'em.
5-male_crotch_will_be_visible=vain,It's a whole new wave of instincts, crashing against the sheer cliffs of my heart.
5-male_crotch_will_be_visible=vain,It's all so exhilarating.  My delicate, gorgeous breasts exposed while a man whips out his ugly tube?  All of Mejare weeps!
5-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pit=seductive,Omigosh, Pit, are you showing your tube?  It's not a little tiny thing, is it?  I hear they can get pretty big!
5-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pit=seductive,Hey, Angel-boy...do you have a <i>man</i>-sized tube?  If so, I might just fall for your cute little winged self.
5-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pit=teasing,Normally I go for tall, strong men...but Hibiki's short like you, and he's kind of cute like you, too.  Do you have a decent-sized tube?
5-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pit=teasing,It's my understanding men's tubes can vary in size, Pit.  I'm willing to overlook shortness in a man if he puts his girth elsewhere.
5-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=stretching,Well, since you're not exactly fully equipped up above, I'm not expecting much.
5-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=smug,Did your creators spend any more time developing a full tube for you, dear?  I hope so.
5-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=teasing,I've learned not to trust androids' anatomy, considering last time.  What's your situation <i>downstairs</i>?
5-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=seductive,I know you're artificial, but <i>please</i> try to teach me something about men this time, OK?
5-male_small_crotch_is_visible=awkward,Uh...maybe I shouldn't have been teasing you.
5-male_small_crotch_is_visible=confused,Oh, but, it gets bigger, right?  Men's tubes get bigger?
5-male_small_crotch_is_visible=awkward,Men's tubes get bigger hard, right?   ...You're <i>already</i> hard?
5-male_small_crotch_is_visible=angry,What do you <i>mean</i>, that's it?  That's no fun!  Look how small it is!
5-male_small_crotch_is_visible=awkward,That's kinda sad. Are you fully grown, ~name~?  In a general sense, not an erection one.
5-male_small_crotch_is_visible=laughing,I read something about <i>paizuri</i> recently, but...I think your thing would get lost in there, to be frank.
5-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=excited,It's so <i>cool</i>...and it can just slide inside a woman as it pleases?
5-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=excited,I really want to try it...just to see if it's all it's cracked up to be.
5-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=seductive,I know it's supposed to go inside me...but the book did mention some <i>paizuri</i> thing that sounded interesting.
5-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=vain,You can look, ~name~.  I want to know for sure that I made a man's tube stand up.
5-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=teasing,I don't have a frame of reference myself, but...that looks pretty good!  A comfortable fit...<i>if you think you can convince me</i>.
5-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=seductive,Hey, I'm not going to pretend to be an expert--and that doesn't look half bad!  Maybe I'll collect <i>your</i> seed, cutie.
5-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=seductive,Ooh, that looks perfectly manageable!  As much as I'm drawn to the burly types, you are just <i>so</i> cute...I'm considering.
5-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=vain,Looks like a decent fit, darling...maybe <i>you'll</i> give me my baby.  She'll be such a cute little girl!
5-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=seductive,Oh, that looks OK!  I'm delicate, so I was worried it might be painful to stuff inside me...<i>God</i>, you're so adorable.
5-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s=seductive,Ohh, that's cute!  So it's actually accurate?  <i>Interesting</i>...
5-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s=seductive,Ooh, that <i>does</i> match what I've seen!  Maybe what I really needed from a man was some <i>artificiality</i>...
5-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s=seductive,Oho!  And it <i>works</i>?  Perhaps a <i>mechanical</i> man is what I've been searching for this whole time.
5-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s=teasing,Ooh, maybe <i>human</i> men are overrated.  What do you think, dear?  Could you satisfy a woman?
5-male_large_crotch_is_visible=awkward,I <i>want</i> to try it...but I don't think it'd fit.
5-male_large_crotch_is_visible=shocked,Eep!  What <i>is</i> that thing?  It can't be a <i>p-penis</i>!
5-male_large_crotch_is_visible=awkward,I read something about <i>paizuri</i>...but that looks beyond even <i>my</i> chest.
5-male_large_crotch_is_visible=shocked,Wha--that's not--who--but it's so--<i>big</i>!  I can't fit that inside me!
5-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=awkward,...You're an <i>outlier</i>, right, Ryu?  Or does all that fighting make a man's thing grow?
5-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=shocked,<i>Eek!  I--I take it back!  Don't touch me with that thing--I don't care about your muscles</i>!
5-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=shocked,<i>Eek</i>!  Y-you can't put that thing inside me!  It'd kill me before your muscles did!
5-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=awkward,That's, uh...a little oversized.  Maybe you could just squeeze me with your muscles and we could have sex that way?
5-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=angry,...OK, I know how big it's <i>supposed</i> to be.  You're just a weird freak imitation of a man.
5-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=shocked,<i>Aaaack!  Help!  W-what is that thing?  That's not a--a tube, a penis, whatever</i>!
5-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=bored,...You're <i>definitely</i> not a man.  I come from a planet of women, and still I know that for sure.
5-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=shocked,<i>Eeeek!  Y-you're a monster, not a man!  G-get away from me!  Keep your tube</i>!
5-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=frustrated,...Are you the <i>average</i> size?  Because I retract anything I said about having sex with men, then.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible=seductive-2,Oh, please don't compare us.  <i>I'm so ashamed</i>.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible=seductive-2,You're revealing your breasts?  I could never bear that kind of shame!
5-female_chest_will_be_visible=vain,I have a deep appreciation for breasts, as you might imagine.  Show us a healthy pair.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible=seductive,Come on already.  You must have wanted this, since you came here in the first place.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible=seductive,I know my own breasts can be intimidating, but I'm sure yours are cute.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=interested,I guess firing straight up makes it a little easier to hit your mark.  Must be a breeze for you.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=seductive,You sure are confident.  I know I <i>act</i> that way, but you really put your money where your mouth is.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=vain,I'm really no good with weapons at all...ground combat is an awful mess.  That's why my Dread is so fun to pilot!
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=teasing,You're still so cool.  But with this sort of thing, maybe it's best not to push your luck...
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=smug,With my pilot's keen eye for patterns, I'm guessing the bra isn't coming off <i>this</i> time, either.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=teasing,My instincts are finely honed from piloting, you know.  I see those little things you still have!
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=stretching,Oh, please.  You've got that hat, the nose, the tie, and you think I'm buying the bra after <i>last</i> time?
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=stretching,Just get the trick over with, Whiteface.  I see about three different ways you could avoid the bra, and I'm just glancing.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=laughing,Wait, your breasts are out already?  Even <i>I</i> brought some accessories to stave it off!
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=interested,Wow, you athletes get straight to the point, don't you?  This is your second loss!
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=interested,I know you're proud of your strength, honey, but wearing a lot of clothes is what wins games here.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=stretching,Well, that was fast.  Not wearing much?  I guess athletes can't help but try to set new best times.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=bored,...Or she's just going to strip part of the stems.  Apparently this place has no rules at all.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=bored,...Or that could happen.  I swear, you could count each of your fingers as a layer in this dump...
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=annoyed,...I doll myself up for this evening on a foreign planet, and Little Miss Forest Sprite goes around counting flowers as layers.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=frustrated,...OK, yeah.  It was funny for one round, but that's not clothing.  This girl's a bigger tease than I am.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:vriska=stretching,There she goes again.  Some girls never learn...even if they've got magical dice.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:vriska=interested,The gimmick's played out, honey.  You can just be normal like the rest of us.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:vriska=teasing,It doesn't matter how brilliant your light show is, darling...people only get dazzled once.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:vriska=smug,You'd be surprised what humans can get used to, dear.  This isn't impressive anymore.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=stretching,Should have expected as much from Miss Grape-flavored over here.  She's going to strip totally backwards, isn't she?
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=teasing,I don't know what I expected.  Your stripping order's got us all on the edge of our seats!
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=stretching,I like to tease...Miss Grape-flavored here just likes to get to the point.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=laughing,Men seem pretty simple and stupid.  I bet they like how you just skip to the good stuff.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:felicia=shocked,Wait, you really <i>are</i> a cat?  Like, that's <i>fur</i>?
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:felicia=shocked,Wait, you're <i>real</i>?  H-how does that work?  Did Earth crossbreed cats and women?
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:felicia=shocked,<i>Eeek</i>!  T-that's <i>real</i> fur?  You're a cat?  Omigosh!
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:felicia=shocked,Wait, I thought that was just skimpy clothing?  You're <i>really</i> a cat?  And it's fur?  B-but how?
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=annoyed,Wonderful.  Yes.  Worth the wait.  I've never seen breasts before.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=awkward,Those...actually look pretty normal.  I'm surprised.  I thought they'd have teeth marks.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=awkward,...OK.  Maybe you were just kidding about that public-use stuff.  Those look fine...
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=angry,I was worried there...OK.  So you were mostly kidding about getting screwed in public.  That's not funny!
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia=vain,See, bras are no fun at all.  Look how long it's taking you, when I slipped my dress off nice and easy.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia=teasing,And now we have to watch her fiddle around with that thing.  I bet you could pull off my dress, Meia.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia=stretching,Oh, stop struggling with it and just slide it off.  Give our Earth friends here something sexy for once!
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia=vain,And <i>this</i> is why I don't wear a bra.  Just look at her fiddling with that thing.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=laughing,<i>Well, Meia?  Are you going to do it, with my hungry eyes boring into you</i>?
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=interested,You heard Elizabeth, Leader.  Are you going to show your breasts to your second-in-command?
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=stretching,Liz is right, Meia--this is very awkward.  It's only, what, the hundredth time I've seen you naked?
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=stretching,<i>Oh, my!  Not Meia's breasts!  Oh, Elizabeth, why must you remind me of this horror</i>?
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=interested,What are you planning, Miss Pixie?  You've got a mischievous look in your eye...well, more mischievous than usual.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=interested,You look like you're plotting something, Kyu.  Mind making it known to the rest of us?
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=teasing,Hey, Miss Pixie.  Stop going on about nonsense like usual and show those cute fairy breasts of yours.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=smug,What are you on about now?  Stop stalling for time and show your chest, Miss Pixie.  I don't have all evening.
5-female_small_chest_is_visible=laughing,Oh, wow.  They really cheap out on the nutrients on Earth, don't they?
5-female_small_chest_is_visible=laughing,Right up there with Misty's.  Who is fourteen.
5-female_small_chest_is_visible=awkward,Oh, wow.  Guess I shouldn't have swung mine around quite so much.
5-female_small_chest_is_visible=awkward,So, uh...no hard feelings about me parading my chest around, right?
5-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:videl=laughing,Using your hair to cover them?  That gives me an idea...but it's not quite what <i>you</i> came up with.
5-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:videl=stretching,Come on, sweetie, those are cute!  Don't cover them up with your hair...actually, that gives me an idea.
5-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:videl=vain,Is that why you have those cute little pigtails?  Modesty just holds the strong woman back...and you've just given me an idea.
5-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:videl=seductive,Oh, are you using your pigtails to cover them?  Clever...and it's just made me think of a great little maneuver of my own.
5-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:7b=interested,Something the matter, dear?  Run out of cute outfits to hide your...well, <i>lack</i> of breasts?
5-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:7b=laughing,...Yeah, I'd try not to strip normally if <i>those</i> were all I had.
5-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:7b=laughing,Aww, don't feel bad.  Those pants are cute...they clash with the blue of your flat chest.
5-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:7b=vain,Well, now I can see why you were shy.  But a woman should stand proud!  ...Hard to say that when there's no flat Mejarians.
5-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:7a=laughing,You roll a die that could give you an outfit like <i>that</i>, and you get embarrassed?  Honestly...
5-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:7a=laughing,Aww, what are you so embarrassed about, darling?  Well, I guess that bikini is supposed to be stretched a little.
5-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:7a=interested,Not filling up that bikini quite how you want to, dear?  Is that why you're blushing?
5-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:7a=laughing,Cute little blue nipples you've got there.  Too bad you don't have the breasts behind them to fill that bikini.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible=vain,Just like Barnette's...oh, she's to <i>die</i> for!
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible=vain,So <i>cute</i>.  Breasts are wonderful, especially mine.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible=vain,I'm so blessed to have breasts this magnificent.  For an Earth woman, you're blessed as well.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible=vain,It's such a liberating feeling, isn't it?  They spend all day just <i>begging</i> to be free.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible=teasing,Like an evening with Barnette.  She's a little cuter, though.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=bored,And she just keeps prattling on...<i>mine</i> are much better.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=bored,Should I stop teasing with her around, or just do it harder so she knows how to do it properly?
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=annoyed,...Look, they're not <i>that</i> great, OK?  Just shut up already...
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=annoyed,And they say <i>I</i> have an ego.  Mine are bigger than that and I don't go on about them this much!
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia=vain,Meia's a little shy, but what do you think?  Aren't Mejarian breasts the most magnificent in the galaxy?
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia=teasing,Are you Earth people in heaven or what?  Doesn't get better than four Mejarian breasts staring back at you.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia=vain,For God's sake, Meia, <i>flaunt them a little</i>!  We're gorgeous alien women, and we should make this a night to remember for boring old Earth.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia=vain,What's a better view than a topless Mejarian?  <i>Two</i>, of course!
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=excited,Wha--<i>oh my gosh</i>!  <i>Magic</i>?  Do it again!  That was so cool!
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=excited,What did you--<i>ooh!  Ooh</i>!  You really <i>are</i> a fairy!  Show me some more magic!
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=excited,Omigosh!  You weren't kidding around!  Magic is so cool!  Do something else!
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=teasing,...Oh my God.  <i>Magic</i>?  Well, then...what <i>else</i> can you do, hm?
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=laughing,<i>Awww, is Little Miss Princess embarrassed?  Should I get you some warm milk and a servant girl</i>?
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=interested,Is something the matter, honey?  Are your delicate princess breasts all mangled up by men?
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=teasing,Got something to hide, Princess Dearest?  Afraid to bare them to the big, bad pirate lady?
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=laughing,What's the matter, darling?  Afraid this pirate will take your breasts and put up a ransom?
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=smug,I don't have to, dear.  Meia's already convinced they do.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=interested,It doesn't matter how many compliments you pay to her breasts, honey.  She's a total head case about them.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=stretching,Oh, I've told her many times that her breasts are just fine.  Nothing penetrates her ridiculuous neuroses.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=smug,If I did, I'd just be confirming what Meia already inexplicably believes.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=interested,You really like showing off the goods, don't you?  Going to cover them up with other things so you can keep on doing it?
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=laughing,It's the exposure you prefer more than the exhibitionism, isn't it?  You just like the reveal!
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=stretching,There's just no stopping you, honey...well, maybe when you run out of clothes.  How tragic will <i>that</i> be?
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=laughing,What is <i>up</i> with this girl?  You really know how to blow through an audience's attention.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=teasing,Oh!  Well, that's as good as the alternative, I suppose.  <i>I'm starting to see through the pretenses here</i>.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=smug,These tricks are really getting desperate, dear.  But hey, I think I'm starting to get what your <i>real</i> job is.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=laughing,Hey, I know what a stripper is.  If clown is just a fancy term for that on Earth, this is all going to make more sense.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=interested,...Honey, are you just a stripper in fancy makeup?  You'd be much better off dropping these silly tricks and just moving your hips a little.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=interested,How many times do you plan on revealing those things before it takes?  They're just breasts, woman.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=frustrated,You're more neurotic than even Meia when it comes to those things.  Practically had to hold you down to get you to show them.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=interested,At least they're finally out.  With how you've been acting, I thought you had a chunk of them missing or something.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=vain,Earth girls are so ridiculously conservative.  I've got breasts just like you, and you're worried about me seeing the damn things.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:6=awkward,...Huh.  At this point I really have no clue what you're going for.  Maybe I'd understand if Mejare had clowns.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:6=bored,...This <i>clowning</i> business is strange.  No wonder the colonists didn't want any on Mejare.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:6=frustrated,...Clowns really are full of surprises...but I'm more baffled than entertained.  If only I grew up around some.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:6=bored,...You should know that, on the planet I come from, clowns seem to be extinct.  Just some...food for thought.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=teasing,I'm telling you, Barnette is <i>always</i> dragging me to the firing range.  You two would be smitten!  ...Maybe I better keep her away from you.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=smug,It's nothing but <i>guns this, ammo that</i> with my girlfriend.  I better not bring you to the Nirvana, or she'll leave me for you.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=interested,I better engage more with Barnette's gun hobby.  One look at you and she'd toss me to the curb.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=vain,Maybe I should try to have more in common with Barnette.  She loves those icky men's guns as much as you do...she's got a whole collection.
5-female_large_chest_is_visible=vain,Nothing quite like setting them free, is there, ~name~?
5-female_large_chest_is_visible=laughing,You should see how insecure Meia gets about her chest.  It's so adorable!
5-female_large_chest_is_visible=stretching,I keep telling Meia her breasts are fine, but she just refuses to listen!  That girl is so neurotic.
5-female_large_chest_is_visible=vain,I liked the teasing, but this feels <i>so</i> much better.  Surely you agree.
5-female_large_chest_is_visible,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,Nothing quite like setting them free, is there, ~name~?
5-female_large_chest_is_visible,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,Meia's so adorably insecure about her chest.  Just look at her!
5-female_large_chest_is_visible,alsoPlaying:meia=interested,Oh, stop scowling, Meia.  You're so neurotic about your breasts.
5-female_large_chest_is_visible,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,I liked the teasing, but this feels <i>so</i> much better.  Surely you agree.
5-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia=shocked,Mejare only has animals in zoos--I guess they never wanted us to see them breed with the males.  This is crazy!
5-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia=seductive,I've...never seen a cat up close.  Are those claws real, too?  Where'd you come from?
5-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia=excited,Seeing a real cat is...it's nuts!  Mejare has almost no animals at all!
5-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia=excited,Omigosh, omigosh, omigosh!  Cats are so cool--I've never seen one until now, not up close!
5-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=teasing,I see you're lugging quite a lot in back, too.  Must make your legs pretty strong!
5-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=seductive,<i>Well, now</i>!  I can see why you wanted to be naked--just look at the size of that thing!  But you wear it well.
5-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=smug,Yeah, yeah.  You've got enough in back for a whole extra woman, honey...but it's pretty fantastic, I'll concede.
5-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=seductive,<i>Oh, my</i>!  You could stare at that thing for hours and find new details.  Is it all muscle or all fat?
5-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=laughing,I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and guess that thing's from squatting, not too much candy.
5-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:velma=laughing,<i>Aww, is someone blind without her glasses</i>?  Just crawl on the floor until you find them, then.
5-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:velma=smug,Don't worry, dear, I won't get in the way.  You can crawl around <i>all you want</i> as you search for them.
5-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:velma=teasing,The game must go on, dearie!  Don't worry, I'll enjoy the view of your butt sticking out as you search the floor.
5-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:velma=teasing,Yeah, Parfet needs her glasses, too.  She's in better shape, though--go get some exercise crawling around looking for them.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible=smug,A nude woman?  Could there be <i>anything</i> more scandalous to a Mejarian?
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible=teasing,I'm hanging on by a thread, but now you don't even have <i>that</i>.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible=bored,I bet the Captain was a looker in her younger years.  Seeing her nude now, though?  <i>Yikes</i>.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible=seductive,Don't be shy, ~name~.  Confidence more than doubles a woman's beauty.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato=seductive,You're my kind of woman, Misato...sexually confident.  Can you teach me about men sometime?
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato=seductive,You really know your way around Earth men, Misato--you're not shy at all!  You've got to teach me.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato=vain,Not to call you <i>easy</i>, dear, but you seem pretty experienced with these men...and confident.  <i>Teach me your ways</i>.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato=seductive,I can never get a man to like me, and yet you seem so experienced and confident.  What's your secret, Miss Military?
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=vain,Thinking about this again, I don't think I'd want to learn how to shoot like you do...or at least destroy my outfits with it.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=thinking,Do I <i>have</i> an outfit I'd be willing to destroy just for the spectacle?  I'd have to buy some rags for the occasion.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=stretching,I think I'd just <i>die</i> if I tried this.  Not from the bullets, but from seeing my wonderful dress in tatters.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=vain,You really are something else, Aimee.  You'd never catch <i>me</i> tearing up my beautiful wardrobe like that.  I'd have to steal more!
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=teasing,Well, how's <i>that</i> for karma?  Cover your breasts, and fate demands you show your cute little rear!  But of course, you wanted to.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=seductive,Ooh, what an adorable little behind!  Don't go and cover it, now!  <i>I know you don't really want to</i>.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=teasing,Nice and tight--you're just a tiny vixen of a girl, aren't you?  <i>Desperate</i> to strut your stuff.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=laughing,<i>Heeheeheehee</i>!  Seems fate would have you baring it all--that's what you want anyway, right?
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=laughing,Oh, we've seen each other naked once or twice.  A day.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=interested,Well, Meia?  Have I seen your <i>you-know-what</i>?  Or do you not know what <i>it</i> is?
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=laughing,Don't ask me how you managed to come here if you can barely spit out the word <i>vagina</i>.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=interested,The most important question of the night, isn't it, Leader?  Your <i>you-know-what</i> is such a mystery.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=shocked,Wha--<i>ew!  Ew!  EW!  What's the matter with you</i>?
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=shocked,...<i>Where's all the color</i>?
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=shocked,...What <i>are</i> you?  You need a hospital!  You need <i>Mejarian</i> medicine!
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=shocked,<i>Ack!  Ew!  Wha--what is that thing?  Ew!  Help!  Stop</i>!
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=laughing,You know you have a mask, right?  Or is Miss Wrestler actually a little shy about showing her whole face?
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=smug,I guess you're more proud of your thighs than your face, because you still have a mask.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=stretching,You really want to be naked, don't you?  Hell, you're just skipping the mask altogether.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=vain,I just realized you still have the mask.  Is it <i>that</i> important to your image?  I understand, then.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=seductive,I'll freely admit to being enchanted--mostly from those flowers.  You only ever see that stuff in gardens on Mejare.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=vain,Must be nice sprouting flowers wherever you go.  They're so rare on Mejare...I wish I could give some to Barnette.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=vain,Flowers are so romantic and sweet-smelling...maybe you're too accustomed to it, but they're a rarity on Mejare.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=vain,You Earth girls are so spoiled when it comes to flowers.  You know how hard it is to start up a garden on Mejare?  We barely have plants!
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=stretching,Honestly, dear, what was your reason for wearing that leotard?  ...Well, I guess Barnette's pretty similar.  Must be how it feels.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=teasing,That leotard's pretty <i>tight</i>, honey.  Just digging up into you...my Barnette dresses the same way.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=vain,I can understand loving the way leotards feel downstairs.  My girlfriend wears something <i>just</i> like it.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=teasing,I <i>may</i> have tried on Barnette's outfit once...so I know how that leotard must be digging into your nether regions.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=laughing,Whoa, whoa, whoa, <i>what</i>?  Honey, that comes at the <i>end</i>!  Give us something to look forward to!
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=interested,Uh...honey, that comes last, usually.  Were you raised in isolation?  Do you not know what audiences like?
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=interested,...You're supposed to keep the audience guessing, dear.  This is certainly a curveball, but now you've got no surprises.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=laughing,Wait, <i>what</i>?  Hey, are you trying to be boring for the rest of the game?  Have some suspense!
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=seductive,Oh, good.  Now you'd fit right in where I'm from!  Shaved is so much cuter.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=vain,Well, you might be a kitty-cat, but at least you know when enough is enough.  See, Mejare likes to be smooth and sleek.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=teasing,Cleanliness is a virtue on my planet!  So I like this shaving approach, Miss Kitty.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=laughing,Hey, take all the hair away!  This kitty needs to see the sun, after all.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=teasing,Ooh, <i>bottomless</i>?  Maybe Earth women value their breasts more than I thought they did.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=vain,Breasts out last, huh, Mia?  I guess you Earth girls want to protect them...we Mejarians feel the same way about our wombs.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=vain,Oh, are you saving the chest for last?  I can understand...my breasts mean a lot to me, too.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=interested,Anything we should know about your breasts, dear?  You seem desperate to protect them.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=vain,I can respect a woman going bottomless.  Bare breasts have a tendency to just swing around all ungainly-like...tough for an athlete.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=teasing,Bottomless first?  Yeah, that fits your athletic attitude to keep your breasts all wrapped up tight.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=stretching,You gym rats and your worries about your breasts hitting you in the face or something.  Exercise ruins everything!
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=smug,Of course the athlete goes bottomless.  She's worried her bare breasts will throw her off-balance.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=awkward,Hey, what are you two...<i>oh, my</i>.  That might be a little much even for me and Barnette.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=shocked,Hey, are you going to put those webs to...<i>use</i>.  Oh, dear.  Barnette might not go for that.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=awkward,That... looks like a lot of rope.  I might have to rethink inviting you over for some time with me and Barnette.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=awkward,...<i>Ooh</i>.  At first I thought your webs sounded cool, but...I'm not sure Barnette would like <i>this</i> much of them.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:vriska=stretching,But maybe you'll prove us all wrong.  Go right ahead.  More fashion for me.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:vriska=teasing,I'm waiting for you to stick it to me, Vriska.  I certainly <i>want</i> to see more cute outfits.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:vriska=teasing,Going to prove my predictions wrong?  If so, more fashion for me...I win either way.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:vriska=vain,By all means, deliver more adorable outfits upon me.  I don't care if you win.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia=teasing,I don't buy your false modesty, Meia.  You're feeling sexy, and now you want to show it off.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia=teasing,That's enough frowning.  I saw you smirking before--you <i>want</i> to show off your gorgeous Mejarian body.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia=interested,You can drop the don't-want-to-be-here act already.  I can see you getting wetter every time someone ogles you a little too long.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia=laughing,That damp spot on your shorts tells me you're not quite so above it all, <i>Leader</i>.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia=interested,Your facade might fool these Earthlings, Meia, but not me.  You're proud of your figure--you certainly earned it in our gym.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=laughing,Well, that seals it.  You're a total nymph...disguised as an innocent little dork.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=stretching,It's always the dorky ones, isn't it?  I bet Parfet's a real wild child...Barnette and I are so dreadfully vanilla.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=vain,Being all sheltered must do this to nerdy types.  Barnette and I just kiss and hold hands like the pure angels we are.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=interested,This must be the only thrill you've gotten in years.  You nerdy types are so predictably dirty.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=vain,Reading too much must mess with nerd girls' sexualities.  One medical book got me obsessed with men, after all.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=vain,Panties first, you dorky little thing?  This must be thrilling for you...<i>I</i> can appreciate the warmth of a loving relationship.
5-female_crotch_is_visible=teasing,Let's face it, ~name~.  Only a <i>Mejarian</i> could understand how to really please another woman.
5-female_crotch_is_visible=interested,Something tells me Earth women don't know how to meet each other's needs.  A <i>man</i> certainly couldn't do it.
5-female_crotch_is_visible=teasing,I know what I'm doing around other women, ~name~.  Give me a call if you're feeling frustrated...and I'll invite my Barnette for the occasion.
5-female_crotch_is_visible=vain,Isn't my thong super cute?  Doesn't cover much, but right now it feels pretty good to have.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=shocked,Oh my God.  You weren't kidding.  You really <i>are</i> some kind of public whore.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=frustrated,...I'm gonna go home now and tell Barnette I love her.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=frustrated,...Earth is a scary planet.  I just wanted to have a little fun.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=shocked,...I swear I don't act like this.  I just think flirting is fun!  I have a girlfriend, honest!
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=interested,Oh hey, your partner's stripping, too.  Just here for moral support, or are you two lovers?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=teasing,Did you really need help stripping, dear?  Or did you <i>want</i> her to strip you, you little lovebird?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=vain,So you've totally got a crush on this girl, right?  I get it...I would've asked Barnette to strip me if she were here.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=thinking,Maybe I should've brought <i>my</i> girlfriend here with me, too...nah, she wouldn't have gone for it.  She needs to lighten up.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia=seductive,Look at you, standing all bold and bare!  I knew you could handle it, but I didn't think you'd enjoy it so much.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia=teasing,I was hoping to loosen you up here, Meia, but it looks like I could learn a thing or two from you about that.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia=teasing,Here she is, ladies!  A true-blue Mejarian woman, fully nude!  And she's not ashamed of her body.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia=vain,My Leader's beautiful <i>inside and out</i>.  I'm so lucky to have her.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=seductive,Still as cute as a button!  Why you'd want to hide that body, I can only wonder...
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=teasing,Must be the neuroses of a royal that made you ashamed of your body.  No other explanation...you're <i>cute</i>.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=seductive,Ohhh, you're like a little chestnut of adorableness!  Why'd you hide your body from me, huh, sweetie?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=seductive,You barely look a day into womanhood, darling.  It's hard to find you erotic when I just want to <i>squeeze</i> you instead!
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=awkward,What are you--oh, dear.  That's <i>one</i> way to get off.  Is this how your "darlin'" does it?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=interested,I have a "darlin'," too...her name is Barnette.  And she doesn't ask me to graze her crotch with bullets.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=laughing,I guess when you can shoot your own clothes off, this is the kind of thing you need to do to reach orgasm.  Is your "darlin'" a good shot, too?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=laughing,These Earth girls just keep getting more depraved.  Your "darlin'" being a man must have done this to you, you poor thing.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=teasing,Blech!  Pubic hair is so unhygienic...but I guess living around men gets a woman used to having no hygiene.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=smug,I'm not a fan of pubic hair, but I guess this thong doesn't cover enough for you to still be wondering about that.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=vain,Not much to spoil about <i>my</i> situation anymore, but no, pubic hair isn't for me.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=frustrated,Mejarians are all about the sleek and shiny...we may be pirates, but we still take care of our hair issues.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=interested,Nothing else, huh?  Why'd you even play this game without dressing up?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=smug,Well, that didn't take long.  One wonders why you came to a strip poker joint just to practice personal hygiene.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=seductive,And...everything else is part of your body?  Absolutely crazy...but kind of cute.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=interested,You're a weird one, dear.  Let your hair grow out, then shave it...come to strip poker, don't wear anything.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:vriska=laughing,<i>Come now, darling</i>!  I think that suits you just fine...technically covered, but people can see right past.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:vriska=interested,You're not <i>complaining</i> now, are you?  What, because you have to play fair like the rest of us?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:vriska=teasing,I thank you once again for the wonderful look at outfits across the universe.  But this pirate's done with you now.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:vriska=teasing,That's what happens when you play against a pirate, sweetie.  She strips you down eventually.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma=smug,Maybe I'm judging you too harshly.  <i>I've</i> considered going commando beneath the dress...
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma=interested,I guess I'm not much more covered under the dress, huh?  Perhaps we're more similar than I realized.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma=smug,Yeah, this is definitely giving you a thrill.  I wonder if <i>I'd</i> get the same sensation walking around in just the dress.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma=teasing,My dress is pretty much the only thing that covers me, too...<i>maybe we should swap</i>.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:0-9=vain,I should hope so!  She doesn't do all those squats in the gym because she thinks it's fun...or maybe she does, who knows.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:0-9=vain,Of course I would.  My Leader is more of a steal than she cares to admit!
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:0-9=teasing,Hey, it's not a lack of beauty that keeps Meia single--it's a lack of smiling.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:0-9=stretching,Of course I agree, honey.  The trouble is getting <i>Meia</i> to do so, the neurotic little thing she is.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=shocked,<i>Eek!  No!  I-I was just joking!  Don't use your magic</i>!
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=shocked,<i>Ack!  M-magic?  I'm sorry I made fun of you</i>!
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=shocked,<i>Wait, no!  You're very decent!  Extremely decent!  I'm sorry</i>!
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=shocked,<i>Wait!  Stop!  D-don't shoot, or cast anything, or whatever</i>!

-3-male_chest_will_be_visible=excited,Ooh...I can't <i>wait</i> to see how it looks.
-3-male_chest_will_be_visible=teasing,Men certainly aren't working with what women do when it comes to chests.  Let's see if yours is better.
-3-male_chest_will_be_visible=seductive-2,<i>How can I stay calm, standing here naked while a man reveals his bulging muscles</i>?
-3-male_chest_will_be_visible=teasing,Pretty crazy stuff, this male nudity.  See what excitement piracy can bring to your life?
-3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=interested,Ooh, does little Angel-boy want to go topless?  I hear you men don't treat that with quite the concern <i>we</i> do.
-3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=seductive,I've <i>never</i> seen men naked before, Pit...<i>won't you get your chest out</i>?  I hear men don't care about that anyway.
-3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=teasing,Is it true that men get topless all the time?  I want to see if Mr. Angel is rocking any <i>muscles</i> beneath his stammering.
-3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=seductive,Oh, please, Mr. Angel, I'm <i>desperate</i> to see a man nude...can't you show me your chest?  Men don't mind that, right?
-3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:link=bored,...<i>Nin-ten-doh</i>?  <i>Character</i>?  This guy's <i>nuts</i>...I better avoid his seed.
-3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:link=interested,...That was a <i>character</i>?  Yeah, I can see why you're playing to strangers in a dump like this.
-3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:link=laughing,You were doing a <i>character</i>?  Is that what men connect to, a grunting buffoon?
-3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:link=laughing,I'm sorry, you <i>broke</i> character?  That implies there <i>was</i> one, dear.  You know, with emotions and speech.
-3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=teasing,So, Little Dungeon Bot...are you built <i>exactly</i> like a man?
-3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=seductive,I'm so dreadfully uninformed about men's bodies, 9S.  Is your artificial body a good enough substitute?
-3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=teasing,You're a little shy about being fake, right?  Well...here's your chance to show me you're a <i>real</i> boy.
-3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=seductive,Can an android really satisfy my unending curiosity about men's muscles?  Give it a shot, honey.
-3-male_chest_is_visible=seductive-2,You've got the muscles to match my breasts.  Well, maybe you're not <i>that</i> good.
-3-male_chest_is_visible=seductive,Oh, dear, ~name~.  Please be gentle with this poor little nude girl.
-3-male_chest_is_visible=seductive-2,Oh, my.  Here I am, nearly defeated, at the mercy of this hulking beast.
-3-male_chest_is_visible=interested,Men gain muscle so easily.  Good thing women got all the brains.
-3-male_chest_is_visible=stretching,I wish I cared enough to make sure your tube came out, too.  But now I'm kind of bored.
-3-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=teasing,Oh, that's...not so bad!  About as many muscles as they had in that book I read...though your height leaves something to be desired.
-3-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=teasing,Not bad, honey, but I expected a little better from such a tiny man.  Doesn't being short make gaining muscle easier?
-3-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=vain,Oh, don't feel <i>too</i> bad.  Hibiki is short, and he's not too ripped either...even though he'd be much more handsome that way.
-3-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=stretching,Nothing to be embarrassed about, dear.  Well, maybe your <i>height</i> is.  Work on that instead.
-3-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=confused,Oh, men wear the same underwear we do?  Well, why won't our prisoners show me theirs, then?
-3-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=confused,...Are you <i>sure</i> you're not a woman, dear?  Because that underwear looks pretty feminine...unless men and women share styles.
-3-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=laughing,Uh...wow.  I really thought men and women would wear different underwear.  Women know better than to tear it up, you know?
-3-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=vain,Do men really wear the same underwear women do?  Not that <i>I</i> own any lingerie...pirates can't afford much.
-3-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=smug,Interesting choice of underwear, sweetheart.  <i>Women</i> wear that...I wouldn't think men would.  Too delicate for them.
-3-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=confused,...OK, now I'm <i>really</i> confused.  Men can have breasts?  You're not all that fat.
-3-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=bored,...I don't think you're a person at this point.  A man with breasts?  What a horrifying sight...
-3-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=angry,OK, seriously.  Breasts on a man?  What the hell are you?  Besides totally gross.
-3-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=frustrated,...I really thought breasts separated men and women pretty cleanly.  Then again, you don't seem human at all.
-3-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=confused,...Wait, I thought men had nipples.  Did I read that wrong?  I was mostly staring at their abs.
-3-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=angry,...Are you pulling my leg?  Do men have nipples or not?  Did your makers just forget them?
-3-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=confused,...Did your creators run out of budget when it came to your nipples, or do men just not have them?
-3-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=confused,Uh, you seem to be missing something there, dear.  Or...do men not have nipples?  How do they breastfeed?
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible=seductive,A man's tube?  Well, I've shown you everything you should need to get it working.
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible=seductive-2,Don't point it towards my nude body...<i>that's far too much for me to bear</i>.
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible=stretching,Good thing it happened <i>now</i>.  My mind's drifting.
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible=seductive,Perfect.  More than seeing your tube, I want to see how it reacts to my body.
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pit=seductive,Omigosh, Pit, are you showing your tube?  It's not a little tiny thing, is it?  I hear they can get pretty big!
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pit=seductive,Hey, Angel-boy...do you have a <i>man</i>-sized tube?  If so, I might just fall for your cute little winged self.
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pit=teasing,Normally I go for tall, strong men...but Hibiki's short like you, and he's kind of cute like you, too.  Do you have a decent-sized tube?
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pit=teasing,It's my understanding men's tubes can vary in size, Pit.  I'm willing to overlook shortness in a man if he puts his girth elsewhere.
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=stretching,Well, since you're not exactly fully equipped up above, I'm not expecting much.
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=smug,Did your creators spend any more time developing a full tube for you, dear?  I hope so.
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=teasing,I've learned not to trust androids' anatomy, considering last time.  What's your situation <i>downstairs</i>?
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=seductive,I know you're artificial, but <i>please</i> try to teach me something about men this time, OK?
-3-male_small_crotch_is_visible=angry,<i>That's</i> what I've been putting on this whole production for?
-3-male_small_crotch_is_visible=angry,...<i>Really</i>?  Out of all the men on Earth, I get <i>you</i>?
-3-male_small_crotch_is_visible=bored,Wow.  If <i>Hibiki's</i> is that small, I'm glad he doesn't flirt back with me.
-3-male_small_crotch_is_visible=angry,<i>That</i>...isn't doing anything for me.  Please tell me most men are bigger than you.
-3-male_small_crotch_is_visible=interested,...Is my nude body making it shrink in fear?
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=laughing,What a wonderful little friend you've got there.  Maybe I'll just <i>gobble him up</i>.
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=excited,They told me as a girl that it spit poison.  But now I know what it <i>really</i> spits, and I want some.
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=laughing,Hi there, little guy!  You're not afraid of women at all, are you?  Standing up so tall and proud.
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=confused,Why's it look like a little mushroom?  Is that better aerodynamically or something?
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=laughing,So if I sat on that thing, would my lovely golden hair reach down far enough to tickle those egg-things in the back?
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=vain,Must be nice as a man, always having a friend around.  Though I guess I have <i>two</i>.
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=teasing,I don't have a frame of reference myself, but...that looks pretty good!  A comfortable fit...<i>if you think you can convince me</i>.
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=seductive,Hey, I'm not going to pretend to be an expert--and that doesn't look half bad!  Maybe I'll collect <i>your</i> seed, cutie.
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=seductive,Ooh, that looks perfectly manageable!  As much as I'm drawn to the burly types, you are just <i>so</i> cute...I'm considering.
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=vain,Looks like a decent fit, darling...maybe <i>you'll</i> give me my baby.  She'll be such a cute little girl!
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=seductive,Oh, that looks OK!  I'm delicate, so I was worried it might be painful to stuff inside me...<i>God</i>, you're so adorable.
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s=seductive,Ohh, that's cute!  So it's actually accurate?  <i>Interesting</i>...
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s=seductive,Ooh, that <i>does</i> match what I've seen!  Maybe what I really needed from a man was some <i>artificiality</i>...
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s=seductive,Oho!  And it <i>works</i>?  Perhaps a <i>mechanical</i> man is what I've been searching for this whole time.
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s=teasing,Ooh, maybe <i>human</i> men are overrated.  What do you think, dear?  Could you satisfy a woman?
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible=seductive,I've read the bigger a man's tube is, the deeper he can deposit seed.  Looks like you're on my radar, ~name~.
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible=awkward,...How'd you walk over here with that thing?  It looks so unwieldy.
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible=shocked,Eek!  Men have three legs?  W-where's your tube?  The book lied to me!
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible=shocked,Eek!  I--I should have known not to trust that book!  That thing's huge!  It can't fit in me!
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=awkward,...You're an <i>outlier</i>, right, Ryu?  Or does all that fighting make a man's thing grow?
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=shocked,<i>Eek!  I--I take it back!  Don't touch me with that thing--I don't care about your muscles</i>!
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=shocked,<i>Eek</i>!  Y-you can't put that thing inside me!  It'd kill me before your muscles did!
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=awkward,That's, uh...a little oversized.  Maybe you could just squeeze me with your muscles and we could have sex that way?
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=angry,...OK, I know how big it's <i>supposed</i> to be.  You're just a weird freak imitation of a man.
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=shocked,<i>Aaaack!  Help!  W-what is that thing?  That's not a--a tube, a penis, whatever</i>!
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=bored,...You're <i>definitely</i> not a man.  I come from a planet of women, and still I know that for sure.
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=shocked,<i>Eeeek!  Y-you're a monster, not a man!  G-get away from me!  Keep your tube</i>!
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=frustrated,...Are you the <i>average</i> size?  Because I retract anything I said about having sex with men, then.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible=smug,Hey, I've shown the chest and even more.  Might as well just get it over with.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible=teasing,Don't be so hard on yourself.  I hear Earth babies aren't genetically engineered.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible=smug,Mejarians are bred beautiful and buxom.  I'm not getting my hopes up for women that are forced to be all-natural.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible=smug,I'm not expecting much.  Earth wouldn't want Mejare's organs so badly if they were happy with their own.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia=vain,We really did this in the wrong order, Meia.  You'd start off with the average Mejarian chest, and then I'd show off something truly magnificent.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia=teasing,Me getting naked first kind of stole your thunder, huh?  Oh, well.  You don't like the spotlight, right?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia=vain,I know you don't like people staring at you.  That's why I'm here--so they're distracted!
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia=laughing,Don't worry, Leader.  They're all still staring at me, so you don't need to feel embarrassed.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=laughing,<i>Well, Meia?  Are you going to do it, with my hungry eyes boring into you</i>?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=interested,You heard Elizabeth, Leader.  Are you going to show your breasts to your second-in-command?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=stretching,Liz is right, Meia--this is very awkward.  It's only, what, the hundredth time I've seen you naked?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=stretching,<i>Oh, my!  Not Meia's breasts!  Oh, Elizabeth, why must you remind me of this horror</i>?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=smug,With my pilot's keen eye for patterns, I'm guessing the bra isn't coming off <i>this</i> time, either.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=teasing,My instincts are finely honed from piloting, you know.  I see those little things you still have!
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=stretching,Oh, please.  You've got that hat, the nose, the tie, and you think I'm buying the bra after <i>last</i> time?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=stretching,Just get the trick over with, Whiteface.  I see about three different ways you could avoid the bra, and I'm just glancing.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=stretching,Should have expected as much from Miss Grape-flavored over here.  She's going to strip totally backwards, isn't she?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=teasing,I don't know what I expected.  Your stripping order's got us all on the edge of our seats!
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=stretching,I like to tease...Miss Grape-flavored here just likes to get to the point.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=laughing,Men seem pretty simple and stupid.  I bet they like how you just skip to the good stuff.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=interested,What are you planning, Miss Pixie?  You've got a mischievous look in your eye...well, more mischievous than usual.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=interested,You look like you're plotting something, Kyu.  Mind making it known to the rest of us?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=teasing,Hey, Miss Pixie.  Stop going on about nonsense like usual and show those cute fairy breasts of yours.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=smug,What are you on about now?  Stop stalling for time and show your chest, Miss Pixie.  I don't have all evening.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:felicia=shocked,Wait, you really <i>are</i> a cat?  Like, that's <i>fur</i>?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:felicia=shocked,Wait, you're <i>real</i>?  H-how does that work?  Did Earth crossbreed cats and women?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:felicia=shocked,<i>Eeek</i>!  T-that's <i>real</i> fur?  You're a cat?  Omigosh!
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:felicia=shocked,Wait, I thought that was just skimpy clothing?  You're <i>really</i> a cat?  And it's fur?  B-but how?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=annoyed,Wonderful.  Yes.  Worth the wait.  I've never seen breasts before.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=awkward,Those...actually look pretty normal.  I'm surprised.  I thought they'd have teeth marks.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=awkward,...OK.  Maybe you were just kidding about that public-use stuff.  Those look fine...
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=angry,I was worried there...OK.  So you were mostly kidding about getting screwed in public.  That's not funny!
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:vriska=stretching,There she goes again.  Some girls never learn...even if they've got magical dice.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:vriska=interested,The gimmick's played out, honey.  You can just be normal like the rest of us.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:vriska=teasing,It doesn't matter how brilliant your light show is, darling...people only get dazzled once.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:vriska=smug,You'd be surprised what humans can get used to, dear.  This isn't impressive anymore.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=bored,...Or she's just going to strip part of the stems.  Apparently this place has no rules at all.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=bored,...Or that could happen.  I swear, you could count each of your fingers as a layer in this dump...
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=annoyed,...I doll myself up for this evening on a foreign planet, and Little Miss Forest Sprite goes around counting flowers as layers.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=frustrated,...OK, yeah.  It was funny for one round, but that's not clothing.  This girl's a bigger tease than I am.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=laughing,Wait, your breasts are out already?  Even <i>I</i> brought some accessories to stave it off!
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=interested,Wow, you athletes get straight to the point, don't you?  This is your second loss!
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=interested,I know you're proud of your strength, honey, but wearing a lot of clothes is what wins games here.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=stretching,Well, that was fast.  Not wearing much?  I guess athletes can't help but try to set new best times.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=interested,I guess firing straight up makes it a little easier to hit your mark.  Must be a breeze for you.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=seductive,You sure are confident.  I know I <i>act</i> that way, but you really put your money where your mouth is.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=vain,I'm really no good with weapons at all...ground combat is an awful mess.  That's why my Dread is so fun to pilot!
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=teasing,You're still so cool.  But with this sort of thing, maybe it's best not to push your luck...
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible=interested,...Yeah, OK.  So why were you pretending to be a woman?
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible=laughing,Shame on you, a man making fun of me by dressing like a woman!
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible=laughing,You know, when <i>B.C.</i> dressed as a woman, she got fake breasts to keep up the facade.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible=awkward,...You know, the Nirvana's hot springs might make your breasts grow.  You should look into that.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:7b=interested,Something the matter, dear?  Run out of cute outfits to hide your...well, <i>lack</i> of breasts?
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:7b=laughing,...Yeah, I'd try not to strip normally if <i>those</i> were all I had.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:7b=laughing,Aww, don't feel bad.  Those pants are cute...they clash with the blue of your flat chest.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:7b=vain,Well, now I can see why you were shy.  But a woman should stand proud!  ...Hard to say that when there's no flat Mejarians.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:7a=laughing,You roll a die that could give you an outfit like <i>that</i>, and you get embarrassed?  Honestly...
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:7a=laughing,Aww, what are you so embarrassed about, darling?  Well, I guess that bikini is supposed to be stretched a little.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:7a=interested,Not filling up that bikini quite how you want to, dear?  Is that why you're blushing?
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:7a=laughing,Cute little blue nipples you've got there.  Too bad you don't have the breasts behind them to fill that bikini.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:videl=vain,Oh, don't be such a buzzkill.  I specifically moved my hair <i>out</i> of the way, and now you go and try to cover them with it.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:videl=seductive,I know they're on the small side, Videl, but you're such a cute little thing!  Move those pigtails aside like I did and let them hang free.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:videl=vain,Hey, even if you're small, a woman's got to be proud of her body.  Move your hair aside like I did!
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:videl=smug,Oh, don't be so embarrassed, Videl!  Look how I moved my hair <i>out</i> of the way--granted, Mejarian genes tend to leave us well-endowed.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible=seductive-2,It's so hard to bear my jealousy.  You're so much bigger than me!
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible=laughing,How can a Mejarian compete with that?  Oh, right, by hitting puberty.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible=vain,See, Meia would be <i>absolutely convinced</i> you're bigger than she is.  She really needs to relax.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible=laughing,Men have nipples, too, and yet they're still so terrified of breasts.  It's just a little extra fat.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=smug,I don't have to, dear.  Meia's already convinced they do.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=interested,It doesn't matter how many compliments you pay to her breasts, honey.  She's a total head case about them.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=stretching,Oh, I've told her many times that her breasts are just fine.  Nothing penetrates her ridiculuous neuroses.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=smug,If I did, I'd just be confirming what Meia already inexplicably believes.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=teasing,Oh!  Well, that's as good as the alternative, I suppose.  <i>I'm starting to see through the pretenses here</i>.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=smug,These tricks are really getting desperate, dear.  But hey, I think I'm starting to get what your <i>real</i> job is.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=laughing,Hey, I know what a stripper is.  If clown is just a fancy term for that on Earth, this is all going to make more sense.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=interested,...Honey, are you just a stripper in fancy makeup?  You'd be much better off dropping these silly tricks and just moving your hips a little.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=interested,How many times do you plan on revealing those things before it takes?  They're just breasts, woman.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=frustrated,You're more neurotic than even Meia when it comes to those things.  Practically had to hold you down to get you to show them.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=interested,At least they're finally out.  With how you've been acting, I thought you had a chunk of them missing or something.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=vain,Earth girls are so ridiculously conservative.  I've got breasts just like you, and you're worried about me seeing the damn things.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:6=awkward,...Huh.  At this point I really have no clue what you're going for.  Maybe I'd understand if Mejare had clowns.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:6=bored,...This <i>clowning</i> business is strange.  No wonder the colonists didn't want any on Mejare.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:6=frustrated,...Clowns really are full of surprises...but I'm more baffled than entertained.  If only I grew up around some.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:6=bored,...You should know that, on the planet I come from, clowns seem to be extinct.  Just some...food for thought.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=excited,Wha--<i>oh my gosh</i>!  <i>Magic</i>?  Do it again!  That was so cool!
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=excited,What did you--<i>ooh!  Ooh</i>!  You really <i>are</i> a fairy!  Show me some more magic!
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=excited,Omigosh!  You weren't kidding around!  Magic is so cool!  Do something else!
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=teasing,...Oh my God.  <i>Magic</i>?  Well, then...what <i>else</i> can you do, hm?
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia=teasing,You're not jealous of me, right, Meia?  I mean, you knew my chest situation going into this, so cheer up!
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia=vain,I hope you don't have any lingering resentment.  I'm Mejare's most beautiful specimen--you shouldn't be comparing yourself to me.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia=interested,Is this why you're always short with me?  A little boob envy?  Come on, Meia, you're better than that.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia=vain,You're too young to be so self-conscious, Meia.  I'm older than you, and look how much fun I'm having!
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia=smug,Honestly.  Twenty years young, and you've already given up on yourself.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia=seductive-2,I can't believe a girl a whole year younger than me could be this ashamed of her body already.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia=stretching,For God's sake, Meia, you're twenty years old and single!  Have some confidence in your body...and get a girlfriend to take the edge off.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=interested,You really like showing off the goods, don't you?  Going to cover them up with other things so you can keep on doing it?
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=laughing,It's the exposure you prefer more than the exhibitionism, isn't it?  You just like the reveal!
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=stretching,There's just no stopping you, honey...well, maybe when you run out of clothes.  How tragic will <i>that</i> be?
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=laughing,What is <i>up</i> with this girl?  You really know how to blow through an audience's attention.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=bored,And she just keeps prattling on...<i>mine</i> are much better.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=bored,Should I stop teasing with her around, or just do it harder so she knows how to do it properly?
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=annoyed,...Look, they're not <i>that</i> great, OK?  Just shut up already...
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=annoyed,And they say <i>I</i> have an ego.  Mine are bigger than that and I don't go on about them this much!
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=laughing,<i>Awww, is Little Miss Princess embarrassed?  Should I get you some warm milk and a servant girl</i>?
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=interested,Is something the matter, honey?  Are your delicate princess breasts all mangled up by men?
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=teasing,Got something to hide, Princess Dearest?  Afraid to bare them to the big, bad pirate lady?
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=laughing,What's the matter, darling?  Afraid this pirate will take your breasts and put up a ransom?
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=teasing,I'm telling you, Barnette is <i>always</i> dragging me to the firing range.  You two would be smitten!  ...Maybe I better keep her away from you.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=smug,It's nothing but <i>guns this, ammo that</i> with my girlfriend.  I better not bring you to the Nirvana, or she'll leave me for you.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=interested,I better engage more with Barnette's gun hobby.  One look at you and she'd toss me to the curb.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=vain,Maybe I should try to have more in common with Barnette.  She loves those icky men's guns as much as you do...she's got a whole collection.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible=stretching,Finally, a woman who understands my pain.  Back pain, that is.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible=teasing,Try not to gloat too much if you find yourself like this against Meia.  She's a little...<i>insecure</i>.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible=teasing,Might be bigger than Barnette's, but she's just so much <i>cuter</i>!
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible=teasing,Look at that, a sister-in-arms.  Nothing quite like a healthy pair, is there?
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,alsoPlaying:meia=stretching,Finally, a woman who understands my pain.  Back pain, that is.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Try not to gloat too much.  Look at how Meia is already--she's a little <i>insecure</i>.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Might be bigger than Barnette's, but she's just so much <i>cuter</i>!
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Look at that, a sister-in-arms.  Nothing quite like a healthy pair, is there?
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia=shocked,Mejare only has animals in zoos--I guess they never wanted us to see them breed with the males.  This is crazy!
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia=seductive,I've...never seen a cat up close.  Are those claws real, too?  Where'd you come from?
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia=excited,Seeing a real cat is...it's nuts!  Mejare has almost no animals at all!
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia=excited,Omigosh, omigosh, omigosh!  Cats are so cool--I've never seen one until now, not up close!
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:velma=laughing,<i>Aww, is someone blind without her glasses</i>?  Just crawl on the floor until you find them, then.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:velma=smug,Don't worry, dear, I won't get in the way.  You can crawl around <i>all you want</i> as you search for them.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:velma=teasing,The game must go on, dearie!  Don't worry, I'll enjoy the view of your butt sticking out as you search the floor.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:velma=teasing,Yeah, Parfet needs her glasses, too.  She's in better shape, though--go get some exercise crawling around looking for them.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=teasing,I see you're lugging quite a lot in back, too.  Must make your legs pretty strong!
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=seductive,<i>Well, now</i>!  I can see why you wanted to be naked--just look at the size of that thing!  But you wear it well.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=smug,Yeah, yeah.  You've got enough in back for a whole extra woman, honey...but it's pretty fantastic, I'll concede.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=seductive,<i>Oh, my</i>!  You could stare at that thing for hours and find new details.  Is it all muscle or all fat?
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=laughing,I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and guess that thing's from squatting, not too much candy.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible=vain,Do your worst, ~name~.  I can handle the sight.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible=smug,I'd like to see how you compare to our whole ship.  The Nirvana's got some fine women on board.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible=interested,Let's see what all the Earth men can't get enough of, ~name~.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible=smug,Oh, please.  I've shielded whole planets from the Harvest--I get bigger thrills than this every day.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=laughing,You know you have a mask, right?  Or is Miss Wrestler actually a little shy about showing her whole face?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=smug,I guess you're more proud of your thighs than your face, because you still have a mask.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=stretching,You really want to be naked, don't you?  Hell, you're just skipping the mask altogether.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=vain,I just realized you still have the mask.  Is it <i>that</i> important to your image?  I understand, then.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=laughing,Whoa, whoa, whoa, <i>what</i>?  Honey, that comes at the <i>end</i>!  Give us something to look forward to!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=interested,Uh...honey, that comes last, usually.  Were you raised in isolation?  Do you not know what audiences like?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=interested,...You're supposed to keep the audience guessing, dear.  This is certainly a curveball, but now you've got no surprises.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=laughing,Wait, <i>what</i>?  Hey, are you trying to be boring for the rest of the game?  Have some suspense!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=vain,Thinking about this again, I don't think I'd want to learn how to shoot like you do...or at least destroy my outfits with it.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=thinking,Do I <i>have</i> an outfit I'd be willing to destroy just for the spectacle?  I'd have to buy some rags for the occasion.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=stretching,I think I'd just <i>die</i> if I tried this.  Not from the bullets, but from seeing my wonderful dress in tatters.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=vain,You really are something else, Aimee.  You'd never catch <i>me</i> tearing up my beautiful wardrobe like that.  I'd have to steal more!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=shocked,Wha--<i>ew!  Ew!  EW!  What's the matter with you</i>?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=shocked,...<i>Where's all the color</i>?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=shocked,...What <i>are</i> you?  You need a hospital!  You need <i>Mejarian</i> medicine!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=shocked,<i>Ack!  Ew!  Wha--what is that thing?  Ew!  Help!  Stop</i>!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=seductive,I'll freely admit to being enchanted--mostly from those flowers.  You only ever see that stuff in gardens on Mejare.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=vain,Must be nice sprouting flowers wherever you go.  They're so rare on Mejare...I wish I could give some to Barnette.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=vain,Flowers are so romantic and sweet-smelling...maybe you're too accustomed to it, but they're a rarity on Mejare.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=vain,You Earth girls are so spoiled when it comes to flowers.  You know how hard it is to start up a garden on Mejare?  We barely have plants!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato=seductive,You're my kind of woman, Misato...sexually confident.  Can you teach me about men sometime?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato=seductive,You really know your way around Earth men, Misato--you're not shy at all!  You've got to teach me.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato=vain,Not to call you <i>easy</i>, dear, but you seem pretty experienced with these men...and confident.  <i>Teach me your ways</i>.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato=seductive,I can never get a man to like me, and yet you seem so experienced and confident.  What's your secret, Miss Military?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=teasing,Ooh, <i>bottomless</i>?  Maybe Earth women value their breasts more than I thought they did.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=vain,Breasts out last, huh, Mia?  I guess you Earth girls want to protect them...we Mejarians feel the same way about our wombs.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=vain,Oh, are you saving the chest for last?  I can understand...my breasts mean a lot to me, too.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=interested,Anything we should know about your breasts, dear?  You seem desperate to protect them.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=seductive,Oh, good.  Now you'd fit right in where I'm from!  Shaved is so much cuter.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=vain,Well, you might be a kitty-cat, but at least you know when enough is enough.  See, Mejare likes to be smooth and sleek.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=teasing,Cleanliness is a virtue on my planet!  So I like this shaving approach, Miss Kitty.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=laughing,Hey, take all the hair away!  This kitty needs to see the sun, after all.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=vain,I can respect a woman going bottomless.  Bare breasts have a tendency to just swing around all ungainly-like...tough for an athlete.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=teasing,Bottomless first?  Yeah, that fits your athletic attitude to keep your breasts all wrapped up tight.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=stretching,You gym rats and your worries about your breasts hitting you in the face or something.  Exercise ruins everything!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=smug,Of course the athlete goes bottomless.  She's worried her bare breasts will throw her off-balance.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:vriska=stretching,But maybe you'll prove us all wrong.  Go right ahead.  More fashion for me.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:vriska=teasing,I'm waiting for you to stick it to me, Vriska.  I certainly <i>want</i> to see more cute outfits.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:vriska=teasing,Going to prove my predictions wrong?  If so, more fashion for me...I win either way.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:vriska=vain,By all means, deliver more adorable outfits upon me.  I don't care if you win.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=awkward,Hey, what are you two...<i>oh, my</i>.  That might be a little much even for me and Barnette.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=shocked,Hey, are you going to put those webs to...<i>use</i>.  Oh, dear.  Barnette might not go for that.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=awkward,That... looks like a lot of rope.  I might have to rethink inviting you over for some time with me and Barnette.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=awkward,...<i>Ooh</i>.  At first I thought your webs sounded cool, but...I'm not sure Barnette would like <i>this</i> much of them.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=laughing,Well, that seals it.  You're a total nymph...disguised as an innocent little dork.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=stretching,It's always the dorky ones, isn't it?  I bet Parfet's a real wild child...Barnette and I are so dreadfully vanilla.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=vain,Being all sheltered must do this to nerdy types.  Barnette and I just kiss and hold hands like the pure angels we are.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=interested,This must be the only thrill you've gotten in years.  You nerdy types are so predictably dirty.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=vain,Reading too much must mess with nerd girls' sexualities.  One medical book got me obsessed with men, after all.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=vain,Panties first, you dorky little thing?  This must be thrilling for you...<i>I</i> can appreciate the warmth of a loving relationship.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=laughing,Oh, we've seen each other naked once or twice.  A day.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=interested,Well, Meia?  Have I seen your <i>you-know-what</i>?  Or do you not know what <i>it</i> is?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=laughing,Don't ask me how you managed to come here if you can barely spit out the word <i>vagina</i>.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=interested,The most important question of the night, isn't it, Leader?  Your <i>you-know-what</i> is such a mystery.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia=laughing,Mejarians are fans of the sleek and shiny.  And since you've already seen <i>my</i> pubic hair situation, you only get one guess as to Meia's.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia=teasing,Expecting her to have any hair?  Well...let's just say I'm not exceptional among Mejarians in <i>all</i> areas.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia=interested,If you think <i>any</i> Mejarian has pubic hair after seeing that the most beautiful one of all doesn't...then Earth people are pretty stupid, huh?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia=interested,Anyone still guessing about planet Mejare's stance on pubic hair?  You shouldn't be.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia,marker:fama_and_oma=vain,Meia and I are young, fertile beauties.  Don't expect any hair...that's for when you become a Fama or something.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=stretching,Honestly, dear, what was your reason for wearing that leotard?  ...Well, I guess Barnette's pretty similar.  Must be how it feels.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=teasing,That leotard's pretty <i>tight</i>, honey.  Just digging up into you...my Barnette dresses the same way.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=vain,I can understand loving the way leotards feel downstairs.  My girlfriend wears something <i>just</i> like it.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=teasing,I <i>may</i> have tried on Barnette's outfit once...so I know how that leotard must be digging into your nether regions.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=teasing,Well, how's <i>that</i> for karma?  Cover your breasts, and fate demands you show your cute little rear!  But of course, you wanted to.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=seductive,Ooh, what an adorable little behind!  Don't go and cover it, now!  <i>I know you don't really want to</i>.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=teasing,Nice and tight--you're just a tiny vixen of a girl, aren't you?  <i>Desperate</i> to strut your stuff.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=laughing,<i>Heeheeheehee</i>!  Seems fate would have you baring it all--that's what you want anyway, right?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible=teasing,Not bad, but you still can't compete with my Barnette.  She's just so cute!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible=seductive-2,Another woman nude?  Why, that's simply <i>unheard of</i> on Mejare!  It's forbidden!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible=teasing,Hear that?  It's the sound of thousands of Tarakkians whimpering, clutching their work spades in terror.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible=confused,How often do you Earth people have sex, anyway?  Is it just a breeding thing, or do men actually give you a good time?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia=vain,Ah, such lovely pale skin!  You see the light of day even less than I do, boss.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia=confused,You're even fairer than I am.  Do you think men like that the same way women do?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia=teasing,Look at that tight, pale little body!  Would you believe she doesn't have a girlfriend?  Unreal!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia=seductive-2,You turn plenty of heads on our crew, Meia, with those abs and that fair skin.  You're so cruel, never returning the feelings.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma=smug,Maybe I'm judging you too harshly.  <i>I've</i> considered going commando beneath the dress...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma=interested,I guess I'm not much more covered under the dress, huh?  Perhaps we're more similar than I realized.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma=smug,Yeah, this is definitely giving you a thrill.  I wonder if <i>I'd</i> get the same sensation walking around in just the dress.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma=teasing,My dress is pretty much the only thing that covers me, too...<i>maybe we should swap</i>.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=awkward,What are you--oh, dear.  That's <i>one</i> way to get off.  Is this how your "darlin'" does it?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=interested,I have a "darlin'," too...her name is Barnette.  And she doesn't ask me to graze her crotch with bullets.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=laughing,I guess when you can shoot your own clothes off, this is the kind of thing you need to do to reach orgasm.  Is your "darlin'" a good shot, too?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=laughing,These Earth girls just keep getting more depraved.  Your "darlin'" being a man must have done this to you, you poor thing.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:0-9=vain,I should hope so!  She doesn't do all those squats in the gym because she thinks it's fun...or maybe she does, who knows.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:0-9=vain,Of course I would.  My Leader is more of a steal than she cares to admit!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:0-9=teasing,Hey, it's not a lack of beauty that keeps Meia single--it's a lack of smiling.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:0-9=stretching,Of course I agree, honey.  The trouble is getting <i>Meia</i> to do so, the neurotic little thing she is.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=seductive,Still as cute as a button!  Why you'd want to hide that body, I can only wonder...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=teasing,Must be the neuroses of a royal that made you ashamed of your body.  No other explanation...you're <i>cute</i>.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=seductive,Ohhh, you're like a little chestnut of adorableness!  Why'd you hide your body from me, huh, sweetie?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=seductive,You barely look a day into womanhood, darling.  It's hard to find you erotic when I just want to <i>squeeze</i> you instead!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:vriska=laughing,<i>Come now, darling</i>!  I think that suits you just fine...technically covered, but people can see right past.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:vriska=interested,You're not <i>complaining</i> now, are you?  What, because you have to play fair like the rest of us?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:vriska=teasing,I thank you once again for the wonderful look at outfits across the universe.  But this pirate's done with you now.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:vriska=teasing,That's what happens when you play against a pirate, sweetie.  She strips you down eventually.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=laughing,I display my beautifully maintained, smooth, glorious body.  And then you follow it up with an mannish, unkempt jungle.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=teasing,You <i>really</i> need some time with our crew.  We'll pry you away from these awful men, and give you a proper shave while we're at it.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=interested,Ouch.  Hard to follow my pristine body with one that's...rather shoddily maintained, if you follow.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=teasing,You're in desperate need of a Mejarian makeover, ~name~.  Specifically a shave.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=interested,Oh hey, your partner's stripping, too.  Just here for moral support, or are you two lovers?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=teasing,Did you really need help stripping, dear?  Or did you <i>want</i> her to strip you, you little lovebird?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=vain,So you've totally got a crush on this girl, right?  I get it...I would've asked Barnette to strip me if she were here.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=thinking,Maybe I should've brought <i>my</i> girlfriend here with me, too...nah, she wouldn't have gone for it.  She needs to lighten up.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=shocked,Oh my God.  You weren't kidding.  You really <i>are</i> some kind of public whore.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=frustrated,...I'm gonna go home now and tell Barnette I love her.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=frustrated,...Earth is a scary planet.  I just wanted to have a little fun.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=shocked,...I swear I don't act like this.  I just think flirting is fun!  I have a girlfriend, honest!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=interested,Nothing else, huh?  Why'd you even play this game without dressing up?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=smug,Well, that didn't take long.  One wonders why you came to a strip poker joint just to practice personal hygiene.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=seductive,And...everything else is part of your body?  Absolutely crazy...but kind of cute.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=interested,You're a weird one, dear.  Let your hair grow out, then shave it...come to strip poker, don't wear anything.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=shocked,<i>Eek!  No!  I-I was just joking!  Don't use your magic</i>!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=shocked,<i>Ack!  M-magic?  I'm sorry I made fun of you</i>!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=shocked,<i>Wait, no!  You're very decent!  Extremely decent!  I'm sorry</i>!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=shocked,<i>Wait!  Stop!  D-don't shoot, or cast anything, or whatever</i>!

-2-male_chest_will_be_visible=excited,Now <i>this</i> is gonna throw me for a loop.  Show me what Earth girls are all too used to.
-2-male_chest_will_be_visible=vain,A man's chest, in the flesh?  Well, <i>I've</i> certainly been no stranger to flesh tonight.
-2-male_chest_will_be_visible=smug,So is this going to make me cum on sight, or what?
-2-male_chest_will_be_visible=interested,I love women's bodies more than anything...so make sure you change my mind about that.
-2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=interested,Ooh, does little Angel-boy want to go topless?  I hear you men don't treat that with quite the concern <i>we</i> do.
-2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=seductive,I've <i>never</i> seen men naked before, Pit...<i>won't you get your chest out</i>?  I hear men don't care about that anyway.
-2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=teasing,Is it true that men get topless all the time?  I want to see if Mr. Angel is rocking any <i>muscles</i> beneath his stammering.
-2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=seductive,Oh, please, Mr. Angel, I'm <i>desperate</i> to see a man nude...can't you show me your chest?  Men don't mind that, right?
-2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:link=bored,...<i>Nin-ten-doh</i>?  <i>Character</i>?  This guy's <i>nuts</i>...I better avoid his seed.
-2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:link=interested,...That was a <i>character</i>?  Yeah, I can see why you're playing to strangers in a dump like this.
-2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:link=laughing,You were doing a <i>character</i>?  Is that what men connect to, a grunting buffoon?
-2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:link=laughing,I'm sorry, you <i>broke</i> character?  That implies there <i>was</i> one, dear.  You know, with emotions and speech.
-2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=teasing,So, Little Dungeon Bot...are you built <i>exactly</i> like a man?
-2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=seductive,I'm so dreadfully uninformed about men's bodies, 9S.  Is your artificial body a good enough substitute?
-2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=teasing,You're a little shy about being fake, right?  Well...here's your chance to show me you're a <i>real</i> boy.
-2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=seductive,Can an android really satisfy my unending curiosity about men's muscles?  Give it a shot, honey.
-2-male_chest_is_visible=excited,So what do men do with all those muscles?  Bang rocks together?  Arm-wrestle and grunt?
-2-male_chest_is_visible=stretching,Something about those muscles just <i>works</i>, damn it!  Why can't I figure it out?
-2-male_chest_is_visible=seductive-2,<i>Why</i> does this turn me on?  I love women, too, but they're so <i>different</i>!
-2-male_chest_is_visible=laughing,<i>Oh, dear.  That's going to finish me off, I fear</i>.
-2-male_chest_is_visible=smug,Well, now!  It's good to see a strong man...especially since their brains aren't much.
-2-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=confused,Oh, men wear the same underwear we do?  Well, why won't our prisoners show me theirs, then?
-2-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=confused,...Are you <i>sure</i> you're not a woman, dear?  Because that underwear looks pretty feminine...unless men and women share styles.
-2-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=laughing,Uh...wow.  I really thought men and women would wear different underwear.  Women know better than to tear it up, you know?
-2-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=vain,Do men really wear the same underwear women do?  Not that <i>I</i> own any lingerie...pirates can't afford much.
-2-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=smug,Interesting choice of underwear, sweetheart.  <i>Women</i> wear that...I wouldn't think men would.  Too delicate for them.
-2-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=confused,...Wait, I thought men had nipples.  Did I read that wrong?  I was mostly staring at their abs.
-2-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=angry,...Are you pulling my leg?  Do men have nipples or not?  Did your makers just forget them?
-2-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=confused,...Did your creators run out of budget when it came to your nipples, or do men just not have them?
-2-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=confused,Uh, you seem to be missing something there, dear.  Or...do men not have nipples?  How do they breastfeed?
-2-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=teasing,Oh, that's...not so bad!  About as many muscles as they had in that book I read...though your height leaves something to be desired.
-2-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=teasing,Not bad, honey, but I expected a little better from such a tiny man.  Doesn't being short make gaining muscle easier?
-2-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=vain,Oh, don't feel <i>too</i> bad.  Hibiki is short, and he's not too ripped either...even though he'd be much more handsome that way.
-2-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=stretching,Nothing to be embarrassed about, dear.  Well, maybe your <i>height</i> is.  Work on that instead.
-2-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=confused,...OK, now I'm <i>really</i> confused.  Men can have breasts?  You're not all that fat.
-2-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=bored,...I don't think you're a person at this point.  A man with breasts?  What a horrifying sight...
-2-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=angry,OK, seriously.  Breasts on a man?  What the hell are you?  Besides totally gross.
-2-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=frustrated,...I really thought breasts separated men and women pretty cleanly.  Then again, you don't seem human at all.
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible=excited,Whatever I'm feeling must be instinct.  Good thing I'm OK with that--Meia'd be trying to logic it out.
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible=vain,It's only fair, ~name~.  I've been baring it all for a while now.  And I'm a poor, delicate little woman.
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible=teasing,Come on, ~name~.  Do this poor Mejarian a favor and show her something new.
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible=smug,I'm expecting big things from you, ~name~.  I mean, you <i>did</i> beat me.
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible=teasing,If I can masturbate next to a strange alien, surely he can stand naked and help me do it.
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,alsoPlaying:meia=excited,Whatever I'm feeling must be instinct.  Sometimes that's better than logic--pilots don't have time to think.
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,It's only fair, ~name~.  I've been baring it all for a while now.  And I'm a poor, delicate little woman.
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Come on, ~name~.  Do this poor Mejarian a favor and show her something new.
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,I'm expecting big things from you, ~name~.  I mean, you <i>did</i> beat me.
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,If I can masturbate next to a strange alien, surely he can stand naked and help me do it.
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pit=seductive,Omigosh, Pit, are you showing your tube?  It's not a little tiny thing, is it?  I hear they can get pretty big!
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pit=seductive,Hey, Angel-boy...do you have a <i>man</i>-sized tube?  If so, I might just fall for your cute little winged self.
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pit=teasing,Normally I go for tall, strong men...but Hibiki's short like you, and he's kind of cute like you, too.  Do you have a decent-sized tube?
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pit=teasing,It's my understanding men's tubes can vary in size, Pit.  I'm willing to overlook shortness in a man if he puts his girth elsewhere.
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=stretching,Well, since you're not exactly fully equipped up above, I'm not expecting much.
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=smug,Did your creators spend any more time developing a full tube for you, dear?  I hope so.
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=teasing,I've learned not to trust androids' anatomy, considering last time.  What's your situation <i>downstairs</i>?
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=seductive,I know you're artificial, but <i>please</i> try to teach me something about men this time, OK?
-2-male_small_crotch_is_visible=awkward,Uh...that doesn't really seem much better than a woman's fingers.
-2-male_small_crotch_is_visible=angry,<i>That's</i> all you've got for me?  Make it bigger!
-2-male_small_crotch_is_visible=frustrated,Don't tell me <i>all</i> men are that small!  There's bigger ones, right?  Right?
-2-male_small_crotch_is_visible=annoyed,I was starting to think about sex with a man...not anymore.
-2-male_small_crotch_is_visible=confused,...Don't they...get bigger?  I wanted to be, like...<i>stuffed</i>...or something.
-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=vain,I've <i>got</i> to try one...with Barnette around, of course.  Wouldn't want to two-time her.
-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=excited,I'm <i>loving</i> this.  Guess it's why that miserable old hag of a judge called me a witch.
-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=seductive,Looks like it'd be a <i>perfect</i> fit...for my perfect body.
-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=laughing,My brain doesn't know what it wants...but my body does.
-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s=seductive,Ohh, that's cute!  So it's actually accurate?  <i>Interesting</i>...
-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s=seductive,Ooh, that <i>does</i> match what I've seen!  Maybe what I really needed from a man was some <i>artificiality</i>...
-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s=seductive,Oho!  And it <i>works</i>?  Perhaps a <i>mechanical</i> man is what I've been searching for this whole time.
-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s=teasing,Ooh, maybe <i>human</i> men are overrated.  What do you think, dear?  Could you satisfy a woman?
-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=teasing,I don't have a frame of reference myself, but...that looks pretty good!  A comfortable fit...<i>if you think you can convince me</i>.
-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=seductive,Hey, I'm not going to pretend to be an expert--and that doesn't look half bad!  Maybe I'll collect <i>your</i> seed, cutie.
-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=seductive,Ooh, that looks perfectly manageable!  As much as I'm drawn to the burly types, you are just <i>so</i> cute...I'm considering.
-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=vain,Looks like a decent fit, darling...maybe <i>you'll</i> give me my baby.  She'll be such a cute little girl!
-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=seductive,Oh, that looks OK!  I'm delicate, so I was worried it might be painful to stuff inside me...<i>God</i>, you're so adorable.
-2-male_large_crotch_is_visible=excited,Ooh...they weren't that big in the <i>book</i>.  What a pleasant surprise.
-2-male_large_crotch_is_visible=interested,So, ~name~, is yours <i>especially</i> big?  You can be honest.
-2-male_large_crotch_is_visible=seductive,I don't think that'd fit...but it <i>does</i> look like fun to play with.
-2-male_large_crotch_is_visible=laughing,Kinda makes want to bat it around like a cat.  It's so funny-looking!
-2-male_large_crotch_is_visible=seductive,That might have a better home between my breasts than inside me.  Men like that too, right?
-2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=angry,...OK, I know how big it's <i>supposed</i> to be.  You're just a weird freak imitation of a man.
-2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=shocked,<i>Aaaack!  Help!  W-what is that thing?  That's not a--a tube, a penis, whatever</i>!
-2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=bored,...You're <i>definitely</i> not a man.  I come from a planet of women, and still I know that for sure.
-2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=shocked,<i>Eeeek!  Y-you're a monster, not a man!  G-get away from me!  Keep your tube</i>!
-2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=frustrated,...Are you the <i>average</i> size?  Because I retract anything I said about having sex with men, then.
-2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=awkward,...You're an <i>outlier</i>, right, Ryu?  Or does all that fighting make a man's thing grow?
-2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=shocked,<i>Eek!  I--I take it back!  Don't touch me with that thing--I don't care about your muscles</i>!
-2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=shocked,<i>Eek</i>!  Y-you can't put that thing inside me!  It'd kill me before your muscles did!
-2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=awkward,That's, uh...a little oversized.  Maybe you could just squeeze me with your muscles and we could have sex that way?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible=smug,A healthy pair of breasts should help me along.  That's usually how this goes.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible=interested,Don't be shy, ~name~!  No use now, when I haven't been shy this whole game.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible=stretching,Ah, the safe and familiar.  That's what a woman needs to reach orgasm.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible=seductive,I'm used to Barnette's adorable little body, you know.  You've got steep competition.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:vriska=stretching,There she goes again.  Some girls never learn...even if they've got magical dice.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:vriska=interested,The gimmick's played out, honey.  You can just be normal like the rest of us.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:vriska=teasing,It doesn't matter how brilliant your light show is, darling...people only get dazzled once.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:vriska=smug,You'd be surprised what humans can get used to, dear.  This isn't impressive anymore.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=laughing,<i>Well, Meia?  Are you going to do it, with my hungry eyes boring into you</i>?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=interested,You heard Elizabeth, Leader.  Are you going to show your breasts to your second-in-command?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=stretching,Liz is right, Meia--this is very awkward.  It's only, what, the hundredth time I've seen you naked?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=stretching,<i>Oh, my!  Not Meia's breasts!  Oh, Elizabeth, why must you remind me of this horror</i>?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=bored,...Or she's just going to strip part of the stems.  Apparently this place has no rules at all.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=bored,...Or that could happen.  I swear, you could count each of your fingers as a layer in this dump...
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=annoyed,...I doll myself up for this evening on a foreign planet, and Little Miss Forest Sprite goes around counting flowers as layers.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=frustrated,...OK, yeah.  It was funny for one round, but that's not clothing.  This girl's a bigger tease than I am.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=interested,I guess firing straight up makes it a little easier to hit your mark.  Must be a breeze for you.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=seductive,You sure are confident.  I know I <i>act</i> that way, but you really put your money where your mouth is.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=vain,I'm really no good with weapons at all...ground combat is an awful mess.  That's why my Dread is so fun to pilot!
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=teasing,You're still so cool.  But with this sort of thing, maybe it's best not to push your luck...
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:felicia=shocked,Wait, you really <i>are</i> a cat?  Like, that's <i>fur</i>?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:felicia=shocked,Wait, you're <i>real</i>?  H-how does that work?  Did Earth crossbreed cats and women?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:felicia=shocked,<i>Eeek</i>!  T-that's <i>real</i> fur?  You're a cat?  Omigosh!
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:felicia=shocked,Wait, I thought that was just skimpy clothing?  You're <i>really</i> a cat?  And it's fur?  B-but how?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=interested,What are you planning, Miss Pixie?  You've got a mischievous look in your eye...well, more mischievous than usual.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=interested,You look like you're plotting something, Kyu.  Mind making it known to the rest of us?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=teasing,Hey, Miss Pixie.  Stop going on about nonsense like usual and show those cute fairy breasts of yours.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=smug,What are you on about now?  Stop stalling for time and show your chest, Miss Pixie.  I don't have all evening.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=smug,With my pilot's keen eye for patterns, I'm guessing the bra isn't coming off <i>this</i> time, either.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=teasing,My instincts are finely honed from piloting, you know.  I see those little things you still have!
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=stretching,Oh, please.  You've got that hat, the nose, the tie, and you think I'm buying the bra after <i>last</i> time?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=stretching,Just get the trick over with, Whiteface.  I see about three different ways you could avoid the bra, and I'm just glancing.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia=vain,If you thought <i>my</i> breasts were nice, ladies...well, Meia's are cute, too.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia=stretching,We really stripped in reverse order, Meia.  First you show how cute Mejarian breasts can be...and then I show how perfect!
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia=smug,Meia's all uncomfortable with her breasts, ladies, even if they <i>are</i> pretty cute.  Don't say anything mean.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia=smug,You're such a head case about those cute little things.  I think it's from spending too much time around me.  Must wear down your ego.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=laughing,Wait, your breasts are out already?  Even <i>I</i> brought some accessories to stave it off!
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=interested,Wow, you athletes get straight to the point, don't you?  This is your second loss!
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=interested,I know you're proud of your strength, honey, but wearing a lot of clothes is what wins games here.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=stretching,Well, that was fast.  Not wearing much?  I guess athletes can't help but try to set new best times.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=annoyed,Wonderful.  Yes.  Worth the wait.  I've never seen breasts before.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=awkward,Those...actually look pretty normal.  I'm surprised.  I thought they'd have teeth marks.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=awkward,...OK.  Maybe you were just kidding about that public-use stuff.  Those look fine...
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=angry,I was worried there...OK.  So you were mostly kidding about getting screwed in public.  That's not funny!
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible=sad,...Hey, listen.  I don't masturbate to children.
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible=bored,...Well, you just made this weird.  Thanks for nothing.
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible=awkward,...Just the thought of being that small makes me want to cry.
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible=laughing,...If most Earth girls are built like you, I think I'm starting to side with the Harvest.  You <i>need</i> Mejarian breasts.
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:7b=interested,Something the matter, dear?  Run out of cute outfits to hide your...well, <i>lack</i> of breasts?
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:7b=laughing,...Yeah, I'd try not to strip normally if <i>those</i> were all I had.
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:7b=laughing,Aww, don't feel bad.  Those pants are cute...they clash with the blue of your flat chest.
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:7b=vain,Well, now I can see why you were shy.  But a woman should stand proud!  ...Hard to say that when there's no flat Mejarians.
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:7a=laughing,You roll a die that could give you an outfit like <i>that</i>, and you get embarrassed?  Honestly...
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:7a=laughing,Aww, what are you so embarrassed about, darling?  Well, I guess that bikini is supposed to be stretched a little.
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:7a=interested,Not filling up that bikini quite how you want to, dear?  Is that why you're blushing?
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:7a=laughing,Cute little blue nipples you've got there.  Too bad you don't have the breasts behind them to fill that bikini.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible=vain,Ohhh...they're just like my Barnette's.  I'm so blessed.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible=seductive,Hey, ~name~.  Bounce them a little.  Have some fun!
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible=teasing,Pretty sizeable for an Earth woman.  Do me a favor and show me what Earth girls like to do with them.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible=interested,I just can't help but play with myself when there's a beautiful woman nearby...I get all excited.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible=mast-2,Frankly, I'm insulted if you think I can't masturbate to that.  Of course, my mind belongs only to Barnette in these times of loneliness.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=bored,And she just keeps prattling on...<i>mine</i> are much better.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=bored,Should I stop teasing with her around, or just do it harder so she knows how to do it properly?
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=annoyed,...Look, they're not <i>that</i> great, OK?  Just shut up already...
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=annoyed,And they say <i>I</i> have an ego.  Mine are bigger than that and I don't go on about them this much!
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=teasing,Oh!  Well, that's as good as the alternative, I suppose.  <i>I'm starting to see through the pretenses here</i>.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=smug,These tricks are really getting desperate, dear.  But hey, I think I'm starting to get what your <i>real</i> job is.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=laughing,Hey, I know what a stripper is.  If clown is just a fancy term for that on Earth, this is all going to make more sense.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=interested,...Honey, are you just a stripper in fancy makeup?  You'd be much better off dropping these silly tricks and just moving your hips a little.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:6=awkward,...Huh.  At this point I really have no clue what you're going for.  Maybe I'd understand if Mejare had clowns.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:6=bored,...This <i>clowning</i> business is strange.  No wonder the colonists didn't want any on Mejare.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:6=frustrated,...Clowns really are full of surprises...but I'm more baffled than entertained.  If only I grew up around some.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:6=bored,...You should know that, on the planet I come from, clowns seem to be extinct.  Just some...food for thought.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=laughing,<i>Awww, is Little Miss Princess embarrassed?  Should I get you some warm milk and a servant girl</i>?
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=interested,Is something the matter, honey?  Are your delicate princess breasts all mangled up by men?
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=teasing,Got something to hide, Princess Dearest?  Afraid to bare them to the big, bad pirate lady?
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=laughing,What's the matter, darling?  Afraid this pirate will take your breasts and put up a ransom?
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=teasing,I'm telling you, Barnette is <i>always</i> dragging me to the firing range.  You two would be smitten!  ...Maybe I better keep her away from you.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=smug,It's nothing but <i>guns this, ammo that</i> with my girlfriend.  I better not bring you to the Nirvana, or she'll leave me for you.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=interested,I better engage more with Barnette's gun hobby.  One look at you and she'd toss me to the curb.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=vain,Maybe I should try to have more in common with Barnette.  She loves those icky men's guns as much as you do...she's got a whole collection.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=smug,I don't have to, dear.  Meia's already convinced they do.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=interested,It doesn't matter how many compliments you pay to her breasts, honey.  She's a total head case about them.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=stretching,Oh, I've told her many times that her breasts are just fine.  Nothing penetrates her ridiculuous neuroses.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=smug,If I did, I'd just be confirming what Meia already inexplicably believes.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=excited,Wha--<i>oh my gosh</i>!  <i>Magic</i>?  Do it again!  That was so cool!
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=excited,What did you--<i>ooh!  Ooh</i>!  You really <i>are</i> a fairy!  Show me some more magic!
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=excited,Omigosh!  You weren't kidding around!  Magic is so cool!  Do something else!
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=teasing,...Oh my God.  <i>Magic</i>?  Well, then...what <i>else</i> can you do, hm?
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=interested,How many times do you plan on revealing those things before it takes?  They're just breasts, woman.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=frustrated,You're more neurotic than even Meia when it comes to those things.  Practically had to hold you down to get you to show them.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=interested,At least they're finally out.  With how you've been acting, I thought you had a chunk of them missing or something.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=vain,Earth girls are so ridiculously conservative.  I've got breasts just like you, and you're worried about me seeing the damn things.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia=excited,Frankly, I'm insulted that you think I can't masturbate to that.  I bet you're thinking of joining me, aren't you?
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia=interested,Officially nude!  Having fun yet, boss?  Isn't it great to let them hang free and relax a little?
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia=seductive,Isn't this taking the edge off?  Or maybe giving you a thrill?  Tell me there's <i>something</i> happening for you.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia=teasing,Don't give us those sob stories.  You're getting turned on, aren't you?  Showing off your breasts to these lecherous Earth people...
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia=teasing,I hope you don't mind me stealing glances at those adorable things.  I can tell you're proud of them, even if you won't admit it.
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible=seductive-2,Want to push them up against mine?  You know, to compare.  Wouldn't want to make things weird between us.
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible=vain,If there's <i>any</i> woman in this galaxy who can appreciate large breasts, it's me.  And Barnette.
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible=laughing,Big enough to kill a man.  Or at least a Tarakkian, who'd die from fright.
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible=teasing,That's the stuff.  You're well on your way to matching my beauty, Earth girl.
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia=shocked,Mejare only has animals in zoos--I guess they never wanted us to see them breed with the males.  This is crazy!
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia=seductive,I've...never seen a cat up close.  Are those claws real, too?  Where'd you come from?
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia=excited,Seeing a real cat is...it's nuts!  Mejare has almost no animals at all!
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia=excited,Omigosh, omigosh, omigosh!  Cats are so cool--I've never seen one until now, not up close!
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:velma=laughing,<i>Aww, is someone blind without her glasses</i>?  Just crawl on the floor until you find them, then.
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:velma=smug,Don't worry, dear, I won't get in the way.  You can crawl around <i>all you want</i> as you search for them.
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:velma=teasing,The game must go on, dearie!  Don't worry, I'll enjoy the view of your butt sticking out as you search the floor.
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:velma=teasing,Yeah, Parfet needs her glasses, too.  She's in better shape, though--go get some exercise crawling around looking for them.
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=teasing,I see you're lugging quite a lot in back, too.  Must make your legs pretty strong!
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=seductive,<i>Well, now</i>!  I can see why you wanted to be naked--just look at the size of that thing!  But you wear it well.
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=smug,Yeah, yeah.  You've got enough in back for a whole extra woman, honey...but it's pretty fantastic, I'll concede.
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=seductive,<i>Oh, my</i>!  You could stare at that thing for hours and find new details.  Is it all muscle or all fat?
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=laughing,I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and guess that thing's from squatting, not too much candy.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible=teasing,Yeah, that's it, ~name~.  Women shouldn't be afraid to strut their stuff.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible=interested,Come on, ~name~, be proud of your body.  That's what they teach us on Mejare.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible=teasing,Be proud of your body, ~name~.  I don't get off on shame.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible=vain,This is what I need more than anything.  I'm without my darling girlfriend and feeling so very unloved.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia=smug,Just when I need it most, you strip down naked for me.  I can always count on you to help me.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia=interested,Crewmates have to help each other, after all...this is certainly helping <i>me</i>.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia=vain,See how great we work together?  I loosen you up so you have fun, and you strip naked to give me some healthy masturbation material.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia=teasing,I knew you couldn't resist helping a crewmate in need.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia=seductive,You're too good-natured to not help your second-in-command out when she needs it.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=teasing,Ooh, <i>bottomless</i>?  Maybe Earth women value their breasts more than I thought they did.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=vain,Breasts out last, huh, Mia?  I guess you Earth girls want to protect them...we Mejarians feel the same way about our wombs.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=vain,Oh, are you saving the chest for last?  I can understand...my breasts mean a lot to me, too.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=interested,Anything we should know about your breasts, dear?  You seem desperate to protect them.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=awkward,Hey, what are you two...<i>oh, my</i>.  That might be a little much even for me and Barnette.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=shocked,Hey, are you going to put those webs to...<i>use</i>.  Oh, dear.  Barnette might not go for that.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=awkward,That... looks like a lot of rope.  I might have to rethink inviting you over for some time with me and Barnette.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=awkward,...<i>Ooh</i>.  At first I thought your webs sounded cool, but...I'm not sure Barnette would like <i>this</i> much of them.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=laughing,Well, that seals it.  You're a total nymph...disguised as an innocent little dork.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=stretching,It's always the dorky ones, isn't it?  I bet Parfet's a real wild child...Barnette and I are so dreadfully vanilla.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=vain,Being all sheltered must do this to nerdy types.  Barnette and I just kiss and hold hands like the pure angels we are.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=interested,This must be the only thrill you've gotten in years.  You nerdy types are so predictably dirty.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=vain,Reading too much must mess with nerd girls' sexualities.  One medical book got me obsessed with men, after all.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=vain,Panties first, you dorky little thing?  This must be thrilling for you...<i>I</i> can appreciate the warmth of a loving relationship.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=vain,I can respect a woman going bottomless.  Bare breasts have a tendency to just swing around all ungainly-like...tough for an athlete.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=teasing,Bottomless first?  Yeah, that fits your athletic attitude to keep your breasts all wrapped up tight.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=stretching,You gym rats and your worries about your breasts hitting you in the face or something.  Exercise ruins everything!
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=smug,Of course the athlete goes bottomless.  She's worried her bare breasts will throw her off-balance.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=laughing,Oh, we've seen each other naked once or twice.  A day.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=interested,Well, Meia?  Have I seen your <i>you-know-what</i>?  Or do you not know what <i>it</i> is?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=laughing,Don't ask me how you managed to come here if you can barely spit out the word <i>vagina</i>.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=interested,The most important question of the night, isn't it, Leader?  Your <i>you-know-what</i> is such a mystery.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:vriska=stretching,But maybe you'll prove us all wrong.  Go right ahead.  More fashion for me.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:vriska=teasing,I'm waiting for you to stick it to me, Vriska.  I certainly <i>want</i> to see more cute outfits.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:vriska=teasing,Going to prove my predictions wrong?  If so, more fashion for me...I win either way.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:vriska=vain,By all means, deliver more adorable outfits upon me.  I don't care if you win.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=vain,Thinking about this again, I don't think I'd want to learn how to shoot like you do...or at least destroy my outfits with it.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=thinking,Do I <i>have</i> an outfit I'd be willing to destroy just for the spectacle?  I'd have to buy some rags for the occasion.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=stretching,I think I'd just <i>die</i> if I tried this.  Not from the bullets, but from seeing my wonderful dress in tatters.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=vain,You really are something else, Aimee.  You'd never catch <i>me</i> tearing up my beautiful wardrobe like that.  I'd have to steal more!
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato=seductive,You're my kind of woman, Misato...sexually confident.  Can you teach me about men sometime?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato=seductive,You really know your way around Earth men, Misato--you're not shy at all!  You've got to teach me.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato=vain,Not to call you <i>easy</i>, dear, but you seem pretty experienced with these men...and confident.  <i>Teach me your ways</i>.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato=seductive,I can never get a man to like me, and yet you seem so experienced and confident.  What's your secret, Miss Military?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=teasing,Well, how's <i>that</i> for karma?  Cover your breasts, and fate demands you show your cute little rear!  But of course, you wanted to.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=seductive,Ooh, what an adorable little behind!  Don't go and cover it, now!  <i>I know you don't really want to</i>.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=teasing,Nice and tight--you're just a tiny vixen of a girl, aren't you?  <i>Desperate</i> to strut your stuff.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=laughing,<i>Heeheeheehee</i>!  Seems fate would have you baring it all--that's what you want anyway, right?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=shocked,Wha--<i>ew!  Ew!  EW!  What's the matter with you</i>?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=shocked,...<i>Where's all the color</i>?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=shocked,...What <i>are</i> you?  You need a hospital!  You need <i>Mejarian</i> medicine!
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=shocked,<i>Ack!  Ew!  Wha--what is that thing?  Ew!  Help!  Stop</i>!
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=seductive,Oh, good.  Now you'd fit right in where I'm from!  Shaved is so much cuter.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=vain,Well, you might be a kitty-cat, but at least you know when enough is enough.  See, Mejare likes to be smooth and sleek.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=teasing,Cleanliness is a virtue on my planet!  So I like this shaving approach, Miss Kitty.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=laughing,Hey, take all the hair away!  This kitty needs to see the sun, after all.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=laughing,You know you have a mask, right?  Or is Miss Wrestler actually a little shy about showing her whole face?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=smug,I guess you're more proud of your thighs than your face, because you still have a mask.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=stretching,You really want to be naked, don't you?  Hell, you're just skipping the mask altogether.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=vain,I just realized you still have the mask.  Is it <i>that</i> important to your image?  I understand, then.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=stretching,Honestly, dear, what was your reason for wearing that leotard?  ...Well, I guess Barnette's pretty similar.  Must be how it feels.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=teasing,That leotard's pretty <i>tight</i>, honey.  Just digging up into you...my Barnette dresses the same way.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=vain,I can understand loving the way leotards feel downstairs.  My girlfriend wears something <i>just</i> like it.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=teasing,I <i>may</i> have tried on Barnette's outfit once...so I know how that leotard must be digging into your nether regions.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=seductive,I'll freely admit to being enchanted--mostly from those flowers.  You only ever see that stuff in gardens on Mejare.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=vain,Must be nice sprouting flowers wherever you go.  They're so rare on Mejare...I wish I could give some to Barnette.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=vain,Flowers are so romantic and sweet-smelling...maybe you're too accustomed to it, but they're a rarity on Mejare.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=vain,You Earth girls are so spoiled when it comes to flowers.  You know how hard it is to start up a garden on Mejare?  We barely have plants!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible=vain,Men are exotic, but you can't beat a woman's smoothness.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible=vain,Men are fascinating, but brand recognition goes a long way.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible=smug,Looky-looky.  A lifetime of living around men, and your groin isn't beat to hell.  Congrats.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible=stretching,Good to know women's beauty extends lightyears across the galaxy.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma=smug,Maybe I'm judging you too harshly.  <i>I've</i> considered going commando beneath the dress...
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma=interested,I guess I'm not much more covered under the dress, huh?  Perhaps we're more similar than I realized.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma=smug,Yeah, this is definitely giving you a thrill.  I wonder if <i>I'd</i> get the same sensation walking around in just the dress.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma=teasing,My dress is pretty much the only thing that covers me, too...<i>maybe we should swap</i>.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=awkward,What are you--oh, dear.  That's <i>one</i> way to get off.  Is this how your "darlin'" does it?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=interested,I have a "darlin'," too...her name is Barnette.  And she doesn't ask me to graze her crotch with bullets.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=laughing,I guess when you can shoot your own clothes off, this is the kind of thing you need to do to reach orgasm.  Is your "darlin'" a good shot, too?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=laughing,These Earth girls just keep getting more depraved.  Your "darlin'" being a man must have done this to you, you poor thing.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=bored,...You know, I <i>would</i> masturbate to that, but I can't really see it.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=bored,Ick.  I'd dump Barnette if she let herself <i>grow out</i> like that.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=frustrated,Way to ruin the moment, ~name~.  I can barely see you behind all that gross pubic hair.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=annoyed,Ugh.  Now I'm going to masturbate to the thought of my razor instead.  Always took it for granted.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:vriska=laughing,<i>Come now, darling</i>!  I think that suits you just fine...technically covered, but people can see right past.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:vriska=interested,You're not <i>complaining</i> now, are you?  What, because you have to play fair like the rest of us?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:vriska=teasing,I thank you once again for the wonderful look at outfits across the universe.  But this pirate's done with you now.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:vriska=teasing,That's what happens when you play against a pirate, sweetie.  She strips you down eventually.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=seductive,Still as cute as a button!  Why you'd want to hide that body, I can only wonder...
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=teasing,Must be the neuroses of a royal that made you ashamed of your body.  No other explanation...you're <i>cute</i>.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=seductive,Ohhh, you're like a little chestnut of adorableness!  Why'd you hide your body from me, huh, sweetie?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=seductive,You barely look a day into womanhood, darling.  It's hard to find you erotic when I just want to <i>squeeze</i> you instead!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=shocked,Oh my God.  You weren't kidding.  You really <i>are</i> some kind of public whore.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=frustrated,...I'm gonna go home now and tell Barnette I love her.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=frustrated,...Earth is a scary planet.  I just wanted to have a little fun.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=shocked,...I swear I don't act like this.  I just think flirting is fun!  I have a girlfriend, honest!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia=smug,Not much different, is she, ladies?  From me, I mean...or <i>any</i> Mejarian.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia=vain,Yes, we Mejarians tend to have a body type we like.  We're pirates, but we're not savages.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia=smug,Sleek and smooth is the Mejarian way.  We don't disagree with <i>everything</i> the state says.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia=stretching,Look how they just slide right off!  And now you can see how they did.  Meia's got to be able to dress quickly to scramble, you know...Mejarian soldiers and such.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=interested,Nothing else, huh?  Why'd you even play this game without dressing up?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=smug,Well, that didn't take long.  One wonders why you came to a strip poker joint just to practice personal hygiene.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=seductive,And...everything else is part of your body?  Absolutely crazy...but kind of cute.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=interested,You're a weird one, dear.  Let your hair grow out, then shave it...come to strip poker, don't wear anything.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=shocked,<i>Eek!  No!  I-I was just joking!  Don't use your magic</i>!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=shocked,<i>Ack!  M-magic?  I'm sorry I made fun of you</i>!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=shocked,<i>Wait, no!  You're very decent!  Extremely decent!  I'm sorry</i>!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=shocked,<i>Wait!  Stop!  D-don't shoot, or cast anything, or whatever</i>!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=interested,Oh hey, your partner's stripping, too.  Just here for moral support, or are you two lovers?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=teasing,Did you really need help stripping, dear?  Or did you <i>want</i> her to strip you, you little lovebird?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=vain,So you've totally got a crush on this girl, right?  I get it...I would've asked Barnette to strip me if she were here.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=thinking,Maybe I should've brought <i>my</i> girlfriend here with me, too...nah, she wouldn't have gone for it.  She needs to lighten up.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:0-9=vain,I should hope so!  She doesn't do all those squats in the gym because she thinks it's fun...or maybe she does, who knows.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:0-9=vain,Of course I would.  My Leader is more of a steal than she cares to admit!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:0-9=teasing,Hey, it's not a lack of beauty that keeps Meia single--it's a lack of smiling.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:0-9=stretching,Of course I agree, honey.  The trouble is getting <i>Meia</i> to do so, the neurotic little thing she is.

-1-male_chest_will_be_visible=laughing,What have we here?  A man running out of options?
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible=teasing,Let's see if your exoticism is enough to start up the waterworks again.
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible=seductive,There's a few men I know with impressive upper bodies.  You're not gonna let me think about <i>them</i>, are you?
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible=seductive-2,I can't bear to watch.  A horrible alien exposing himself before my defeated nude body!
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=teasing,So, Little Dungeon Bot...are you built <i>exactly</i> like a man?
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=seductive,I'm so dreadfully uninformed about men's bodies, 9S.  Is your artificial body a good enough substitute?
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=teasing,You're a little shy about being fake, right?  Well...here's your chance to show me you're a <i>real</i> boy.
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=seductive,Can an android really satisfy my unending curiosity about men's muscles?  Give it a shot, honey.
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=interested,Ooh, does little Angel-boy want to go topless?  I hear you men don't treat that with quite the concern <i>we</i> do.
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=seductive,I've <i>never</i> seen men naked before, Pit...<i>won't you get your chest out</i>?  I hear men don't care about that anyway.
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=teasing,Is it true that men get topless all the time?  I want to see if Mr. Angel is rocking any <i>muscles</i> beneath his stammering.
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=seductive,Oh, please, Mr. Angel, I'm <i>desperate</i> to see a man nude...can't you show me your chest?  Men don't mind that, right?
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:link=bored,...<i>Nin-ten-doh</i>?  <i>Character</i>?  This guy's <i>nuts</i>...I better avoid his seed.
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:link=interested,...That was a <i>character</i>?  Yeah, I can see why you're playing to strangers in a dump like this.
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:link=laughing,You were doing a <i>character</i>?  Is that what men connect to, a grunting buffoon?
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:link=laughing,I'm sorry, you <i>broke</i> character?  That implies there <i>was</i> one, dear.  You know, with emotions and speech.
-1-male_chest_is_visible=teasing,Men look so top-heavy.  Sure you're not gonna topple over right onto me?
-1-male_chest_is_visible=vain,If only you had gotten around to this sooner.  Now all I'm left with is a scientific curiosity.
-1-male_chest_is_visible=smug,Shame you couldn't have done this when I was, you know, <i>masturbating</i>.
-1-male_chest_is_visible=excited,It's like you flipped a woman upside down...and made her <i>irresistible</i>.
-1-male_chest_is_visible=seductive,Mejare's really been missing out all these years.  Men look like a lot of fun in bed, with all those powerful muscles.
-1-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=confused,...Wait, I thought men had nipples.  Did I read that wrong?  I was mostly staring at their abs.
-1-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=angry,...Are you pulling my leg?  Do men have nipples or not?  Did your makers just forget them?
-1-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=confused,...Did your creators run out of budget when it came to your nipples, or do men just not have them?
-1-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=confused,Uh, you seem to be missing something there, dear.  Or...do men not have nipples?  How do they breastfeed?
-1-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=teasing,Oh, that's...not so bad!  About as many muscles as they had in that book I read...though your height leaves something to be desired.
-1-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=teasing,Not bad, honey, but I expected a little better from such a tiny man.  Doesn't being short make gaining muscle easier?
-1-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=vain,Oh, don't feel <i>too</i> bad.  Hibiki is short, and he's not too ripped either...even though he'd be much more handsome that way.
-1-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=stretching,Nothing to be embarrassed about, dear.  Well, maybe your <i>height</i> is.  Work on that instead.
-1-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=confused,...OK, now I'm <i>really</i> confused.  Men can have breasts?  You're not all that fat.
-1-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=bored,...I don't think you're a person at this point.  A man with breasts?  What a horrifying sight...
-1-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=angry,OK, seriously.  Breasts on a man?  What the hell are you?  Besides totally gross.
-1-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=frustrated,...I really thought breasts separated men and women pretty cleanly.  Then again, you don't seem human at all.
-1-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=confused,Oh, men wear the same underwear we do?  Well, why won't our prisoners show me theirs, then?
-1-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=confused,...Are you <i>sure</i> you're not a woman, dear?  Because that underwear looks pretty feminine...unless men and women share styles.
-1-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=laughing,Uh...wow.  I really thought men and women would wear different underwear.  Women know better than to tear it up, you know?
-1-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=vain,Do men really wear the same underwear women do?  Not that <i>I</i> own any lingerie...pirates can't afford much.
-1-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=smug,Interesting choice of underwear, sweetheart.  <i>Women</i> wear that...I wouldn't think men would.  Too delicate for them.
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible=stretching,Took you long enough.  Couldn't have given me a peek while I was masturbating, huh?
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible=seductive-2,Too bad I couldn't have forced this myself.  I'm such a poor representative of Mejare, losing to a man like this.
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible=stretching,I'm such a poor representative of Mejare, losing to a man like this and leering at his tube...and also for being a pirate.
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible=seductive-2,Great, now he's getting his tube-thing out.  <i>Around men, the horror never ends</i>!
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pit=seductive,Omigosh, Pit, are you showing your tube?  It's not a little tiny thing, is it?  I hear they can get pretty big!
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pit=seductive,Hey, Angel-boy...do you have a <i>man</i>-sized tube?  If so, I might just fall for your cute little winged self.
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pit=teasing,Normally I go for tall, strong men...but Hibiki's short like you, and he's kind of cute like you, too.  Do you have a decent-sized tube?
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pit=teasing,It's my understanding men's tubes can vary in size, Pit.  I'm willing to overlook shortness in a man if he puts his girth elsewhere.
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=stretching,Well, since you're not exactly fully equipped up above, I'm not expecting much.
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=smug,Did your creators spend any more time developing a full tube for you, dear?  I hope so.
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=teasing,I've learned not to trust androids' anatomy, considering last time.  What's your situation <i>downstairs</i>?
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=seductive,I know you're artificial, but <i>please</i> try to teach me something about men this time, OK?
-1-male_small_crotch_is_visible=thinking,Size isn't based on height, right?  If it is, Hibiki's <i>really</i> in trouble.
-1-male_small_crotch_is_visible=bored,Huh.  Guess I'm <i>glad</i> I'm all done.  Does that thing still work properly?
-1-male_small_crotch_is_visible=annoyed,Yuck.  Good thing I finished already.  A pipsqueak like that would've taken me right out of the zone.
-1-male_small_crotch_is_visible=angry,I go through this whole game, lose, masturbate, wait around, and <i>this</i> is my reward?
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=teasing,You look like a nice specimen, ~name~.  <i>I'll collect your seed later</i>.
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=vain,Men have a peg, women have a hole.  <i>It's so obvious in retrospect</i>!
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=seductive,I can't help but wonder how that'd feel inside me.  <i>Something must be done</i>.
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=seductive,So inelegant, yet so powerful.  Like men themselves.
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=interested,So, do you men get all competitive about the sizes of those things?  I know women can get touchy about breasts.
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=laughing,Oh, what a nice size!  <i>I always get hungry after sex</i>.
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s=seductive,Ohh, that's cute!  So it's actually accurate?  <i>Interesting</i>...
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s=seductive,Ooh, that <i>does</i> match what I've seen!  Maybe what I really needed from a man was some <i>artificiality</i>...
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s=seductive,Oho!  And it <i>works</i>?  Perhaps a <i>mechanical</i> man is what I've been searching for this whole time.
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s=teasing,Ooh, maybe <i>human</i> men are overrated.  What do you think, dear?  Could you satisfy a woman?
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=teasing,I don't have a frame of reference myself, but...that looks pretty good!  A comfortable fit...<i>if you think you can convince me</i>.
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=seductive,Hey, I'm not going to pretend to be an expert--and that doesn't look half bad!  Maybe I'll collect <i>your</i> seed, cutie.
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=seductive,Ooh, that looks perfectly manageable!  As much as I'm drawn to the burly types, you are just <i>so</i> cute...I'm considering.
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=vain,Looks like a decent fit, darling...maybe <i>you'll</i> give me my baby.  She'll be such a cute little girl!
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=seductive,Oh, that looks OK!  I'm delicate, so I was worried it might be painful to stuff inside me...<i>God</i>, you're so adorable.
-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible=awkward,Uh...I <i>wanted</i> your seed, but I think it'd get lost on its way out of you.
-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible=laughing,Well, now!  Looks like meat's on the menu.
-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible=laughing,A full-course Mejarian meal, this tube of yours.  I'll call Meia over here and make it a dinner for two.
-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible=seductive,Ooh...I'm not quite sure what to do with that thing, but I'd <i>love</i> to try and figure it out.
-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible=vain,I wish Barnette were here...I want to try that thing with her.
-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=angry,...OK, I know how big it's <i>supposed</i> to be.  You're just a weird freak imitation of a man.
-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=shocked,<i>Aaaack!  Help!  W-what is that thing?  That's not a--a tube, a penis, whatever</i>!
-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=bored,...You're <i>definitely</i> not a man.  I come from a planet of women, and still I know that for sure.
-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=shocked,<i>Eeeek!  Y-you're a monster, not a man!  G-get away from me!  Keep your tube</i>!
-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=frustrated,...Are you the <i>average</i> size?  Because I retract anything I said about having sex with men, then.
-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=awkward,...You're an <i>outlier</i>, right, Ryu?  Or does all that fighting make a man's thing grow?
-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=shocked,<i>Eek!  I--I take it back!  Don't touch me with that thing--I don't care about your muscles</i>!
-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=shocked,<i>Eek</i>!  Y-you can't put that thing inside me!  It'd kill me before your muscles did!
-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=awkward,That's, uh...a little oversized.  Maybe you could just squeeze me with your muscles and we could have sex that way?
-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,alsoPlaying:meia=awkward,Uh...I <i>wanted</i> your seed, but I think it'd get lost on its way out of you.
-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,Well, now!  Looks like meat's on the menu.
-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,A full-course Mejarian meal, this tube of yours.  Feeling hungry, Meia?  <i>Let's eat him</i>.
-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,alsoPlaying:meia=seductive,Ooh...I'm not quite sure what to do with that thing, but I'd <i>love</i> to try and figure it out.
-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,I wish Barnette were here...I want to try that thing with her.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible=seductive-2,Do a lady a favor and let her know how she compares.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible=interested,Let's see what Earth's finest is working with.  That's how you'd describe yourself, right?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible=vain,Time to see if years of space colonization have changed women in the ways that matter.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible=thinking,Dita would be a blubbering mess right now.  I could never bring her here--Meia will be annoyed, but Dita's just too sweet for this place.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,alsoPlaying:meia=seductive-2,Do a lady a favor and let her know how she compares.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,alsoPlaying:meia=interested,Let's see what Earth's finest is working with.  That's how you'd describe yourself, right?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,Time to see if years of space colonization have changed women in the ways that matter.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,alsoPlaying:meia=thinking,Dita would be a blubbering mess right now.  We could never bring her here--she's just too sweet for this place.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia=seductive,I'm telling you, you and Valore would be such a cute couple!  And I think she likes you.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia=seductive,You need a girlfriend before you boil over completely.  I bet Valore would be all over you--and she loves formations just as much!
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia=teasing,So self-conscious.  You know what I think?  You should be the cream to Valore's chocolate.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia=vain,Misty's all over you, but she's a little young, don't you think?  Now <i>Valore</i>, she's your type.  A fellow squadron leader!
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:vriska=stretching,There she goes again.  Some girls never learn...even if they've got magical dice.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:vriska=interested,The gimmick's played out, honey.  You can just be normal like the rest of us.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:vriska=teasing,It doesn't matter how brilliant your light show is, darling...people only get dazzled once.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:vriska=smug,You'd be surprised what humans can get used to, dear.  This isn't impressive anymore.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=annoyed,Wonderful.  Yes.  Worth the wait.  I've never seen breasts before.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=awkward,Those...actually look pretty normal.  I'm surprised.  I thought they'd have teeth marks.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=awkward,...OK.  Maybe you were just kidding about that public-use stuff.  Those look fine...
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=angry,I was worried there...OK.  So you were mostly kidding about getting screwed in public.  That's not funny!
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:felicia=shocked,Wait, you really <i>are</i> a cat?  Like, that's <i>fur</i>?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:felicia=shocked,Wait, you're <i>real</i>?  H-how does that work?  Did Earth crossbreed cats and women?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:felicia=shocked,<i>Eeek</i>!  T-that's <i>real</i> fur?  You're a cat?  Omigosh!
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:felicia=shocked,Wait, I thought that was just skimpy clothing?  You're <i>really</i> a cat?  And it's fur?  B-but how?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=interested,I guess firing straight up makes it a little easier to hit your mark.  Must be a breeze for you.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=seductive,You sure are confident.  I know I <i>act</i> that way, but you really put your money where your mouth is.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=vain,I'm really no good with weapons at all...ground combat is an awful mess.  That's why my Dread is so fun to pilot!
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=teasing,You're still so cool.  But with this sort of thing, maybe it's best not to push your luck...
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=smug,With my pilot's keen eye for patterns, I'm guessing the bra isn't coming off <i>this</i> time, either.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=teasing,My instincts are finely honed from piloting, you know.  I see those little things you still have!
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=stretching,Oh, please.  You've got that hat, the nose, the tie, and you think I'm buying the bra after <i>last</i> time?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=stretching,Just get the trick over with, Whiteface.  I see about three different ways you could avoid the bra, and I'm just glancing.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=bored,...Or she's just going to strip part of the stems.  Apparently this place has no rules at all.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=bored,...Or that could happen.  I swear, you could count each of your fingers as a layer in this dump...
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=annoyed,...I doll myself up for this evening on a foreign planet, and Little Miss Forest Sprite goes around counting flowers as layers.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=frustrated,...OK, yeah.  It was funny for one round, but that's not clothing.  This girl's a bigger tease than I am.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=laughing,<i>Well, Meia?  Are you going to do it, with my hungry eyes boring into you</i>?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=interested,You heard Elizabeth, Leader.  Are you going to show your breasts to your second-in-command?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=stretching,Liz is right, Meia--this is very awkward.  It's only, what, the hundredth time I've seen you naked?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=stretching,<i>Oh, my!  Not Meia's breasts!  Oh, Elizabeth, why must you remind me of this horror</i>?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=interested,What are you planning, Miss Pixie?  You've got a mischievous look in your eye...well, more mischievous than usual.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=interested,You look like you're plotting something, Kyu.  Mind making it known to the rest of us?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=teasing,Hey, Miss Pixie.  Stop going on about nonsense like usual and show those cute fairy breasts of yours.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=smug,What are you on about now?  Stop stalling for time and show your chest, Miss Pixie.  I don't have all evening.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=laughing,Wait, your breasts are out already?  Even <i>I</i> brought some accessories to stave it off!
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=interested,Wow, you athletes get straight to the point, don't you?  This is your second loss!
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=interested,I know you're proud of your strength, honey, but wearing a lot of clothes is what wins games here.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=stretching,Well, that was fast.  Not wearing much?  I guess athletes can't help but try to set new best times.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible=laughing,Oh, wow.  You Earth girls really <i>are</i> all-natural.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible=awkward,Normally I say work with what you've got, but...you're not working with <i>anything</i>, really.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible=frustrated,Jeez.  That makes <i>me</i> feel smaller just looking at them.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible=awkward,...<i>Reallllly</i> appreciating Mejarian genetic engineering right now.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible=interested,I've got to introduce you to Meia so she stops whining about how her breasts are small.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:7a=laughing,You roll a die that could give you an outfit like <i>that</i>, and you get embarrassed?  Honestly...
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:7a=laughing,Aww, what are you so embarrassed about, darling?  Well, I guess that bikini is supposed to be stretched a little.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:7a=interested,Not filling up that bikini quite how you want to, dear?  Is that why you're blushing?
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:7a=laughing,Cute little blue nipples you've got there.  Too bad you don't have the breasts behind them to fill that bikini.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:7b=interested,Something the matter, dear?  Run out of cute outfits to hide your...well, <i>lack</i> of breasts?
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:7b=laughing,...Yeah, I'd try not to strip normally if <i>those</i> were all I had.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:7b=laughing,Aww, don't feel bad.  Those pants are cute...they clash with the blue of your flat chest.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:7b=vain,Well, now I can see why you were shy.  But a woman should stand proud!  ...Hard to say that when there's no flat Mejarians.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,Oh, wow.  You Earth girls really <i>are</i> all-natural.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,alsoPlaying:meia=awkward,Normally I say work with what you've got, but...you're not working with <i>anything</i>, really.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,alsoPlaying:meia=frustrated,Jeez.  That makes <i>me</i> feel smaller just looking at them.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,alsoPlaying:meia=awkward,...<i>Reallllly</i> appreciating Mejarian genetic engineering right now.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,alsoPlaying:meia=interested,<i>See</i>, Meia?  <i>That's</i> small.  <i>This</i> is what Earth girls have to feed their children with.  You're <i>fine</i>.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible=seductive,Just gonna let them hang like that?  Swing them around, have a little fun!
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible=seductive,Don't be such a sourpuss.  Shake them around--they're great!
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible=seductive-2,Oh, woe is me.  I'll <i>never</i> measure up to that...
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible=teasing,Don't be so dramatic.  I masturbated, the party's over.  Unless you're trying to seduce someone else here?
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=laughing,<i>Awww, is Little Miss Princess embarrassed?  Should I get you some warm milk and a servant girl</i>?
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=interested,Is something the matter, honey?  Are your delicate princess breasts all mangled up by men?
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=teasing,Got something to hide, Princess Dearest?  Afraid to bare them to the big, bad pirate lady?
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=laughing,What's the matter, darling?  Afraid this pirate will take your breasts and put up a ransom?
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=smug,I don't have to, dear.  Meia's already convinced they do.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=interested,It doesn't matter how many compliments you pay to her breasts, honey.  She's a total head case about them.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=stretching,Oh, I've told her many times that her breasts are just fine.  Nothing penetrates her ridiculuous neuroses.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=smug,If I did, I'd just be confirming what Meia already inexplicably believes.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=interested,How many times do you plan on revealing those things before it takes?  They're just breasts, woman.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=frustrated,You're more neurotic than even Meia when it comes to those things.  Practically had to hold you down to get you to show them.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=interested,At least they're finally out.  With how you've been acting, I thought you had a chunk of them missing or something.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=vain,Earth girls are so ridiculously conservative.  I've got breasts just like you, and you're worried about me seeing the damn things.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=teasing,Oh!  Well, that's as good as the alternative, I suppose.  <i>I'm starting to see through the pretenses here</i>.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=smug,These tricks are really getting desperate, dear.  But hey, I think I'm starting to get what your <i>real</i> job is.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=laughing,Hey, I know what a stripper is.  If clown is just a fancy term for that on Earth, this is all going to make more sense.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=interested,...Honey, are you just a stripper in fancy makeup?  You'd be much better off dropping these silly tricks and just moving your hips a little.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:6=awkward,...Huh.  At this point I really have no clue what you're going for.  Maybe I'd understand if Mejare had clowns.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:6=bored,...This <i>clowning</i> business is strange.  No wonder the colonists didn't want any on Mejare.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:6=frustrated,...Clowns really are full of surprises...but I'm more baffled than entertained.  If only I grew up around some.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:6=bored,...You should know that, on the planet I come from, clowns seem to be extinct.  Just some...food for thought.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=teasing,I'm telling you, Barnette is <i>always</i> dragging me to the firing range.  You two would be smitten!  ...Maybe I better keep her away from you.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=smug,It's nothing but <i>guns this, ammo that</i> with my girlfriend.  I better not bring you to the Nirvana, or she'll leave me for you.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=interested,I better engage more with Barnette's gun hobby.  One look at you and she'd toss me to the curb.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=vain,Maybe I should try to have more in common with Barnette.  She loves those icky men's guns as much as you do...she's got a whole collection.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=excited,Wha--<i>oh my gosh</i>!  <i>Magic</i>?  Do it again!  That was so cool!
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=excited,What did you--<i>ooh!  Ooh</i>!  You really <i>are</i> a fairy!  Show me some more magic!
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=excited,Omigosh!  You weren't kidding around!  Magic is so cool!  Do something else!
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=teasing,...Oh my God.  <i>Magic</i>?  Well, then...what <i>else</i> can you do, hm?
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=bored,And she just keeps prattling on...<i>mine</i> are much better.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=bored,Should I stop teasing with her around, or just do it harder so she knows how to do it properly?
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=annoyed,...Look, they're not <i>that</i> great, OK?  Just shut up already...
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=annoyed,And they say <i>I</i> have an ego.  Mine are bigger than that and I don't go on about them this much!
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia=seductive,Don't let people tell you those aren't cute!  Think of Misty, with her poor little Plutonian ones.  Mine were much bigger at her age!
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia=smug,What would Misty think of her "big sister" exposing herself like this?  Eh, she's a total flirt, she'd be fine with it.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia=vain,Misty'd be cute if she weren't so lecherous.  She should save that for us filthy Mejarians.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia=teasing,Hey, you're still bigger than Misty!  And a bunch of other women you've convinced yourself you're smaller than.  Maybe you should be with <i>her</i>.
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible=stretching,...Oh, did someone reveal her breasts?  It was just so mundane to me, I didn't notice.
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible=teasing,Now <i>you're</i> my kind of woman.  Large and in charge.
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible=vain,It's Barnette's <i>one</i> flaw that her chest isn't as big as mine.  But it's OK--I'm a selfless lover.
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible=smug,Meia's such a head case about her breasts.  She really needs a girlfriend to take the edge off, let her know her body's fine.
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible=laughing,Would you believe there are Earth women who get surgery to make their breasts bigger?  Even Meia wouldn't go <i>that</i> far.
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=teasing,I see you're lugging quite a lot in back, too.  Must make your legs pretty strong!
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=seductive,<i>Well, now</i>!  I can see why you wanted to be naked--just look at the size of that thing!  But you wear it well.
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=smug,Yeah, yeah.  You've got enough in back for a whole extra woman, honey...but it's pretty fantastic, I'll concede.
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=seductive,<i>Oh, my</i>!  You could stare at that thing for hours and find new details.  Is it all muscle or all fat?
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=laughing,I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and guess that thing's from squatting, not too much candy.
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia=shocked,Mejare only has animals in zoos--I guess they never wanted us to see them breed with the males.  This is crazy!
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia=seductive,I've...never seen a cat up close.  Are those claws real, too?  Where'd you come from?
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia=excited,Seeing a real cat is...it's nuts!  Mejare has almost no animals at all!
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia=excited,Omigosh, omigosh, omigosh!  Cats are so cool--I've never seen one until now, not up close!
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:velma=laughing,<i>Aww, is someone blind without her glasses</i>?  Just crawl on the floor until you find them, then.
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:velma=smug,Don't worry, dear, I won't get in the way.  You can crawl around <i>all you want</i> as you search for them.
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:velma=teasing,The game must go on, dearie!  Don't worry, I'll enjoy the view of your butt sticking out as you search the floor.
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:velma=teasing,Yeah, Parfet needs her glasses, too.  She's in better shape, though--go get some exercise crawling around looking for them.
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,alsoPlaying:meia=stretching,...Oh, did someone reveal her breasts?  It was just so mundane to me, I didn't notice.
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Now <i>you're</i> my kind of woman.  Large and in charge.
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,It's Barnette's <i>one</i> flaw that her chest isn't as big as mine.  But it's OK--I'm a selfless lover.
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,Are you still being a big head case about your breasts, Meia?  You really need a girlfriend to get some validation, I swear.
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,Would you believe there are Earth women who get surgery to make their breasts bigger?  Even Meia wouldn't go <i>that</i> far.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible=stretching,A little late for this reveal to leave an impact, don't you think?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible=smug,Unless you're packing a man's tube under there, I don't think this is gonna shock anyone.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible=seductive-2,A woman revealing her vagina?  Well, that's a new one tonight, isn't it?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible=laughing,Feel this energy in the air?  Enough to stop a hundred Tarakkians in their tracks.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=laughing,Well, that seals it.  You're a total nymph...disguised as an innocent little dork.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=stretching,It's always the dorky ones, isn't it?  I bet Parfet's a real wild child...Barnette and I are so dreadfully vanilla.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=vain,Being all sheltered must do this to nerdy types.  Barnette and I just kiss and hold hands like the pure angels we are.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=interested,This must be the only thrill you've gotten in years.  You nerdy types are so predictably dirty.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=vain,Reading too much must mess with nerd girls' sexualities.  One medical book got me obsessed with men, after all.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=vain,Panties first, you dorky little thing?  This must be thrilling for you...<i>I</i> can appreciate the warmth of a loving relationship.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia=seductive-2,Mejare tells us to be proud of our bodies, but also not to expose them.  Talk about clashing advice!
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia=teasing,You're so shy about your body.  A model Mejarian, despite your pirating habits.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia=interested,Mejare would be proud of you, so concerned about exposure.  Wouldn't want the Harvest to have its goods damaged, would we?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia=vain,Forget embarrassing our crew...all of Mejare is taught not to flaunt our bodies like this.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=vain,I can respect a woman going bottomless.  Bare breasts have a tendency to just swing around all ungainly-like...tough for an athlete.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=teasing,Bottomless first?  Yeah, that fits your athletic attitude to keep your breasts all wrapped up tight.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=stretching,You gym rats and your worries about your breasts hitting you in the face or something.  Exercise ruins everything!
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=smug,Of course the athlete goes bottomless.  She's worried her bare breasts will throw her off-balance.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:vriska=stretching,But maybe you'll prove us all wrong.  Go right ahead.  More fashion for me.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:vriska=teasing,I'm waiting for you to stick it to me, Vriska.  I certainly <i>want</i> to see more cute outfits.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:vriska=teasing,Going to prove my predictions wrong?  If so, more fashion for me...I win either way.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:vriska=vain,By all means, deliver more adorable outfits upon me.  I don't care if you win.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=seductive,I'll freely admit to being enchanted--mostly from those flowers.  You only ever see that stuff in gardens on Mejare.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=vain,Must be nice sprouting flowers wherever you go.  They're so rare on Mejare...I wish I could give some to Barnette.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=vain,Flowers are so romantic and sweet-smelling...maybe you're too accustomed to it, but they're a rarity on Mejare.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=vain,You Earth girls are so spoiled when it comes to flowers.  You know how hard it is to start up a garden on Mejare?  We barely have plants!
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=stretching,Honestly, dear, what was your reason for wearing that leotard?  ...Well, I guess Barnette's pretty similar.  Must be how it feels.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=teasing,That leotard's pretty <i>tight</i>, honey.  Just digging up into you...my Barnette dresses the same way.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=vain,I can understand loving the way leotards feel downstairs.  My girlfriend wears something <i>just</i> like it.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=teasing,I <i>may</i> have tried on Barnette's outfit once...so I know how that leotard must be digging into your nether regions.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=laughing,You know you have a mask, right?  Or is Miss Wrestler actually a little shy about showing her whole face?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=smug,I guess you're more proud of your thighs than your face, because you still have a mask.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=stretching,You really want to be naked, don't you?  Hell, you're just skipping the mask altogether.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=vain,I just realized you still have the mask.  Is it <i>that</i> important to your image?  I understand, then.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato=seductive,You're my kind of woman, Misato...sexually confident.  Can you teach me about men sometime?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato=seductive,You really know your way around Earth men, Misato--you're not shy at all!  You've got to teach me.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato=vain,Not to call you <i>easy</i>, dear, but you seem pretty experienced with these men...and confident.  <i>Teach me your ways</i>.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato=seductive,I can never get a man to like me, and yet you seem so experienced and confident.  What's your secret, Miss Military?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=shocked,Wha--<i>ew!  Ew!  EW!  What's the matter with you</i>?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=shocked,...<i>Where's all the color</i>?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=shocked,...What <i>are</i> you?  You need a hospital!  You need <i>Mejarian</i> medicine!
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=shocked,<i>Ack!  Ew!  Wha--what is that thing?  Ew!  Help!  Stop</i>!
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=teasing,Ooh, <i>bottomless</i>?  Maybe Earth women value their breasts more than I thought they did.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=vain,Breasts out last, huh, Mia?  I guess you Earth girls want to protect them...we Mejarians feel the same way about our wombs.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=vain,Oh, are you saving the chest for last?  I can understand...my breasts mean a lot to me, too.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=interested,Anything we should know about your breasts, dear?  You seem desperate to protect them.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=seductive,Oh, good.  Now you'd fit right in where I'm from!  Shaved is so much cuter.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=vain,Well, you might be a kitty-cat, but at least you know when enough is enough.  See, Mejare likes to be smooth and sleek.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=teasing,Cleanliness is a virtue on my planet!  So I like this shaving approach, Miss Kitty.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=laughing,Hey, take all the hair away!  This kitty needs to see the sun, after all.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=vain,Thinking about this again, I don't think I'd want to learn how to shoot like you do...or at least destroy my outfits with it.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=thinking,Do I <i>have</i> an outfit I'd be willing to destroy just for the spectacle?  I'd have to buy some rags for the occasion.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=stretching,I think I'd just <i>die</i> if I tried this.  Not from the bullets, but from seeing my wonderful dress in tatters.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=vain,You really are something else, Aimee.  You'd never catch <i>me</i> tearing up my beautiful wardrobe like that.  I'd have to steal more!
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=awkward,Hey, what are you two...<i>oh, my</i>.  That might be a little much even for me and Barnette.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=shocked,Hey, are you going to put those webs to...<i>use</i>.  Oh, dear.  Barnette might not go for that.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=awkward,That... looks like a lot of rope.  I might have to rethink inviting you over for some time with me and Barnette.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=awkward,...<i>Ooh</i>.  At first I thought your webs sounded cool, but...I'm not sure Barnette would like <i>this</i> much of them.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=laughing,Oh, we've seen each other naked once or twice.  A day.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=interested,Well, Meia?  Have I seen your <i>you-know-what</i>?  Or do you not know what <i>it</i> is?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=laughing,Don't ask me how you managed to come here if you can barely spit out the word <i>vagina</i>.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=interested,The most important question of the night, isn't it, Leader?  Your <i>you-know-what</i> is such a mystery.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=teasing,Well, how's <i>that</i> for karma?  Cover your breasts, and fate demands you show your cute little rear!  But of course, you wanted to.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=seductive,Ooh, what an adorable little behind!  Don't go and cover it, now!  <i>I know you don't really want to</i>.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=teasing,Nice and tight--you're just a tiny vixen of a girl, aren't you?  <i>Desperate</i> to strut your stuff.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=laughing,<i>Heeheeheehee</i>!  Seems fate would have you baring it all--that's what you want anyway, right?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible=teasing,How's mine look?  I take utmost care of it, you know.  Mejarians are taught that way.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible=vain,Not to brag, but Mejare is quite literally Earth's go-to colony for quality female reproductive organs.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible=smug,Yeah, I get plenty of peeks at my crewmates' goods in the showers.  I'd say yours could fit in.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible=stretching,Makes me wonder how voluptuous cute little Paiway will grow to be.  She's still just a child!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:0-9=vain,I should hope so!  She doesn't do all those squats in the gym because she thinks it's fun...or maybe she does, who knows.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:0-9=vain,Of course I would.  My Leader is more of a steal than she cares to admit!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:0-9=teasing,Hey, it's not a lack of beauty that keeps Meia single--it's a lack of smiling.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:0-9=stretching,Of course I agree, honey.  The trouble is getting <i>Meia</i> to do so, the neurotic little thing she is.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia=laughing,How's that wonderful strategy working out for you, Meia?  Dominating, as we can see.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia=smug,But this game has no luck at all, right?  Of course not.  You're just unskilled, clearly.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia=teasing,All that lovely pale skin is telling me you might want to reconsider this honed strategy of yours.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia=smug,Tactics are for piloting, Meia.  This game has all the strategy of picking an outfit.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=interested,Oh hey, your partner's stripping, too.  Just here for moral support, or are you two lovers?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=teasing,Did you really need help stripping, dear?  Or did you <i>want</i> her to strip you, you little lovebird?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=vain,So you've totally got a crush on this girl, right?  I get it...I would've asked Barnette to strip me if she were here.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=thinking,Maybe I should've brought <i>my</i> girlfriend here with me, too...nah, she wouldn't have gone for it.  She needs to lighten up.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy,priority:0=confused,Not to be rude, but, uh, that hair's really gross.  How do you wash yourself?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy,priority:0=angry,Ew!  Don't Earth girls know to shave before stripping in public?  Have some respect for your body!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy,priority:0=annoyed,...You know, my hair is gorgeous.  But even <i>I</i> can't make a jungle of pubic hair look good.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy,priority:0=frustrated,Women's bodies are so delightfully smooth.  Why ruin that with coarse, ugly hair strewn around your groin?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma=smug,Maybe I'm judging you too harshly.  <i>I've</i> considered going commando beneath the dress...
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma=interested,I guess I'm not much more covered under the dress, huh?  Perhaps we're more similar than I realized.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma=smug,Yeah, this is definitely giving you a thrill.  I wonder if <i>I'd</i> get the same sensation walking around in just the dress.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma=teasing,My dress is pretty much the only thing that covers me, too...<i>maybe we should swap</i>.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=seductive,Still as cute as a button!  Why you'd want to hide that body, I can only wonder...
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=teasing,Must be the neuroses of a royal that made you ashamed of your body.  No other explanation...you're <i>cute</i>.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=seductive,Ohhh, you're like a little chestnut of adorableness!  Why'd you hide your body from me, huh, sweetie?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=seductive,You barely look a day into womanhood, darling.  It's hard to find you erotic when I just want to <i>squeeze</i> you instead!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:vriska=laughing,<i>Come now, darling</i>!  I think that suits you just fine...technically covered, but people can see right past.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:vriska=interested,You're not <i>complaining</i> now, are you?  What, because you have to play fair like the rest of us?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:vriska=teasing,I thank you once again for the wonderful look at outfits across the universe.  But this pirate's done with you now.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:vriska=teasing,That's what happens when you play against a pirate, sweetie.  She strips you down eventually.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=interested,Nothing else, huh?  Why'd you even play this game without dressing up?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=smug,Well, that didn't take long.  One wonders why you came to a strip poker joint just to practice personal hygiene.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=seductive,And...everything else is part of your body?  Absolutely crazy...but kind of cute.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=interested,You're a weird one, dear.  Let your hair grow out, then shave it...come to strip poker, don't wear anything.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=shocked,<i>Eek!  No!  I-I was just joking!  Don't use your magic</i>!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=shocked,<i>Ack!  M-magic?  I'm sorry I made fun of you</i>!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=shocked,<i>Wait, no!  You're very decent!  Extremely decent!  I'm sorry</i>!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=shocked,<i>Wait!  Stop!  D-don't shoot, or cast anything, or whatever</i>!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=awkward,What are you--oh, dear.  That's <i>one</i> way to get off.  Is this how your "darlin'" does it?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=interested,I have a "darlin'," too...her name is Barnette.  And she doesn't ask me to graze her crotch with bullets.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=laughing,I guess when you can shoot your own clothes off, this is the kind of thing you need to do to reach orgasm.  Is your "darlin'" a good shot, too?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=laughing,These Earth girls just keep getting more depraved.  Your "darlin'" being a man must have done this to you, you poor thing.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=shocked,Oh my God.  You weren't kidding.  You really <i>are</i> some kind of public whore.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=frustrated,...I'm gonna go home now and tell Barnette I love her.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=frustrated,...Earth is a scary planet.  I just wanted to have a little fun.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=shocked,...I swear I don't act like this.  I just think flirting is fun!  I have a girlfriend, honest!




#OPPONENT MASTURBATING
#When an opponent is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must pay the penalty by masturbating in front of everyone.
#The "must_masturbate" line is for just before it happens, and the "start_masturbating" line immediately follows.
#The "masturbating" line will be spoken a little after the opponent has started but before they climax.
#When the opponent climaxes, your character will say the "finished_masturbating" line.

0-male_must_masturbate,target:9s=smug,And now for the <i>ultimate</i> test of your humanity.  If he bleeds, he masturbates.
0-male_must_masturbate,target:9s=stretching,Well, time to cast aside your artificiality, honey.  Let's see if a fake man can outperform a real one!
0-male_must_masturbate,target:9s=vain,Don't feel bad if your fakeness makes this weird for you.  I don't have much frame of reference.
0-male_must_masturbate,target:9s=seductive,<i>Have fun, dear</i>!  Do you have to rev yourself up a bit, or are you actually like a real person in this regard?
0-male_must_masturbate,target:captain_falcon=teasing,Well, Mr. Shouts-a-minute, now you get to yell at us and have it actually be appropriate.  Go nuts.
0-male_must_masturbate,target:captain_falcon=laughing,You were shouting enough already, so I shudder to think at how noisy you'll be <i>now</i>.
0-male_must_masturbate,target:captain_falcon=stretching,Oh, good.  The man who already wouldn't shut up has to <i>masturbate</i> now.  Can't we just make him leave?

0-male_start_masturbating=laughing,Just picturing the look on Meia's face at the sight of this is killing my libido.
0-male_start_masturbating=laughing,That dumb motion is making me laugh.  I think Meia laughed once...by accident.
0-male_start_masturbating,target:9s=laughing,What does an android think about, exactly?  Silicone breasts?  Mechanical hips?
0-male_start_masturbating,target:9s=interested,I'm quite curious what's going through your mind.  The exact optimal jerking speed, factoring in fuel efficiency?
0-male_start_masturbating,target:9s=seductive,Anyone on your mind, Little Dungeon Bot?  Someone at this table...or maybe your cute little "2B" partner?
0-male_start_masturbating,target:9s=vain,What gets a robot going, huh?  If I could make a <i>machine</i> like me, I'm officially the most gorgeous woman alive.
0-male_start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia=seductive,Oh, my!  You didn't have to go so far to show this Mejarian a good time, ~name~.
0-male_start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia=seductive,Oh, my!  You're such a gracious host, showing me all this.  <i>I'm so embarrassed</i>!
0-male_start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,That dumb motion is making me laugh.  I think you laughed once, Meia...by accident.
0-male_masturbating=awkward,So...how long do men tend to last?
0-male_masturbating=vain,You can think about me if you want, ~name~...but <i>I'll</i> be thinking of my Barnette.
0-male_masturbating=vain,Be honest, ~name~.  Mejarians are so much prettier than Earth women, aren't they?
0-male_masturbating=seductive,Just picture my glorious body all over that thing...whatever it is that men like about women's bodies.
0-male_masturbating,target:9s=laughing,Hey, 9S.  You're thinking about how much you want to...well, you know.  Aren't you?
0-male_masturbating,target:9s=vain,I just can't get over the look on your face, honey.  A robot in ecstasy!  Marvelous.
0-male_masturbating,target:9s=thinking,Seriously, I'm wondering what a robot thinks about when he masturbates.  I can't even figure out <i>human</i> men.
0-male_masturbating,target:9s=thinking,It's hard to find this erotic when I'm confused about your gender <i>and</i> your mechanics.
0-male_finished_masturbating=shocked,Wha--it just spurts out <i>all at once</i>?  That's not what the book said!
0-male_finished_masturbating=shocked,Wha--ew, it looks all sticky!  <i>That's</i> a man's seed?
0-male_finished_masturbating=shocked,H-hey, don't get any in my hair!  That looks like a pain to wash off!
0-male_finished_masturbating=angry,Hey, I wasn't done teasing you!  Keep going!
0-male_finished_masturbating=angry,H-hey, watch where you spray that!  I know how to use this sword, you know!
0-male_finished_masturbating,target:9s=awkward,<i>Let me see it, now</i>!  ...Where is it?  You know, your seed?
0-male_finished_masturbating,target:9s=angry,...Do you seriously not have any seed?  The one thing I was most interested in?
0-male_finished_masturbating,target:9s=bored,...Oh.  You're a machine, so you don't have the <i>semen</i> stuff.  Well, you're worthless to me, then.
0-male_finished_masturbating,target:9s=angry,Wha--w-where's all the seed?  I wanted to see men's <i>sperm</i> things!  Hey!
0-male_finished_masturbating,target:corrin_m=shocked,<i>Eeeeeek!  I knew men were monsters!  How dare you try to enter my womb</i>!
0-male_finished_masturbating,target:corrin_m=shocked,<i>Wait!  I take it all back!  I don't want man-beasts clawing at my breasts!  Stay away from my womb</i>!
0-male_finished_masturbating,target:corrin_m=bored,...I don't want talons anywhere near my cervix.  Earth women can have you for themselves.
0-male_finished_masturbating,target:corrin_m=shocked,<i>Wha--wha--a monster!  Stay back!  I have a girlfriend-and she has guns!  I don't need men</i>!
0-male_finished_masturbating,target:jin=shocked,<i>Eep</i>!  W-why's it glowing so much?  The book just said it was pearly, not <i>radioactive</i>!
0-male_finished_masturbating,target:jin=awkward,...Uh, did I miss a paragraph in the book?  Does men's sperm come out all lustrous and then fade?
0-male_finished_masturbating,target:jin=seductive,Oh, wow!  Does it really glow that much?  That looks like <i>I'd</i> glow if you came inside me.
0-male_finished_masturbating,target:jin=seductive,Wow, men's seed is even more glorious than I imagined!  You must pump your heart and soul into that stuff to make it shine like that!
0-female_must_masturbate=laughing,Don't let my lecherous stares stop you, ~name~.
0-female_must_masturbate=interested,What good is a woman who can't even play poker?  Honestly.
0-female_must_masturbate=interested,You didn't even make me lose <i>once</i>, ~name~.  Meia'd wipe the floor with you.
0-female_must_masturbate=interested,Gonna paw away at it, or is there a real strategy you've got?
0-female_must_masturbate,saidMarker:1v1=laughing,Yeah, you might not be cut out for our little pirate crew.  We like women who can, you know, <i>fight</i>.
0-female_must_masturbate,saidMarker:1v1=smug,Can't say I'm impressed with Earth women...going and losing to me so easily.
0-female_must_masturbate,saidMarker:1v1=laughing,Want to use my sword as some kind of toy?  You know, since you couldn't even make me lost <i>that</i>.
0-female_must_masturbate,saidMarker:1v1=teasing,Yeah, you're definitely not pilot material.  Women need to be good under pressure, you know?
0-female_must_masturbate,saidMarker:1v1=seductive,Aww, you poor thing.  Don't feel bad...I'm much smarter than I look, sweetie.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:meia,alsoPlaying:kyu=vain,Hey, <i>I'm</i> fun.  Meia barely knows what "fun" means.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:meia,alsoPlaying:kyu=stretching,Hey, don't give Meia any credit for all the fun <i>I'm</i> bringing.  Her job is to stand there and look miserable.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:meia,alsoPlaying:kyu=teasing,It's a hard life being a pirate, Miss Pixie!  So I try to make it fun for myself, while Meia is content is live in misery.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:meia,alsoPlaying:kyu=vain,It's nice to be appreciated for lighting up a room the way I do.  I have to work extra hard when Meia's killing the mood nearby.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:misato=teasing,Sure you've still got the coordination to <i>find</i> you vagina, Boozeball?  Either way, this'll be entertaining.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:misato=laughing,I think this works out perfectly.  Either you manage to masturbate and it's sexy, or you fall over and it's funny.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:misato=vain,Have fun pawing at both your vaginas, Miss Doublevision.  You look like you're going to fall asleep any minute now.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:misato=teasing,Sorry I couldn't drink too much with you, but I'm in enemy territory, after all.  Now have fun trying to find your vagina, Blurry-eyes.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:meia=smug,Unbelievable, for my superior officer to lose like this...what a disgrace.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:meia=laughing,Guess you should stick to piloting, eh, Meia?  This isn't your strong suit.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:meia=teasing,You <i>sure</i> you don't want me to lend you some clothes?  Because you're totally out of options.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:meia=smug,You're my superior officer...but I'm the superior poker player, clearly.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:meia=laughing,And here I was hoping we could ogle <i>each other</i> a little.  But no, you went and lost like it was nothing.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:morrigan=bored,<i>Now how does a succubus do it</i>--oh.  She gets help.  Makes sense.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:morrigan=shocked,<i>Eeep  W-where'd she come from?  Help</i>!
0-female_must_masturbate,target:morrigan=shocked,Who's "Lilith"?  Wait, where'd <i>she</i> come from?  Help!  No!
0-female_must_masturbate,target:morrigan=stretching,Oh, you brought a friend to help?  Just like a succubus...then again, I should've brought Barnette.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:meia,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0,priority:1001=laughing,Heeheeheeheehee!  Oh, did I leave that part out?  Silly me!
0-female_must_masturbate,target:meia,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0,priority:1001=smug,What, I didn't mention that part, Meia?  <i>Whoops-a-daisy</i>.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:meia,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0,priority:1001=stretching,I mean, I didn't think you'd find out by being the first to have to do it.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:meia,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0,priority:1001=smug,<i>What a shame that you had to find out this way</i>.  But really, it's your own fault.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:meia,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0,priority:1001=laughing,Well, you know, maybe you wouldn't have found out this way if you managed to beat me...<i>once</i>.
0-female_must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:meia,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0,priority:1001=laughing,<i>Heeheeheeheehee</i>!
0-female_must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:meia,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0,priority:1001=smug,Oh, come on, I knew you wouldn't come along if I mentioned that part.
0-female_must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:meia,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0,priority:1001=smug,OK, so maybe I told a few lies of omission to get you here.  Big deal, it's just masturbation.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:moon=frustrated,Great.  Yeah.  Masturbate instead of seeking medical attention.  See if <i>I</i> care.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:moon=bored,...Sometimes I wonder why I like teasing people so much.  Maybe it's just to prove I can toe the line others can't.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:moon=frustrated,Some people you just can't help.  Or even talk to.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:moon=annoyed,What a shock.  Yeah, have fun.  Whatever.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:streaming-chan=laughing,What are you--oh.  <i>Oh</i>.  So you're <i>that</i> kind of woman...a toy woman.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:streaming-chan=stretching,Toys, huh?  Yeah, I can see you poor single women resorting to them without a girlfriend around.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:streaming-chan=teasing,A <i>toy</i>?  What, don't you Earth girls have pet men you summon to ravish you on command?
0-female_must_masturbate,target:streaming-chan=vain,Should've known Miss Media would use a toy--the most conspicuous way to get yourself off, besides enlisting a partner.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=smug,Oh, <i>God</i>.  Miss Busybee has to masturbate now?  We're going to drown in her tears.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=laughing,Should we really make her do this?  She's so scared of her own body, she'll run in circles.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=vain,Maybe I'd have some sympathy if you had a body to be ashamed of.  As it stands, this embarrassment is an insult to poor ugly girls.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=interested,Do we really want to make her do this?  She's <i>already</i> a blubbering mess, and she's just standing around naked.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=stretching,Get the cleanup crew ready.  If this girl hasn't peed herself yet, she's going to do it now.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=stretching,<i>God</i>, Earth girls grow up soft.  Fighting men all your life really toughens you up!
0-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=stretching,Look, Florina masturbating is bad for everyone here.  She cries, and she annoys <i>us</i> in the process.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=teasing,I'm tempted to plant a big smooch right on your mouth, dear.  That'll shock you right out of your embarrassment!
0-female_must_masturbate,target:aimee=teasing,Now if you could masturbate with the <i>bullets</i>, that'd <i>really</i> impress me.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:aimee=smug,Surely she doesn't have to do it, right?  I mean, she already came earlier.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:aimee=interested,We'd better find some cover, considering how she made herself cum <i>last</i> time.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:aimee=teasing,Well, <i>this</i> is a predicament.  Or is your aim good enough to <i>juuust</i> graze yourself to orgasm?
0-female_must_masturbate,target:felicia=teasing,Wow, you weren't kidding!  Come on, honey, what were you thinking?  Couldn't stuff yourself into an overcoat?
0-female_must_masturbate,target:felicia=laughing,Well, you sure made this easy, honey.  That's what you get for showing up naked.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:felicia=stretching,Not much of a tease, are you?  Just up and arriving naked to start with.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:felicia=laughing,I thought you had clothes to start with, however skimpy, but no.  You were actually naked this whole time.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:vriska=smug,Oh, what's the big deal?  Masturbating in front of us would be less embarrassing than the state you're in now.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:vriska=interested,Dealer, doesn't this count as naked?  Hasn't she lost now?  Come on.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:vriska=interested,Come <i>on</i>, Vriska.  You're naked.  You lost.  It's OK.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:vriska=laughing,Everyone loses eventually, sweetie.  Even cheaters with speech impediments.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:sei=laughing,That last drink was the dagger, huh?  Maybe you would've held up otherwise.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:sei=interested,Looks like that last drink was the one that blurred out all the numbers on the cards.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:sei=teasing,All you've got, eh, dearie?  Did the alcohol finally reach your brain and short out your poker face?
0-female_must_masturbate,target:sei=vain,A noble effort, made all the more tragic in how you just kept shooting yourself in the foot with that booze.  Now get to the good stuff.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:sei=seductive,You're a horny little blue ball of booze, aren't you?  You sound like you've been waiting for this--drunks aren't exactly subtle.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:nagisa=laughing,You're putting on a <i>performance</i> for us?  Isn't that what the masturbation is anyway?
0-female_must_masturbate,target:nagisa=teasing,Hey, honey--if you want to put on a play, play with <i>yourself</i>.  That's what we all came here for.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:nagisa=smug,Yeah, Mejare has some plays I know of.  Mostly about men eating a poor helpless woman, then getting gutted themselves.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:nagisa=vain,A play, huh?  Let's see if it's more riveting than the man-killing, rough-and-tumble world of Mejarian theater.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:nagisa=smug,Oh, you're doing a play?  I was never big on theater myself--my own life as a pilot is far more interesting, after all.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:elizabeth=shocked,It's been fun, Liz, but you--you--<i>there's more than one of you</i>.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:elizabeth=shocked,Well, Liz, it was nice getting to know--<i>both of you</i>.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:elizabeth=shocked,<i>Ack!  No!  The Harvest!  They're mulitplying!  Help</i>!
0-female_must_masturbate,target:elizabeth=shocked,...<i>What?  What's happening?  Elizabeth</i>?
0-female_must_masturbate,target:rainbow_mika=laughing,What now, Miss Wrestler?  Is your partner going to help you <i>masturbate</i>, too?
0-female_must_masturbate,target:rainbow_mika=teasing,Well, there's only one thing that girl can help you with now, honey.  If you're up to task, of course.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:rainbow_mika=teasing,Is your partner going all the way with "assisting" you?  Because that would make this Mejarian feel right at home.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:rainbow_mika=vain,Well, you should know the drill, dear.  Or will you invite your partner along for <i>this</i>, too?
0-female_must_masturbate,target:amalia=smug,I can only <i>dream</i> of how embarrassed you must be, dear.  There's no possible chance you're actually an exhibitionist.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:amalia=laughing,This must be <i>so</i> devastating.  Surely you don't get off on being watched like us lecherous commoners.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:amalia=stretching,Oh, woe is you!  A princess forced to exhibit her base desires like her lowly subjects.  No chance she's into it.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:amalia=teasing,Nobility, reduced to her primal instincts for an audience...it's a good thing you're so above it all.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:alpha,marker:planet-countries=confused,What's a <i>yoo-ess-bee</i>?  Something only Planet Japan has?
0-female_must_masturbate,target:alpha=thinking,"Yoo-ess-bees" make you real?  Do <i>I</i> have one without even knowing it?
0-female_must_masturbate,target:alpha=smug,Oh look, she's actually speaking instead of singing.  And even then, she's goin on about nonsense like "yoo-ess-bees."
0-female_must_masturbate,target:alpha=stretching,A "yoo-ess-bee"?  Sounds like some fancy gadget Parfet would understand.  Is Miss Popstar a secret genius?
0-female_must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,Don't let my lecherous stares stop you, ~name~.
0-female_must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:meia=interested,What good is a woman who can't even play poker?  Honestly.
0-female_must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:meia=interested,Gonna paw away at it, or is there a real strategy you've got?
0-female_start_masturbating=stretching,Don't worry.  Mejare is all women, so this is nothing!
0-female_start_masturbating=teasing,I promise not to look if you're shy, ~name~.  But I'm still gonna tease you.
0-female_start_masturbating=interested,Is this all an Earth woman has to teach me?
0-female_start_masturbating=teasing,Parfet does it in the engine room, I hear.  Guess she likes to add to the hum of the machinery.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:videl=excited,Wow, you <i>are</i> flying!  I'm so much taller, it was hard to tell--<i>how're you doing that</i>?
0-female_start_masturbating,target:videl=seductive,Hard to be sure in crazy places like this, but you've been flying this whole time, Videl!  I should've noticed!
0-female_start_masturbating,target:videl=excited,Videl!  Videl!  Omigosh, can you teach me how to fly?  I don't see any wings, so that means I can learn, right?
0-female_start_masturbating,target:videl=vain,Can you show me how to fly, Videl?  That'd make the most talented woman alive in addition to the most beautiful!
0-female_start_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=laughing,<i>Ooh</i>.  Should've known a magical woman dressed in all scarlet would pull something like this...I think I'm good.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=teasing,That's...quite a lot of hands.  More than I think I could keep track of...<i>but that's half the fun</i>.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=vain,Not sure I like being tied up and fondled, dear...well, maybe with the right person.  A certain green-haired cutie, specifically.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=vain,To each her own, I suppose...that level of vulnerability is for Barnette's eyes only, as far as I'm concerned.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:vriska=shocked,Wha--you--<i>oh dear</i>.  Maybe we <i>should</i> let her keep playing.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:vriska=shocked,...I take it back.  Let her keep playing, Dealer.  Let her leave, actually.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:vriska=awkward,...Oh my.  That die <i>really</i> hates you.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:vriska=bored,...This is getting too weird for me.  Earth is a strange planet.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:nagisa=teasing,Well, here we go.  Take me on a thrilling, dramatic adventure...shy little sheltered Earth girl.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:nagisa=vain,This had better be more thrilling than what I do every day, you know.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:nagisa=teasing,Hey, coming here was like an anatomy and culture lesson already.  This story better be crazy!
0-female_start_masturbating,target:nagisa=vain,I crave drama, you know...that's why I'm a ruthless pirate and cunning pilot.  So don't let me down with this story.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:felicia=shocked,<i>Gah</i>!  W-where'd you keep that thing?  It's enormous...and phallic!
0-female_start_masturbating,target:felicia=laughing,A <i>vibrator</i>?  Never seen one shaped like that...must be like a man's tube.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:felicia=smug,Figures Earth women would even have <i>toys</i> shaped like men's things.  Can't you be independent?
0-female_start_masturbating,target:felicia=vain,Oh, of course.  I should've known any toys on this planet would resemble men's tubes.  You Earth girls are hopeless.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:meia=laughing,Guess I should have told you about the rule, huh?  I just wanted to see the look on your face.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:meia=teasing,I knew you wouldn't back down from a challenge.  Sorry I'm not nude enough to give you some eye candy!
0-female_start_masturbating,target:meia=teasing,Meia Gisborn isn't the type of woman to leave a crowd dissatisfied, right?  Of course not.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:meia=smug,This is like the worst-case scenario for you.  Didn't beat me at all <i>and</i> the first to lose!  And, you know, getting blindsided with the masturbation rule.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:meia=laughing,Come on, Meia Gisborn's no coward, right?  That's the spirit!
0-female_start_masturbating,target:meia=teasing,Don't worry, Meia.  I still have my sword, so I'll hold them at bay while you do your thing.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,OK.  Yes.  This is happening now.  Elizabeth is capable of this.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,Neat powers, Elizabeth.  Real...real <i>Mejarian</i>.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,Who...who <i>are</i> you?  Which one is Elizabeth?
0-female_start_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,I--I thought you were just a sweet little Earth girl!  Who are you?
0-female_start_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=laughing,Barnette's got a few toys...which have helped give us some perspective on men's tubes.  But not <i>quite</i> that big.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=teasing,Toys are hard to come by on Mejare, you know...they're symbols of men.  Unless you're a pirate, where you get your pick.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=stretching,I can't believe you carry that unwieldy thing around.  Earth women can't go five minutes without something phallic!
0-female_start_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=vain,Such ridiculous things...Barnette's lovely fingers are all I need to be happy.  And maybe her gun-shaped toys.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:amalia=awkward,...Oh.  OK.  Well, way to prove me wrong right away.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:amalia=shocked,Uh...<i>what are you doing?  I was just teasing</i>!
0-female_start_masturbating,target:amalia=shocked,...I was just kidding around!  It was a joke!  You don't have to...uh...
0-female_start_masturbating,target:amalia=awkward,...Or you could go ahead and actually be an exhibitionist.  That works too, I guess.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu=smug,And now Miss Pixie takes to the air to masturbate?  I don't know what I expected out of you.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu=teasing,I should've expected you to use those wings at some point, Miss Fairytale.  Now give me a good view.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu=laughing,I'd call you a skank for flying up and presenting to us, but I think you'd relish that.  So have your fun.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu=seductive,You're a little crazy, Miss Pixie, but you certainly put the effort in.  Check out that fairy flight!
0-female_start_masturbating,target:moon=sad,I'm honestly rethinking my entire life.  You're like a prophetic angel.  I shouldn't come to these sorts of places.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:moon=frustrated,Are you an apparition sent to punish me for being curious about men?
0-female_start_masturbating,target:moon=sad,You don't have to whore yourself out for money.  Just come to Mejare...you'll make excellent anti-men propaganda.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:moon=bored,For the first time in my life, I'm regretting a decision.  Coming here was a bad idea.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:aella=interested,You've <i>never</i> masturbated, huh?  Locked away in a house all your life and your hands never wandered south of the border?
0-female_start_masturbating,target:aella=teasing,What are you, a robot?  <i>Everyone</i> masturbates, dearie...unless you're <i>that</i> popular with the girls.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:aella=stretching,Yeah, you've never masturbated.  <i>Mm-hm</i>.  And I've never taken a bath.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:aella=smug,Oh, give me a break, honey.  Sex I can see people shying away from, but never <i>masturbating</i>?  Does your heart not beat?
0-female_start_masturbating,target:aella=interested,Ooh, Miss Big-Boned over here has never masturbated.  That's why you came to a public strip poker game, right?
0-female_start_masturbating,target:aella=teasing,Never masturbated, huh?  You must think you're better than the rest of us, Miss Chastity.  Well, <i>you're missing out</i>.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:hermione=laughing,<i>Oh, my</i>!  That's <i>one</i> way to use magic, you little skank!  But I understand.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:hermione=interested,Well, dear, you're not fooling anyone with the good-girl act now.  That's way too many hands to be wholesome.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:hermione=vain,Now <i>that</i> looks pretty magical.  Suddenly my two-handed approach with Barnette seems inadequate.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:hermione=teasing,<i>My, my, my</i>!  Miss Witch knows what she wants, alright.  And she's not afraid to magic her way there.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:shego=interested,Legs getting tired, dear?  Or are you afraid we won't see enough of you on the floor?
0-female_start_masturbating,target:shego=laughing,Seems Miss Lean-and-Green's butt is a little too delicate for the cold floor...or maybe she's just a total exhibitionist.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:shego=seductive,Aww, does the poor bodysuited villain not like how cold the floor is on her little backside?  Take a chair and show off, then.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:shego=teasing,Yeah, standing all this time is a little grating.  But hey, you could hide a little more if you sat on the floor...maybe.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:morrigan=vain,<i>Oh, my</i>!  Just like me and Barnette...except we can't fly.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:morrigan=laughing,Maybe Barnette and I would try that position if one of us had wings.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:morrigan=seductive,You're certainly proving yourself to be every bit the succubus you claim to be, dear.  I'm falling under <i>both</i> your spells!
0-female_start_masturbating,target:morrigan=teasing,Well, Miss Succubus, the addition of this "Lilith" is making me feel right at home.  That's how Mejarians have sex--mostly.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=shocked,<i>Wait, I was kidding!  Ack</i>!
0-female_start_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=shocked,<i>Wait, I wasn't serious!  Don't!  You'll kill us</i>!
0-female_start_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=awkward,<i>...I wasn't being serious.  Please don't catch anyone in the crossfire</i>.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=shocked,<i>Eek!  I said she should help you, not wrestle you</i>!
0-female_start_masturbating,target:joey=seductive,Oh, my!  That's the biggest vibrator I've ever seen--I guess there's a lot more room on Earth!
0-female_start_masturbating,target:joey=interested,Is this just a clown thing where everything is comically large?  Or more of a general Earth style?
0-female_start_masturbating,target:joey=vain,A vibrator?  And my, it's enormous--and shaped like men's tubes!  All I need are Barnette's lovely fingers, not these massive toys.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:joey=vain,My, such <i>girth</i> on that thing!  Is this men's influence?  Because Mejare's toys are rather inconspicuous.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:alpha=shocked,...OK.  Yeah.  I'm starting to believe you about this <i>virtual</i> business.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:alpha=awkward,That's...new.  Nice color shift.  Glad I could see you become a real woman.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:alpha=shocked,<i>Eek</i>!  I-I mean, uh, great skin tone there, Alpha.  Much more natural.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:alpha=awkward,...Well, it worked.  I shouldn't have doubted you...but I still don't understand you.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:aimee=shocked,O-oh, you're--using the gun.  ...Maybe you should unload it first?
0-female_start_masturbating,target:aimee=shocked,...OK, I call Barnette a gun nut, but she doesn't go <i>that</i> far.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:aimee=awkward,...Barnette has some toys shaped like guns.  Just for fun, you know?  But...the <i>real thing</i>?
0-female_start_masturbating,target:aimee=awkward,...I really thought you were cool, but now I'm worried.  Isn't that kind of dangerous?
0-female_start_masturbating,target:florina=seductive,Oh look, she's going to sing to make herself feel better!  That's...actually kind of sweet.  I think I like you, darling!
0-female_start_masturbating,target:florina=seductive,Ooh, a song?  Sorry I made fun--I <i>love</i> music!  Go for it, cutie.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:florina=teasing,Yeah, I try to make Barnette sing, too.  But that's by accident...and the tune's all over the place.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:florina=excited,You are just so <i>unbearably</i> cute.  Now you're <i>singing</i>?  I just want to squeeze you!
0-female_masturbating=vain,Make yourself happy, ~name~...I always make <i>Barnette</i> happy.
0-female_masturbating=vain,Want me to move around?  Shake something?  I'm not stripping--you had to <i>earn</i> that.
0-female_masturbating=laughing,Do Earth girls appreciate each other?  You should--Mejarians have the right idea on <i>that</i> front.
0-female_masturbating=interested,Don't tell me men and their tubes are going through your head.  You should learn to appreciate a woman's elegance.
0-female_masturbating,target:aimee=awkward,I'm...kind of worried about you, Aimee.  Is there something we should know about men's guns?
0-female_masturbating,target:aimee=bored,I'd definitely give Barnette an intervention if she started masturbating with loaded guns.
0-female_masturbating,target:aimee=smug,That thing is gonna make a bigger racket than even <i>you</i> are.
0-female_masturbating,target:aimee=awkward,This is getting way too weird for me, Aimee.  The clothes thing was cool, but <i>this</i>?  It's a death wish!
0-female_masturbating,target:videl=teasing,At least you're making this interesting, just bobbing up and down like that...<i>you're such a pervert</i>.
0-female_masturbating,target:videl=vain,Just gliding along, letting your instincts guide you...<i>oh, to be young again</i>!  Well, younger.
0-female_masturbating,target:videl=seductive,If only I could fly like you and make my beauty more fully visible.  Do you realize how lucky you are?
0-female_masturbating,target:videl=seductive,Videl, Videl, <i>Videl</i>!  You're a complete package, dear--cute, fit, adorable pigtails, and superpowers!
0-female_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=interested,Holding up, dear?  You seem a little incapable of saying the safe word.
0-female_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=stretching,I guess when you've got superpowers at your disposal, you need to feel unsafe for once to be excited.
0-female_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=laughing,See, this is why I don't want magic.  <i>This</i> is the kind of thing I'd need to get a thrill again.
0-female_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=laughing,Hanging in there, Miss Bloodred?  Any tighter and it won't just be your outfit that's scarlet.
0-female_masturbating,target:moon=frustrated,Please don't look at me.  Please don't talk.  I'm very afraid.
0-female_masturbating,target:moon=frustrated,God, just let it end already...I'll go straight after this, I promise.
0-female_masturbating,target:moon=bored,Yes.  Cute.  Elegant.  You have the grace of those swans I see in zoos.
0-female_masturbating,target:moon=bored,Marvelous.  Having fun, Moon?  Good.  Glad, even.
0-female_masturbating,target:kyu=seductive,Hey, Miss Love Fairy.  I know you've got wings, but share the magic a little!  <i>I</i> want to fly too, you know!
0-female_masturbating,target:kyu=vain,Now <i>this</i> is a good use of wings.  Who wants to sit on the nasty old ground to masturbate?
0-female_masturbating,target:kyu=interested,I like your style, Miss Pixie.  You were born with wings, and now you've found the perfect use for them.
0-female_masturbating,target:kyu=stretching,Yeah, I'd probably fly like that, too.  But <i>some</i> fairies just won't share their magic with the rest of us.
0-female_masturbating,target:amalia=excited,Omigosh, is that vine doing what men's tubes do?  It looks like it!  Show me more!
0-female_masturbating,target:amalia=awkward,...I was just ribbing you about being naughty.  I guess I was right...or I really got to you.
0-female_masturbating,target:amalia=excited,Ooh, show me more angles!  That's <i>so cool</i>...it's like a really long men's tube, right?  Right?
0-female_masturbating,target:amalia=laughing,You really <i>are</i> a little skank!  I should've known all princesses are like this, all sheltered and itching for adventure.
0-female_masturbating,target:amalia=laughing,Can't reach orgasm without a giant tube shoved inside of you, huh?  Glad I didn't grow up stuck with men for my sexual needs.
0-female_masturbating,target:shego=teasing,Hey, honey, I'm been talking dirty all game...no sense waiting till the end on <i>that</i> front.
0-female_masturbating,target:shego=laughing,Just listen to the things coming out of Green-bean's mouth!  She's trying to catch up to what I've been doing all evening.
0-female_masturbating,target:shego=teasing,Too bad I got such a head start on the dirty talk, because Shego's doing her best now to match me.
0-female_masturbating,target:shego=seductive,You've got a filthy mouth on you to match the green complexion.  Can't you be a sweetheart for once?
0-female_masturbating,target:gwen=smug,...I can't really fault you for this.  If <i>I</i> had spider-web powers, I'd give that a try, too.
0-female_masturbating,target:gwen=teasing,I'm going to go ahead and guess this isn't <i>all</i> you use that webbing for...if you've got someone else with you.
0-female_masturbating,target:gwen=vain,That webbing looks like quite a bit of fun!  If only I could give it a try with Barnette.
0-female_masturbating,target:gwen=seductive,Hey, I like those angles you're pulling, cutie!  Go upside down again!
0-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=teasing,<i>Hoo</i>.  Well, at least you seem like you're in control.  Have fun, girls!
0-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=seductive,Well, you're not killing anyone, so fine by me.  This is fun to watch!
0-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=teasing,Just stand a safe distance away...this <i>is</i> pretty sexy.
0-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=seductive,I <i>knew</i> you two were lovers!  Can't keep your hands off each other...or anything else.
0-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=vain,As long as you don't clothesline me, you can keep this up all you want, cuties.  Just watch those muscles ripple!
0-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=seductive,Barnette and I aren't as strong as you two, but maybe I should take notes anyway.
0-female_masturbating,target:morrigan=teasing,I was hoping to learn something new here to surprise Barnette tomorrow evening...or maybe even when I get back.
0-female_masturbating,target:morrigan=vain,It's so comforting to see two women enjoying each others' bodies.  I thought Earth had never heard of such a thing!
0-female_masturbating,target:morrigan=stretching,Par for the course where I'm from, Morrigan--sorry it's not leaving an impact.  Well, Mejarians don't fly, but still.
0-female_masturbating,target:morrigan=vain,Hey, keep it up, Miss Succubus.  You're making my heart swell with memories of my darling Barnette--it's hard to be away from her!
0-female_masturbating,target:meia=seductive,I feel so awful about beating you like this, Meia.  Just take your time and enjoy yourself.
0-female_masturbating,target:meia=seductive,Don't worry, Meia.  I won't let anything bad happen to you while you do this...we're still crewmates, after all.
0-female_masturbating,target:meia=teasing,Nice and easy.  Anyone who gets handsy near <i>my</i> squadron leader is getting a taste of this rapier!
0-female_masturbating,target:meia=teasing,Hard to believe you actually <i>know</i> how to masturbate.  I figured you were just Dread-sexual.
0-female_masturbating,target:uravity=vain,You're so rude, Ochako, to not share your levitation powers with everyone else.  I share my beauty!
0-female_masturbating,target:uravity=smug,Miss Gravity is certainly making the best use of her powers that <i>I</i> could think of.  Shame the rest of us can't join in.
0-female_masturbating,target:uravity=seductive,Are you <i>sure</i> you were born with these powers?  There isn't some crazy Earth doctor I can visit to fly, too?
0-female_masturbating,target:uravity=vain,Is there nothing crueler than showing off the powers the rest of us can't enjoy?  At least <i>I</i> can't hide how beautiful I am.
0-female_masturbating,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:8=teasing,I can't believe I met <i>two</i> women who can fly...and that both would use it for such <i>unsavory</i> reasons.  <i>Teach me</i>!
0-female_masturbating,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:8=vain,Two women showing off the goods in the air, and neither will bother to show me how!  <i>I</i> want to fly, too, you know.
0-female_masturbating,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:8=seductive,Hey, what's a beautiful woman got to do to get some flying lessons?  <i>I</i> want to join in on the airborne fun you two are having!
0-female_masturbating,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:8=vain,You damn Earthling teases are keeping secrets from me!  Can't a gorgeous girl like me learn to fly, too?  I learned to pilot!
0-female_masturbating,target:marceline=confused,What exactly is letting you float like that?  You've been doing it all game, and it doesn't even look strenuous.
0-female_masturbating,target:marceline=seductive,You're inhuman in so many ways...no eyes, blue skin, floating.  But you sure masturbate like a normal girl.
0-female_masturbating,target:marceline=teasing,I guess you're pretty human after all, Eyeballs.  Just look at you floating there, having the time of your life!
0-female_masturbating,target:marceline=teasing,Going to perform any fancy tricks for us, Miss Levitator?  Masturbate upside down or something?
0-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=awkward,...I guess you don't need a girlfriend, do you?
0-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=awkward,...You know, I didn't peg you as the kind of girl who'd be open to this sort of thing.  Or that had superpowers.
0-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=awkward,You know, I've done that...with Barnette.  You know, <i>another</i> woman.  Not myself.
0-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=thinking,Now I'm curious how good a clone of me would be at this sort of thing...
0-female_masturbating,target:vriska=confused,You, uh, holding up over there, Vriska?  Wriggling free sometime soon?
0-female_masturbating,target:vriska=frustrated,...I'm just going to assume she's into this.  I really don't want to touch her.
0-female_masturbating,target:vriska=bored,...I think I would've preferred you <i>gaining</i> clothes, Vriska.
0-female_masturbating,target:vriska=bored,That magic was cool, but <i>yeesh</i>.  What a weirdo...
0-female_masturbating,target:rinkah=laughing,Did you just--you <i>did</i>!  You're such a beast of a woman, Rinkah...
0-female_masturbating,target:rinkah=laughing,Are you putting your finger where I think you are?  You've done nothing but confirm stereotypes all evening...you <i>animal</i>.
0-female_masturbating,target:rinkah=smug,I guess Miss Warrior is so tempered from all her harsh battles, she needs to stick fingers in her rear to feel anything.
0-female_masturbating,target:rinkah=teasing,I don't know what I expected from you, Miss Fireball, but a finger in the butt checks out.  Barnette and I would never be that dirty.
0-female_finished_masturbating=vain,Barnette makes the cutest faces.  I should have brought her here...
0-female_finished_masturbating=laughing,Don't think I've ever made <i>that</i> face.  Hopefully my Barnette wouldn't lie to me about that.
0-female_finished_masturbating=teasing,Can't say I'm impressed with the technique, but how <i>explosive</i>.
0-female_finished_masturbating=interested,And you did it all by yourself!  What's a woman without her independence?
0-female_finished_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,...That ended as quickly as it began.  What <i>was</i> that?
0-female_finished_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,You don't even seem bothered!  W-why didn't you say you could do stuff like that?
0-female_finished_masturbating,target:elizabeth=awkward,...And this sort of thing just comes naturally to you?  Didn't bat an eye?
0-female_finished_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,OK.  Yes.  It's over now, apparently.  Very enlightening, Elizabeth.  Never judge by appearances.
0-female_finished_masturbating,target:vriska=shocked,Wha--<i>ew!  W-what's all that blue stuff?  Don't get it on me!  It's gross</i>!
0-female_finished_masturbating,target:vriska=shocked,<i>Ack!  F-fluid!  B-blue fluid everywhere!  Is it poisonous</i>?
0-female_finished_masturbating,target:vriska=shocked,<i>Eeek!  V-Vriska!  What is this?  What did you do?  Why are you leaking blue stuff</i>?
0-female_finished_masturbating,target:vriska=shocked,<i>Ack!  K-keep that stuff away from me!  It's corrosive, isn't it?  M-magic corrosive blue fluid</i>!
0-female_finished_masturbating,target:uravity=seductive,And she just plops down like a doofus!  You get cuter the longer I look at you, darling.
0-female_finished_masturbating,target:uravity=laughing,Have a good time, Miss Gravity?  Seems like you lost control of your little floating maneuver.
0-female_finished_masturbating,target:uravity=teasing,I think you might be the most adorable girl I've ever met, from stuffing your figure into that suit to just plopping on the ground.
0-female_finished_masturbating,target:uravity=laughing,Ha!  I guess you really <i>have</i> overcome your embarrassment, to just drop down like that.  Or maybe that was an accident.
0-female_finished_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=vain,I knew Earth girls could love each other the way we do.  Men are just so superfluous!
0-female_finished_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=seductive,Talk about a Mejarian power couple.  You're stronger than the men I know anyway!
0-female_finished_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=teasing,I like the idea of men just picking me up...but it seems like you two could do that anyway.
0-female_finished_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=vain,I guess Earth isn't so different from Mejare after all.  Two strong women in love!  ...Like me and Barnette.
0-female_finished_masturbating,target:morrigan=seductive,What, she's leaving?  Stay a while!  We can talk about woman relationships together!
0-female_finished_masturbating,target:morrigan=seductive,Hey, don't leave so soon, dear!  You're a steal yourself--I can tell you more about more girlfriend!
0-female_finished_masturbating,target:morrigan=seductive,Aww, don't leave, honey!  We just got to meet each other, and you spent it all underneath Morrigan's butt!
0-female_finished_masturbating,target:morrigan=vain,<i>Leave if you must.  I guess I'm not beautiful enough to warrant sticking around</i>.
0-female_finished_masturbating,target:moon=bored,Nice finish.  The white fluid really stands out against your blackened labia.
0-female_finished_masturbating,target:moon=annoyed,Class act, these Earth girls.  Absolutely marvelous to behold.
0-female_finished_masturbating,target:moon=annoyed,Would you believe I thought I was superior to Earth girls?  Moon here's shown me I have a long way to go.
0-female_finished_masturbating,target:moon=bored,Perfect.  Yeah.  Mm-hm.  Glad you had fun.  See you next time.
0-female_finished_masturbating,target:aimee=shocked,A-ah!  See?  I <i>told</i> you!
0-female_finished_masturbating,target:aimee=bored,...Yeah, <i>definitely</i> making sure Barnette doesn't go this far.
0-female_finished_masturbating,target:aimee=bored,Guess we all knew that was coming, but I wanted to believe you'd pull it off.
0-female_finished_masturbating,target:aimee=frustrated,...I think I prefer <i>Barnette's</i> level of gun-hobby.  As in, not shooting herself.
0-female_finished_masturbating,target:meia=vain,<i>It's good to get to know your crew members intimately</i>.
0-female_finished_masturbating,target:meia=teasing,I hope that makes you feel better about losing so badly.
0-female_finished_masturbating,target:meia=seductive,See?  Don't you feel much better now?  You should do this more often.
0-female_finished_masturbating,target:meia=laughing,That was so cute, Meia!  Come on, put on that winning smile for me.
0-female_finished_masturbating,target:meia=vain,And you have the nerve to get all self-conscious about your body.  Look at these poor, plain-looking Earth girls!
0-female_finished_masturbating,target:meia=laughing,For someone so neurotic about her body, you sure got yourself drenched.
0-female_finished_masturbating,target:launch=seductive,Ooh, the blue one again!  If you weren't so unstable, I'd invite you back for a drink, cutie.
0-female_finished_masturbating,target:launch=vain,Oh, thank God, the blue one's back.  Good to see a woman who's polite and sincere in my line of work!
0-female_finished_masturbating,target:launch=interested,Just in time.  I wasn't looking forward to hearing your counterpart bellyache about losing.
0-female_finished_masturbating,target:launch=teasing,Just the hair color I wanted to see!  You're so much nicer to be around, even if you're kind of a doormat.
0-female_finished_masturbating,target:amalia=stretching,<i>And it just dumps you off, disgusted with your behavior</i>.
0-female_finished_masturbating,target:amalia=smug,Earth women are so bestial, having sex with men and plants in equal measures.
0-female_finished_masturbating,target:amalia=laughing,You ought to be ashamed of yourself, young lady!  Now go get your servant to clean you up!
0-female_finished_masturbating,target:amalia=vain,Looks like Little Miss Princess was just another dirty commoner, begging to be ravished and tossed aside.
0-female_finished_masturbating,target:black_canary=angry,<i>Oooow</i>!  Hey, shut up, you freak!
0-female_finished_masturbating,target:black_canary=angry,<i>Ow</i>!  What was <i>that</i> for?  <i>Ugh</i>!
0-female_finished_masturbating,target:black_canary=angry,<i>Oooooow</i>!  Ooh, the <i>nerve</i> of some people!  Take your weird voice powers and beat it, freak!
0-female_finished_masturbating,target:black_canary=annoyed,<i>AM I TALKING TOO LOUD?  I THINK I JUST WENT DEAF</i>.

1-male_must_masturbate=seductive,Did you lose on purpose just to teach me about men?  You're so sweet, ~name~.
1-male_must_masturbate=teasing,I don't exactly have experience watching men do this.  Give me a good show, ~name~!
1-male_must_masturbate=smug,Great job losing.  But you were up against a Mejarian woman in a battle of wits, so, yeah.
1-male_must_masturbate=vain,What a sorry performance, ~name~.  Guess I'll stick to the <i>other</i> men in my life.
1-male_must_masturbate,target:9s=smug,And now for the <i>ultimate</i> test of your humanity.  If he bleeds, he masturbates.
1-male_must_masturbate,target:9s=stretching,Well, time to cast aside your artificiality, honey.  Let's see if a fake man can outperform a real one!
1-male_must_masturbate,target:9s=vain,Don't feel bad if your fakeness makes this weird for you.  I don't have much frame of reference.

1-male_must_masturbate,saidMarker:1v1=laughing,Good effort from that little pea-brain of yours, but I still didn't take off any actual <i>clothing</i>.
1-male_must_masturbate,saidMarker:1v1=stretching,Ooh, now I get to see how men jerk that dumb little tube of theirs!  Oh, and, uh, shame about how bad I beat you.
1-male_must_masturbate,saidMarker:1v1=teasing,All that manly bravado was no match for my cunning pirate wits, it would seem.  <i>Too bad for you</i>!
1-male_must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:meia,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0,priority:1001=laughing,Oops!  <i>Must have slipped my mind</i>!  But hey, at least it's a man.

1-male_must_masturbate,target:captain_falcon=teasing,Well, Mr. Shouts-a-minute, now you get to yell at us and have it actually be appropriate.  Go nuts.
1-male_must_masturbate,target:captain_falcon=laughing,You were shouting enough already, so I shudder to think at how noisy you'll be <i>now</i>.
1-male_must_masturbate,target:captain_falcon=stretching,Oh, good.  The man who already wouldn't shut up has to <i>masturbate</i> now.  Can't we just make him leave?
1-male_must_masturbate,target:captain_falcon=laughing,Well, I'll learn about men from this, but you might deafen me in the process.
1-male_must_masturbate,target:captain_america,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0=laughing,<i>Pfft</i>!  You didn't <i>know</i> that?  Some heroic man you are, not even knowing the rules of a silly game.
1-male_must_masturbate,target:captain_america,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0=laughing,That's some excellent situational awareness, dear.  Then again, I lied to Meia to make her believe the same thing.
1-male_must_masturbate,target:captain_america,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0=interested,Nice job doing your homework, Mr. Muscle.  I guess they didn't pump up your brain at all.
1-male_must_masturbate,target:captain_america,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0=laughing,What, Mr. Goody-Two-Shoes didn't read the rulebook before he got here?  Come <i>on</i>.
1-male_start_masturbating=vain,Oh, my.  A delicate flower like me doesn't belong near a man in this state.
1-male_start_masturbating=teasing,Men are so <i>vile</i>...I shouldn't be subjected to such degeneracy.
1-male_start_masturbating=seductive,A man masturbating...now <i>this</i> I came to see.
1-male_start_masturbating=laughing,Makes me wonder if Hibiki's guts would extend to public masturbation...especially with lecherous women nearby.
1-male_start_masturbating,target:9s=laughing,What does an android think about, exactly?  Silicone breasts?  Mechanical hips?
1-male_start_masturbating,target:9s=interested,I'm quite curious what's going through your mind.  The exact optimal jerking speed, factoring in fuel efficiency?
1-male_start_masturbating,target:9s=seductive,Anyone on your mind, Little Dungeon Bot?  Someone at this table...or maybe your cute little "2B" partner?
1-male_start_masturbating,target:9s=vain,What gets a robot going, huh?  If I could make a <i>machine</i> like me, I'm officially the most gorgeous woman alive.
1-male_masturbating=teasing,I was told men were violent animals growing up.  Try not to lose control of yourself, ~name~.
1-male_masturbating=vain,Careful, ~name~.  I don't even know you!  <i>Or what you're capable of</i>.
1-male_masturbating=teasing,I know I'm beautiful, ~name~, but no touching!
1-male_masturbating=vain,Ever masturbated to a woman as beautiful as myself?  Of course not.  If I were nude, you'd be done already!
1-male_masturbating,target:9s=laughing,Hey, 9S.  You're thinking about how much you want to...well, you know.  Aren't you?
1-male_masturbating,target:9s=vain,I just can't get over the look on your face, honey.  A robot in ecstasy!  Marvelous.
1-male_masturbating,target:9s=thinking,Seriously, I'm wondering what a robot thinks about when he masturbates.  I can't even figure out <i>human</i> men.
1-male_masturbating,target:9s=thinking,It's hard to find this erotic when I'm confused about your gender <i>and</i> your mechanics.
1-male_finished_masturbating=shocked,Gah!  I--you--<i>that's</i> seed?  Why's it just spurt out like that?  Men are gross!
1-male_finished_masturbating=angry,H-hey, don't get any on this dress!  It's too delicate for the wash!
1-male_finished_masturbating=shocked,A--agh!  I thought it's only supposed to shoot if it's <i>inside</i> me!
1-male_finished_masturbating=shocked,Wha--hey!  Is that your seed?  Why's it all sticky?  It's gross!
1-male_finished_masturbating=shocked,Eep!  It's everywhere!  Did any get on me?  Can it wash off?  Is it safe on skin?
1-male_finished_masturbating,target:jin=shocked,<i>Eep</i>!  W-why's it glowing so much?  The book just said it was pearly, not <i>radioactive</i>!
1-male_finished_masturbating,target:jin=awkward,...Uh, did I miss a paragraph in the book?  Does men's sperm come out all lustrous and then fade?
1-male_finished_masturbating,target:jin=seductive,Oh, wow!  Does it really glow that much?  That looks like <i>I'd</i> glow if you came inside me.
1-male_finished_masturbating,target:jin=seductive,Wow, men's seed is even more glorious than I imagined!  You must pump your heart and soul into that stuff to make it shine like that!
1-male_finished_masturbating,target:corrin_m=shocked,<i>Eeeeeek!  I knew men were monsters!  How dare you try to enter my womb</i>!
1-male_finished_masturbating,target:corrin_m=shocked,<i>Wait!  I take it all back!  I don't want man-beasts clawing at my breasts!  Stay away from my womb</i>!
1-male_finished_masturbating,target:corrin_m=bored,...I don't want talons anywhere near my cervix.  Earth women can have you for themselves.
1-male_finished_masturbating,target:corrin_m=shocked,<i>Wha--wha--a monster!  Stay back!  I have a girlfriend-and she has guns!  I don't need men</i>!
1-male_finished_masturbating,target:9s=awkward,<i>Let me see it, now</i>!  ...Where is it?  You know, your seed?
1-male_finished_masturbating,target:9s=angry,...Do you seriously not have any seed?  The one thing I was most interested in?
1-male_finished_masturbating,target:9s=bored,...Oh.  You're a machine, so you don't have the <i>semen</i> stuff.  Well, you're worthless to me, then.
1-male_finished_masturbating,target:9s=angry,Wha--w-where's all the seed?  I wanted to see men's <i>sperm</i> things!  Hey!
1-female_must_masturbate=smug,Show me how an Earth woman handles herself, ~name~.
1-female_must_masturbate=teasing,Do Earth women even <i>know</i> to masturbate, with men always around to do the work for you?
1-female_must_masturbate=laughing,Just <i>what</i> could I expect from an Earth woman pushed to the brink of decency?  I guess sex with men already counts as that.
1-female_must_masturbate=interested,You've got the worst hand, ~name~.  I hope you don't have the worst <i>hands</i>.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:sei=laughing,That last drink was the dagger, huh?  Maybe you would've held up otherwise.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:sei=interested,Looks like that last drink was the one that blurred out all the numbers on the cards.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:sei=teasing,All you've got, eh, dearie?  Did the alcohol finally reach your brain and short out your poker face?
1-female_must_masturbate,target:sei=vain,A noble effort, made all the more tragic in how you just kept shooting yourself in the foot with that booze.  Now get to the good stuff.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:sei=seductive,You're a horny little blue ball of booze, aren't you?  You sound like you've been waiting for this--drunks aren't exactly subtle.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:streaming-chan=laughing,What are you--oh.  <i>Oh</i>.  So you're <i>that</i> kind of woman...a toy woman.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:streaming-chan=stretching,Toys, huh?  Yeah, I can see you poor single women resorting to them without a girlfriend around.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:streaming-chan=teasing,A <i>toy</i>?  What, don't you Earth girls have pet men you summon to ravish you on command?
1-female_must_masturbate,target:streaming-chan=vain,Should've known Miss Media would use a toy--the most conspicuous way to get yourself off, besides enlisting a partner.
1-female_must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:meia,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0,priority:1001=laughing,Oops!  <i>Must have slipped my mind</i>!
1-female_must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:meia,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0,priority:1001=seductive,Oh, don't be so dramatic, sourpuss.  Masturbation is fun!
1-female_must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:meia,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0,priority:1001=vain,Just sit back and watch, Meia.  We'll find out how Earth women do it, since they're always surrounded by men willing to do it for them.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:vriska=smug,Oh, what's the big deal?  Masturbating in front of us would be less embarrassing than the state you're in now.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:vriska=interested,Dealer, doesn't this count as naked?  Hasn't she lost now?  Come on.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:vriska=interested,Come <i>on</i>, Vriska.  You're naked.  You lost.  It's OK.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:vriska=laughing,Everyone loses eventually, sweetie.  Even cheaters with speech impediments.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:elizabeth=shocked,It's been fun, Liz, but you--you--<i>there's more than one of you</i>.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:elizabeth=shocked,Well, Liz, it was nice getting to know--<i>both of you</i>.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:elizabeth=shocked,<i>Ack!  No!  The Harvest!  They're mulitplying!  Help</i>!
1-female_must_masturbate,target:elizabeth=shocked,...<i>What?  What's happening?  Elizabeth</i>?
1-female_must_masturbate,target:amalia=smug,I can only <i>dream</i> of how embarrassed you must be, dear.  There's no possible chance you're actually an exhibitionist.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:amalia=laughing,This must be <i>so</i> devastating.  Surely you don't get off on being watched like us lecherous commoners.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:amalia=stretching,Oh, woe is you!  A princess forced to exhibit her base desires like her lowly subjects.  No chance she's into it.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:amalia=teasing,Nobility, reduced to her primal instincts for an audience...it's a good thing you're so above it all.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:alpha,marker:planet-countries=confused,What's a <i>yoo-ess-bee</i>?  Something only Planet Japan has?
1-female_must_masturbate,target:alpha=thinking,"Yoo-ess-bees" make you real?  Do <i>I</i> have one without even knowing it?
1-female_must_masturbate,target:alpha=smug,Oh look, she's actually speaking instead of singing.  And even then, she's goin on about nonsense like "yoo-ess-bees."
1-female_must_masturbate,target:alpha=stretching,A "yoo-ess-bee"?  Sounds like some fancy gadget Parfet would understand.  Is Miss Popstar a secret genius?
1-female_must_masturbate,target:felicia=teasing,Wow, you weren't kidding!  Come on, honey, what were you thinking?  Couldn't stuff yourself into an overcoat?
1-female_must_masturbate,target:felicia=laughing,Well, you sure made this easy, honey.  That's what you get for showing up naked.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:felicia=stretching,Not much of a tease, are you?  Just up and arriving naked to start with.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:felicia=laughing,I thought you had clothes to start with, however skimpy, but no.  You were actually naked this whole time.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:aimee=teasing,Now if you could masturbate with the <i>bullets</i>, that'd <i>really</i> impress me.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:aimee=smug,Surely she doesn't have to do it, right?  I mean, she already came earlier.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:aimee=interested,We'd better find some cover, considering how she made herself cum <i>last</i> time.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:aimee=teasing,Well, <i>this</i> is a predicament.  Or is your aim good enough to <i>juuust</i> graze yourself to orgasm?
1-female_must_masturbate,target:meia,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0=smug,OK, so I lied.  I thought you'd do a little better than the first to lose, so I didn't think you'd find out like this.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:meia,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0=laughing,Don't be so dramatic.  It's your fault for losing that you had to learn about it like this.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:meia,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0=stretching,Come on, Meia!  So you lost and have to masturbate.  At least you're learning things about Earth people!
1-female_must_masturbate,target:meia,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0=laughing,Oh, please, what's a little public humiliation?  Can't have my leader getting too arrogant, now.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=smug,Oh, <i>God</i>.  Miss Busybee has to masturbate now?  We're going to drown in her tears.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=laughing,Should we really make her do this?  She's so scared of her own body, she'll run in circles.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=vain,Maybe I'd have some sympathy if you had a body to be ashamed of.  As it stands, this embarrassment is an insult to poor ugly girls.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=interested,Do we really want to make her do this?  She's <i>already</i> a blubbering mess, and she's just standing around naked.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=stretching,Get the cleanup crew ready.  If this girl hasn't peed herself yet, she's going to do it now.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=stretching,<i>God</i>, Earth girls grow up soft.  Fighting men all your life really toughens you up!
1-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=stretching,Look, Florina masturbating is bad for everyone here.  She cries, and she annoys <i>us</i> in the process.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=teasing,I'm tempted to plant a big smooch right on your mouth, dear.  That'll shock you right out of your embarrassment!
1-female_must_masturbate,target:nagisa=laughing,You're putting on a <i>performance</i> for us?  Isn't that what the masturbation is anyway?
1-female_must_masturbate,target:nagisa=teasing,Hey, honey--if you want to put on a play, play with <i>yourself</i>.  That's what we all came here for.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:nagisa=smug,Yeah, Mejare has some plays I know of.  Mostly about men eating a poor helpless woman, then getting gutted themselves.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:nagisa=vain,A play, huh?  Let's see if it's more riveting than the man-killing, rough-and-tumble world of Mejarian theater.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:nagisa=smug,Oh, you're doing a play?  I was never big on theater myself--my own life as a pilot is far more interesting, after all.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:meia,alsoPlaying:kyu=vain,Hey, <i>I'm</i> fun.  Meia barely knows what "fun" means.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:meia,alsoPlaying:kyu=stretching,Hey, don't give Meia any credit for all the fun <i>I'm</i> bringing.  Her job is to stand there and look miserable.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:meia,alsoPlaying:kyu=teasing,It's a hard life being a pirate, Miss Pixie!  So I try to make it fun for myself, while Meia is content is live in misery.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:meia,alsoPlaying:kyu=vain,It's nice to be appreciated for lighting up a room the way I do.  I have to work extra hard when Meia's killing the mood nearby.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:moon=frustrated,Great.  Yeah.  Masturbate instead of seeking medical attention.  See if <i>I</i> care.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:moon=bored,...Sometimes I wonder why I like teasing people so much.  Maybe it's just to prove I can toe the line others can't.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:moon=frustrated,Some people you just can't help.  Or even talk to.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:moon=annoyed,What a shock.  Yeah, have fun.  Whatever.
1-female_must_masturbate,saidMarker:1v1=laughing,Just one loss?  Earth women are such a disappointment.  Guess living around men drags your IQ down a little.
1-female_must_masturbate,saidMarker:1v1=vain,Well, hey--at least you got a chance to appreciate my lovely Mejarian outfit in its entirety.
1-female_must_masturbate,saidMarker:1v1=teasing,Nice try, but I'm not the brainless bimbo I appear to be.  A pirate has to be deceiving if she wants to steal anything!
1-female_must_masturbate,saidMarker:1v1=teasing,Just couldn't get anything going, huh?  It's OK, sweetie--you're still very pretty, even without much of a brain.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:morrigan=bored,<i>Now how does a succubus do it</i>--oh.  She gets help.  Makes sense.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:morrigan=shocked,<i>Eeep  W-where'd she come from?  Help</i>!
1-female_must_masturbate,target:morrigan=shocked,Who's "Lilith"?  Wait, where'd <i>she</i> come from?  Help!  No!
1-female_must_masturbate,target:morrigan=stretching,Oh, you brought a friend to help?  Just like a succubus...then again, I should've brought Barnette.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:meia=stretching,So long, Meia.  I really expected better from my squadron leader, I've got to say.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:meia=laughing,My whole dress is still intact.  If you want, you can use my armbands as underwear instead of masturbating.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:meia=smug,Well, now!  Not the outcome I expected, or the lead in general.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:meia=laughing,Aw, that's too bad, Meia.  I guess we know who the <i>real</i> smartest cookie on the Nirvana is!
1-female_must_masturbate,target:misato=teasing,Sure you've still got the coordination to <i>find</i> you vagina, Boozeball?  Either way, this'll be entertaining.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:misato=laughing,I think this works out perfectly.  Either you manage to masturbate and it's sexy, or you fall over and it's funny.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:misato=vain,Have fun pawing at both your vaginas, Miss Doublevision.  You look like you're going to fall asleep any minute now.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:misato=teasing,Sorry I couldn't drink too much with you, but I'm in enemy territory, after all.  Now have fun trying to find your vagina, Blurry-eyes.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:rainbow_mika=laughing,What now, Miss Wrestler?  Is your partner going to help you <i>masturbate</i>, too?
1-female_must_masturbate,target:rainbow_mika=teasing,Well, there's only one thing that girl can help you with now, honey.  If you're up to task, of course.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:rainbow_mika=teasing,Is your partner going all the way with "assisting" you?  Because that would make this Mejarian feel right at home.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:rainbow_mika=vain,Well, you should know the drill, dear.  Or will you invite your partner along for <i>this</i>, too?
1-female_start_masturbating=teasing,Mejarian sex pretty much <i>is</i> masturbation, just with a friend.  So I'm something of an expert.
1-female_start_masturbating=teasing,Did you know?  That rapier of mine is the finest Mejarian steel, made in the capital city itself.  Masturbate to <i>that</i>!
1-female_start_masturbating=laughing,This would make Meia so mad.  Not the masturbation, just the losing.
1-female_start_masturbating=seductive,Something tells me Earth girls could really use the touch of a woman to bring them to their senses.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:videl=excited,Wow, you <i>are</i> flying!  I'm so much taller, it was hard to tell--<i>how're you doing that</i>?
1-female_start_masturbating,target:videl=seductive,Hard to be sure in crazy places like this, but you've been flying this whole time, Videl!  I should've noticed!
1-female_start_masturbating,target:videl=excited,Videl!  Videl!  Omigosh, can you teach me how to fly?  I don't see any wings, so that means I can learn, right?
1-female_start_masturbating,target:videl=vain,Can you show me how to fly, Videl?  That'd make the most talented woman alive in addition to the most beautiful!
1-female_start_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,OK.  Yes.  This is happening now.  Elizabeth is capable of this.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,Neat powers, Elizabeth.  Real...real <i>Mejarian</i>.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,Who...who <i>are</i> you?  Which one is Elizabeth?
1-female_start_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,I--I thought you were just a sweet little Earth girl!  Who are you?
1-female_start_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=laughing,<i>Ooh</i>.  Should've known a magical woman dressed in all scarlet would pull something like this...I think I'm good.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=teasing,That's...quite a lot of hands.  More than I think I could keep track of...<i>but that's half the fun</i>.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=vain,Not sure I like being tied up and fondled, dear...well, maybe with the right person.  A certain green-haired cutie, specifically.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=vain,To each her own, I suppose...that level of vulnerability is for Barnette's eyes only, as far as I'm concerned.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=laughing,Barnette's got a few toys...which have helped give us some perspective on men's tubes.  But not <i>quite</i> that big.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=teasing,Toys are hard to come by on Mejare, you know...they're symbols of men.  Unless you're a pirate, where you get your pick.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=stretching,I can't believe you carry that unwieldy thing around.  Earth women can't go five minutes without something phallic!
1-female_start_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=vain,Such ridiculous things...Barnette's lovely fingers are all I need to be happy.  And maybe her gun-shaped toys.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:vriska=shocked,Wha--you--<i>oh dear</i>.  Maybe we <i>should</i> let her keep playing.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:vriska=shocked,...I take it back.  Let her keep playing, Dealer.  Let her leave, actually.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:vriska=awkward,...Oh my.  That die <i>really</i> hates you.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:vriska=bored,...This is getting too weird for me.  Earth is a strange planet.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:meia=teasing,Do whatever it is you have to, Meia.  If you know what to do at all.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:meia=laughing,I've seen you naked, but doing anything sexual?  My brain can hardly process it.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:meia=laughing,I've always figured you just saw your body as a tool to pilot Dreads, not something to enjoy yourself with.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:meia=teasing,You know what "masturbate" means, right, Meia?  I don't have to demonstrate or anything?
1-female_start_masturbating,target:shego=interested,Legs getting tired, dear?  Or are you afraid we won't see enough of you on the floor?
1-female_start_masturbating,target:shego=laughing,Seems Miss Lean-and-Green's butt is a little too delicate for the cold floor...or maybe she's just a total exhibitionist.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:shego=seductive,Aww, does the poor bodysuited villain not like how cold the floor is on her little backside?  Take a chair and show off, then.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:shego=teasing,Yeah, standing all this time is a little grating.  But hey, you could hide a little more if you sat on the floor...maybe.
1-female_start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Mejarian sex pretty much <i>is</i> masturbation, just with a friend.  So I'm something of an expert.
1-female_start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Did you know?  That rapier of mine is the finest Mejarian steel, made in the capital city itself.  Masturbate to <i>that</i>!
1-female_start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia=seductive,Something tells me Earth girls could really use the touch of a woman to bring them to their senses.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:nagisa=teasing,Well, here we go.  Take me on a thrilling, dramatic adventure...shy little sheltered Earth girl.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:nagisa=vain,This had better be more thrilling than what I do every day, you know.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:nagisa=teasing,Hey, coming here was like an anatomy and culture lesson already.  This story better be crazy!
1-female_start_masturbating,target:nagisa=vain,I crave drama, you know...that's why I'm a ruthless pirate and cunning pilot.  So don't let me down with this story.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:morrigan=vain,<i>Oh, my</i>!  Just like me and Barnette...except we can't fly.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:morrigan=laughing,Maybe Barnette and I would try that position if one of us had wings.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:morrigan=seductive,You're certainly proving yourself to be every bit the succubus you claim to be, dear.  I'm falling under <i>both</i> your spells!
1-female_start_masturbating,target:morrigan=teasing,Well, Miss Succubus, the addition of this "Lilith" is making me feel right at home.  That's how Mejarians have sex--mostly.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:florina=seductive,Oh look, she's going to sing to make herself feel better!  That's...actually kind of sweet.  I think I like you, darling!
1-female_start_masturbating,target:florina=seductive,Ooh, a song?  Sorry I made fun--I <i>love</i> music!  Go for it, cutie.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:florina=teasing,Yeah, I try to make Barnette sing, too.  But that's by accident...and the tune's all over the place.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:florina=excited,You are just so <i>unbearably</i> cute.  Now you're <i>singing</i>?  I just want to squeeze you!
1-female_start_masturbating,target:joey=seductive,Oh, my!  That's the biggest vibrator I've ever seen--I guess there's a lot more room on Earth!
1-female_start_masturbating,target:joey=interested,Is this just a clown thing where everything is comically large?  Or more of a general Earth style?
1-female_start_masturbating,target:joey=vain,A vibrator?  And my, it's enormous--and shaped like men's tubes!  All I need are Barnette's lovely fingers, not these massive toys.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:joey=vain,My, such <i>girth</i> on that thing!  Is this men's influence?  Because Mejare's toys are rather inconspicuous.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:aella=interested,You've <i>never</i> masturbated, huh?  Locked away in a house all your life and your hands never wandered south of the border?
1-female_start_masturbating,target:aella=teasing,What are you, a robot?  <i>Everyone</i> masturbates, dearie...unless you're <i>that</i> popular with the girls.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:aella=stretching,Yeah, you've never masturbated.  <i>Mm-hm</i>.  And I've never taken a bath.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:aella=smug,Oh, give me a break, honey.  Sex I can see people shying away from, but never <i>masturbating</i>?  Does your heart not beat?
1-female_start_masturbating,target:aella=interested,Ooh, Miss Big-Boned over here has never masturbated.  That's why you came to a public strip poker game, right?
1-female_start_masturbating,target:aella=teasing,Never masturbated, huh?  You must think you're better than the rest of us, Miss Chastity.  Well, <i>you're missing out</i>.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu=smug,And now Miss Pixie takes to the air to masturbate?  I don't know what I expected out of you.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu=teasing,I should've expected you to use those wings at some point, Miss Fairytale.  Now give me a good view.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu=laughing,I'd call you a skank for flying up and presenting to us, but I think you'd relish that.  So have your fun.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu=seductive,You're a little crazy, Miss Pixie, but you certainly put the effort in.  Check out that fairy flight!
1-female_start_masturbating,target:alpha=shocked,...OK.  Yeah.  I'm starting to believe you about this <i>virtual</i> business.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:alpha=awkward,That's...new.  Nice color shift.  Glad I could see you become a real woman.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:alpha=shocked,<i>Eek</i>!  I-I mean, uh, great skin tone there, Alpha.  Much more natural.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:alpha=awkward,...Well, it worked.  I shouldn't have doubted you...but I still don't understand you.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:aimee=shocked,O-oh, you're--using the gun.  ...Maybe you should unload it first?
1-female_start_masturbating,target:aimee=shocked,...OK, I call Barnette a gun nut, but she doesn't go <i>that</i> far.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:aimee=awkward,...Barnette has some toys shaped like guns.  Just for fun, you know?  But...the <i>real thing</i>?
1-female_start_masturbating,target:aimee=awkward,...I really thought you were cool, but now I'm worried.  Isn't that kind of dangerous?
1-female_start_masturbating,target:amalia=awkward,...Oh.  OK.  Well, way to prove me wrong right away.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:amalia=shocked,Uh...<i>what are you doing?  I was just teasing</i>!
1-female_start_masturbating,target:amalia=shocked,...I was just kidding around!  It was a joke!  You don't have to...uh...
1-female_start_masturbating,target:amalia=awkward,...Or you could go ahead and actually be an exhibitionist.  That works too, I guess.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:felicia=shocked,<i>Gah</i>!  W-where'd you keep that thing?  It's enormous...and phallic!
1-female_start_masturbating,target:felicia=laughing,A <i>vibrator</i>?  Never seen one shaped like that...must be like a man's tube.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:felicia=smug,Figures Earth women would even have <i>toys</i> shaped like men's things.  Can't you be independent?
1-female_start_masturbating,target:felicia=vain,Oh, of course.  I should've known any toys on this planet would resemble men's tubes.  You Earth girls are hopeless.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=shocked,<i>Wait, I was kidding!  Ack</i>!
1-female_start_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=shocked,<i>Wait, I wasn't serious!  Don't!  You'll kill us</i>!
1-female_start_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=awkward,<i>...I wasn't being serious.  Please don't catch anyone in the crossfire</i>.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=shocked,<i>Eek!  I said she should help you, not wrestle you</i>!
1-female_start_masturbating,target:hermione=laughing,<i>Oh, my</i>!  That's <i>one</i> way to use magic, you little skank!  But I understand.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:hermione=interested,Well, dear, you're not fooling anyone with the good-girl act now.  That's way too many hands to be wholesome.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:hermione=vain,Now <i>that</i> looks pretty magical.  Suddenly my two-handed approach with Barnette seems inadequate.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:hermione=teasing,<i>My, my, my</i>!  Miss Witch knows what she wants, alright.  And she's not afraid to magic her way there.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:moon=sad,I'm honestly rethinking my entire life.  You're like a prophetic angel.  I shouldn't come to these sorts of places.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:moon=frustrated,Are you an apparition sent to punish me for being curious about men?
1-female_start_masturbating,target:moon=sad,You don't have to whore yourself out for money.  Just come to Mejare...you'll make excellent anti-men propaganda.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:moon=bored,For the first time in my life, I'm regretting a decision.  Coming here was a bad idea.
1-female_masturbating=vain,Want to see a little leg, ~name~?  All women love other women--that must be true even on Earth!
1-female_masturbating=vain,You're so adorable...like cute little Dita, with her man-obsession.
1-female_masturbating=laughing,Picturing Meia masturbating always cracks me up.  What does she think about, Dread formations?
1-female_masturbating=teasing,Be honest, ~name~.  You keep a couple men around just to pleasure you, don't you?
1-female_masturbating,target:vriska=confused,You, uh, holding up over there, Vriska?  Wriggling free sometime soon?
1-female_masturbating,target:vriska=frustrated,...I'm just going to assume she's into this.  I really don't want to touch her.
1-female_masturbating,target:vriska=bored,...I think I would've preferred you <i>gaining</i> clothes, Vriska.
1-female_masturbating,target:vriska=bored,That magic was cool, but <i>yeesh</i>.  What a weirdo...
1-female_masturbating,target:kyu=seductive,Hey, Miss Love Fairy.  I know you've got wings, but share the magic a little!  <i>I</i> want to fly too, you know!
1-female_masturbating,target:kyu=vain,Now <i>this</i> is a good use of wings.  Who wants to sit on the nasty old ground to masturbate?
1-female_masturbating,target:kyu=interested,I like your style, Miss Pixie.  You were born with wings, and now you've found the perfect use for them.
1-female_masturbating,target:kyu=stretching,Yeah, I'd probably fly like that, too.  But <i>some</i> fairies just won't share their magic with the rest of us.
1-female_masturbating,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:8=teasing,I can't believe I met <i>two</i> women who can fly...and that both would use it for such <i>unsavory</i> reasons.  <i>Teach me</i>!
1-female_masturbating,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:8=vain,Two women showing off the goods in the air, and neither will bother to show me how!  <i>I</i> want to fly, too, you know.
1-female_masturbating,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:8=seductive,Hey, what's a beautiful woman got to do to get some flying lessons?  <i>I</i> want to join in on the airborne fun you two are having!
1-female_masturbating,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:8=vain,You damn Earthling teases are keeping secrets from me!  Can't a gorgeous girl like me learn to fly, too?  I learned to pilot!
1-female_masturbating,target:uravity=vain,You're so rude, Ochako, to not share your levitation powers with everyone else.  I share my beauty!
1-female_masturbating,target:uravity=smug,Miss Gravity is certainly making the best use of her powers that <i>I</i> could think of.  Shame the rest of us can't join in.
1-female_masturbating,target:uravity=seductive,Are you <i>sure</i> you were born with these powers?  There isn't some crazy Earth doctor I can visit to fly, too?
1-female_masturbating,target:uravity=vain,Is there nothing crueler than showing off the powers the rest of us can't enjoy?  At least <i>I</i> can't hide how beautiful I am.
1-female_masturbating,target:videl=teasing,At least you're making this interesting, just bobbing up and down like that...<i>you're such a pervert</i>.
1-female_masturbating,target:videl=vain,Just gliding along, letting your instincts guide you...<i>oh, to be young again</i>!  Well, younger.
1-female_masturbating,target:videl=seductive,If only I could fly like you and make my beauty more fully visible.  Do you realize how lucky you are?
1-female_masturbating,target:videl=seductive,Videl, Videl, <i>Videl</i>!  You're a complete package, dear--cute, fit, adorable pigtails, and superpowers!
1-female_masturbating,target:gwen=smug,...I can't really fault you for this.  If <i>I</i> had spider-web powers, I'd give that a try, too.
1-female_masturbating,target:gwen=teasing,I'm going to go ahead and guess this isn't <i>all</i> you use that webbing for...if you've got someone else with you.
1-female_masturbating,target:gwen=vain,That webbing looks like quite a bit of fun!  If only I could give it a try with Barnette.
1-female_masturbating,target:gwen=seductive,Hey, I like those angles you're pulling, cutie!  Go upside down again!
1-female_masturbating,target:marceline=confused,What exactly is letting you float like that?  You've been doing it all game, and it doesn't even look strenuous.
1-female_masturbating,target:marceline=seductive,You're inhuman in so many ways...no eyes, blue skin, floating.  But you sure masturbate like a normal girl.
1-female_masturbating,target:marceline=teasing,I guess you're pretty human after all, Eyeballs.  Just look at you floating there, having the time of your life!
1-female_masturbating,target:marceline=teasing,Going to perform any fancy tricks for us, Miss Levitator?  Masturbate upside down or something?
1-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=awkward,...I guess you don't need a girlfriend, do you?
1-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=awkward,...You know, I didn't peg you as the kind of girl who'd be open to this sort of thing.  Or that had superpowers.
1-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=awkward,You know, I've done that...with Barnette.  You know, <i>another</i> woman.  Not myself.
1-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=thinking,Now I'm curious how good a clone of me would be at this sort of thing...
1-female_masturbating,target:shego=teasing,Hey, honey, I'm been talking dirty all game...no sense waiting till the end on <i>that</i> front.
1-female_masturbating,target:shego=laughing,Just listen to the things coming out of Green-bean's mouth!  She's trying to catch up to what I've been doing all evening.
1-female_masturbating,target:shego=teasing,Too bad I got such a head start on the dirty talk, because Shego's doing her best now to match me.
1-female_masturbating,target:shego=seductive,You've got a filthy mouth on you to match the green complexion.  Can't you be a sweetheart for once?
1-female_masturbating,target:amalia=excited,Omigosh, is that vine doing what men's tubes do?  It looks like it!  Show me more!
1-female_masturbating,target:amalia=awkward,...I was just ribbing you about being naughty.  I guess I was right...or I really got to you.
1-female_masturbating,target:amalia=excited,Ooh, show me more angles!  That's <i>so cool</i>...it's like a really long men's tube, right?  Right?
1-female_masturbating,target:amalia=laughing,You really <i>are</i> a little skank!  I should've known all princesses are like this, all sheltered and itching for adventure.
1-female_masturbating,target:amalia=laughing,Can't reach orgasm without a giant tube shoved inside of you, huh?  Glad I didn't grow up stuck with men for my sexual needs.
1-female_masturbating,target:aimee=awkward,I'm...kind of worried about you, Aimee.  Is there something we should know about men's guns?
1-female_masturbating,target:aimee=bored,I'd definitely give Barnette an intervention if she started masturbating with loaded guns.
1-female_masturbating,target:aimee=smug,That thing is gonna make a bigger racket than even <i>you</i> are.
1-female_masturbating,target:aimee=awkward,This is getting way too weird for me, Aimee.  The clothes thing was cool, but <i>this</i>?  It's a death wish!
1-female_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=interested,Holding up, dear?  You seem a little incapable of saying the safe word.
1-female_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=stretching,I guess when you've got superpowers at your disposal, you need to feel unsafe for once to be excited.
1-female_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=laughing,See, this is why I don't want magic.  <i>This</i> is the kind of thing I'd need to get a thrill again.
1-female_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=laughing,Hanging in there, Miss Bloodred?  Any tighter and it won't just be your outfit that's scarlet.
1-female_masturbating,target:meia=teasing,Just think of all the lovely ladies on the Nirvana...or the three men, if you've been getting <i>those</i> rumblings.
1-female_masturbating,target:meia=seductive,I'm sure there's plenty of women back home who're thinking of <i>you</i>, Meia.
1-female_masturbating,target:meia=teasing,Hey, the crew has a lot of respect for you.  <i>And I bet a few ladies even have a crush on you</i>!
1-female_masturbating,target:meia=interested,Going for that warm feeling the Paksis gives us?  The pounding in the head?
1-female_masturbating,target:moon=frustrated,Please don't look at me.  Please don't talk.  I'm very afraid.
1-female_masturbating,target:moon=frustrated,God, just let it end already...I'll go straight after this, I promise.
1-female_masturbating,target:moon=bored,Yes.  Cute.  Elegant.  You have the grace of those swans I see in zoos.
1-female_masturbating,target:moon=bored,Marvelous.  Having fun, Moon?  Good.  Glad, even.
1-female_masturbating,target:rinkah=laughing,Did you just--you <i>did</i>!  You're such a beast of a woman, Rinkah...
1-female_masturbating,target:rinkah=laughing,Are you putting your finger where I think you are?  You've done nothing but confirm stereotypes all evening...you <i>animal</i>.
1-female_masturbating,target:rinkah=smug,I guess Miss Warrior is so tempered from all her harsh battles, she needs to stick fingers in her rear to feel anything.
1-female_masturbating,target:rinkah=teasing,I don't know what I expected from you, Miss Fireball, but a finger in the butt checks out.  Barnette and I would never be that dirty.
1-female_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,Want to see a little leg, ~name~?  All women love other women--that must be true even on Earth!
1-female_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,You're so adorable...like cute little Dita, with her man-obsession.
1-female_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Be honest, ~name~.  You keep a couple men around just to pleasure you, don't you?
1-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=teasing,<i>Hoo</i>.  Well, at least you seem like you're in control.  Have fun, girls!
1-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=seductive,Well, you're not killing anyone, so fine by me.  This is fun to watch!
1-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=teasing,Just stand a safe distance away...this <i>is</i> pretty sexy.
1-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=seductive,I <i>knew</i> you two were lovers!  Can't keep your hands off each other...or anything else.
1-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=vain,As long as you don't clothesline me, you can keep this up all you want, cuties.  Just watch those muscles ripple!
1-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=seductive,Barnette and I aren't as strong as you two, but maybe I should take notes anyway.
1-female_masturbating,target:morrigan=teasing,I was hoping to learn something new here to surprise Barnette tomorrow evening...or maybe even when I get back.
1-female_masturbating,target:morrigan=vain,It's so comforting to see two women enjoying each others' bodies.  I thought Earth had never heard of such a thing!
1-female_masturbating,target:morrigan=stretching,Par for the course where I'm from, Morrigan--sorry it's not leaving an impact.  Well, Mejarians don't fly, but still.
1-female_masturbating,target:morrigan=vain,Hey, keep it up, Miss Succubus.  You're making my heart swell with memories of my darling Barnette--it's hard to be away from her!
1-female_finished_masturbating=smug,Oh, dear.  Was that <i>my</i> fault?
1-female_finished_masturbating=vain,Oh, to be cursed with this beauty!  Always making women lose control of themselves...
1-female_finished_masturbating=interested,Barnette makes cuter faces.  Jeez, at least <i>try</i> to win me over.
1-female_finished_masturbating=smug,What a finish.  Earth girls are pretty good sports about losing so handily.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:amalia=stretching,<i>And it just dumps you off, disgusted with your behavior</i>.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:amalia=smug,Earth women are so bestial, having sex with men and plants in equal measures.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:amalia=laughing,You ought to be ashamed of yourself, young lady!  Now go get your servant to clean you up!
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:amalia=vain,Looks like Little Miss Princess was just another dirty commoner, begging to be ravished and tossed aside.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:black_canary=angry,<i>Oooow</i>!  Hey, shut up, you freak!
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:black_canary=angry,<i>Ow</i>!  What was <i>that</i> for?  <i>Ugh</i>!
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:black_canary=angry,<i>Oooooow</i>!  Ooh, the <i>nerve</i> of some people!  Take your weird voice powers and beat it, freak!
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:black_canary=annoyed,<i>AM I TALKING TOO LOUD?  I THINK I JUST WENT DEAF</i>.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,...That ended as quickly as it began.  What <i>was</i> that?
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,You don't even seem bothered!  W-why didn't you say you could do stuff like that?
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:elizabeth=awkward,...And this sort of thing just comes naturally to you?  Didn't bat an eye?
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,OK.  Yes.  It's over now, apparently.  Very enlightening, Elizabeth.  Never judge by appearances.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:morrigan=seductive,What, she's leaving?  Stay a while!  We can talk about woman relationships together!
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:morrigan=seductive,Hey, don't leave so soon, dear!  You're a steal yourself--I can tell you more about more girlfriend!
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:morrigan=seductive,Aww, don't leave, honey!  We just got to meet each other, and you spent it all underneath Morrigan's butt!
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:morrigan=vain,<i>Leave if you must.  I guess I'm not beautiful enough to warrant sticking around</i>.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:moon=bored,Nice finish.  The white fluid really stands out against your blackened labia.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:moon=annoyed,Class act, these Earth girls.  Absolutely marvelous to behold.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:moon=annoyed,Would you believe I thought I was superior to Earth girls?  Moon here's shown me I have a long way to go.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:moon=bored,Perfect.  Yeah.  Mm-hm.  Glad you had fun.  See you next time.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=vain,I knew Earth girls could love each other the way we do.  Men are just so superfluous!
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=seductive,Talk about a Mejarian power couple.  You're stronger than the men I know anyway!
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=teasing,I like the idea of men just picking me up...but it seems like you two could do that anyway.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=vain,I guess Earth isn't so different from Mejare after all.  Two strong women in love!  ...Like me and Barnette.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:uravity=seductive,And she just plops down like a doofus!  You get cuter the longer I look at you, darling.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:uravity=laughing,Have a good time, Miss Gravity?  Seems like you lost control of your little floating maneuver.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:uravity=teasing,I think you might be the most adorable girl I've ever met, from stuffing your figure into that suit to just plopping on the ground.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:uravity=laughing,Ha!  I guess you really <i>have</i> overcome your embarrassment, to just drop down like that.  Or maybe that was an accident.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:vriska=shocked,Wha--<i>ew!  W-what's all that blue stuff?  Don't get it on me!  It's gross</i>!
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:vriska=shocked,<i>Ack!  F-fluid!  B-blue fluid everywhere!  Is it poisonous</i>?
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:vriska=shocked,<i>Eeek!  V-Vriska!  What is this?  What did you do?  Why are you leaking blue stuff</i>?
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:vriska=shocked,<i>Ack!  K-keep that stuff away from me!  It's corrosive, isn't it?  M-magic corrosive blue fluid</i>!
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:meia=vain,My respect for you is unshaken, ma'am.  I'd follow you anywhere.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:meia=teasing,Don't let this get to you, Meia.  <i>You're still my super-cool squadron leader</i>!
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:meia=teasing,I hope you're not ashamed to show me you actually have a sexuality.  You're cuter than ever!
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:launch=seductive,Ooh, the blue one again!  If you weren't so unstable, I'd invite you back for a drink, cutie.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:launch=vain,Oh, thank God, the blue one's back.  Good to see a woman who's polite and sincere in my line of work!
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:launch=interested,Just in time.  I wasn't looking forward to hearing your counterpart bellyache about losing.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:launch=teasing,Just the hair color I wanted to see!  You're so much nicer to be around, even if you're kind of a doormat.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:aimee=shocked,A-ah!  See?  I <i>told</i> you!
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:aimee=bored,...Yeah, <i>definitely</i> making sure Barnette doesn't go this far.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:aimee=bored,Guess we all knew that was coming, but I wanted to believe you'd pull it off.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:aimee=frustrated,...I think I prefer <i>Barnette's</i> level of gun-hobby.  As in, not shooting herself.


#lost boots
2-male_must_masturbate=interested,Out just like that?  I expected better from the big, bad <i>man</i>.
2-male_must_masturbate=smug,Men are so easy to outmaneuver.  Guess Earth women are running the Harvest.
2-male_must_masturbate=teasing,Lost the game, did you?  Lose some seed while you're at it.
2-male_must_masturbate=excited,God, am I ready to see this.  If you think <i>I've</i> been teasing <i>you</i>, try being cooped up with three men on a ship for months.
2-male_must_masturbate,target:9s=smug,And now for the <i>ultimate</i> test of your humanity.  If he bleeds, he masturbates.
2-male_must_masturbate,target:9s=stretching,Well, time to cast aside your artificiality, honey.  Let's see if a fake man can outperform a real one!
2-male_must_masturbate,target:9s=vain,Don't feel bad if your fakeness makes this weird for you.  I don't have much frame of reference.
2-male_must_masturbate,target:9s=seductive,<i>Have fun, dear</i>!  Do you have to rev yourself up a bit, or are you actually like a real person in this regard?
2-male_must_masturbate,target:captain_america,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0=laughing,<i>Pfft</i>!  You didn't <i>know</i> that?  Some heroic man you are, not even knowing the rules of a silly game.
2-male_must_masturbate,target:captain_america,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0=laughing,That's some excellent situational awareness, dear.  Then again, I lied to Meia to make her believe the same thing.
2-male_must_masturbate,target:captain_america,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0=interested,Nice job doing your homework, Mr. Muscle.  I guess they didn't pump up your brain at all.
2-male_must_masturbate,target:captain_america,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0=laughing,What, Mr. Goody-Two-Shoes didn't read the rulebook before he got here?  Come <i>on</i>.
2-male_must_masturbate,target:captain_falcon=teasing,Well, Mr. Shouts-a-minute, now you get to yell at us and have it actually be appropriate.  Go nuts.
2-male_must_masturbate,target:captain_falcon=laughing,You were shouting enough already, so I shudder to think at how noisy you'll be <i>now</i>.
2-male_must_masturbate,target:captain_falcon=stretching,Oh, good.  The man who already wouldn't shut up has to <i>masturbate</i> now.  Can't we just make him leave?
2-male_must_masturbate,target:captain_falcon=laughing,Well, I'll learn about men from this, but you might deafen me in the process.
2-male_must_masturbate,saidMarker:1v1=teasing,And that's a wrap!  Show me what I've won, Earth-man--do it <i>nice and slow</i> so I can study it.
2-male_must_masturbate,saidMarker:1v1=smug,All too easy.  But hey, at least you beat everybody else--better than I expected from a man.
2-male_must_masturbate,saidMarker:1v1=laughing,Now then, do men like women's feet?  I hope so, because that's all you're getting from me.
2-male_must_masturbate,saidMarker:1v1=teasing,Better luck next time, ~name~.  You'd better hope there's a next time, unless my feet are all it takes for you to get yourself off.

2-male_must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:meia,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0,priority:1001=smug,What's the big deal?  It's just a man jerking his tube or whatever.
2-male_start_masturbating=seductive,So<i> brutish</i>...but so <i>fascinating</i>, too.  Keep going, ~name~.
2-male_start_masturbating=smug,Guess that's why they call it "jerking off."  No style, no grace, no charm.
2-male_start_masturbating=smug,That's all it takes to get your seed out?  Repeat the same dull motion over and over?  <i>Men</i>...
2-male_start_masturbating=interested,Those tubes must feel great inside me, because that motion certainly doesn't look stimulating.
2-male_start_masturbating,target:9s=laughing,What does an android think about, exactly?  Silicone breasts?  Mechanical hips?
2-male_start_masturbating,target:9s=interested,I'm quite curious what's going through your mind.  The exact optimal jerking speed, factoring in fuel efficiency?
2-male_start_masturbating,target:9s=seductive,Anyone on your mind, Little Dungeon Bot?  Someone at this table...or maybe your cute little "2B" partner?
2-male_start_masturbating,target:9s=vain,What gets a robot going, huh?  If I could make a <i>machine</i> like me, I'm officially the most gorgeous woman alive.
2-male_masturbating=seductive,Am I attractive to an Earth man, ~name~?  Mejarians can't keep their eyes off me.
2-male_masturbating=vain,I'm trying to picture B.C. doing this...and part of me thinks it's more appealing.
2-male_masturbating=vain,What angle do I look best from, in a man's opinion?  The women in my life can never decide.
2-male_masturbating=interested,I've got to hand it to you men, ~name~.  That doesn't look easy <i>or</i> comfortable.
2-male_masturbating,target:9s=laughing,Hey, 9S.  You're thinking about how much you want to...well, you know.  Aren't you?
2-male_masturbating,target:9s=vain,I just can't get over the look on your face, honey.  A robot in ecstasy!  Marvelous.
2-male_masturbating,target:9s=thinking,Seriously, I'm wondering what a robot thinks about when he masturbates.  I can't even figure out <i>human</i> men.
2-male_masturbating,target:9s=thinking,It's hard to find this erotic when I'm confused about your gender <i>and</i> your mechanics.
2-male_finished_masturbating=shocked,T-<i>that's</i> what male seed looks like?  I take back what I said!  ...Maybe.
2-male_finished_masturbating=shocked,Gah!  W-what's that?  Is someone gonna clean that?
2-male_finished_masturbating=shocked,Eek!  Don't get it on me!  I don't know what it does!  Is it poisonous?
2-male_finished_masturbating=angry,Watch the outfit!  Cleaning this is a nightmare, you know!
2-male_finished_masturbating,target:9s=awkward,<i>Let me see it, now</i>!  ...Where is it?  You know, your seed?
2-male_finished_masturbating,target:9s=angry,...Do you seriously not have any seed?  The one thing I was most interested in?
2-male_finished_masturbating,target:9s=bored,...Oh.  You're a machine, so you don't have the <i>semen</i> stuff.  Well, you're worthless to me, then.
2-male_finished_masturbating,target:9s=angry,Wha--w-where's all the seed?  I wanted to see men's <i>sperm</i> things!  Hey!
2-male_finished_masturbating,target:corrin_m=shocked,<i>Eeeeeek!  I knew men were monsters!  How dare you try to enter my womb</i>!
2-male_finished_masturbating,target:corrin_m=shocked,<i>Wait!  I take it all back!  I don't want man-beasts clawing at my breasts!  Stay away from my womb</i>!
2-male_finished_masturbating,target:corrin_m=bored,...I don't want talons anywhere near my cervix.  Earth women can have you for themselves.
2-male_finished_masturbating,target:corrin_m=shocked,<i>Wha--wha--a monster!  Stay back!  I have a girlfriend-and she has guns!  I don't need men</i>!
2-male_finished_masturbating,target:jin=shocked,<i>Eep</i>!  W-why's it glowing so much?  The book just said it was pearly, not <i>radioactive</i>!
2-male_finished_masturbating,target:jin=awkward,...Uh, did I miss a paragraph in the book?  Does men's sperm come out all lustrous and then fade?
2-male_finished_masturbating,target:jin=seductive,Oh, wow!  Does it really glow that much?  That looks like <i>I'd</i> glow if you came inside me.
2-male_finished_masturbating,target:jin=seductive,Wow, men's seed is even more glorious than I imagined!  You must pump your heart and soul into that stuff to make it shine like that!
2-female_must_masturbate=teasing,And she's <i>outta</i> there!  Too easy...but have fun.
2-female_must_masturbate=teasing,A fellow woman down and out.  Tell them it was Jura Basil Elden's fault, and how beautiful she was.
2-female_must_masturbate=laughing,Sad to see you go, but glad to see you...<i>come</i>.
2-female_must_masturbate=interested,Hey, you cost me my boots.  Maybe you'll get my feet wet, if you follow.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:meia,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0,priority:1001=laughing,I didn't think you'd find out like this, OK?  I expected better from you.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:meia,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0,priority:1001=smug,Hey, Meia, it's your own fault for losing so badly.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:meia,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0,priority:1001=stretching,Oh, don't give me that.  They've got to up the stakes somehow, and you lost pretty badly.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:meia,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0,priority:1001=vain,Shame on you for thinking this game was so low-stakes.  I know you like a challenge!
2-female_must_masturbate,target:sei=laughing,That last drink was the dagger, huh?  Maybe you would've held up otherwise.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:sei=interested,Looks like that last drink was the one that blurred out all the numbers on the cards.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:sei=teasing,All you've got, eh, dearie?  Did the alcohol finally reach your brain and short out your poker face?
2-female_must_masturbate,target:sei=vain,A noble effort, made all the more tragic in how you just kept shooting yourself in the foot with that booze.  Now get to the good stuff.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:sei=seductive,You're a horny little blue ball of booze, aren't you?  You sound like you've been waiting for this--drunks aren't exactly subtle.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:amalia=smug,I can only <i>dream</i> of how embarrassed you must be, dear.  There's no possible chance you're actually an exhibitionist.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:amalia=laughing,This must be <i>so</i> devastating.  Surely you don't get off on being watched like us lecherous commoners.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:amalia=stretching,Oh, woe is you!  A princess forced to exhibit her base desires like her lowly subjects.  No chance she's into it.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:amalia=teasing,Nobility, reduced to her primal instincts for an audience...it's a good thing you're so above it all.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:elizabeth=shocked,It's been fun, Liz, but you--you--<i>there's more than one of you</i>.

2-female_must_masturbate,target:elizabeth=shocked,<i>Ack!  No!  The Harvest!  They're mulitplying!  Help</i>!
2-female_must_masturbate,target:elizabeth=shocked,...<i>What?  What's happening?  Elizabeth</i>?
2-female_must_masturbate,target:nagisa=laughing,You're putting on a <i>performance</i> for us?  Isn't that what the masturbation is anyway?
2-female_must_masturbate,target:nagisa=teasing,Hey, honey--if you want to put on a play, play with <i>yourself</i>.  That's what we all came here for.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:nagisa=smug,Yeah, Mejare has some plays I know of.  Mostly about men eating a poor helpless woman, then getting gutted themselves.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:nagisa=vain,A play, huh?  Let's see if it's more riveting than the man-killing, rough-and-tumble world of Mejarian theater.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:nagisa=smug,Oh, you're doing a play?  I was never big on theater myself--my own life as a pilot is far more interesting, after all.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:alpha,marker:planet-countries=confused,What's a <i>yoo-ess-bee</i>?  Something only Planet Japan has?
2-female_must_masturbate,target:alpha=thinking,"Yoo-ess-bees" make you real?  Do <i>I</i> have one without even knowing it?
2-female_must_masturbate,target:alpha=smug,Oh look, she's actually speaking instead of singing.  And even then, she's goin on about nonsense like "yoo-ess-bees."
2-female_must_masturbate,target:alpha=stretching,A "yoo-ess-bee"?  Sounds like some fancy gadget Parfet would understand.  Is Miss Popstar a secret genius?
2-female_must_masturbate,target:streaming-chan=laughing,What are you--oh.  <i>Oh</i>.  So you're <i>that</i> kind of woman...a toy woman.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:streaming-chan=stretching,Toys, huh?  Yeah, I can see you poor single women resorting to them without a girlfriend around.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:streaming-chan=teasing,A <i>toy</i>?  What, don't you Earth girls have pet men you summon to ravish you on command?
2-female_must_masturbate,target:streaming-chan=vain,Should've known Miss Media would use a toy--the most conspicuous way to get yourself off, besides enlisting a partner.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:felicia=teasing,Wow, you weren't kidding!  Come on, honey, what were you thinking?  Couldn't stuff yourself into an overcoat?
2-female_must_masturbate,target:felicia=laughing,Well, you sure made this easy, honey.  That's what you get for showing up naked.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:felicia=stretching,Not much of a tease, are you?  Just up and arriving naked to start with.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:felicia=laughing,I thought you had clothes to start with, however skimpy, but no.  You were actually naked this whole time.

2-female_must_masturbate,target:morrigan=stretching,Oh, you brought a friend to help?  Just like a succubus...then again, I should've brought Barnette.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:meia=interested,Not sure how to do it, Meia?  I know sexuality is a foreign concept to you.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:meia=teasing,Just pretend your labia are the controls to your Dread.  Just fiddle around, you know?
2-female_must_masturbate,target:meia=laughing,I guess you might have a few gaps in knowledge.  That thing hasn't seen the light of day since you had your diapers changed.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:meia=vain,Would you like some pointers from a woman with actual sexual experience?  Because I really doubt that groin of yours has ever seen any action.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:meia=laughing,Considering you put up a thick wall of ice around your vagina, I doubt any woman alive has gotten near it before.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:aimee=teasing,Now if you could masturbate with the <i>bullets</i>, that'd <i>really</i> impress me.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:aimee=smug,Surely she doesn't have to do it, right?  I mean, she already came earlier.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:aimee=interested,We'd better find some cover, considering how she made herself cum <i>last</i> time.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:aimee=teasing,Well, <i>this</i> is a predicament.  Or is your aim good enough to <i>juuust</i> graze yourself to orgasm?
2-female_must_masturbate,target:vriska=smug,Oh, what's the big deal?  Masturbating in front of us would be less embarrassing than the state you're in now.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:vriska=interested,Dealer, doesn't this count as naked?  Hasn't she lost now?  Come on.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:vriska=interested,Come <i>on</i>, Vriska.  You're naked.  You lost.  It's OK.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:vriska=laughing,Everyone loses eventually, sweetie.  Even cheaters with speech impediments.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:misato=teasing,Sure you've still got the coordination to <i>find</i> you vagina, Boozeball?  Either way, this'll be entertaining.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:misato=laughing,I think this works out perfectly.  Either you manage to masturbate and it's sexy, or you fall over and it's funny.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:misato=vain,Have fun pawing at both your vaginas, Miss Doublevision.  You look like you're going to fall asleep any minute now.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:misato=teasing,Sorry I couldn't drink too much with you, but I'm in enemy territory, after all.  Now have fun trying to find your vagina, Blurry-eyes.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=smug,Oh, <i>God</i>.  Miss Busybee has to masturbate now?  We're going to drown in her tears.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=laughing,Should we really make her do this?  She's so scared of her own body, she'll run in circles.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=vain,Maybe I'd have some sympathy if you had a body to be ashamed of.  As it stands, this embarrassment is an insult to poor ugly girls.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=interested,Do we really want to make her do this?  She's <i>already</i> a blubbering mess, and she's just standing around naked.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=stretching,Get the cleanup crew ready.  If this girl hasn't peed herself yet, she's going to do it now.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=stretching,<i>God</i>, Earth girls grow up soft.  Fighting men all your life really toughens you up!
2-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=stretching,Look, Florina masturbating is bad for everyone here.  She cries, and she annoys <i>us</i> in the process.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=teasing,I'm tempted to plant a big smooch right on your mouth, dear.  That'll shock you right out of your embarrassment!
2-female_must_masturbate,target:meia,alsoPlaying:kyu=vain,Hey, <i>I'm</i> fun.  Meia barely knows what "fun" means.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:meia,alsoPlaying:kyu=stretching,Hey, don't give Meia any credit for all the fun <i>I'm</i> bringing.  Her job is to stand there and look miserable.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:meia,alsoPlaying:kyu=teasing,It's a hard life being a pirate, Miss Pixie!  So I try to make it fun for myself, while Meia is content is live in misery.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:meia,alsoPlaying:kyu=vain,It's nice to be appreciated for lighting up a room the way I do.  I have to work extra hard when Meia's killing the mood nearby.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:moon=frustrated,Great.  Yeah.  Masturbate instead of seeking medical attention.  See if <i>I</i> care.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:moon=bored,...Sometimes I wonder why I like teasing people so much.  Maybe it's just to prove I can toe the line others can't.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:moon=frustrated,Some people you just can't help.  Or even talk to.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:moon=annoyed,What a shock.  Yeah, have fun.  Whatever.
2-female_must_masturbate,saidMarker:1v1=vain,Remember that I pilot a complicated Dread against killer Harvest cubes on a daily basis...so this wasn't exactly stressful.

2-female_must_masturbate,saidMarker:1v1=vain,Don't beat yourself up about this.  What do you expect when you go up against a pirate, and a distractingly beautiful one at that?

2-female_must_masturbate,target:rainbow_mika=teasing,Well, there's only one thing that girl can help you with now, honey.  If you're up to task, of course.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:rainbow_mika=teasing,Is your partner going all the way with "assisting" you?  Because that would make this Mejarian feel right at home.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:rainbow_mika=vain,Well, you should know the drill, dear.  Or will you invite your partner along for <i>this</i>, too?
2-female_start_masturbating=stretching,Not exactly the <i>rarest</i> sight on Mejare.  Women have needs, you know.
2-female_start_masturbating=interested,I see Earth women and Mejarians aren't quite so different after all.
2-female_start_masturbating=smug,And I was so looking forward to stripping some more to help you out later.  Oh, well.
2-female_start_masturbating=vain,You know, I have no idea how Barnette masturbates.  I've always been around to do the job for her.
2-female_start_masturbating=teasing,Those boots I was wearing cost thousands of credits.  I just stole them--but that kind of money is worth masturbating to!
2-female_start_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=shocked,<i>Wait, I was kidding!  Ack</i>!

2-female_start_masturbating,target:aella=interested,You've <i>never</i> masturbated, huh?  Locked away in a house all your life and your hands never wandered south of the border?
2-female_start_masturbating,target:aella=teasing,What are you, a robot?  <i>Everyone</i> masturbates, dearie...unless you're <i>that</i> popular with the girls.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:aella=stretching,Yeah, you've never masturbated.  <i>Mm-hm</i>.  And I've never taken a bath.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:aella=smug,Oh, give me a break, honey.  Sex I can see people shying away from, but never <i>masturbating</i>?  Does your heart not beat?
2-female_start_masturbating,target:aella=interested,Ooh, Miss Big-Boned over here has never masturbated.  That's why you came to a public strip poker game, right?
2-female_start_masturbating,target:aella=teasing,Never masturbated, huh?  You must think you're better than the rest of us, Miss Chastity.  Well, <i>you're missing out</i>.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:felicia=shocked,<i>Gah</i>!  W-where'd you keep that thing?  It's enormous...and phallic!
2-female_start_masturbating,target:felicia=laughing,A <i>vibrator</i>?  Never seen one shaped like that...must be like a man's tube.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:felicia=smug,Figures Earth women would even have <i>toys</i> shaped like men's things.  Can't you be independent?
2-female_start_masturbating,target:felicia=vain,Oh, of course.  I should've known any toys on this planet would resemble men's tubes.  You Earth girls are hopeless.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=laughing,<i>Ooh</i>.  Should've known a magical woman dressed in all scarlet would pull something like this...I think I'm good.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=teasing,That's...quite a lot of hands.  More than I think I could keep track of...<i>but that's half the fun</i>.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=vain,Not sure I like being tied up and fondled, dear...well, maybe with the right person.  A certain green-haired cutie, specifically.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=vain,To each her own, I suppose...that level of vulnerability is for Barnette's eyes only, as far as I'm concerned.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:amalia=awkward,...Oh.  OK.  Well, way to prove me wrong right away.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:amalia=shocked,Uh...<i>what are you doing?  I was just teasing</i>!
2-female_start_masturbating,target:amalia=shocked,...I was just kidding around!  It was a joke!  You don't have to...uh...
2-female_start_masturbating,target:amalia=awkward,...Or you could go ahead and actually be an exhibitionist.  That works too, I guess.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:joey=seductive,Oh, my!  That's the biggest vibrator I've ever seen--I guess there's a lot more room on Earth!
2-female_start_masturbating,target:joey=interested,Is this just a clown thing where everything is comically large?  Or more of a general Earth style?
2-female_start_masturbating,target:joey=vain,A vibrator?  And my, it's enormous--and shaped like men's tubes!  All I need are Barnette's lovely fingers, not these massive toys.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:joey=vain,My, such <i>girth</i> on that thing!  Is this men's influence?  Because Mejare's toys are rather inconspicuous.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:meia=seductive,Just give it your best.  You always do when there's cubes trying to kill us...or men.  Or women.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:meia=seductive,Sorry to see my officer reduced to a harlot on the floor.  But she's so <i>adorable</i>, trying to figure out her own body!
2-female_start_masturbating,target:meia=laughing,Masturbating suits you, Meia!  Maybe because this is probably your first time ever.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:meia=interested,Not sure I believe you've done this before, Meia.  You're looking a little clumsy already.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=laughing,Barnette's got a few toys...which have helped give us some perspective on men's tubes.  But not <i>quite</i> that big.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=teasing,Toys are hard to come by on Mejare, you know...they're symbols of men.  Unless you're a pirate, where you get your pick.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=stretching,I can't believe you carry that unwieldy thing around.  Earth women can't go five minutes without something phallic!
2-female_start_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=vain,Such ridiculous things...Barnette's lovely fingers are all I need to be happy.  And maybe her gun-shaped toys.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:videl=excited,Wow, you <i>are</i> flying!  I'm so much taller, it was hard to tell--<i>how're you doing that</i>?
2-female_start_masturbating,target:videl=seductive,Hard to be sure in crazy places like this, but you've been flying this whole time, Videl!  I should've noticed!
2-female_start_masturbating,target:videl=excited,Videl!  Videl!  Omigosh, can you teach me how to fly?  I don't see any wings, so that means I can learn, right?
2-female_start_masturbating,target:videl=vain,Can you show me how to fly, Videl?  That'd make the most talented woman alive in addition to the most beautiful!
2-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu=smug,And now Miss Pixie takes to the air to masturbate?  I don't know what I expected out of you.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu=teasing,I should've expected you to use those wings at some point, Miss Fairytale.  Now give me a good view.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu=laughing,I'd call you a skank for flying up and presenting to us, but I think you'd relish that.  So have your fun.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu=seductive,You're a little crazy, Miss Pixie, but you certainly put the effort in.  Check out that fairy flight!
2-female_start_masturbating,target:morrigan=vain,<i>Oh, my</i>!  Just like me and Barnette...except we can't fly.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:morrigan=laughing,Maybe Barnette and I would try that position if one of us had wings.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:morrigan=seductive,You're certainly proving yourself to be every bit the succubus you claim to be, dear.  I'm falling under <i>both</i> your spells!
2-female_start_masturbating,target:morrigan=teasing,Well, Miss Succubus, the addition of this "Lilith" is making me feel right at home.  That's how Mejarians have sex--mostly.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:florina=seductive,Oh look, she's going to sing to make herself feel better!  That's...actually kind of sweet.  I think I like you, darling!
2-female_start_masturbating,target:florina=seductive,Ooh, a song?  Sorry I made fun--I <i>love</i> music!  Go for it, cutie.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:florina=teasing,Yeah, I try to make Barnette sing, too.  But that's by accident...and the tune's all over the place.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:florina=excited,You are just so <i>unbearably</i> cute.  Now you're <i>singing</i>?  I just want to squeeze you!
2-female_start_masturbating,target:vriska=shocked,Wha--you--<i>oh dear</i>.  Maybe we <i>should</i> let her keep playing.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:vriska=shocked,...I take it back.  Let her keep playing, Dealer.  Let her leave, actually.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:vriska=awkward,...Oh my.  That die <i>really</i> hates you.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:vriska=bored,...This is getting too weird for me.  Earth is a strange planet.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:alpha=shocked,...OK.  Yeah.  I'm starting to believe you about this <i>virtual</i> business.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:alpha=awkward,That's...new.  Nice color shift.  Glad I could see you become a real woman.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:alpha=shocked,<i>Eek</i>!  I-I mean, uh, great skin tone there, Alpha.  Much more natural.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:alpha=awkward,...Well, it worked.  I shouldn't have doubted you...but I still don't understand you.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:shego=interested,Legs getting tired, dear?  Or are you afraid we won't see enough of you on the floor?
2-female_start_masturbating,target:shego=laughing,Seems Miss Lean-and-Green's butt is a little too delicate for the cold floor...or maybe she's just a total exhibitionist.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:shego=seductive,Aww, does the poor bodysuited villain not like how cold the floor is on her little backside?  Take a chair and show off, then.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:shego=teasing,Yeah, standing all this time is a little grating.  But hey, you could hide a little more if you sat on the floor...maybe.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:aimee=shocked,O-oh, you're--using the gun.  ...Maybe you should unload it first?
2-female_start_masturbating,target:aimee=shocked,...OK, I call Barnette a gun nut, but she doesn't go <i>that</i> far.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:aimee=awkward,...Barnette has some toys shaped like guns.  Just for fun, you know?  But...the <i>real thing</i>?
2-female_start_masturbating,target:aimee=awkward,...I really thought you were cool, but now I'm worried.  Isn't that kind of dangerous?
2-female_start_masturbating,target:hermione=laughing,<i>Oh, my</i>!  That's <i>one</i> way to use magic, you little skank!  But I understand.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:hermione=interested,Well, dear, you're not fooling anyone with the good-girl act now.  That's way too many hands to be wholesome.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:hermione=vain,Now <i>that</i> looks pretty magical.  Suddenly my two-handed approach with Barnette seems inadequate.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:hermione=teasing,<i>My, my, my</i>!  Miss Witch knows what she wants, alright.  And she's not afraid to magic her way there.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:nagisa=teasing,Well, here we go.  Take me on a thrilling, dramatic adventure...shy little sheltered Earth girl.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:nagisa=vain,This had better be more thrilling than what I do every day, you know.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:nagisa=teasing,Hey, coming here was like an anatomy and culture lesson already.  This story better be crazy!
2-female_start_masturbating,target:nagisa=vain,I crave drama, you know...that's why I'm a ruthless pirate and cunning pilot.  So don't let me down with this story.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:moon=sad,I'm honestly rethinking my entire life.  You're like a prophetic angel.  I shouldn't come to these sorts of places.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:moon=frustrated,Are you an apparition sent to punish me for being curious about men?
2-female_start_masturbating,target:moon=sad,You don't have to whore yourself out for money.  Just come to Mejare...you'll make excellent anti-men propaganda.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:moon=bored,For the first time in my life, I'm regretting a decision.  Coming here was a bad idea.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,OK.  Yes.  This is happening now.  Elizabeth is capable of this.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,Neat powers, Elizabeth.  Real...real <i>Mejarian</i>.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,Who...who <i>are</i> you?  Which one is Elizabeth?
2-female_start_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,I--I thought you were just a sweet little Earth girl!  Who are you?
2-female_masturbating=teasing,Don't think you'll steal me away from my Barnette.  She's so much cuter!
2-female_masturbating=seductive,You're awfully cute, ~name~.  Just think what Mejarian genetic engineering would have done for you!
2-female_masturbating=vain,This is hardly adventurous for me.  I saved a whole planet from the Harvest with my Vandread!
2-female_masturbating=teasing,Think about whatever you want, ~name~.  But know that only a Mejarian woman would return the favor properly.
2-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=awkward,...I guess you don't need a girlfriend, do you?
2-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=awkward,...You know, I didn't peg you as the kind of girl who'd be open to this sort of thing.  Or that had superpowers.
2-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=awkward,You know, I've done that...with Barnette.  You know, <i>another</i> woman.  Not myself.
2-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=thinking,Now I'm curious how good a clone of me would be at this sort of thing...
2-female_masturbating,target:shego=teasing,Hey, honey, I'm been talking dirty all game...no sense waiting till the end on <i>that</i> front.
2-female_masturbating,target:shego=laughing,Just listen to the things coming out of Green-bean's mouth!  She's trying to catch up to what I've been doing all evening.
2-female_masturbating,target:shego=teasing,Too bad I got such a head start on the dirty talk, because Shego's doing her best now to match me.
2-female_masturbating,target:shego=seductive,You've got a filthy mouth on you to match the green complexion.  Can't you be a sweetheart for once?
2-female_masturbating,target:aimee=awkward,I'm...kind of worried about you, Aimee.  Is there something we should know about men's guns?
2-female_masturbating,target:aimee=bored,I'd definitely give Barnette an intervention if she started masturbating with loaded guns.
2-female_masturbating,target:aimee=smug,That thing is gonna make a bigger racket than even <i>you</i> are.
2-female_masturbating,target:aimee=awkward,This is getting way too weird for me, Aimee.  The clothes thing was cool, but <i>this</i>?  It's a death wish!
2-female_masturbating,target:meia=interested,This is a whole new side to you.  You've got a libido after all, don't you?
2-female_masturbating,target:meia=teasing,Never saw you as capable of masturbating, Meia.  So...<i>who's on your mind</i>?
2-female_masturbating,target:meia=seductive,If you need any help, I'll gladly throw this game.  My squadron leader comes before some silly cards!
2-female_masturbating,target:meia=interested,Is this the side of you you don't want us to see?  For fear of looking all soft or something?
2-female_masturbating,target:meia=teasing,There's nothing wrong with being lovable, Meia.  You're so <i>cute</i> like this!
2-female_masturbating,target:rinkah=laughing,Did you just--you <i>did</i>!  You're such a beast of a woman, Rinkah...
2-female_masturbating,target:rinkah=laughing,Are you putting your finger where I think you are?  You've done nothing but confirm stereotypes all evening...you <i>animal</i>.
2-female_masturbating,target:rinkah=smug,I guess Miss Warrior is so tempered from all her harsh battles, she needs to stick fingers in her rear to feel anything.
2-female_masturbating,target:rinkah=teasing,I don't know what I expected from you, Miss Fireball, but a finger in the butt checks out.  Barnette and I would never be that dirty.
2-female_masturbating,target:marceline=confused,What exactly is letting you float like that?  You've been doing it all game, and it doesn't even look strenuous.
2-female_masturbating,target:marceline=seductive,You're inhuman in so many ways...no eyes, blue skin, floating.  But you sure masturbate like a normal girl.
2-female_masturbating,target:marceline=teasing,I guess you're pretty human after all, Eyeballs.  Just look at you floating there, having the time of your life!
2-female_masturbating,target:marceline=teasing,Going to perform any fancy tricks for us, Miss Levitator?  Masturbate upside down or something?
2-female_masturbating,target:amalia=excited,Omigosh, is that vine doing what men's tubes do?  It looks like it!  Show me more!
2-female_masturbating,target:amalia=awkward,...I was just ribbing you about being naughty.  I guess I was right...or I really got to you.
2-female_masturbating,target:amalia=excited,Ooh, show me more angles!  That's <i>so cool</i>...it's like a really long men's tube, right?  Right?
2-female_masturbating,target:amalia=laughing,You really <i>are</i> a little skank!  I should've known all princesses are like this, all sheltered and itching for adventure.
2-female_masturbating,target:amalia=laughing,Can't reach orgasm without a giant tube shoved inside of you, huh?  Glad I didn't grow up stuck with men for my sexual needs.
2-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=teasing,<i>Hoo</i>.  Well, at least you seem like you're in control.  Have fun, girls!
2-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=seductive,Well, you're not killing anyone, so fine by me.  This is fun to watch!
2-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=teasing,Just stand a safe distance away...this <i>is</i> pretty sexy.
2-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=seductive,I <i>knew</i> you two were lovers!  Can't keep your hands off each other...or anything else.
2-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=vain,As long as you don't clothesline me, you can keep this up all you want, cuties.  Just watch those muscles ripple!
2-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=seductive,Barnette and I aren't as strong as you two, but maybe I should take notes anyway.
2-female_masturbating,target:vriska=confused,You, uh, holding up over there, Vriska?  Wriggling free sometime soon?
2-female_masturbating,target:vriska=frustrated,...I'm just going to assume she's into this.  I really don't want to touch her.
2-female_masturbating,target:vriska=bored,...I think I would've preferred you <i>gaining</i> clothes, Vriska.
2-female_masturbating,target:vriska=bored,That magic was cool, but <i>yeesh</i>.  What a weirdo...
2-female_masturbating,target:uravity=vain,You're so rude, Ochako, to not share your levitation powers with everyone else.  I share my beauty!
2-female_masturbating,target:uravity=smug,Miss Gravity is certainly making the best use of her powers that <i>I</i> could think of.  Shame the rest of us can't join in.
2-female_masturbating,target:uravity=seductive,Are you <i>sure</i> you were born with these powers?  There isn't some crazy Earth doctor I can visit to fly, too?
2-female_masturbating,target:uravity=vain,Is there nothing crueler than showing off the powers the rest of us can't enjoy?  At least <i>I</i> can't hide how beautiful I am.
2-female_masturbating,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:8=teasing,I can't believe I met <i>two</i> women who can fly...and that both would use it for such <i>unsavory</i> reasons.  <i>Teach me</i>!
2-female_masturbating,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:8=vain,Two women showing off the goods in the air, and neither will bother to show me how!  <i>I</i> want to fly, too, you know.
2-female_masturbating,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:8=seductive,Hey, what's a beautiful woman got to do to get some flying lessons?  <i>I</i> want to join in on the airborne fun you two are having!
2-female_masturbating,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:8=vain,You damn Earthling teases are keeping secrets from me!  Can't a gorgeous girl like me learn to fly, too?  I learned to pilot!
2-female_masturbating,target:moon=frustrated,Please don't look at me.  Please don't talk.  I'm very afraid.
2-female_masturbating,target:moon=frustrated,God, just let it end already...I'll go straight after this, I promise.
2-female_masturbating,target:moon=bored,Yes.  Cute.  Elegant.  You have the grace of those swans I see in zoos.
2-female_masturbating,target:moon=bored,Marvelous.  Having fun, Moon?  Good.  Glad, even.
2-female_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=interested,Holding up, dear?  You seem a little incapable of saying the safe word.
2-female_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=stretching,I guess when you've got superpowers at your disposal, you need to feel unsafe for once to be excited.
2-female_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=laughing,See, this is why I don't want magic.  <i>This</i> is the kind of thing I'd need to get a thrill again.
2-female_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=laughing,Hanging in there, Miss Bloodred?  Any tighter and it won't just be your outfit that's scarlet.
2-female_masturbating,target:gwen=smug,...I can't really fault you for this.  If <i>I</i> had spider-web powers, I'd give that a try, too.
2-female_masturbating,target:gwen=teasing,I'm going to go ahead and guess this isn't <i>all</i> you use that webbing for...if you've got someone else with you.
2-female_masturbating,target:gwen=vain,That webbing looks like quite a bit of fun!  If only I could give it a try with Barnette.
2-female_masturbating,target:gwen=seductive,Hey, I like those angles you're pulling, cutie!  Go upside down again!
2-female_masturbating,target:morrigan=teasing,I was hoping to learn something new here to surprise Barnette tomorrow evening...or maybe even when I get back.
2-female_masturbating,target:morrigan=vain,It's so comforting to see two women enjoying each others' bodies.  I thought Earth had never heard of such a thing!
2-female_masturbating,target:morrigan=stretching,Par for the course where I'm from, Morrigan--sorry it's not leaving an impact.  Well, Mejarians don't fly, but still.
2-female_masturbating,target:morrigan=vain,Hey, keep it up, Miss Succubus.  You're making my heart swell with memories of my darling Barnette--it's hard to be away from her!
2-female_masturbating,target:videl=teasing,At least you're making this interesting, just bobbing up and down like that...<i>you're such a pervert</i>.
2-female_masturbating,target:videl=vain,Just gliding along, letting your instincts guide you...<i>oh, to be young again</i>!  Well, younger.
2-female_masturbating,target:videl=seductive,If only I could fly like you and make my beauty more fully visible.  Do you realize how lucky you are?
2-female_masturbating,target:videl=seductive,Videl, Videl, <i>Videl</i>!  You're a complete package, dear--cute, fit, adorable pigtails, and superpowers!
2-female_masturbating,target:kyu=seductive,Hey, Miss Love Fairy.  I know you've got wings, but share the magic a little!  <i>I</i> want to fly too, you know!
2-female_masturbating,target:kyu=vain,Now <i>this</i> is a good use of wings.  Who wants to sit on the nasty old ground to masturbate?
2-female_masturbating,target:kyu=interested,I like your style, Miss Pixie.  You were born with wings, and now you've found the perfect use for them.
2-female_masturbating,target:kyu=stretching,Yeah, I'd probably fly like that, too.  But <i>some</i> fairies just won't share their magic with the rest of us.
2-female_finished_masturbating=stretching,Still not as cute as Barnette.  Can't beat that vibrant green hair.
2-female_finished_masturbating=smug,I think I'll stick to Barnette, thanks.
2-female_finished_masturbating=vain,So much to gush, but I barely even blushed.
2-female_finished_masturbating=teasing,Did you hit <i>nirvana</i>, ~name~?  I came up with that name, you know.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,...That ended as quickly as it began.  What <i>was</i> that?
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,You don't even seem bothered!  W-why didn't you say you could do stuff like that?
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:elizabeth=awkward,...And this sort of thing just comes naturally to you?  Didn't bat an eye?
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,OK.  Yes.  It's over now, apparently.  Very enlightening, Elizabeth.  Never judge by appearances.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:aimee=shocked,A-ah!  See?  I <i>told</i> you!
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:aimee=bored,...Yeah, <i>definitely</i> making sure Barnette doesn't go this far.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:aimee=bored,Guess we all knew that was coming, but I wanted to believe you'd pull it off.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:aimee=frustrated,...I think I prefer <i>Barnette's</i> level of gun-hobby.  As in, not shooting herself.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:moon=bored,Nice finish.  The white fluid really stands out against your blackened labia.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:moon=annoyed,Class act, these Earth girls.  Absolutely marvelous to behold.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:moon=annoyed,Would you believe I thought I was superior to Earth girls?  Moon here's shown me I have a long way to go.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:moon=bored,Perfect.  Yeah.  Mm-hm.  Glad you had fun.  See you next time.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:launch=seductive,Ooh, the blue one again!  If you weren't so unstable, I'd invite you back for a drink, cutie.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:launch=vain,Oh, thank God, the blue one's back.  Good to see a woman who's polite and sincere in my line of work!
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:launch=interested,Just in time.  I wasn't looking forward to hearing your counterpart bellyache about losing.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:launch=teasing,Just the hair color I wanted to see!  You're so much nicer to be around, even if you're kind of a doormat.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=vain,I knew Earth girls could love each other the way we do.  Men are just so superfluous!
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=seductive,Talk about a Mejarian power couple.  You're stronger than the men I know anyway!
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=teasing,I like the idea of men just picking me up...but it seems like you two could do that anyway.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=vain,I guess Earth isn't so different from Mejare after all.  Two strong women in love!  ...Like me and Barnette.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:amalia=stretching,<i>And it just dumps you off, disgusted with your behavior</i>.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:amalia=smug,Earth women are so bestial, having sex with men and plants in equal measures.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:amalia=laughing,You ought to be ashamed of yourself, young lady!  Now go get your servant to clean you up!
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:amalia=vain,Looks like Little Miss Princess was just another dirty commoner, begging to be ravished and tossed aside.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:uravity=seductive,And she just plops down like a doofus!  You get cuter the longer I look at you, darling.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:uravity=laughing,Have a good time, Miss Gravity?  Seems like you lost control of your little floating maneuver.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:uravity=teasing,I think you might be the most adorable girl I've ever met, from stuffing your figure into that suit to just plopping on the ground.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:uravity=laughing,Ha!  I guess you really <i>have</i> overcome your embarrassment, to just drop down like that.  Or maybe that was an accident.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:vriska=shocked,Wha--<i>ew!  W-what's all that blue stuff?  Don't get it on me!  It's gross</i>!
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:vriska=shocked,<i>Ack!  F-fluid!  B-blue fluid everywhere!  Is it poisonous</i>?
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:vriska=shocked,<i>Eeek!  V-Vriska!  What is this?  What did you do?  Why are you leaking blue stuff</i>?
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:vriska=shocked,<i>Ack!  K-keep that stuff away from me!  It's corrosive, isn't it?  M-magic corrosive blue fluid</i>!
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:meia=teasing,Whomever you thought about, I'm sure they're very happy about it.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:meia=teasing,Maybe you're not so good at cards anymore, but I'd still call you a steal.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:meia=smug,There's some sugar to your ice after all, Meia.  Never thought I'd learn <i>that</i> here.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:morrigan=seductive,What, she's leaving?  Stay a while!  We can talk about woman relationships together!
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:morrigan=seductive,Hey, don't leave so soon, dear!  You're a steal yourself--I can tell you more about more girlfriend!
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:morrigan=seductive,Aww, don't leave, honey!  We just got to meet each other, and you spent it all underneath Morrigan's butt!
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:morrigan=vain,<i>Leave if you must.  I guess I'm not beautiful enough to warrant sticking around</i>.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:black_canary=angry,<i>Oooow</i>!  Hey, shut up, you freak!
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:black_canary=angry,<i>Ow</i>!  What was <i>that</i> for?  <i>Ugh</i>!
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:black_canary=angry,<i>Oooooow</i>!  Ooh, the <i>nerve</i> of some people!  Take your weird voice powers and beat it, freak!
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:black_canary=annoyed,<i>AM I TALKING TOO LOUD?  I THINK I JUST WENT DEAF</i>.

3-male_must_masturbate=laughing,Could it be?  A man outwitted by a woman?  Ridiculous!
3-male_must_masturbate=teasing,At long last, my reward for beating a man.  Not just bragging rights, but some sexual education!
3-male_must_masturbate=seductive,Don't feel bad about losing.  Just think of it as doing this poor, curious Mejarian girl a favor.

3-male_must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:meia,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0,priority:1001=teasing,Just wanted to see your genuine reaction to men masturbating next to you.  You know, instead of your regular stoic facade.
3-male_must_masturbate,target:9s=smug,And now for the <i>ultimate</i> test of your humanity.  If he bleeds, he masturbates.
3-male_must_masturbate,target:9s=stretching,Well, time to cast aside your artificiality, honey.  Let's see if a fake man can outperform a real one!
3-male_must_masturbate,target:9s=vain,Don't feel bad if your fakeness makes this weird for you.  I don't have much frame of reference.
3-male_must_masturbate,target:9s=seductive,<i>Have fun, dear</i>!  Do you have to rev yourself up a bit, or are you actually like a real person in this regard?

3-male_must_masturbate,target:captain_america,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0=laughing,That's some excellent situational awareness, dear.  Then again, I lied to Meia to make her believe the same thing.
3-male_must_masturbate,target:captain_america,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0=interested,Nice job doing your homework, Mr. Muscle.  I guess they didn't pump up your brain at all.
3-male_must_masturbate,target:captain_america,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0=laughing,What, Mr. Goody-Two-Shoes didn't read the rulebook before he got here?  Come <i>on</i>.
3-male_must_masturbate,target:captain_falcon=teasing,Well, Mr. Shouts-a-minute, now you get to yell at us and have it actually be appropriate.  Go nuts.
3-male_must_masturbate,target:captain_falcon=laughing,You were shouting enough already, so I shudder to think at how noisy you'll be <i>now</i>.
3-male_must_masturbate,target:captain_falcon=stretching,Oh, good.  The man who already wouldn't shut up has to <i>masturbate</i> now.  Can't we just make him leave?
3-male_must_masturbate,target:captain_falcon=laughing,Well, I'll learn about men from this, but you might deafen me in the process.
3-male_must_masturbate,saidMarker:1v1=losing-choker,Good effort, ~name~, especially for a man.  Want me to take off my dress?  Guess what--<i>I still had the choker</i>!
3-male_must_masturbate,saidMarker:1v1=teasing,<i>You poor little thing.  Should I show some leg for you to masturbate to?  Men like that, right</i>?
3-male_must_masturbate,saidMarker:1v1=interested,Hey, those big, bad Tarakkian soldiers never managed to put a dent in me.  <i>You</i> never had a shot.
3-male_must_masturbate,saidMarker:1v1=teasing,The conclusion we all expected.  But hey, at least I get a little sexual education for my trouble.
3-male_start_masturbating=teasing,Show me what men are all about, ~name~!
3-male_start_masturbating=vain,I wonder if Hibiki'd have the guts to do this.  I mean, he <i>did</i> chicken out in delivering Ezra's baby.
3-male_start_masturbating=teasing,Unleash the animal inside, ~name~.  Just remember to keep it a safe distance away.
3-male_start_masturbating=laughing,And my reward is...watching a shaved ape return to his instincts.
3-male_start_masturbating,target:9s=laughing,What does an android think about, exactly?  Silicone breasts?  Mechanical hips?
3-male_start_masturbating,target:9s=interested,I'm quite curious what's going through your mind.  The exact optimal jerking speed, factoring in fuel efficiency?
3-male_start_masturbating,target:9s=seductive,Anyone on your mind, Little Dungeon Bot?  Someone at this table...or maybe your cute little "2B" partner?
3-male_start_masturbating,target:9s=vain,What gets a robot going, huh?  If I could make a <i>machine</i> like me, I'm officially the most gorgeous woman alive.
3-male_masturbating=teasing,Should I show some leg, ~name~?  You know, since you couldn't strip me any better than that?
3-male_masturbating=confused,Doesn't that wear out your tube, just beating away like that?
3-male_masturbating=teasing,With <i>me</i> around, this must be your best masturbation session ever.
3-male_masturbating=interested,I know you grew up around women, but have you ever <i>masturbated</i> around one?
3-male_masturbating,target:9s=laughing,Hey, 9S.  You're thinking about how much you want to...well, you know.  Aren't you?
3-male_masturbating,target:9s=vain,I just can't get over the look on your face, honey.  A robot in ecstasy!  Marvelous.
3-male_masturbating,target:9s=thinking,Seriously, I'm wondering what a robot thinks about when he masturbates.  I can't even figure out <i>human</i> men.
3-male_masturbating,target:9s=thinking,It's hard to find this erotic when I'm confused about your gender <i>and</i> your mechanics.
3-male_finished_masturbating=confused,And <i>that's</i> where the sperm are?  Just looks like fluid to me.  Where are they?
3-male_finished_masturbating=shocked,Wha--<i>ew</i>!  Don't spray it on me!  It's supposed to go inside!
3-male_finished_masturbating=shocked,Ew, it looks all thick!  That's not <i>really</i> your seed, right?  it can't be!
3-male_finished_masturbating=shocked,<i>That</i> has to go inside me?  Never mind!  No men's babies for me!
3-male_finished_masturbating=angry,...The book made men's seed look a lot more attractive.
3-male_finished_masturbating,target:9s=awkward,<i>Let me see it, now</i>!  ...Where is it?  You know, your seed?
3-male_finished_masturbating,target:9s=angry,...Do you seriously not have any seed?  The one thing I was most interested in?
3-male_finished_masturbating,target:9s=bored,...Oh.  You're a machine, so you don't have the <i>semen</i> stuff.  Well, you're worthless to me, then.
3-male_finished_masturbating,target:9s=angry,Wha--w-where's all the seed?  I wanted to see men's <i>sperm</i> things!  Hey!
3-male_finished_masturbating,target:jin=shocked,<i>Eep</i>!  W-why's it glowing so much?  The book just said it was pearly, not <i>radioactive</i>!
3-male_finished_masturbating,target:jin=awkward,...Uh, did I miss a paragraph in the book?  Does men's sperm come out all lustrous and then fade?
3-male_finished_masturbating,target:jin=seductive,Oh, wow!  Does it really glow that much?  That looks like <i>I'd</i> glow if you came inside me.
3-male_finished_masturbating,target:jin=seductive,Wow, men's seed is even more glorious than I imagined!  You must pump your heart and soul into that stuff to make it shine like that!
3-male_finished_masturbating,target:corrin_m=shocked,<i>Eeeeeek!  I knew men were monsters!  How dare you try to enter my womb</i>!
3-male_finished_masturbating,target:corrin_m=shocked,<i>Wait!  I take it all back!  I don't want man-beasts clawing at my breasts!  Stay away from my womb</i>!
3-male_finished_masturbating,target:corrin_m=bored,...I don't want talons anywhere near my cervix.  Earth women can have you for themselves.
3-male_finished_masturbating,target:corrin_m=shocked,<i>Wha--wha--a monster!  Stay back!  I have a girlfriend-and she has guns!  I don't need men</i>!
3-female_must_masturbate=smug,Too easy.  I guess Mejarians are smarter as well as being more beautiful.
3-female_must_masturbate=teasing,Years of fighting men have sharpened Mejarians' minds.  We're not dumb little doormats, you know.
3-female_must_masturbate=vain,I fight both Mejare <i>and</i> Tarak's armies.  A pirate's got to be resourceful!
3-female_must_masturbate=smug,I guess you can't expect quick thinking from these Earthling civilians.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:elizabeth=shocked,It's been fun, Liz, but you--you--<i>there's more than one of you</i>.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:elizabeth=shocked,Well, Liz, it was nice getting to know--<i>both of you</i>.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:elizabeth=shocked,<i>Ack!  No!  The Harvest!  They're mulitplying!  Help</i>!
3-female_must_masturbate,target:elizabeth=shocked,...<i>What?  What's happening?  Elizabeth</i>?
3-female_must_masturbate,saidMarker:1v1=smug,<i>Couldn't even get all my accessories off</i>...quite the sad performance from a fellow woman.
3-female_must_masturbate,saidMarker:1v1=teasing,I really wanted to come out of here with a little more respect for Earth girls, but you just kept on disappointing me.  <i>Now let's see how you masturbate</i>.
3-female_must_masturbate,saidMarker:1v1=laughing,Got a real knockout masturbation technique?  Because that's the only thing you have left that could possibly impress me.
3-female_must_masturbate,saidMarker:1v1=interested,Seems men's idiocy has all but weathered away your wits.  Has it done the same for your masturbation skills?
3-female_must_masturbate,target:amalia=smug,I can only <i>dream</i> of how embarrassed you must be, dear.  There's no possible chance you're actually an exhibitionist.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:amalia=laughing,This must be <i>so</i> devastating.  Surely you don't get off on being watched like us lecherous commoners.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:amalia=stretching,Oh, woe is you!  A princess forced to exhibit her base desires like her lowly subjects.  No chance she's into it.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:amalia=teasing,Nobility, reduced to her primal instincts for an audience...it's a good thing you're so above it all.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:alpha,marker:planet-countries=confused,What's a <i>yoo-ess-bee</i>?  Something only Planet Japan has?
3-female_must_masturbate,target:alpha=thinking,"Yoo-ess-bees" make you real?  Do <i>I</i> have one without even knowing it?
3-female_must_masturbate,target:alpha=smug,Oh look, she's actually speaking instead of singing.  And even then, she's goin on about nonsense like "yoo-ess-bees."
3-female_must_masturbate,target:alpha=stretching,A "yoo-ess-bee"?  Sounds like some fancy gadget Parfet would understand.  Is Miss Popstar a secret genius?
3-female_must_masturbate,target:streaming-chan=laughing,What are you--oh.  <i>Oh</i>.  So you're <i>that</i> kind of woman...a toy woman.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:streaming-chan=stretching,Toys, huh?  Yeah, I can see you poor single women resorting to them without a girlfriend around.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:streaming-chan=teasing,A <i>toy</i>?  What, don't you Earth girls have pet men you summon to ravish you on command?
3-female_must_masturbate,target:streaming-chan=vain,Should've known Miss Media would use a toy--the most conspicuous way to get yourself off, besides enlisting a partner.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:felicia=teasing,Wow, you weren't kidding!  Come on, honey, what were you thinking?  Couldn't stuff yourself into an overcoat?
3-female_must_masturbate,target:felicia=laughing,Well, you sure made this easy, honey.  That's what you get for showing up naked.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:felicia=stretching,Not much of a tease, are you?  Just up and arriving naked to start with.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:felicia=laughing,I thought you had clothes to start with, however skimpy, but no.  You were actually naked this whole time.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:vriska=smug,Oh, what's the big deal?  Masturbating in front of us would be less embarrassing than the state you're in now.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:vriska=interested,Dealer, doesn't this count as naked?  Hasn't she lost now?  Come on.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:vriska=interested,Come <i>on</i>, Vriska.  You're naked.  You lost.  It's OK.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:vriska=laughing,Everyone loses eventually, sweetie.  Even cheaters with speech impediments.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:nagisa=laughing,You're putting on a <i>performance</i> for us?  Isn't that what the masturbation is anyway?
3-female_must_masturbate,target:nagisa=teasing,Hey, honey--if you want to put on a play, play with <i>yourself</i>.  That's what we all came here for.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:nagisa=smug,Yeah, Mejare has some plays I know of.  Mostly about men eating a poor helpless woman, then getting gutted themselves.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:nagisa=vain,A play, huh?  Let's see if it's more riveting than the man-killing, rough-and-tumble world of Mejarian theater.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:nagisa=smug,Oh, you're doing a play?  I was never big on theater myself--my own life as a pilot is far more interesting, after all.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:misato=teasing,Sure you've still got the coordination to <i>find</i> you vagina, Boozeball?  Either way, this'll be entertaining.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:misato=laughing,I think this works out perfectly.  Either you manage to masturbate and it's sexy, or you fall over and it's funny.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:misato=vain,Have fun pawing at both your vaginas, Miss Doublevision.  You look like you're going to fall asleep any minute now.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:misato=teasing,Sorry I couldn't drink too much with you, but I'm in enemy territory, after all.  Now have fun trying to find your vagina, Blurry-eyes.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:aimee=teasing,Now if you could masturbate with the <i>bullets</i>, that'd <i>really</i> impress me.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:aimee=smug,Surely she doesn't have to do it, right?  I mean, she already came earlier.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:aimee=interested,We'd better find some cover, considering how she made herself cum <i>last</i> time.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:aimee=teasing,Well, <i>this</i> is a predicament.  Or is your aim good enough to <i>juuust</i> graze yourself to orgasm?
3-female_must_masturbate,target:meia,alsoPlaying:kyu=vain,Hey, <i>I'm</i> fun.  Meia barely knows what "fun" means.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:meia,alsoPlaying:kyu=stretching,Hey, don't give Meia any credit for all the fun <i>I'm</i> bringing.  Her job is to stand there and look miserable.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:meia,alsoPlaying:kyu=teasing,It's a hard life being a pirate, Miss Pixie!  So I try to make it fun for myself, while Meia is content is live in misery.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:meia,alsoPlaying:kyu=vain,It's nice to be appreciated for lighting up a room the way I do.  I have to work extra hard when Meia's killing the mood nearby.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=smug,Oh, <i>God</i>.  Miss Busybee has to masturbate now?  We're going to drown in her tears.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=laughing,Should we really make her do this?  She's so scared of her own body, she'll run in circles.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=vain,Maybe I'd have some sympathy if you had a body to be ashamed of.  As it stands, this embarrassment is an insult to poor ugly girls.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=interested,Do we really want to make her do this?  She's <i>already</i> a blubbering mess, and she's just standing around naked.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=stretching,Get the cleanup crew ready.  If this girl hasn't peed herself yet, she's going to do it now.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=stretching,<i>God</i>, Earth girls grow up soft.  Fighting men all your life really toughens you up!
3-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=stretching,Look, Florina masturbating is bad for everyone here.  She cries, and she annoys <i>us</i> in the process.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=teasing,I'm tempted to plant a big smooch right on your mouth, dear.  That'll shock you right out of your embarrassment!
3-female_must_masturbate,target:moon=frustrated,Great.  Yeah.  Masturbate instead of seeking medical attention.  See if <i>I</i> care.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:moon=bored,...Sometimes I wonder why I like teasing people so much.  Maybe it's just to prove I can toe the line others can't.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:moon=frustrated,Some people you just can't help.  Or even talk to.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:moon=annoyed,What a shock.  Yeah, have fun.  Whatever.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:meia,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0,priority:1001=laughing,Ouch.  Well, I didn't think you'd find out this way...<i>but I'm glad you are</i>.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:meia,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0,priority:1001=teasing,Just a harmless prank.  Or it was, until you went and lost first.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:meia,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0,priority:1001=laughing,If you'd like to admit this game is just luck, now's the time.  It's the only face you have left to save.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:meia,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0,priority:1001=laughing,Do you have an issue with my harmless little prank, Meia?  How petty of you.
3-female_must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:meia,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0,priority:1001=smug,As if you would have come had I mentioned that.
3-female_must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:meia,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0,priority:1001=laughing,Had to get you here somehow!  I'm not above a few lies of omission.
3-female_must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:meia,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0,priority:1001=vain,Oh, come on, just a little white lie.  Barnette hears them all the time, and we still love each other.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:sei=laughing,That last drink was the dagger, huh?  Maybe you would've held up otherwise.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:sei=interested,Looks like that last drink was the one that blurred out all the numbers on the cards.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:sei=teasing,All you've got, eh, dearie?  Did the alcohol finally reach your brain and short out your poker face?
3-female_must_masturbate,target:sei=vain,A noble effort, made all the more tragic in how you just kept shooting yourself in the foot with that booze.  Now get to the good stuff.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:sei=seductive,You're a horny little blue ball of booze, aren't you?  You sound like you've been waiting for this--drunks aren't exactly subtle.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:meia=laughing,Well, hey.  At least you weren't the first to lose--imagine learning about the masturbation rule <i>that</i> way!
3-female_must_masturbate,target:meia=smug,You hung around, but it seems you've left the second-in-command in finish the job.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:meia=teasing,Should I consider this a promotion to squadron leader?  Seems I've surpassed you.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:meia=vain,I'm disappointed, Meia.  I even have some small things left!
3-female_must_masturbate,target:morrigan=bored,<i>Now how does a succubus do it</i>--oh.  She gets help.  Makes sense.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:morrigan=shocked,<i>Eeep  W-where'd she come from?  Help</i>!
3-female_must_masturbate,target:morrigan=shocked,Who's "Lilith"?  Wait, where'd <i>she</i> come from?  Help!  No!
3-female_must_masturbate,target:morrigan=stretching,Oh, you brought a friend to help?  Just like a succubus...then again, I should've brought Barnette.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:rainbow_mika=laughing,What now, Miss Wrestler?  Is your partner going to help you <i>masturbate</i>, too?
3-female_must_masturbate,target:rainbow_mika=teasing,Well, there's only one thing that girl can help you with now, honey.  If you're up to task, of course.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:rainbow_mika=teasing,Is your partner going all the way with "assisting" you?  Because that would make this Mejarian feel right at home.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:rainbow_mika=vain,Well, you should know the drill, dear.  Or will you invite your partner along for <i>this</i>, too?
3-female_start_masturbating=smug,Good luck with that, ~name~.
3-female_start_masturbating=laughing,Don't let me distract you.  At least I still have my dress on.
3-female_start_masturbating=interested,That's how an Earth girl does it, huh?  A little inelegant.
3-female_start_masturbating=vain,Meia certainly wouldn't back down from this.  I swear she thinks we wouldn't respect her if she wasn't constantly dead-serious.
3-female_start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,Good luck with that, ~name~.
3-female_start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,Don't let me distract you.  At least I still have my dress on.
3-female_start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia=interested,That's how an Earth girl does it, huh?  A little inelegant.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:nagisa=teasing,Well, here we go.  Take me on a thrilling, dramatic adventure...shy little sheltered Earth girl.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:nagisa=vain,This had better be more thrilling than what I do every day, you know.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:nagisa=teasing,Hey, coming here was like an anatomy and culture lesson already.  This story better be crazy!
3-female_start_masturbating,target:nagisa=vain,I crave drama, you know...that's why I'm a ruthless pirate and cunning pilot.  So don't let me down with this story.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:moon=sad,I'm honestly rethinking my entire life.  You're like a prophetic angel.  I shouldn't come to these sorts of places.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:moon=frustrated,Are you an apparition sent to punish me for being curious about men?
3-female_start_masturbating,target:moon=sad,You don't have to whore yourself out for money.  Just come to Mejare...you'll make excellent anti-men propaganda.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:moon=bored,For the first time in my life, I'm regretting a decision.  Coming here was a bad idea.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=shocked,<i>Wait, I was kidding!  Ack</i>!
3-female_start_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=shocked,<i>Wait, I wasn't serious!  Don't!  You'll kill us</i>!
3-female_start_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=awkward,<i>...I wasn't being serious.  Please don't catch anyone in the crossfire</i>.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=shocked,<i>Eek!  I said she should help you, not wrestle you</i>!
3-female_start_masturbating,target:joey=seductive,Oh, my!  That's the biggest vibrator I've ever seen--I guess there's a lot more room on Earth!
3-female_start_masturbating,target:joey=interested,Is this just a clown thing where everything is comically large?  Or more of a general Earth style?
3-female_start_masturbating,target:joey=vain,A vibrator?  And my, it's enormous--and shaped like men's tubes!  All I need are Barnette's lovely fingers, not these massive toys.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:joey=vain,My, such <i>girth</i> on that thing!  Is this men's influence?  Because Mejare's toys are rather inconspicuous.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=laughing,<i>Ooh</i>.  Should've known a magical woman dressed in all scarlet would pull something like this...I think I'm good.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=teasing,That's...quite a lot of hands.  More than I think I could keep track of...<i>but that's half the fun</i>.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=vain,Not sure I like being tied up and fondled, dear...well, maybe with the right person.  A certain green-haired cutie, specifically.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=vain,To each her own, I suppose...that level of vulnerability is for Barnette's eyes only, as far as I'm concerned.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,OK.  Yes.  This is happening now.  Elizabeth is capable of this.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,Neat powers, Elizabeth.  Real...real <i>Mejarian</i>.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,Who...who <i>are</i> you?  Which one is Elizabeth?
3-female_start_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,I--I thought you were just a sweet little Earth girl!  Who are you?
3-female_start_masturbating,target:meia=vain,How embarrassing for both of us.  Where does you mind go, Meia?  Can you imagine being wrapped in the heavenly warmth of a thousand million stars?
3-female_start_masturbating,target:meia=interested,I'm not sure I ever wanted to see this side of you.  Maybe I should have come alone.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:meia=seductive,This all too much for me to bear, Meia!  We should stay professional.  Want me to avert my eyes?
3-female_start_masturbating,target:meia=vain,Oh, to see my poor, sweet Leader reduced to this!  I'm so ashamed.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:amalia=awkward,...Oh.  OK.  Well, way to prove me wrong right away.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:amalia=shocked,Uh...<i>what are you doing?  I was just teasing</i>!
3-female_start_masturbating,target:amalia=shocked,...I was just kidding around!  It was a joke!  You don't have to...uh...
3-female_start_masturbating,target:amalia=awkward,...Or you could go ahead and actually be an exhibitionist.  That works too, I guess.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:felicia=shocked,<i>Gah</i>!  W-where'd you keep that thing?  It's enormous...and phallic!
3-female_start_masturbating,target:felicia=laughing,A <i>vibrator</i>?  Never seen one shaped like that...must be like a man's tube.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:felicia=smug,Figures Earth women would even have <i>toys</i> shaped like men's things.  Can't you be independent?
3-female_start_masturbating,target:felicia=vain,Oh, of course.  I should've known any toys on this planet would resemble men's tubes.  You Earth girls are hopeless.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:vriska=shocked,Wha--you--<i>oh dear</i>.  Maybe we <i>should</i> let her keep playing.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:vriska=shocked,...I take it back.  Let her keep playing, Dealer.  Let her leave, actually.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:vriska=awkward,...Oh my.  That die <i>really</i> hates you.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:vriska=bored,...This is getting too weird for me.  Earth is a strange planet.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:alpha=shocked,...OK.  Yeah.  I'm starting to believe you about this <i>virtual</i> business.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:alpha=awkward,That's...new.  Nice color shift.  Glad I could see you become a real woman.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:alpha=shocked,<i>Eek</i>!  I-I mean, uh, great skin tone there, Alpha.  Much more natural.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:alpha=awkward,...Well, it worked.  I shouldn't have doubted you...but I still don't understand you.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:florina=seductive,Oh look, she's going to sing to make herself feel better!  That's...actually kind of sweet.  I think I like you, darling!
3-female_start_masturbating,target:florina=seductive,Ooh, a song?  Sorry I made fun--I <i>love</i> music!  Go for it, cutie.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:florina=teasing,Yeah, I try to make Barnette sing, too.  But that's by accident...and the tune's all over the place.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:florina=excited,You are just so <i>unbearably</i> cute.  Now you're <i>singing</i>?  I just want to squeeze you!
3-female_start_masturbating,target:videl=excited,Wow, you <i>are</i> flying!  I'm so much taller, it was hard to tell--<i>how're you doing that</i>?
3-female_start_masturbating,target:videl=seductive,Hard to be sure in crazy places like this, but you've been flying this whole time, Videl!  I should've noticed!
3-female_start_masturbating,target:videl=excited,Videl!  Videl!  Omigosh, can you teach me how to fly?  I don't see any wings, so that means I can learn, right?
3-female_start_masturbating,target:videl=vain,Can you show me how to fly, Videl?  That'd make the most talented woman alive in addition to the most beautiful!
3-female_start_masturbating,target:aimee=shocked,O-oh, you're--using the gun.  ...Maybe you should unload it first?
3-female_start_masturbating,target:aimee=shocked,...OK, I call Barnette a gun nut, but she doesn't go <i>that</i> far.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:aimee=awkward,...Barnette has some toys shaped like guns.  Just for fun, you know?  But...the <i>real thing</i>?
3-female_start_masturbating,target:aimee=awkward,...I really thought you were cool, but now I'm worried.  Isn't that kind of dangerous?
3-female_start_masturbating,target:morrigan=vain,<i>Oh, my</i>!  Just like me and Barnette...except we can't fly.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:morrigan=laughing,Maybe Barnette and I would try that position if one of us had wings.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:morrigan=seductive,You're certainly proving yourself to be every bit the succubus you claim to be, dear.  I'm falling under <i>both</i> your spells!
3-female_start_masturbating,target:morrigan=teasing,Well, Miss Succubus, the addition of this "Lilith" is making me feel right at home.  That's how Mejarians have sex--mostly.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:hermione=laughing,<i>Oh, my</i>!  That's <i>one</i> way to use magic, you little skank!  But I understand.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:hermione=interested,Well, dear, you're not fooling anyone with the good-girl act now.  That's way too many hands to be wholesome.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:hermione=vain,Now <i>that</i> looks pretty magical.  Suddenly my two-handed approach with Barnette seems inadequate.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:hermione=teasing,<i>My, my, my</i>!  Miss Witch knows what she wants, alright.  And she's not afraid to magic her way there.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=laughing,Barnette's got a few toys...which have helped give us some perspective on men's tubes.  But not <i>quite</i> that big.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=teasing,Toys are hard to come by on Mejare, you know...they're symbols of men.  Unless you're a pirate, where you get your pick.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=stretching,I can't believe you carry that unwieldy thing around.  Earth women can't go five minutes without something phallic!
3-female_start_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=vain,Such ridiculous things...Barnette's lovely fingers are all I need to be happy.  And maybe her gun-shaped toys.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:aella=interested,You've <i>never</i> masturbated, huh?  Locked away in a house all your life and your hands never wandered south of the border?
3-female_start_masturbating,target:aella=teasing,What are you, a robot?  <i>Everyone</i> masturbates, dearie...unless you're <i>that</i> popular with the girls.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:aella=stretching,Yeah, you've never masturbated.  <i>Mm-hm</i>.  And I've never taken a bath.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:aella=smug,Oh, give me a break, honey.  Sex I can see people shying away from, but never <i>masturbating</i>?  Does your heart not beat?
3-female_start_masturbating,target:aella=interested,Ooh, Miss Big-Boned over here has never masturbated.  That's why you came to a public strip poker game, right?
3-female_start_masturbating,target:aella=teasing,Never masturbated, huh?  You must think you're better than the rest of us, Miss Chastity.  Well, <i>you're missing out</i>.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:shego=interested,Legs getting tired, dear?  Or are you afraid we won't see enough of you on the floor?
3-female_start_masturbating,target:shego=laughing,Seems Miss Lean-and-Green's butt is a little too delicate for the cold floor...or maybe she's just a total exhibitionist.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:shego=seductive,Aww, does the poor bodysuited villain not like how cold the floor is on her little backside?  Take a chair and show off, then.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:shego=teasing,Yeah, standing all this time is a little grating.  But hey, you could hide a little more if you sat on the floor...maybe.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu=smug,And now Miss Pixie takes to the air to masturbate?  I don't know what I expected out of you.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu=teasing,I should've expected you to use those wings at some point, Miss Fairytale.  Now give me a good view.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu=laughing,I'd call you a skank for flying up and presenting to us, but I think you'd relish that.  So have your fun.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu=seductive,You're a little crazy, Miss Pixie, but you certainly put the effort in.  Check out that fairy flight!
3-female_masturbating=stretching,Pretty good stuff, I guess.
3-female_masturbating=interested,I think Earth girls' masturbation skills are lacking.  Too much sex with men, no doubt.
3-female_masturbating=teasing,Not to brag, but Mejarians are pretty skilled with their fingers.  We have to be.
3-female_masturbating=confused,So Earth women think about men when they do this, right?  Misty's from Pluto, and she sure knew how to woo Hibiki.
3-female_masturbating,target:meia=teasing,Don't forget I'm taken, boss.  Don't give me any hungry looks, or I might tell Barnette.
3-female_masturbating,target:meia=seductive,Want me to strip for you?  I'd hate for my squadron leader's mind to drift towards any nasty men lurking around...
3-female_masturbating,target:meia=interested,How do I know this isn't what you do when you hog the jacuzzi all to yourself, huh?  Taking advantage of our deference?
3-female_masturbating,target:meia=stretching,Color me unimpressed.  I expected something bombastic from my very own boss, but Barnette's better with her fingers.
3-female_masturbating,target:vriska=confused,You, uh, holding up over there, Vriska?  Wriggling free sometime soon?
3-female_masturbating,target:vriska=frustrated,...I'm just going to assume she's into this.  I really don't want to touch her.
3-female_masturbating,target:vriska=bored,...I think I would've preferred you <i>gaining</i> clothes, Vriska.
3-female_masturbating,target:vriska=bored,That magic was cool, but <i>yeesh</i>.  What a weirdo...
3-female_masturbating,target:uravity=vain,You're so rude, Ochako, to not share your levitation powers with everyone else.  I share my beauty!
3-female_masturbating,target:uravity=smug,Miss Gravity is certainly making the best use of her powers that <i>I</i> could think of.  Shame the rest of us can't join in.
3-female_masturbating,target:uravity=seductive,Are you <i>sure</i> you were born with these powers?  There isn't some crazy Earth doctor I can visit to fly, too?
3-female_masturbating,target:uravity=vain,Is there nothing crueler than showing off the powers the rest of us can't enjoy?  At least <i>I</i> can't hide how beautiful I am.
3-female_masturbating,target:videl=teasing,At least you're making this interesting, just bobbing up and down like that...<i>you're such a pervert</i>.
3-female_masturbating,target:videl=vain,Just gliding along, letting your instincts guide you...<i>oh, to be young again</i>!  Well, younger.
3-female_masturbating,target:videl=seductive,If only I could fly like you and make my beauty more fully visible.  Do you realize how lucky you are?
3-female_masturbating,target:videl=seductive,Videl, Videl, <i>Videl</i>!  You're a complete package, dear--cute, fit, adorable pigtails, and superpowers!
3-female_masturbating,target:shego=teasing,Hey, honey, I'm been talking dirty all game...no sense waiting till the end on <i>that</i> front.
3-female_masturbating,target:shego=laughing,Just listen to the things coming out of Green-bean's mouth!  She's trying to catch up to what I've been doing all evening.
3-female_masturbating,target:shego=teasing,Too bad I got such a head start on the dirty talk, because Shego's doing her best now to match me.
3-female_masturbating,target:shego=seductive,You've got a filthy mouth on you to match the green complexion.  Can't you be a sweetheart for once?
3-female_masturbating,target:rinkah=laughing,Did you just--you <i>did</i>!  You're such a beast of a woman, Rinkah...
3-female_masturbating,target:rinkah=laughing,Are you putting your finger where I think you are?  You've done nothing but confirm stereotypes all evening...you <i>animal</i>.
3-female_masturbating,target:rinkah=smug,I guess Miss Warrior is so tempered from all her harsh battles, she needs to stick fingers in her rear to feel anything.
3-female_masturbating,target:rinkah=teasing,I don't know what I expected from you, Miss Fireball, but a finger in the butt checks out.  Barnette and I would never be that dirty.
3-female_masturbating,target:moon=frustrated,Please don't look at me.  Please don't talk.  I'm very afraid.
3-female_masturbating,target:moon=frustrated,God, just let it end already...I'll go straight after this, I promise.
3-female_masturbating,target:moon=bored,Yes.  Cute.  Elegant.  You have the grace of those swans I see in zoos.
3-female_masturbating,target:moon=bored,Marvelous.  Having fun, Moon?  Good.  Glad, even.
3-female_masturbating,target:gwen=smug,...I can't really fault you for this.  If <i>I</i> had spider-web powers, I'd give that a try, too.
3-female_masturbating,target:gwen=teasing,I'm going to go ahead and guess this isn't <i>all</i> you use that webbing for...if you've got someone else with you.
3-female_masturbating,target:gwen=vain,That webbing looks like quite a bit of fun!  If only I could give it a try with Barnette.
3-female_masturbating,target:gwen=seductive,Hey, I like those angles you're pulling, cutie!  Go upside down again!
3-female_masturbating,target:kyu=seductive,Hey, Miss Love Fairy.  I know you've got wings, but share the magic a little!  <i>I</i> want to fly too, you know!
3-female_masturbating,target:kyu=vain,Now <i>this</i> is a good use of wings.  Who wants to sit on the nasty old ground to masturbate?
3-female_masturbating,target:kyu=interested,I like your style, Miss Pixie.  You were born with wings, and now you've found the perfect use for them.
3-female_masturbating,target:kyu=stretching,Yeah, I'd probably fly like that, too.  But <i>some</i> fairies just won't share their magic with the rest of us.
3-female_masturbating,target:marceline=confused,What exactly is letting you float like that?  You've been doing it all game, and it doesn't even look strenuous.
3-female_masturbating,target:marceline=seductive,You're inhuman in so many ways...no eyes, blue skin, floating.  But you sure masturbate like a normal girl.
3-female_masturbating,target:marceline=teasing,I guess you're pretty human after all, Eyeballs.  Just look at you floating there, having the time of your life!
3-female_masturbating,target:marceline=teasing,Going to perform any fancy tricks for us, Miss Levitator?  Masturbate upside down or something?
3-female_masturbating,target:amalia=excited,Omigosh, is that vine doing what men's tubes do?  It looks like it!  Show me more!
3-female_masturbating,target:amalia=awkward,...I was just ribbing you about being naughty.  I guess I was right...or I really got to you.
3-female_masturbating,target:amalia=excited,Ooh, show me more angles!  That's <i>so cool</i>...it's like a really long men's tube, right?  Right?
3-female_masturbating,target:amalia=laughing,You really <i>are</i> a little skank!  I should've known all princesses are like this, all sheltered and itching for adventure.
3-female_masturbating,target:amalia=laughing,Can't reach orgasm without a giant tube shoved inside of you, huh?  Glad I didn't grow up stuck with men for my sexual needs.
3-female_masturbating,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:8=teasing,I can't believe I met <i>two</i> women who can fly...and that both would use it for such <i>unsavory</i> reasons.  <i>Teach me</i>!
3-female_masturbating,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:8=vain,Two women showing off the goods in the air, and neither will bother to show me how!  <i>I</i> want to fly, too, you know.
3-female_masturbating,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:8=seductive,Hey, what's a beautiful woman got to do to get some flying lessons?  <i>I</i> want to join in on the airborne fun you two are having!
3-female_masturbating,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:8=vain,You damn Earthling teases are keeping secrets from me!  Can't a gorgeous girl like me learn to fly, too?  I learned to pilot!
3-female_masturbating,target:morrigan=teasing,I was hoping to learn something new here to surprise Barnette tomorrow evening...or maybe even when I get back.
3-female_masturbating,target:morrigan=vain,It's so comforting to see two women enjoying each others' bodies.  I thought Earth had never heard of such a thing!
3-female_masturbating,target:morrigan=stretching,Par for the course where I'm from, Morrigan--sorry it's not leaving an impact.  Well, Mejarians don't fly, but still.
3-female_masturbating,target:morrigan=vain,Hey, keep it up, Miss Succubus.  You're making my heart swell with memories of my darling Barnette--it's hard to be away from her!
3-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=teasing,<i>Hoo</i>.  Well, at least you seem like you're in control.  Have fun, girls!
3-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=seductive,Well, you're not killing anyone, so fine by me.  This is fun to watch!
3-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=teasing,Just stand a safe distance away...this <i>is</i> pretty sexy.
3-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=seductive,I <i>knew</i> you two were lovers!  Can't keep your hands off each other...or anything else.
3-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=vain,As long as you don't clothesline me, you can keep this up all you want, cuties.  Just watch those muscles ripple!
3-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=seductive,Barnette and I aren't as strong as you two, but maybe I should take notes anyway.
3-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=awkward,...I guess you don't need a girlfriend, do you?
3-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=awkward,...You know, I didn't peg you as the kind of girl who'd be open to this sort of thing.  Or that had superpowers.
3-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=awkward,You know, I've done that...with Barnette.  You know, <i>another</i> woman.  Not myself.
3-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=thinking,Now I'm curious how good a clone of me would be at this sort of thing...
3-female_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=interested,Holding up, dear?  You seem a little incapable of saying the safe word.
3-female_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=stretching,I guess when you've got superpowers at your disposal, you need to feel unsafe for once to be excited.
3-female_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=laughing,See, this is why I don't want magic.  <i>This</i> is the kind of thing I'd need to get a thrill again.
3-female_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=laughing,Hanging in there, Miss Bloodred?  Any tighter and it won't just be your outfit that's scarlet.
3-female_masturbating,target:aimee=awkward,I'm...kind of worried about you, Aimee.  Is there something we should know about men's guns?
3-female_masturbating,target:aimee=bored,I'd definitely give Barnette an intervention if she started masturbating with loaded guns.
3-female_masturbating,target:aimee=smug,That thing is gonna make a bigger racket than even <i>you</i> are.
3-female_masturbating,target:aimee=awkward,This is getting way too weird for me, Aimee.  The clothes thing was cool, but <i>this</i>?  It's a death wish!
3-female_finished_masturbating=seductive,Well, Earth girls can certainly <i>finish</i> like a Mejarian.
3-female_finished_masturbating=confused,Would sex with a man have been any better for you?  Or do you just use them to breed?
3-female_finished_masturbating=vain,That's the kind of explosiveness only my sweet Barnette can help me reach.
3-female_finished_masturbating=teasing,Perhaps there's hope for Earth girls after all.  If you want an even better time, give me a call.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:launch=seductive,Ooh, the blue one again!  If you weren't so unstable, I'd invite you back for a drink, cutie.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:launch=vain,Oh, thank God, the blue one's back.  Good to see a woman who's polite and sincere in my line of work!
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:launch=interested,Just in time.  I wasn't looking forward to hearing your counterpart bellyache about losing.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:launch=teasing,Just the hair color I wanted to see!  You're so much nicer to be around, even if you're kind of a doormat.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,...That ended as quickly as it began.  What <i>was</i> that?
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,You don't even seem bothered!  W-why didn't you say you could do stuff like that?
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:elizabeth=awkward,...And this sort of thing just comes naturally to you?  Didn't bat an eye?
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,OK.  Yes.  It's over now, apparently.  Very enlightening, Elizabeth.  Never judge by appearances.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:morrigan=seductive,What, she's leaving?  Stay a while!  We can talk about woman relationships together!
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:morrigan=seductive,Hey, don't leave so soon, dear!  You're a steal yourself--I can tell you more about more girlfriend!
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:morrigan=seductive,Aww, don't leave, honey!  We just got to meet each other, and you spent it all underneath Morrigan's butt!
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:morrigan=vain,<i>Leave if you must.  I guess I'm not beautiful enough to warrant sticking around</i>.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:black_canary=angry,<i>Oooow</i>!  Hey, shut up, you freak!
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:black_canary=angry,<i>Ow</i>!  What was <i>that</i> for?  <i>Ugh</i>!
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:black_canary=angry,<i>Oooooow</i>!  Ooh, the <i>nerve</i> of some people!  Take your weird voice powers and beat it, freak!
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:black_canary=annoyed,<i>AM I TALKING TOO LOUD?  I THINK I JUST WENT DEAF</i>.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:meia=shocked,Explosive.  What did we just see, twenty years of sexual repression all coming out at once?
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:meia=laughing,Please tell me you weren't thinking of any men right there.  I expect better from the leader of our Dreads.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:meia=teasing,Pretty titillating.  Too bad I couldn't join you--I'm actually <i>good</i> at cards.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:meia=seductive,At least this proves you're nice and healthy.  Sometimes we worry you might be a too little wound-up.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:uravity=seductive,And she just plops down like a doofus!  You get cuter the longer I look at you, darling.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:uravity=laughing,Have a good time, Miss Gravity?  Seems like you lost control of your little floating maneuver.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:uravity=teasing,I think you might be the most adorable girl I've ever met, from stuffing your figure into that suit to just plopping on the ground.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:uravity=laughing,Ha!  I guess you really <i>have</i> overcome your embarrassment, to just drop down like that.  Or maybe that was an accident.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=vain,I knew Earth girls could love each other the way we do.  Men are just so superfluous!
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=seductive,Talk about a Mejarian power couple.  You're stronger than the men I know anyway!
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=teasing,I like the idea of men just picking me up...but it seems like you two could do that anyway.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=vain,I guess Earth isn't so different from Mejare after all.  Two strong women in love!  ...Like me and Barnette.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:vriska=shocked,Wha--<i>ew!  W-what's all that blue stuff?  Don't get it on me!  It's gross</i>!
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:vriska=shocked,<i>Ack!  F-fluid!  B-blue fluid everywhere!  Is it poisonous</i>?
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:vriska=shocked,<i>Eeek!  V-Vriska!  What is this?  What did you do?  Why are you leaking blue stuff</i>?
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:vriska=shocked,<i>Ack!  K-keep that stuff away from me!  It's corrosive, isn't it?  M-magic corrosive blue fluid</i>!
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:moon=bored,Nice finish.  The white fluid really stands out against your blackened labia.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:moon=annoyed,Class act, these Earth girls.  Absolutely marvelous to behold.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:moon=annoyed,Would you believe I thought I was superior to Earth girls?  Moon here's shown me I have a long way to go.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:moon=bored,Perfect.  Yeah.  Mm-hm.  Glad you had fun.  See you next time.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:amalia=stretching,<i>And it just dumps you off, disgusted with your behavior</i>.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:amalia=smug,Earth women are so bestial, having sex with men and plants in equal measures.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:amalia=laughing,You ought to be ashamed of yourself, young lady!  Now go get your servant to clean you up!
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:amalia=vain,Looks like Little Miss Princess was just another dirty commoner, begging to be ravished and tossed aside.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:aimee=shocked,A-ah!  See?  I <i>told</i> you!
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:aimee=bored,...Yeah, <i>definitely</i> making sure Barnette doesn't go this far.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:aimee=bored,Guess we all knew that was coming, but I wanted to believe you'd pull it off.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:aimee=frustrated,...I think I prefer <i>Barnette's</i> level of gun-hobby.  As in, not shooting herself.

4-male_must_masturbate=teasing,Show me what I've won, ~name~!
4-male_must_masturbate=laughing,My, my.  Better hope someone gets me out of this dress quick, or you'll be left awfully frustrated.
4-male_must_masturbate=vain,And, as expected, the crafty Mejarian woman triumphed over the bumbling Earth man, and he was forced to spill seed in her honor.
4-male_must_masturbate=smug,Nothing I couldn't have predicted from the beginning.
4-male_must_masturbate,saidMarker:1v1=laughing,<i>Heeheeheehee</i>!  <i>I only had my dress left</i>!  You were <i>thiiiiiiiiis</i> close, but you blew it!
4-male_must_masturbate,saidMarker:1v1=vain,It would seem fate has given me the ultimate blessing--the dress stays on.  Well, then again, I wouldn't have minded taking it off...
4-male_must_masturbate,saidMarker:1v1=teasing,Tough break, ~name~.  Want me to remove the dress anyway?  Well, since you're so sweet--<i>nope</i>!
4-male_must_masturbate,saidMarker:1v1=interested,Well, that's do it.  But you can still jerk your tube to my cleavage, right?  Or are men so simple they need actual nipples?
4-male_must_masturbate,target:captain_america,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0=laughing,<i>Pfft</i>!  You didn't <i>know</i> that?  Some heroic man you are, not even knowing the rules of a silly game.
4-male_must_masturbate,target:captain_america,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0=laughing,That's some excellent situational awareness, dear.  Then again, I lied to Meia to make her believe the same thing.

4-male_must_masturbate,target:captain_america,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0=laughing,What, Mr. Goody-Two-Shoes didn't read the rulebook before he got here?  Come <i>on</i>.
4-male_must_masturbate,target:9s=smug,And now for the <i>ultimate</i> test of your humanity.  If he bleeds, he masturbates.
4-male_must_masturbate,target:9s=stretching,Well, time to cast aside your artificiality, honey.  Let's see if a fake man can outperform a real one!
4-male_must_masturbate,target:9s=vain,Don't feel bad if your fakeness makes this weird for you.  I don't have much frame of reference.
4-male_must_masturbate,target:9s=seductive,<i>Have fun, dear</i>!  Do you have to rev yourself up a bit, or are you actually like a real person in this regard?
4-male_must_masturbate,target:captain_falcon=teasing,Well, Mr. Shouts-a-minute, now you get to yell at us and have it actually be appropriate.  Go nuts.
4-male_must_masturbate,target:captain_falcon=laughing,You were shouting enough already, so I shudder to think at how noisy you'll be <i>now</i>.
4-male_must_masturbate,target:captain_falcon=stretching,Oh, good.  The man who already wouldn't shut up has to <i>masturbate</i> now.  Can't we just make him leave?
4-male_must_masturbate,target:captain_falcon=laughing,Well, I'll learn about men from this, but you might deafen me in the process.
4-male_must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:meia,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0,priority:1001=smug,<i>Must have slipped my mind</i>.  Oh, well, these things happen.  And it's a man--that's fascinating.

4-male_must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:meia,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0,priority:1001=interested,Look at it this way--you didn't lose first, and now you can see how men release their seed!  How cool is <i>that</i>?
4-male_start_masturbating=excited,Yeah, that's the stuff, ~name~.  Just like the book said.
4-male_start_masturbating=vain,I can't picture Meia with a man...she's too serious.  Now her and Valore, <i>they'd</i> make an adorable couple!
4-male_start_masturbating=seductive,I travel all over space, but <i>here's</i> a journey I don't know the destination of.
4-male_start_masturbating=teasing,I can't quite bring myself to bear the child of a man who couldn't even get my out of my dress in strip poker...but maybe your seed will change my mind.
4-male_start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia=excited,Yeah, that's the stuff, ~name~.  Just like the book said.
4-male_start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,I can't picture you with a man, Meia...you're too serious.  Now you and Valore, <i>you'd</i> make an adorable couple!

4-male_start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,I can't quite bring myself to bear the child of a man who couldn't even get my out of my dress in strip poker...but maybe your seed will change my mind.
4-male_start_masturbating,target:9s=laughing,What does an android think about, exactly?  Silicone breasts?  Mechanical hips?
4-male_start_masturbating,target:9s=interested,I'm quite curious what's going through your mind.  The exact optimal jerking speed, factoring in fuel efficiency?
4-male_start_masturbating,target:9s=seductive,Anyone on your mind, Little Dungeon Bot?  Someone at this table...or maybe your cute little "2B" partner?
4-male_start_masturbating,target:9s=vain,What gets a robot going, huh?  If I could make a <i>machine</i> like me, I'm officially the most gorgeous woman alive.
4-male_masturbating=teasing,This enough of a view for you, ~name~?
4-male_masturbating=awkward,So...how long do I have to keep teasing you?  This is hard work, you know.
4-male_masturbating=laughing,Want to see some more, ~name~?  Well...<i>get better at cards</i>!
4-male_masturbating=interested,Sure you're not about to just rub that thing right down to nothing?  That's the pace you're going at.
4-male_masturbating,target:9s=laughing,Hey, 9S.  You're thinking about how much you want to...well, you know.  Aren't you?
4-male_masturbating,target:9s=vain,I just can't get over the look on your face, honey.  A robot in ecstasy!  Marvelous.
4-male_masturbating,target:9s=thinking,Seriously, I'm wondering what a robot thinks about when he masturbates.  I can't even figure out <i>human</i> men.
4-male_masturbating,target:9s=thinking,It's hard to find this erotic when I'm confused about your gender <i>and</i> your mechanics.
4-male_finished_masturbating=angry,H-hey!  I was still teasing you!
4-male_finished_masturbating=angry,I didn't say stop!  Can't you men control yourselves?
4-male_finished_masturbating=shocked,A-ah!  I didn't tell you to spray it!
4-male_finished_masturbating=shocked,W-wait, my dress!  Don't get it on my dress!
4-male_finished_masturbating=angry,Hey, I was thinking about collecting some!  Now it's all dirty from the floor!
4-male_finished_masturbating,target:corrin_m=shocked,<i>Eeeeeek!  I knew men were monsters!  How dare you try to enter my womb</i>!
4-male_finished_masturbating,target:corrin_m=shocked,<i>Wait!  I take it all back!  I don't want man-beasts clawing at my breasts!  Stay away from my womb</i>!
4-male_finished_masturbating,target:corrin_m=bored,...I don't want talons anywhere near my cervix.  Earth women can have you for themselves.
4-male_finished_masturbating,target:corrin_m=shocked,<i>Wha--wha--a monster!  Stay back!  I have a girlfriend-and she has guns!  I don't need men</i>!

4-male_finished_masturbating,target:9s=angry,...Do you seriously not have any seed?  The one thing I was most interested in?
4-male_finished_masturbating,target:9s=bored,...Oh.  You're a machine, so you don't have the <i>semen</i> stuff.  Well, you're worthless to me, then.
4-male_finished_masturbating,target:9s=angry,Wha--w-where's all the seed?  I wanted to see men's <i>sperm</i> things!  Hey!
4-male_finished_masturbating,target:jin=shocked,<i>Eep</i>!  W-why's it glowing so much?  The book just said it was pearly, not <i>radioactive</i>!
4-male_finished_masturbating,target:jin=awkward,...Uh, did I miss a paragraph in the book?  Does men's sperm come out all lustrous and then fade?
4-male_finished_masturbating,target:jin=seductive,Oh, wow!  Does it really glow that much?  That looks like <i>I'd</i> glow if you came inside me.
4-male_finished_masturbating,target:jin=seductive,Wow, men's seed is even more glorious than I imagined!  You must pump your heart and soul into that stuff to make it shine like that!
4-female_must_masturbate=vain,Guess you aren't much good at poker.  Any better at <i>this</i>?
4-female_must_masturbate=teasing,Let's see how an Earth woman treats herself, ~name~.  I doubt better than a Mejarian.
4-female_must_masturbate=laughing,Meia doesn't know about the masturbation rule.  She's really gonna lay into me when we leave.
4-female_must_masturbate=smug,And Mejare takes the crown once again.  War produces some sharp citizens, it would seem.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:meia,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0,priority:1001=laughing,Ouch.  Well, I <i>did</i> expect better from my very own squadron leader.  Not my fault you blew it.

4-female_must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:meia,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0,priority:1001=laughing,What's the big deal?  Aren't you confident you'll win?
4-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=smug,Oh, <i>God</i>.  Miss Busybee has to masturbate now?  We're going to drown in her tears.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=laughing,Should we really make her do this?  She's so scared of her own body, she'll run in circles.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=vain,Maybe I'd have some sympathy if you had a body to be ashamed of.  As it stands, this embarrassment is an insult to poor ugly girls.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=interested,Do we really want to make her do this?  She's <i>already</i> a blubbering mess, and she's just standing around naked.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=stretching,Get the cleanup crew ready.  If this girl hasn't peed herself yet, she's going to do it now.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=stretching,<i>God</i>, Earth girls grow up soft.  Fighting men all your life really toughens you up!
4-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=stretching,Look, Florina masturbating is bad for everyone here.  She cries, and she annoys <i>us</i> in the process.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=teasing,I'm tempted to plant a big smooch right on your mouth, dear.  That'll shock you right out of your embarrassment!
4-female_must_masturbate,target:meia,alsoPlaying:kyu=vain,Hey, <i>I'm</i> fun.  Meia barely knows what "fun" means.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:meia,alsoPlaying:kyu=stretching,Hey, don't give Meia any credit for all the fun <i>I'm</i> bringing.  Her job is to stand there and look miserable.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:meia,alsoPlaying:kyu=teasing,It's a hard life being a pirate, Miss Pixie!  So I try to make it fun for myself, while Meia is content is live in misery.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:meia,alsoPlaying:kyu=vain,It's nice to be appreciated for lighting up a room the way I do.  I have to work extra hard when Meia's killing the mood nearby.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:aimee=teasing,Now if you could masturbate with the <i>bullets</i>, that'd <i>really</i> impress me.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:aimee=smug,Surely she doesn't have to do it, right?  I mean, she already came earlier.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:aimee=interested,We'd better find some cover, considering how she made herself cum <i>last</i> time.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:aimee=teasing,Well, <i>this</i> is a predicament.  Or is your aim good enough to <i>juuust</i> graze yourself to orgasm?
4-female_must_masturbate,target:moon=frustrated,Great.  Yeah.  Masturbate instead of seeking medical attention.  See if <i>I</i> care.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:moon=bored,...Sometimes I wonder why I like teasing people so much.  Maybe it's just to prove I can toe the line others can't.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:moon=frustrated,Some people you just can't help.  Or even talk to.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:moon=annoyed,What a shock.  Yeah, have fun.  Whatever.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:morrigan=bored,<i>Now how does a succubus do it</i>--oh.  She gets help.  Makes sense.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:morrigan=shocked,<i>Eeep  W-where'd she come from?  Help</i>!
4-female_must_masturbate,target:morrigan=shocked,Who's "Lilith"?  Wait, where'd <i>she</i> come from?  Help!  No!
4-female_must_masturbate,target:morrigan=stretching,Oh, you brought a friend to help?  Just like a succubus...then again, I should've brought Barnette.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:alpha,marker:planet-countries=confused,What's a <i>yoo-ess-bee</i>?  Something only Planet Japan has?
4-female_must_masturbate,target:alpha=thinking,"Yoo-ess-bees" make you real?  Do <i>I</i> have one without even knowing it?
4-female_must_masturbate,target:alpha=smug,Oh look, she's actually speaking instead of singing.  And even then, she's goin on about nonsense like "yoo-ess-bees."
4-female_must_masturbate,target:alpha=stretching,A "yoo-ess-bee"?  Sounds like some fancy gadget Parfet would understand.  Is Miss Popstar a secret genius?
4-female_must_masturbate,target:nagisa=laughing,You're putting on a <i>performance</i> for us?  Isn't that what the masturbation is anyway?
4-female_must_masturbate,target:nagisa=teasing,Hey, honey--if you want to put on a play, play with <i>yourself</i>.  That's what we all came here for.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:nagisa=smug,Yeah, Mejare has some plays I know of.  Mostly about men eating a poor helpless woman, then getting gutted themselves.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:nagisa=vain,A play, huh?  Let's see if it's more riveting than the man-killing, rough-and-tumble world of Mejarian theater.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:nagisa=smug,Oh, you're doing a play?  I was never big on theater myself--my own life as a pilot is far more interesting, after all.
4-female_must_masturbate,saidMarker:1v1=teasing,And my dress was <i>thiiiis</i> close to coming off.  But I guess you Earth women only care about <i>men</i> getting nude, right?
4-female_must_masturbate,saidMarker:1v1=vain,Well, that's that.  I know I'm clothed, but am I giving you any eye candy?  Or are Earth women fixated on men and their ridiculous mushroom-things?
4-female_must_masturbate,saidMarker:1v1=laughing,Don't keep me waiting, honey.  You don't mind the strange alien woman leering at you, right?  The one obsessed with other women?
4-female_must_masturbate,saidMarker:1v1=seductive,Don't let my lecherous stares distract you, ~name~...I <i>have</i> earned this, even if the idea of two women loving each other repulses you.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:elizabeth=shocked,It's been fun, Liz, but you--you--<i>there's more than one of you</i>.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:elizabeth=shocked,Well, Liz, it was nice getting to know--<i>both of you</i>.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:elizabeth=shocked,<i>Ack!  No!  The Harvest!  They're mulitplying!  Help</i>!
4-female_must_masturbate,target:elizabeth=shocked,...<i>What?  What's happening?  Elizabeth</i>?
4-female_must_masturbate,target:rainbow_mika=laughing,What now, Miss Wrestler?  Is your partner going to help you <i>masturbate</i>, too?
4-female_must_masturbate,target:rainbow_mika=teasing,Well, there's only one thing that girl can help you with now, honey.  If you're up to task, of course.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:rainbow_mika=teasing,Is your partner going all the way with "assisting" you?  Because that would make this Mejarian feel right at home.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:rainbow_mika=vain,Well, you should know the drill, dear.  Or will you invite your partner along for <i>this</i>, too?
4-female_must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,Guess you aren't much good at poker.  Any better at <i>this</i>?
4-female_must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Let's see how an Earth woman treats herself, ~name~.  I doubt better than a Mejarian.
4-female_must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,And Mejare takes the crown once again.  War produces some sharp citizens, it would seem.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:meia=laughing,Just couldn't hang with the best, could you, Meia?  Shame...look at all the skin I'm still covering!
4-female_must_masturbate,target:meia=teasing,So close to getting me naked, too.  Maybe I'll slip this off just to help out my poor Leader.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:meia=interested,Way to one-up me, Meia.  So close to me revealing my body, and you go and start masturbating.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:meia=vain,I still have my <i>whole dress</i>, Meia.  What a poor showing.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:sei=laughing,That last drink was the dagger, huh?  Maybe you would've held up otherwise.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:sei=interested,Looks like that last drink was the one that blurred out all the numbers on the cards.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:sei=teasing,All you've got, eh, dearie?  Did the alcohol finally reach your brain and short out your poker face?
4-female_must_masturbate,target:sei=vain,A noble effort, made all the more tragic in how you just kept shooting yourself in the foot with that booze.  Now get to the good stuff.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:sei=seductive,You're a horny little blue ball of booze, aren't you?  You sound like you've been waiting for this--drunks aren't exactly subtle.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:amalia=smug,I can only <i>dream</i> of how embarrassed you must be, dear.  There's no possible chance you're actually an exhibitionist.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:amalia=laughing,This must be <i>so</i> devastating.  Surely you don't get off on being watched like us lecherous commoners.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:amalia=stretching,Oh, woe is you!  A princess forced to exhibit her base desires like her lowly subjects.  No chance she's into it.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:amalia=teasing,Nobility, reduced to her primal instincts for an audience...it's a good thing you're so above it all.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:streaming-chan=laughing,What are you--oh.  <i>Oh</i>.  So you're <i>that</i> kind of woman...a toy woman.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:streaming-chan=stretching,Toys, huh?  Yeah, I can see you poor single women resorting to them without a girlfriend around.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:streaming-chan=teasing,A <i>toy</i>?  What, don't you Earth girls have pet men you summon to ravish you on command?
4-female_must_masturbate,target:streaming-chan=vain,Should've known Miss Media would use a toy--the most conspicuous way to get yourself off, besides enlisting a partner.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:vriska=smug,Oh, what's the big deal?  Masturbating in front of us would be less embarrassing than the state you're in now.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:vriska=interested,Dealer, doesn't this count as naked?  Hasn't she lost now?  Come on.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:vriska=interested,Come <i>on</i>, Vriska.  You're naked.  You lost.  It's OK.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:vriska=laughing,Everyone loses eventually, sweetie.  Even cheaters with speech impediments.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:misato=teasing,Sure you've still got the coordination to <i>find</i> you vagina, Boozeball?  Either way, this'll be entertaining.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:misato=laughing,I think this works out perfectly.  Either you manage to masturbate and it's sexy, or you fall over and it's funny.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:misato=vain,Have fun pawing at both your vaginas, Miss Doublevision.  You look like you're going to fall asleep any minute now.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:misato=teasing,Sorry I couldn't drink too much with you, but I'm in enemy territory, after all.  Now have fun trying to find your vagina, Blurry-eyes.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:felicia=teasing,Wow, you weren't kidding!  Come on, honey, what were you thinking?  Couldn't stuff yourself into an overcoat?
4-female_must_masturbate,target:felicia=laughing,Well, you sure made this easy, honey.  That's what you get for showing up naked.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:felicia=stretching,Not much of a tease, are you?  Just up and arriving naked to start with.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:felicia=laughing,I thought you had clothes to start with, however skimpy, but no.  You were actually naked this whole time.
4-female_start_masturbating=vain,Let's see how you stack up to Mejare's finest.  We're experts in this area, you know.
4-female_start_masturbating=vain,I'll always take form over function...except for my Vandread, which is an ugly crab thing.  But so <i>powerful</i>!
4-female_start_masturbating=stretching,I wonder if this is anything like how Misty does it.  Pluto's pretty close to Earth.
4-female_start_masturbating=vain,I bet Ezra's feeling cooped up, stuck with the baby and with no Oma around.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:vriska=shocked,Wha--you--<i>oh dear</i>.  Maybe we <i>should</i> let her keep playing.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:vriska=shocked,...I take it back.  Let her keep playing, Dealer.  Let her leave, actually.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:vriska=awkward,...Oh my.  That die <i>really</i> hates you.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:vriska=bored,...This is getting too weird for me.  Earth is a strange planet.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,OK.  Yes.  This is happening now.  Elizabeth is capable of this.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,Neat powers, Elizabeth.  Real...real <i>Mejarian</i>.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,Who...who <i>are</i> you?  Which one is Elizabeth?
4-female_start_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,I--I thought you were just a sweet little Earth girl!  Who are you?
4-female_start_masturbating,target:morrigan=vain,<i>Oh, my</i>!  Just like me and Barnette...except we can't fly.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:morrigan=laughing,Maybe Barnette and I would try that position if one of us had wings.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:morrigan=seductive,You're certainly proving yourself to be every bit the succubus you claim to be, dear.  I'm falling under <i>both</i> your spells!
4-female_start_masturbating,target:morrigan=teasing,Well, Miss Succubus, the addition of this "Lilith" is making me feel right at home.  That's how Mejarians have sex--mostly.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:florina=seductive,Oh look, she's going to sing to make herself feel better!  That's...actually kind of sweet.  I think I like you, darling!
4-female_start_masturbating,target:florina=seductive,Ooh, a song?  Sorry I made fun--I <i>love</i> music!  Go for it, cutie.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:florina=teasing,Yeah, I try to make Barnette sing, too.  But that's by accident...and the tune's all over the place.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:florina=excited,You are just so <i>unbearably</i> cute.  Now you're <i>singing</i>?  I just want to squeeze you!
4-female_start_masturbating,target:hermione=laughing,<i>Oh, my</i>!  That's <i>one</i> way to use magic, you little skank!  But I understand.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:hermione=interested,Well, dear, you're not fooling anyone with the good-girl act now.  That's way too many hands to be wholesome.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:hermione=vain,Now <i>that</i> looks pretty magical.  Suddenly my two-handed approach with Barnette seems inadequate.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:hermione=teasing,<i>My, my, my</i>!  Miss Witch knows what she wants, alright.  And she's not afraid to magic her way there.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=laughing,Barnette's got a few toys...which have helped give us some perspective on men's tubes.  But not <i>quite</i> that big.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=teasing,Toys are hard to come by on Mejare, you know...they're symbols of men.  Unless you're a pirate, where you get your pick.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=stretching,I can't believe you carry that unwieldy thing around.  Earth women can't go five minutes without something phallic!
4-female_start_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=vain,Such ridiculous things...Barnette's lovely fingers are all I need to be happy.  And maybe her gun-shaped toys.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:shego=interested,Legs getting tired, dear?  Or are you afraid we won't see enough of you on the floor?
4-female_start_masturbating,target:shego=laughing,Seems Miss Lean-and-Green's butt is a little too delicate for the cold floor...or maybe she's just a total exhibitionist.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:shego=seductive,Aww, does the poor bodysuited villain not like how cold the floor is on her little backside?  Take a chair and show off, then.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:shego=teasing,Yeah, standing all this time is a little grating.  But hey, you could hide a little more if you sat on the floor...maybe.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:joey=seductive,Oh, my!  That's the biggest vibrator I've ever seen--I guess there's a lot more room on Earth!
4-female_start_masturbating,target:joey=interested,Is this just a clown thing where everything is comically large?  Or more of a general Earth style?
4-female_start_masturbating,target:joey=vain,A vibrator?  And my, it's enormous--and shaped like men's tubes!  All I need are Barnette's lovely fingers, not these massive toys.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:joey=vain,My, such <i>girth</i> on that thing!  Is this men's influence?  Because Mejare's toys are rather inconspicuous.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=laughing,<i>Ooh</i>.  Should've known a magical woman dressed in all scarlet would pull something like this...I think I'm good.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=teasing,That's...quite a lot of hands.  More than I think I could keep track of...<i>but that's half the fun</i>.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=vain,Not sure I like being tied up and fondled, dear...well, maybe with the right person.  A certain green-haired cutie, specifically.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=vain,To each her own, I suppose...that level of vulnerability is for Barnette's eyes only, as far as I'm concerned.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu=smug,And now Miss Pixie takes to the air to masturbate?  I don't know what I expected out of you.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu=teasing,I should've expected you to use those wings at some point, Miss Fairytale.  Now give me a good view.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu=laughing,I'd call you a skank for flying up and presenting to us, but I think you'd relish that.  So have your fun.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu=seductive,You're a little crazy, Miss Pixie, but you certainly put the effort in.  Check out that fairy flight!
4-female_start_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=shocked,<i>Wait, I was kidding!  Ack</i>!
4-female_start_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=shocked,<i>Wait, I wasn't serious!  Don't!  You'll kill us</i>!
4-female_start_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=awkward,<i>...I wasn't being serious.  Please don't catch anyone in the crossfire</i>.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=shocked,<i>Eek!  I said she should help you, not wrestle you</i>!
4-female_start_masturbating,target:moon=sad,I'm honestly rethinking my entire life.  You're like a prophetic angel.  I shouldn't come to these sorts of places.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:moon=frustrated,Are you an apparition sent to punish me for being curious about men?
4-female_start_masturbating,target:moon=sad,You don't have to whore yourself out for money.  Just come to Mejare...you'll make excellent anti-men propaganda.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:moon=bored,For the first time in my life, I'm regretting a decision.  Coming here was a bad idea.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:nagisa=teasing,Well, here we go.  Take me on a thrilling, dramatic adventure...shy little sheltered Earth girl.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:nagisa=vain,This had better be more thrilling than what I do every day, you know.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:nagisa=teasing,Hey, coming here was like an anatomy and culture lesson already.  This story better be crazy!
4-female_start_masturbating,target:nagisa=vain,I crave drama, you know...that's why I'm a ruthless pirate and cunning pilot.  So don't let me down with this story.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:videl=excited,Wow, you <i>are</i> flying!  I'm so much taller, it was hard to tell--<i>how're you doing that</i>?
4-female_start_masturbating,target:videl=seductive,Hard to be sure in crazy places like this, but you've been flying this whole time, Videl!  I should've noticed!
4-female_start_masturbating,target:videl=excited,Videl!  Videl!  Omigosh, can you teach me how to fly?  I don't see any wings, so that means I can learn, right?
4-female_start_masturbating,target:videl=vain,Can you show me how to fly, Videl?  That'd make the most talented woman alive in addition to the most beautiful!
4-female_start_masturbating,target:meia=teasing,You don't fool me.  There's a part of you that <i>loves</i> this attention.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:meia=laughing,Don't crowd around her, folks.  Meia can get a little shy...or maybe you're <i>loving</i> this.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:meia=vain,You're still comfortable like this, right?  Would you be more or less so if <i>I</i> were naked, too?
4-female_start_masturbating,target:meia=teasing,What a tease.  You act all stoic, but this is <i>thrilling</i> you, isn't it?
4-female_start_masturbating,target:meia=stretching,Yeah, yeah, go enjoy yourself while your crewmate gets left behind, stuck in her dress.  Some leader <i>you</i> are.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:felicia=shocked,<i>Gah</i>!  W-where'd you keep that thing?  It's enormous...and phallic!
4-female_start_masturbating,target:felicia=laughing,A <i>vibrator</i>?  Never seen one shaped like that...must be like a man's tube.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:felicia=smug,Figures Earth women would even have <i>toys</i> shaped like men's things.  Can't you be independent?
4-female_start_masturbating,target:felicia=vain,Oh, of course.  I should've known any toys on this planet would resemble men's tubes.  You Earth girls are hopeless.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:aella=interested,You've <i>never</i> masturbated, huh?  Locked away in a house all your life and your hands never wandered south of the border?
4-female_start_masturbating,target:aella=teasing,What are you, a robot?  <i>Everyone</i> masturbates, dearie...unless you're <i>that</i> popular with the girls.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:aella=stretching,Yeah, you've never masturbated.  <i>Mm-hm</i>.  And I've never taken a bath.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:aella=smug,Oh, give me a break, honey.  Sex I can see people shying away from, but never <i>masturbating</i>?  Does your heart not beat?
4-female_start_masturbating,target:aella=interested,Ooh, Miss Big-Boned over here has never masturbated.  That's why you came to a public strip poker game, right?
4-female_start_masturbating,target:aella=teasing,Never masturbated, huh?  You must think you're better than the rest of us, Miss Chastity.  Well, <i>you're missing out</i>.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:amalia=awkward,...Oh.  OK.  Well, way to prove me wrong right away.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:amalia=shocked,Uh...<i>what are you doing?  I was just teasing</i>!
4-female_start_masturbating,target:amalia=shocked,...I was just kidding around!  It was a joke!  You don't have to...uh...
4-female_start_masturbating,target:amalia=awkward,...Or you could go ahead and actually be an exhibitionist.  That works too, I guess.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:aimee=shocked,O-oh, you're--using the gun.  ...Maybe you should unload it first?
4-female_start_masturbating,target:aimee=shocked,...OK, I call Barnette a gun nut, but she doesn't go <i>that</i> far.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:aimee=awkward,...Barnette has some toys shaped like guns.  Just for fun, you know?  But...the <i>real thing</i>?
4-female_start_masturbating,target:aimee=awkward,...I really thought you were cool, but now I'm worried.  Isn't that kind of dangerous?
4-female_start_masturbating,target:alpha=shocked,...OK.  Yeah.  I'm starting to believe you about this <i>virtual</i> business.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:alpha=awkward,That's...new.  Nice color shift.  Glad I could see you become a real woman.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:alpha=shocked,<i>Eek</i>!  I-I mean, uh, great skin tone there, Alpha.  Much more natural.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:alpha=awkward,...Well, it worked.  I shouldn't have doubted you...but I still don't understand you.
4-female_masturbating=teasing,Take it easy, ~name~.  Let me tease you a little.
4-female_masturbating=seductive,I grew up on a planet of all women, ~name~...so, you know, this doesn't exactly bother me.
4-female_masturbating=seductive,Just relax, ~name~, and let the vastness of the universe overtake you...
4-female_masturbating=teasing,Concentrate, ~name~...imagine yourself buried in my chest.  <i>Drowning</i> in fleshy goodness.
4-female_masturbating,target:vriska=confused,You, uh, holding up over there, Vriska?  Wriggling free sometime soon?
4-female_masturbating,target:vriska=frustrated,...I'm just going to assume she's into this.  I really don't want to touch her.
4-female_masturbating,target:vriska=bored,...I think I would've preferred you <i>gaining</i> clothes, Vriska.
4-female_masturbating,target:vriska=bored,That magic was cool, but <i>yeesh</i>.  What a weirdo...
4-female_masturbating,target:gwen=smug,...I can't really fault you for this.  If <i>I</i> had spider-web powers, I'd give that a try, too.
4-female_masturbating,target:gwen=teasing,I'm going to go ahead and guess this isn't <i>all</i> you use that webbing for...if you've got someone else with you.
4-female_masturbating,target:gwen=vain,That webbing looks like quite a bit of fun!  If only I could give it a try with Barnette.
4-female_masturbating,target:gwen=seductive,Hey, I like those angles you're pulling, cutie!  Go upside down again!
4-female_masturbating,target:kyu=seductive,Hey, Miss Love Fairy.  I know you've got wings, but share the magic a little!  <i>I</i> want to fly too, you know!
4-female_masturbating,target:kyu=vain,Now <i>this</i> is a good use of wings.  Who wants to sit on the nasty old ground to masturbate?
4-female_masturbating,target:kyu=interested,I like your style, Miss Pixie.  You were born with wings, and now you've found the perfect use for them.
4-female_masturbating,target:kyu=stretching,Yeah, I'd probably fly like that, too.  But <i>some</i> fairies just won't share their magic with the rest of us.
4-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=awkward,...I guess you don't need a girlfriend, do you?
4-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=awkward,...You know, I didn't peg you as the kind of girl who'd be open to this sort of thing.  Or that had superpowers.
4-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=awkward,You know, I've done that...with Barnette.  You know, <i>another</i> woman.  Not myself.
4-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=thinking,Now I'm curious how good a clone of me would be at this sort of thing...
4-female_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=interested,Holding up, dear?  You seem a little incapable of saying the safe word.
4-female_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=stretching,I guess when you've got superpowers at your disposal, you need to feel unsafe for once to be excited.
4-female_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=laughing,See, this is why I don't want magic.  <i>This</i> is the kind of thing I'd need to get a thrill again.
4-female_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=laughing,Hanging in there, Miss Bloodred?  Any tighter and it won't just be your outfit that's scarlet.
4-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=teasing,<i>Hoo</i>.  Well, at least you seem like you're in control.  Have fun, girls!
4-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=seductive,Well, you're not killing anyone, so fine by me.  This is fun to watch!
4-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=teasing,Just stand a safe distance away...this <i>is</i> pretty sexy.
4-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=seductive,I <i>knew</i> you two were lovers!  Can't keep your hands off each other...or anything else.
4-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=vain,As long as you don't clothesline me, you can keep this up all you want, cuties.  Just watch those muscles ripple!
4-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=seductive,Barnette and I aren't as strong as you two, but maybe I should take notes anyway.
4-female_masturbating,target:shego=teasing,Hey, honey, I'm been talking dirty all game...no sense waiting till the end on <i>that</i> front.
4-female_masturbating,target:shego=laughing,Just listen to the things coming out of Green-bean's mouth!  She's trying to catch up to what I've been doing all evening.
4-female_masturbating,target:shego=teasing,Too bad I got such a head start on the dirty talk, because Shego's doing her best now to match me.
4-female_masturbating,target:shego=seductive,You've got a filthy mouth on you to match the green complexion.  Can't you be a sweetheart for once?
4-female_masturbating,target:amalia=excited,Omigosh, is that vine doing what men's tubes do?  It looks like it!  Show me more!
4-female_masturbating,target:amalia=awkward,...I was just ribbing you about being naughty.  I guess I was right...or I really got to you.
4-female_masturbating,target:amalia=excited,Ooh, show me more angles!  That's <i>so cool</i>...it's like a really long men's tube, right?  Right?
4-female_masturbating,target:amalia=laughing,You really <i>are</i> a little skank!  I should've known all princesses are like this, all sheltered and itching for adventure.
4-female_masturbating,target:amalia=laughing,Can't reach orgasm without a giant tube shoved inside of you, huh?  Glad I didn't grow up stuck with men for my sexual needs.
4-female_masturbating,target:marceline=confused,What exactly is letting you float like that?  You've been doing it all game, and it doesn't even look strenuous.
4-female_masturbating,target:marceline=seductive,You're inhuman in so many ways...no eyes, blue skin, floating.  But you sure masturbate like a normal girl.
4-female_masturbating,target:marceline=teasing,I guess you're pretty human after all, Eyeballs.  Just look at you floating there, having the time of your life!
4-female_masturbating,target:marceline=teasing,Going to perform any fancy tricks for us, Miss Levitator?  Masturbate upside down or something?
4-female_masturbating,target:uravity=vain,You're so rude, Ochako, to not share your levitation powers with everyone else.  I share my beauty!
4-female_masturbating,target:uravity=smug,Miss Gravity is certainly making the best use of her powers that <i>I</i> could think of.  Shame the rest of us can't join in.
4-female_masturbating,target:uravity=seductive,Are you <i>sure</i> you were born with these powers?  There isn't some crazy Earth doctor I can visit to fly, too?
4-female_masturbating,target:uravity=vain,Is there nothing crueler than showing off the powers the rest of us can't enjoy?  At least <i>I</i> can't hide how beautiful I am.
4-female_masturbating,target:rinkah=laughing,Did you just--you <i>did</i>!  You're such a beast of a woman, Rinkah...
4-female_masturbating,target:rinkah=laughing,Are you putting your finger where I think you are?  You've done nothing but confirm stereotypes all evening...you <i>animal</i>.
4-female_masturbating,target:rinkah=smug,I guess Miss Warrior is so tempered from all her harsh battles, she needs to stick fingers in her rear to feel anything.
4-female_masturbating,target:rinkah=teasing,I don't know what I expected from you, Miss Fireball, but a finger in the butt checks out.  Barnette and I would never be that dirty.
4-female_masturbating,target:videl=teasing,At least you're making this interesting, just bobbing up and down like that...<i>you're such a pervert</i>.
4-female_masturbating,target:videl=vain,Just gliding along, letting your instincts guide you...<i>oh, to be young again</i>!  Well, younger.
4-female_masturbating,target:videl=seductive,If only I could fly like you and make my beauty more fully visible.  Do you realize how lucky you are?
4-female_masturbating,target:videl=seductive,Videl, Videl, <i>Videl</i>!  You're a complete package, dear--cute, fit, adorable pigtails, and superpowers!
4-female_masturbating,target:aimee=awkward,I'm...kind of worried about you, Aimee.  Is there something we should know about men's guns?
4-female_masturbating,target:aimee=bored,I'd definitely give Barnette an intervention if she started masturbating with loaded guns.
4-female_masturbating,target:aimee=smug,That thing is gonna make a bigger racket than even <i>you</i> are.
4-female_masturbating,target:aimee=awkward,This is getting way too weird for me, Aimee.  The clothes thing was cool, but <i>this</i>?  It's a death wish!
4-female_masturbating,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:8=teasing,I can't believe I met <i>two</i> women who can fly...and that both would use it for such <i>unsavory</i> reasons.  <i>Teach me</i>!
4-female_masturbating,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:8=vain,Two women showing off the goods in the air, and neither will bother to show me how!  <i>I</i> want to fly, too, you know.
4-female_masturbating,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:8=seductive,Hey, what's a beautiful woman got to do to get some flying lessons?  <i>I</i> want to join in on the airborne fun you two are having!
4-female_masturbating,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:8=vain,You damn Earthling teases are keeping secrets from me!  Can't a gorgeous girl like me learn to fly, too?  I learned to pilot!
4-female_masturbating,target:moon=frustrated,Please don't look at me.  Please don't talk.  I'm very afraid.
4-female_masturbating,target:moon=frustrated,God, just let it end already...I'll go straight after this, I promise.
4-female_masturbating,target:moon=bored,Yes.  Cute.  Elegant.  You have the grace of those swans I see in zoos.
4-female_masturbating,target:moon=bored,Marvelous.  Having fun, Moon?  Good.  Glad, even.
4-female_masturbating,target:morrigan=teasing,I was hoping to learn something new here to surprise Barnette tomorrow evening...or maybe even when I get back.
4-female_masturbating,target:morrigan=vain,It's so comforting to see two women enjoying each others' bodies.  I thought Earth had never heard of such a thing!
4-female_masturbating,target:morrigan=stretching,Par for the course where I'm from, Morrigan--sorry it's not leaving an impact.  Well, Mejarians don't fly, but still.
4-female_masturbating,target:morrigan=vain,Hey, keep it up, Miss Succubus.  You're making my heart swell with memories of my darling Barnette--it's hard to be away from her!
4-female_masturbating,target:meia=teasing,Watch where your eyes go, Meia...<i>Barnette won't be happy</i>!
4-female_masturbating,target:meia=laughing,Gotta be honest, boss...your hands look a little clumsy.
4-female_masturbating,target:meia=interested,You really need a girlfriend, Meia.  Your fingers are all over the place...
4-female_masturbating,target:meia=teasing,Sometimes a helper really helps you get the technique down.  Are you following me on this one?
4-female_masturbating,target:meia=interested,You really are just a big ball of repressed sexual energy.  If I weren't taken, I'd help you with that.
4-female_masturbating,target:meia=laughing,I wanted you to loosen up here, but maybe not <i>this</i> much.  You're loving this.
4-female_finished_masturbating=vain,Nothing like girls having fun together.
4-female_finished_masturbating=laughing,Try as I might to picture Meia's O-face, all that comes to mind is her same icy stare.
4-female_finished_masturbating=interested,See?  What do women even need men around for?  We understand each other so much better.
4-female_finished_masturbating=laughing,Sing like a space opera, ~name~.
4-female_finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=vain,Nothing like girls having fun together.
4-female_finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=laughing,Try as I might to picture your O-face, Meia, all that comes to mind is your same icy stare.
4-female_finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=interested,See?  What do women even need men around for?  We understand each other so much better.
4-female_finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=laughing,Sing like a space opera, ~name~.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:launch=seductive,Ooh, the blue one again!  If you weren't so unstable, I'd invite you back for a drink, cutie.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:launch=vain,Oh, thank God, the blue one's back.  Good to see a woman who's polite and sincere in my line of work!
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:launch=interested,Just in time.  I wasn't looking forward to hearing your counterpart bellyache about losing.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:launch=teasing,Just the hair color I wanted to see!  You're so much nicer to be around, even if you're kind of a doormat.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=vain,I knew Earth girls could love each other the way we do.  Men are just so superfluous!
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=seductive,Talk about a Mejarian power couple.  You're stronger than the men I know anyway!
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=teasing,I like the idea of men just picking me up...but it seems like you two could do that anyway.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=vain,I guess Earth isn't so different from Mejare after all.  Two strong women in love!  ...Like me and Barnette.
4-female_finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=vain,Nothing like girls having fun together.
4-female_finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=interested,See?  What do women even need men around for?  We understand each other so much better.
4-female_finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=laughing,Sing like a space opera, ~name~.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:amalia=stretching,<i>And it just dumps you off, disgusted with your behavior</i>.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:amalia=smug,Earth women are so bestial, having sex with men and plants in equal measures.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:amalia=laughing,You ought to be ashamed of yourself, young lady!  Now go get your servant to clean you up!
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:amalia=vain,Looks like Little Miss Princess was just another dirty commoner, begging to be ravished and tossed aside.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:uravity=seductive,And she just plops down like a doofus!  You get cuter the longer I look at you, darling.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:uravity=laughing,Have a good time, Miss Gravity?  Seems like you lost control of your little floating maneuver.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:uravity=teasing,I think you might be the most adorable girl I've ever met, from stuffing your figure into that suit to just plopping on the ground.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:uravity=laughing,Ha!  I guess you really <i>have</i> overcome your embarrassment, to just drop down like that.  Or maybe that was an accident.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:moon=bored,Nice finish.  The white fluid really stands out against your blackened labia.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:moon=annoyed,Class act, these Earth girls.  Absolutely marvelous to behold.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:moon=annoyed,Would you believe I thought I was superior to Earth girls?  Moon here's shown me I have a long way to go.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:moon=bored,Perfect.  Yeah.  Mm-hm.  Glad you had fun.  See you next time.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:vriska=shocked,Wha--<i>ew!  W-what's all that blue stuff?  Don't get it on me!  It's gross</i>!
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:vriska=shocked,<i>Ack!  F-fluid!  B-blue fluid everywhere!  Is it poisonous</i>?
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:vriska=shocked,<i>Eeek!  V-Vriska!  What is this?  What did you do?  Why are you leaking blue stuff</i>?
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:vriska=shocked,<i>Ack!  K-keep that stuff away from me!  It's corrosive, isn't it?  M-magic corrosive blue fluid</i>!
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:morrigan=seductive,What, she's leaving?  Stay a while!  We can talk about woman relationships together!
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:morrigan=seductive,Hey, don't leave so soon, dear!  You're a steal yourself--I can tell you more about more girlfriend!
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:morrigan=seductive,Aww, don't leave, honey!  We just got to meet each other, and you spent it all underneath Morrigan's butt!
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:morrigan=vain,<i>Leave if you must.  I guess I'm not beautiful enough to warrant sticking around</i>.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:meia=seductive,Nothing like watching a woman come out of her shell.  Don't you feel better now?
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:meia=interested,See?  All that energy was boiling under the surface, distracting you while we piloted.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:meia=vain,See what lies just underneath the surface?  Don't judge a Mejarian by appearances, ladies.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:meia=laughing,That was <i>adorable</i>!  You're the cutest, Meia...besides Barnette, and maybe Dita.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:meia=laughing,I knew you were pent-up...but I didn't know you were capable of irrigating Tarak.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:black_canary=angry,<i>Oooow</i>!  Hey, shut up, you freak!
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:black_canary=angry,<i>Ow</i>!  What was <i>that</i> for?  <i>Ugh</i>!
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:black_canary=angry,<i>Oooooow</i>!  Ooh, the <i>nerve</i> of some people!  Take your weird voice powers and beat it, freak!
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:black_canary=annoyed,<i>AM I TALKING TOO LOUD?  I THINK I JUST WENT DEAF</i>.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,...That ended as quickly as it began.  What <i>was</i> that?
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,You don't even seem bothered!  W-why didn't you say you could do stuff like that?
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:elizabeth=awkward,...And this sort of thing just comes naturally to you?  Didn't bat an eye?
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,OK.  Yes.  It's over now, apparently.  Very enlightening, Elizabeth.  Never judge by appearances.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:aimee=shocked,A-ah!  See?  I <i>told</i> you!
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:aimee=bored,...Yeah, <i>definitely</i> making sure Barnette doesn't go this far.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:aimee=bored,Guess we all knew that was coming, but I wanted to believe you'd pull it off.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:aimee=frustrated,...I think I prefer <i>Barnette's</i> level of gun-hobby.  As in, not shooting herself.

5-male_must_masturbate=smug,Well, well, well.  Look who outwitted whom.
5-male_must_masturbate=laughing,Men may be strong, but their minds have rarely impressed me.
5-male_must_masturbate=laughing,It's OK, ~name~.  This is perfectly natural for a man...losing, that is.
5-male_must_masturbate=smug,I wasn't worried.  You're no Harvest mothership...or even a little cube drone.
5-male_must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:meia,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0,priority:1001=seductive-2,So I wanted to see a man's seed in addition to his tube.  <i>Is that so wrong</i>?
5-male_must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:meia,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0,priority:1001=smug,Oh, don't act like you're not pleasantly surprised.  Haven't you been wondering how men masturbate?
5-male_must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:meia,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0,priority:1001=laughing,Please.  I saw you blush for a second there--you want to know how he'll do it.
5-male_must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:meia,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0,priority:1001=interested,Oh, don't give me that.  You're just as curious as me, you just don't want people to know about it.
5-male_must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:meia,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0,priority:1001=laughing,Don't sit here and tell me you don't want to see what men's seed looks like.  Or are you worried it might turn you on?
5-male_must_masturbate,target:captain_falcon=teasing,Well, Mr. Shouts-a-minute, now you get to yell at us and have it actually be appropriate.  Go nuts.
5-male_must_masturbate,target:captain_falcon=laughing,You were shouting enough already, so I shudder to think at how noisy you'll be <i>now</i>.
5-male_must_masturbate,target:captain_falcon=stretching,Oh, good.  The man who already wouldn't shut up has to <i>masturbate</i> now.  Can't we just make him leave?
5-male_must_masturbate,target:captain_falcon=laughing,Well, I'll learn about men from this, but you might deafen me in the process.
5-male_must_masturbate,saidMarker:1v1=teasing,Looks like I won after all!  But really, if <i>this</i> isn't enough for you, there's just no pleasing men.
5-male_must_masturbate,saidMarker:1v1=interested,Hey, Earth-man, you got my dress off all the same.  So mission accomplished, I'd say.
5-male_must_masturbate,saidMarker:1v1=laughing,Well done, ~name~.  You gave yourself quite the load of masturbation fuel before losing like a chump.
5-male_must_masturbate,saidMarker:1v1=vain,Hey, now--if <i>this</i> isn't enough to still satisfy men, I can see why women formed their own planet.
5-male_must_masturbate,saidMarker:1v1=teasing,Well, Mr. Earth-man, you lost--but I don't want to hear any complaining!  You've got a view of Jura Basil Elden in her underwear, after all.
5-male_must_masturbate,target:captain_america,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0=laughing,<i>Pfft</i>!  You didn't <i>know</i> that?  Some heroic man you are, not even knowing the rules of a silly game.
5-male_must_masturbate,target:captain_america,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0=laughing,That's some excellent situational awareness, dear.  Then again, I lied to Meia to make her believe the same thing.
5-male_must_masturbate,target:captain_america,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0=interested,Nice job doing your homework, Mr. Muscle.  I guess they didn't pump up your brain at all.
5-male_must_masturbate,target:captain_america,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0=laughing,What, Mr. Goody-Two-Shoes didn't read the rulebook before he got here?  Come <i>on</i>.
5-male_must_masturbate,target:9s=smug,And now for the <i>ultimate</i> test of your humanity.  If he bleeds, he masturbates.
5-male_must_masturbate,target:9s=stretching,Well, time to cast aside your artificiality, honey.  Let's see if a fake man can outperform a real one!
5-male_must_masturbate,target:9s=vain,Don't feel bad if your fakeness makes this weird for you.  I don't have much frame of reference.
5-male_must_masturbate,target:9s=seductive,<i>Have fun, dear</i>!  Do you have to rev yourself up a bit, or are you actually like a real person in this regard?
5-male_start_masturbating=seductive,Earth men like breasts, right?  Well then, this shouldn't take you long.
5-male_start_masturbating=seductive,Save some seed for me, ~name~.  You're handsome.
5-male_start_masturbating=laughing,A few months ago, this would've put Celtic in a coma.  Poor girl could barely stand to be <i>near</i> men!
5-male_start_masturbating=stretching,I wonder which of our prisoners lasts the longest.  Duero's the smartest, but the other two have dumb luck on their sides.
5-male_start_masturbating,target:9s=laughing,What does an android think about, exactly?  Silicone breasts?  Mechanical hips?
5-male_start_masturbating,target:9s=interested,I'm quite curious what's going through your mind.  The exact optimal jerking speed, factoring in fuel efficiency?
5-male_start_masturbating,target:9s=seductive,Anyone on your mind, Little Dungeon Bot?  Someone at this table...or maybe your cute little "2B" partner?
5-male_start_masturbating,target:9s=vain,What gets a robot going, huh?  If I could make a <i>machine</i> like me, I'm officially the most gorgeous woman alive.
5-male_masturbating=seductive-2,Don't stare, ~name~.  It's so <i>embarrassing</i>.
5-male_masturbating=seductive-2,A man ogling my bare breasts?  Why, all of Mejare cries out in agony!
5-male_masturbating=laughing,Teehee.  A man masturbating to my breasts...it's so <i>thrilling</i>.
5-male_masturbating=vain,Good to know my wonderful body pleases men <i>and</i> women.
5-male_masturbating,target:9s=laughing,Hey, 9S.  You're thinking about how much you want to...well, you know.  Aren't you?
5-male_masturbating,target:9s=vain,I just can't get over the look on your face, honey.  A robot in ecstasy!  Marvelous.
5-male_masturbating,target:9s=thinking,Seriously, I'm wondering what a robot thinks about when he masturbates.  I can't even figure out <i>human</i> men.
5-male_masturbating,target:9s=thinking,It's hard to find this erotic when I'm confused about your gender <i>and</i> your mechanics.
5-male_finished_masturbating=angry,Hey, don't waste it all over the floor!  It'll get contaminated, and I won't be able to use it!
5-male_finished_masturbating=vain,That goo really makes a baby?  I can just picture the photo ops with my <i>gorgeous</i> child...
5-male_finished_masturbating=laughing,You men spurt out goo on command, and you expect me to believe you're the same species.
5-male_finished_masturbating=laughing,I may want that seed for a baby...<i>Dita</i> would want it in a test tube for her alien studies.
5-male_finished_masturbating=shocked,Ack!  W-what am I looking at?  Who are you?  Someone help!
5-male_finished_masturbating,target:corrin_m=shocked,<i>Eeeeeek!  I knew men were monsters!  How dare you try to enter my womb</i>!
5-male_finished_masturbating,target:corrin_m=shocked,<i>Wait!  I take it all back!  I don't want man-beasts clawing at my breasts!  Stay away from my womb</i>!
5-male_finished_masturbating,target:corrin_m=bored,...I don't want talons anywhere near my cervix.  Earth women can have you for themselves.
5-male_finished_masturbating,target:corrin_m=shocked,<i>Wha--wha--a monster!  Stay back!  I have a girlfriend-and she has guns!  I don't need men</i>!
5-male_finished_masturbating,target:jin=shocked,<i>Eep</i>!  W-why's it glowing so much?  The book just said it was pearly, not <i>radioactive</i>!
5-male_finished_masturbating,target:jin=awkward,...Uh, did I miss a paragraph in the book?  Does men's sperm come out all lustrous and then fade?
5-male_finished_masturbating,target:jin=seductive,Oh, wow!  Does it really glow that much?  That looks like <i>I'd</i> glow if you came inside me.
5-male_finished_masturbating,target:jin=seductive,Wow, men's seed is even more glorious than I imagined!  You must pump your heart and soul into that stuff to make it shine like that!
5-male_finished_masturbating,target:9s=awkward,<i>Let me see it, now</i>!  ...Where is it?  You know, your seed?
5-male_finished_masturbating,target:9s=angry,...Do you seriously not have any seed?  The one thing I was most interested in?
5-male_finished_masturbating,target:9s=bored,...Oh.  You're a machine, so you don't have the <i>semen</i> stuff.  Well, you're worthless to me, then.
5-male_finished_masturbating,target:9s=angry,Wha--w-where's all the seed?  I wanted to see men's <i>sperm</i> things!  Hey!
5-female_must_masturbate=laughing,Wanna know something funny?  I didn't tell Meia about the masturbation rule!
5-female_must_masturbate=interested,Earth women haven't surprised me much so far.  Here's your chance.
5-female_must_masturbate=vain,This would absolutely <i>kill</i> Meia.  She's so damn competitive.
5-female_must_masturbate=smug,Wasn't exactly rattled.  Jura Basil Elden is quite comfortable in her skin.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:alpha,marker:planet-countries=confused,What's a <i>yoo-ess-bee</i>?  Something only Planet Japan has?
5-female_must_masturbate,target:alpha=thinking,"Yoo-ess-bees" make you real?  Do <i>I</i> have one without even knowing it?
5-female_must_masturbate,target:alpha=smug,Oh look, she's actually speaking instead of singing.  And even then, she's goin on about nonsense like "yoo-ess-bees."
5-female_must_masturbate,target:alpha=stretching,A "yoo-ess-bee"?  Sounds like some fancy gadget Parfet would understand.  Is Miss Popstar a secret genius?
5-female_must_masturbate,target:elizabeth=shocked,It's been fun, Liz, but you--you--<i>there's more than one of you</i>.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:elizabeth=shocked,Well, Liz, it was nice getting to know--<i>both of you</i>.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:elizabeth=shocked,<i>Ack!  No!  The Harvest!  They're mulitplying!  Help</i>!
5-female_must_masturbate,target:elizabeth=shocked,...<i>What?  What's happening?  Elizabeth</i>?
5-female_must_masturbate,target:aimee=teasing,Now if you could masturbate with the <i>bullets</i>, that'd <i>really</i> impress me.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:aimee=smug,Surely she doesn't have to do it, right?  I mean, she already came earlier.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:aimee=interested,We'd better find some cover, considering how she made herself cum <i>last</i> time.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:aimee=teasing,Well, <i>this</i> is a predicament.  Or is your aim good enough to <i>juuust</i> graze yourself to orgasm?
5-female_must_masturbate,target:felicia=teasing,Wow, you weren't kidding!  Come on, honey, what were you thinking?  Couldn't stuff yourself into an overcoat?
5-female_must_masturbate,target:felicia=laughing,Well, you sure made this easy, honey.  That's what you get for showing up naked.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:felicia=stretching,Not much of a tease, are you?  Just up and arriving naked to start with.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:felicia=laughing,I thought you had clothes to start with, however skimpy, but no.  You were actually naked this whole time.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:meia,alsoPlaying:kyu=vain,Hey, <i>I'm</i> fun.  Meia barely knows what "fun" means.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:meia,alsoPlaying:kyu=stretching,Hey, don't give Meia any credit for all the fun <i>I'm</i> bringing.  Her job is to stand there and look miserable.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:meia,alsoPlaying:kyu=teasing,It's a hard life being a pirate, Miss Pixie!  So I try to make it fun for myself, while Meia is content is live in misery.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:meia,alsoPlaying:kyu=vain,It's nice to be appreciated for lighting up a room the way I do.  I have to work extra hard when Meia's killing the mood nearby.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=smug,Oh, <i>God</i>.  Miss Busybee has to masturbate now?  We're going to drown in her tears.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=laughing,Should we really make her do this?  She's so scared of her own body, she'll run in circles.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=vain,Maybe I'd have some sympathy if you had a body to be ashamed of.  As it stands, this embarrassment is an insult to poor ugly girls.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=interested,Do we really want to make her do this?  She's <i>already</i> a blubbering mess, and she's just standing around naked.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=stretching,Get the cleanup crew ready.  If this girl hasn't peed herself yet, she's going to do it now.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=stretching,<i>God</i>, Earth girls grow up soft.  Fighting men all your life really toughens you up!
5-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=stretching,Look, Florina masturbating is bad for everyone here.  She cries, and she annoys <i>us</i> in the process.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=teasing,I'm tempted to plant a big smooch right on your mouth, dear.  That'll shock you right out of your embarrassment!
5-female_must_masturbate,target:sei=laughing,That last drink was the dagger, huh?  Maybe you would've held up otherwise.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:sei=interested,Looks like that last drink was the one that blurred out all the numbers on the cards.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:sei=teasing,All you've got, eh, dearie?  Did the alcohol finally reach your brain and short out your poker face?
5-female_must_masturbate,target:sei=vain,A noble effort, made all the more tragic in how you just kept shooting yourself in the foot with that booze.  Now get to the good stuff.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:sei=seductive,You're a horny little blue ball of booze, aren't you?  You sound like you've been waiting for this--drunks aren't exactly subtle.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:nagisa=laughing,You're putting on a <i>performance</i> for us?  Isn't that what the masturbation is anyway?
5-female_must_masturbate,target:nagisa=teasing,Hey, honey--if you want to put on a play, play with <i>yourself</i>.  That's what we all came here for.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:nagisa=smug,Yeah, Mejare has some plays I know of.  Mostly about men eating a poor helpless woman, then getting gutted themselves.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:nagisa=vain,A play, huh?  Let's see if it's more riveting than the man-killing, rough-and-tumble world of Mejarian theater.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:nagisa=smug,Oh, you're doing a play?  I was never big on theater myself--my own life as a pilot is far more interesting, after all.

5-female_must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:meia,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0,priority:1001=smug,Big deal.  Aren't you interested in how Earth women do it?  <i>I</i> am.
5-female_must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:meia,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0,priority:1001=interested,What, are you worried you'll <i>lose</i>?  Gotta keep your composure when the stakes are raised.
5-female_must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:meia,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0,priority:1001=teasing,So what?  My squadron leader should be able to adapt to shifting circumstances.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:moon=frustrated,Great.  Yeah.  Masturbate instead of seeking medical attention.  See if <i>I</i> care.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:moon=bored,...Sometimes I wonder why I like teasing people so much.  Maybe it's just to prove I can toe the line others can't.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:moon=frustrated,Some people you just can't help.  Or even talk to.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:moon=annoyed,What a shock.  Yeah, have fun.  Whatever.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:rainbow_mika=laughing,What now, Miss Wrestler?  Is your partner going to help you <i>masturbate</i>, too?
5-female_must_masturbate,target:rainbow_mika=teasing,Well, there's only one thing that girl can help you with now, honey.  If you're up to task, of course.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:rainbow_mika=teasing,Is your partner going all the way with "assisting" you?  Because that would make this Mejarian feel right at home.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:rainbow_mika=vain,Well, you should know the drill, dear.  Or will you invite your partner along for <i>this</i>, too?
5-female_must_masturbate,target:morrigan=bored,<i>Now how does a succubus do it</i>--oh.  She gets help.  Makes sense.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:morrigan=shocked,<i>Eeep  W-where'd she come from?  Help</i>!
5-female_must_masturbate,target:morrigan=shocked,Who's "Lilith"?  Wait, where'd <i>she</i> come from?  Help!  No!
5-female_must_masturbate,target:morrigan=stretching,Oh, you brought a friend to help?  Just like a succubus...then again, I should've brought Barnette.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:misato=teasing,Sure you've still got the coordination to <i>find</i> you vagina, Boozeball?  Either way, this'll be entertaining.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:misato=laughing,I think this works out perfectly.  Either you manage to masturbate and it's sexy, or you fall over and it's funny.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:misato=vain,Have fun pawing at both your vaginas, Miss Doublevision.  You look like you're going to fall asleep any minute now.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:misato=teasing,Sorry I couldn't drink too much with you, but I'm in enemy territory, after all.  Now have fun trying to find your vagina, Blurry-eyes.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:streaming-chan=laughing,What are you--oh.  <i>Oh</i>.  So you're <i>that</i> kind of woman...a toy woman.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:streaming-chan=stretching,Toys, huh?  Yeah, I can see you poor single women resorting to them without a girlfriend around.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:streaming-chan=teasing,A <i>toy</i>?  What, don't you Earth girls have pet men you summon to ravish you on command?
5-female_must_masturbate,target:streaming-chan=vain,Should've known Miss Media would use a toy--the most conspicuous way to get yourself off, besides enlisting a partner.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:amalia=smug,I can only <i>dream</i> of how embarrassed you must be, dear.  There's no possible chance you're actually an exhibitionist.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:amalia=laughing,This must be <i>so</i> devastating.  Surely you don't get off on being watched like us lecherous commoners.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:amalia=stretching,Oh, woe is you!  A princess forced to exhibit her base desires like her lowly subjects.  No chance she's into it.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:amalia=teasing,Nobility, reduced to her primal instincts for an audience...it's a good thing you're so above it all.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:vriska=smug,Oh, what's the big deal?  Masturbating in front of us would be less embarrassing than the state you're in now.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:vriska=interested,Dealer, doesn't this count as naked?  Hasn't she lost now?  Come on.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:vriska=interested,Come <i>on</i>, Vriska.  You're naked.  You lost.  It's OK.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:vriska=laughing,Everyone loses eventually, sweetie.  Even cheaters with speech impediments.
5-female_must_masturbate,saidMarker:1v1=laughing,You may have lost, but you've got plenty to look at, right?  Oh wait, I forgot Earth women are afraid of each other's bodies.
5-female_must_masturbate,saidMarker:1v1=laughing,Don't feel bad.  You can still masturbate to my breasts and pretend they were yours.
5-female_must_masturbate,saidMarker:1v1=vain,At least you managed to get me out of that tight little dress.  It's fashionable, but this is certainly more comfortable!
5-female_must_masturbate,saidMarker:1v1=teasing,Perhaps this is the perfect way to end things.  I can help you along with your little masturbation session by snapping my thong against my hips.
5-female_must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:meia=interested,Earth women haven't surprised me much so far.  Here's your chance.
5-female_must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,Wasn't exactly rattled.  Jura Basil Elden is quite comfortable in her skin.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:meia=vain,Not bad, Meia, but it seems we've found the superior pilot.  Enjoy your little pleasure session.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:meia=interested,Couldn't quite land the killing shot.  To be fair, my thong is a pretty small target.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:meia=teasing,And there you go, losing like you're some civilian.  Killer instinct muddled by all the lust in the air?
5-female_must_masturbate,target:meia=laughing,You've got the killer instinct, Meia.  Try to ease that up as your masturbate for me.
5-female_start_masturbating=seductive,You're so cute, ~name~.  Just diving right in like that...
5-female_start_masturbating=teasing,Yeah, I can already tell that I should just stick to Barnette.  She's got some skill in those hands of hers.
5-female_start_masturbating=teasing,Give me something to tighten my thong over, ~name~.
5-female_start_masturbating=laughing,Any technique to how an Earth girl does it?  Or has male roughness desenstized you to the point where you'd need a battering ram to feel anything?
5-female_start_masturbating,target:aella=interested,You've <i>never</i> masturbated, huh?  Locked away in a house all your life and your hands never wandered south of the border?
5-female_start_masturbating,target:aella=teasing,What are you, a robot?  <i>Everyone</i> masturbates, dearie...unless you're <i>that</i> popular with the girls.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:aella=stretching,Yeah, you've never masturbated.  <i>Mm-hm</i>.  And I've never taken a bath.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:aella=smug,Oh, give me a break, honey.  Sex I can see people shying away from, but never <i>masturbating</i>?  Does your heart not beat?
5-female_start_masturbating,target:aella=interested,Ooh, Miss Big-Boned over here has never masturbated.  That's why you came to a public strip poker game, right?
5-female_start_masturbating,target:aella=teasing,Never masturbated, huh?  You must think you're better than the rest of us, Miss Chastity.  Well, <i>you're missing out</i>.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:joey=seductive,Oh, my!  That's the biggest vibrator I've ever seen--I guess there's a lot more room on Earth!
5-female_start_masturbating,target:joey=interested,Is this just a clown thing where everything is comically large?  Or more of a general Earth style?
5-female_start_masturbating,target:joey=vain,A vibrator?  And my, it's enormous--and shaped like men's tubes!  All I need are Barnette's lovely fingers, not these massive toys.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:joey=vain,My, such <i>girth</i> on that thing!  Is this men's influence?  Because Mejare's toys are rather inconspicuous.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:hermione=laughing,<i>Oh, my</i>!  That's <i>one</i> way to use magic, you little skank!  But I understand.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:hermione=interested,Well, dear, you're not fooling anyone with the good-girl act now.  That's way too many hands to be wholesome.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:hermione=vain,Now <i>that</i> looks pretty magical.  Suddenly my two-handed approach with Barnette seems inadequate.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:hermione=teasing,<i>My, my, my</i>!  Miss Witch knows what she wants, alright.  And she's not afraid to magic her way there.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=laughing,Barnette's got a few toys...which have helped give us some perspective on men's tubes.  But not <i>quite</i> that big.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=teasing,Toys are hard to come by on Mejare, you know...they're symbols of men.  Unless you're a pirate, where you get your pick.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=stretching,I can't believe you carry that unwieldy thing around.  Earth women can't go five minutes without something phallic!
5-female_start_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=vain,Such ridiculous things...Barnette's lovely fingers are all I need to be happy.  And maybe her gun-shaped toys.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=laughing,<i>Ooh</i>.  Should've known a magical woman dressed in all scarlet would pull something like this...I think I'm good.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=teasing,That's...quite a lot of hands.  More than I think I could keep track of...<i>but that's half the fun</i>.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=vain,Not sure I like being tied up and fondled, dear...well, maybe with the right person.  A certain green-haired cutie, specifically.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=vain,To each her own, I suppose...that level of vulnerability is for Barnette's eyes only, as far as I'm concerned.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:aimee=shocked,O-oh, you're--using the gun.  ...Maybe you should unload it first?
5-female_start_masturbating,target:aimee=shocked,...OK, I call Barnette a gun nut, but she doesn't go <i>that</i> far.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:aimee=awkward,...Barnette has some toys shaped like guns.  Just for fun, you know?  But...the <i>real thing</i>?
5-female_start_masturbating,target:aimee=awkward,...I really thought you were cool, but now I'm worried.  Isn't that kind of dangerous?
5-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu=smug,And now Miss Pixie takes to the air to masturbate?  I don't know what I expected out of you.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu=teasing,I should've expected you to use those wings at some point, Miss Fairytale.  Now give me a good view.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu=laughing,I'd call you a skank for flying up and presenting to us, but I think you'd relish that.  So have your fun.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu=seductive,You're a little crazy, Miss Pixie, but you certainly put the effort in.  Check out that fairy flight!
5-female_start_masturbating,target:florina=seductive,Oh look, she's going to sing to make herself feel better!  That's...actually kind of sweet.  I think I like you, darling!
5-female_start_masturbating,target:florina=seductive,Ooh, a song?  Sorry I made fun--I <i>love</i> music!  Go for it, cutie.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:florina=teasing,Yeah, I try to make Barnette sing, too.  But that's by accident...and the tune's all over the place.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:florina=excited,You are just so <i>unbearably</i> cute.  Now you're <i>singing</i>?  I just want to squeeze you!
5-female_start_masturbating,target:videl=excited,Wow, you <i>are</i> flying!  I'm so much taller, it was hard to tell--<i>how're you doing that</i>?
5-female_start_masturbating,target:videl=seductive,Hard to be sure in crazy places like this, but you've been flying this whole time, Videl!  I should've noticed!
5-female_start_masturbating,target:videl=excited,Videl!  Videl!  Omigosh, can you teach me how to fly?  I don't see any wings, so that means I can learn, right?
5-female_start_masturbating,target:videl=vain,Can you show me how to fly, Videl?  That'd make the most talented woman alive in addition to the most beautiful!
5-female_start_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=shocked,<i>Wait, I was kidding!  Ack</i>!
5-female_start_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=shocked,<i>Wait, I wasn't serious!  Don't!  You'll kill us</i>!
5-female_start_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=awkward,<i>...I wasn't being serious.  Please don't catch anyone in the crossfire</i>.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=shocked,<i>Eek!  I said she should help you, not wrestle you</i>!
5-female_start_masturbating,target:shego=interested,Legs getting tired, dear?  Or are you afraid we won't see enough of you on the floor?
5-female_start_masturbating,target:shego=laughing,Seems Miss Lean-and-Green's butt is a little too delicate for the cold floor...or maybe she's just a total exhibitionist.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:shego=seductive,Aww, does the poor bodysuited villain not like how cold the floor is on her little backside?  Take a chair and show off, then.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:shego=teasing,Yeah, standing all this time is a little grating.  But hey, you could hide a little more if you sat on the floor...maybe.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:alpha=shocked,...OK.  Yeah.  I'm starting to believe you about this <i>virtual</i> business.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:alpha=awkward,That's...new.  Nice color shift.  Glad I could see you become a real woman.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:alpha=shocked,<i>Eek</i>!  I-I mean, uh, great skin tone there, Alpha.  Much more natural.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:alpha=awkward,...Well, it worked.  I shouldn't have doubted you...but I still don't understand you.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,OK.  Yes.  This is happening now.  Elizabeth is capable of this.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,Neat powers, Elizabeth.  Real...real <i>Mejarian</i>.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,Who...who <i>are</i> you?  Which one is Elizabeth?
5-female_start_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,I--I thought you were just a sweet little Earth girl!  Who are you?
5-female_start_masturbating,target:morrigan=vain,<i>Oh, my</i>!  Just like me and Barnette...except we can't fly.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:morrigan=laughing,Maybe Barnette and I would try that position if one of us had wings.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:morrigan=seductive,You're certainly proving yourself to be every bit the succubus you claim to be, dear.  I'm falling under <i>both</i> your spells!
5-female_start_masturbating,target:morrigan=teasing,Well, Miss Succubus, the addition of this "Lilith" is making me feel right at home.  That's how Mejarians have sex--mostly.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:meia=laughing,You're really helping me fill in the blanks here.  Wasn't sure you <i>knew</i> how to masturbate.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:meia=interested,So has that thing <i>ever</i> seen any action?  You're without a girlfriend, after all.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:meia=stretching,Don't expect any help.  Oh, who am I kidding, you don't want any--even if you've probably never done this.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:meia=laughing,You're full of surprises, Meia.  I can't help but wonder how much emotion you'll finally betray...I imagine this is your first time.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:amalia=awkward,...Oh.  OK.  Well, way to prove me wrong right away.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:amalia=shocked,Uh...<i>what are you doing?  I was just teasing</i>!
5-female_start_masturbating,target:amalia=shocked,...I was just kidding around!  It was a joke!  You don't have to...uh...
5-female_start_masturbating,target:amalia=awkward,...Or you could go ahead and actually be an exhibitionist.  That works too, I guess.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:felicia=shocked,<i>Gah</i>!  W-where'd you keep that thing?  It's enormous...and phallic!
5-female_start_masturbating,target:felicia=laughing,A <i>vibrator</i>?  Never seen one shaped like that...must be like a man's tube.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:felicia=smug,Figures Earth women would even have <i>toys</i> shaped like men's things.  Can't you be independent?
5-female_start_masturbating,target:felicia=vain,Oh, of course.  I should've known any toys on this planet would resemble men's tubes.  You Earth girls are hopeless.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:nagisa=teasing,Well, here we go.  Take me on a thrilling, dramatic adventure...shy little sheltered Earth girl.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:nagisa=vain,This had better be more thrilling than what I do every day, you know.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:nagisa=teasing,Hey, coming here was like an anatomy and culture lesson already.  This story better be crazy!
5-female_start_masturbating,target:nagisa=vain,I crave drama, you know...that's why I'm a ruthless pirate and cunning pilot.  So don't let me down with this story.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:vriska=shocked,Wha--you--<i>oh dear</i>.  Maybe we <i>should</i> let her keep playing.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:vriska=shocked,...I take it back.  Let her keep playing, Dealer.  Let her leave, actually.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:vriska=awkward,...Oh my.  That die <i>really</i> hates you.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:vriska=bored,...This is getting too weird for me.  Earth is a strange planet.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:moon=sad,I'm honestly rethinking my entire life.  You're like a prophetic angel.  I shouldn't come to these sorts of places.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:moon=frustrated,Are you an apparition sent to punish me for being curious about men?
5-female_start_masturbating,target:moon=sad,You don't have to whore yourself out for money.  Just come to Mejare...you'll make excellent anti-men propaganda.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:moon=bored,For the first time in my life, I'm regretting a decision.  Coming here was a bad idea.
5-female_masturbating=teasing,Just pace yourself, ~name~.  I'm taken, you know.
5-female_masturbating=teasing,I know my breasts are out, ~name~, but control yourself!
5-female_masturbating=laughing,I know that look in your eye, ~name~.  An Earth woman being converted.
5-female_masturbating=vain,It's OK.  I have this effect on women, Mejarian or not.
5-female_masturbating=vain,Deep breathing, ~name~.  Let my beauty envelop you like sunlight on a beach.
5-female_masturbating,target:meia=teasing,I'm plenty of eye candy, right?  I see your lust in the spa sometimes.  Well, I'm happy with Barnette, homewrecker.
5-female_masturbating,target:meia=interested,Any crewmates on your mind, boss?  Some lovely ladies you're too proud to admit your feelings towards?
5-female_masturbating,target:meia=vain,You can masturbate to my body anytime, Meia.  My squadron leader needs her mind to be clear and focused!
5-female_masturbating,target:meia=teasing,I understand your wandering eye.  I'm beautiful, and you have needs...as much as you try to deny it.
5-female_masturbating,target:meia=laughing,You're so pent-up.  This is driving you <i>crazy</i>!  See how badly you needed this game?
5-female_masturbating,target:videl=teasing,At least you're making this interesting, just bobbing up and down like that...<i>you're such a pervert</i>.
5-female_masturbating,target:videl=vain,Just gliding along, letting your instincts guide you...<i>oh, to be young again</i>!  Well, younger.
5-female_masturbating,target:videl=seductive,If only I could fly like you and make my beauty more fully visible.  Do you realize how lucky you are?
5-female_masturbating,target:videl=seductive,Videl, Videl, <i>Videl</i>!  You're a complete package, dear--cute, fit, adorable pigtails, and superpowers!
5-female_masturbating,target:shego=teasing,Hey, honey, I'm been talking dirty all game...no sense waiting till the end on <i>that</i> front.
5-female_masturbating,target:shego=laughing,Just listen to the things coming out of Green-bean's mouth!  She's trying to catch up to what I've been doing all evening.
5-female_masturbating,target:shego=teasing,Too bad I got such a head start on the dirty talk, because Shego's doing her best now to match me.
5-female_masturbating,target:shego=seductive,You've got a filthy mouth on you to match the green complexion.  Can't you be a sweetheart for once?
5-female_masturbating,target:amalia=excited,Omigosh, is that vine doing what men's tubes do?  It looks like it!  Show me more!
5-female_masturbating,target:amalia=awkward,...I was just ribbing you about being naughty.  I guess I was right...or I really got to you.
5-female_masturbating,target:amalia=excited,Ooh, show me more angles!  That's <i>so cool</i>...it's like a really long men's tube, right?  Right?
5-female_masturbating,target:amalia=laughing,You really <i>are</i> a little skank!  I should've known all princesses are like this, all sheltered and itching for adventure.
5-female_masturbating,target:amalia=laughing,Can't reach orgasm without a giant tube shoved inside of you, huh?  Glad I didn't grow up stuck with men for my sexual needs.
5-female_masturbating,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:8=teasing,I can't believe I met <i>two</i> women who can fly...and that both would use it for such <i>unsavory</i> reasons.  <i>Teach me</i>!
5-female_masturbating,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:8=vain,Two women showing off the goods in the air, and neither will bother to show me how!  <i>I</i> want to fly, too, you know.
5-female_masturbating,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:8=seductive,Hey, what's a beautiful woman got to do to get some flying lessons?  <i>I</i> want to join in on the airborne fun you two are having!
5-female_masturbating,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:8=vain,You damn Earthling teases are keeping secrets from me!  Can't a gorgeous girl like me learn to fly, too?  I learned to pilot!
5-female_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=interested,Holding up, dear?  You seem a little incapable of saying the safe word.
5-female_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=stretching,I guess when you've got superpowers at your disposal, you need to feel unsafe for once to be excited.
5-female_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=laughing,See, this is why I don't want magic.  <i>This</i> is the kind of thing I'd need to get a thrill again.
5-female_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=laughing,Hanging in there, Miss Bloodred?  Any tighter and it won't just be your outfit that's scarlet.
5-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=awkward,...I guess you don't need a girlfriend, do you?
5-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=awkward,...You know, I didn't peg you as the kind of girl who'd be open to this sort of thing.  Or that had superpowers.
5-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=awkward,You know, I've done that...with Barnette.  You know, <i>another</i> woman.  Not myself.
5-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=thinking,Now I'm curious how good a clone of me would be at this sort of thing...
5-female_masturbating,target:uravity=vain,You're so rude, Ochako, to not share your levitation powers with everyone else.  I share my beauty!
5-female_masturbating,target:uravity=smug,Miss Gravity is certainly making the best use of her powers that <i>I</i> could think of.  Shame the rest of us can't join in.
5-female_masturbating,target:uravity=seductive,Are you <i>sure</i> you were born with these powers?  There isn't some crazy Earth doctor I can visit to fly, too?
5-female_masturbating,target:uravity=vain,Is there nothing crueler than showing off the powers the rest of us can't enjoy?  At least <i>I</i> can't hide how beautiful I am.
5-female_masturbating,target:aimee=awkward,I'm...kind of worried about you, Aimee.  Is there something we should know about men's guns?
5-female_masturbating,target:aimee=bored,I'd definitely give Barnette an intervention if she started masturbating with loaded guns.
5-female_masturbating,target:aimee=smug,That thing is gonna make a bigger racket than even <i>you</i> are.
5-female_masturbating,target:aimee=awkward,This is getting way too weird for me, Aimee.  The clothes thing was cool, but <i>this</i>?  It's a death wish!
5-female_masturbating,target:vriska=confused,You, uh, holding up over there, Vriska?  Wriggling free sometime soon?
5-female_masturbating,target:vriska=frustrated,...I'm just going to assume she's into this.  I really don't want to touch her.
5-female_masturbating,target:vriska=bored,...I think I would've preferred you <i>gaining</i> clothes, Vriska.
5-female_masturbating,target:vriska=bored,That magic was cool, but <i>yeesh</i>.  What a weirdo...
5-female_masturbating,target:moon=frustrated,Please don't look at me.  Please don't talk.  I'm very afraid.
5-female_masturbating,target:moon=frustrated,God, just let it end already...I'll go straight after this, I promise.
5-female_masturbating,target:moon=bored,Yes.  Cute.  Elegant.  You have the grace of those swans I see in zoos.
5-female_masturbating,target:moon=bored,Marvelous.  Having fun, Moon?  Good.  Glad, even.
5-female_masturbating,target:morrigan=teasing,I was hoping to learn something new here to surprise Barnette tomorrow evening...or maybe even when I get back.
5-female_masturbating,target:morrigan=vain,It's so comforting to see two women enjoying each others' bodies.  I thought Earth had never heard of such a thing!
5-female_masturbating,target:morrigan=stretching,Par for the course where I'm from, Morrigan--sorry it's not leaving an impact.  Well, Mejarians don't fly, but still.
5-female_masturbating,target:morrigan=vain,Hey, keep it up, Miss Succubus.  You're making my heart swell with memories of my darling Barnette--it's hard to be away from her!
5-female_masturbating,target:marceline=confused,What exactly is letting you float like that?  You've been doing it all game, and it doesn't even look strenuous.
5-female_masturbating,target:marceline=seductive,You're inhuman in so many ways...no eyes, blue skin, floating.  But you sure masturbate like a normal girl.
5-female_masturbating,target:marceline=teasing,I guess you're pretty human after all, Eyeballs.  Just look at you floating there, having the time of your life!
5-female_masturbating,target:marceline=teasing,Going to perform any fancy tricks for us, Miss Levitator?  Masturbate upside down or something?
5-female_masturbating,target:rinkah=laughing,Did you just--you <i>did</i>!  You're such a beast of a woman, Rinkah...
5-female_masturbating,target:rinkah=laughing,Are you putting your finger where I think you are?  You've done nothing but confirm stereotypes all evening...you <i>animal</i>.
5-female_masturbating,target:rinkah=smug,I guess Miss Warrior is so tempered from all her harsh battles, she needs to stick fingers in her rear to feel anything.
5-female_masturbating,target:rinkah=teasing,I don't know what I expected from you, Miss Fireball, but a finger in the butt checks out.  Barnette and I would never be that dirty.
5-female_masturbating,target:gwen=smug,...I can't really fault you for this.  If <i>I</i> had spider-web powers, I'd give that a try, too.
5-female_masturbating,target:gwen=teasing,I'm going to go ahead and guess this isn't <i>all</i> you use that webbing for...if you've got someone else with you.
5-female_masturbating,target:gwen=vain,That webbing looks like quite a bit of fun!  If only I could give it a try with Barnette.
5-female_masturbating,target:gwen=seductive,Hey, I like those angles you're pulling, cutie!  Go upside down again!
5-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=teasing,<i>Hoo</i>.  Well, at least you seem like you're in control.  Have fun, girls!
5-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=seductive,Well, you're not killing anyone, so fine by me.  This is fun to watch!
5-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=teasing,Just stand a safe distance away...this <i>is</i> pretty sexy.
5-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=seductive,I <i>knew</i> you two were lovers!  Can't keep your hands off each other...or anything else.
5-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=vain,As long as you don't clothesline me, you can keep this up all you want, cuties.  Just watch those muscles ripple!
5-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=seductive,Barnette and I aren't as strong as you two, but maybe I should take notes anyway.
5-female_masturbating,target:kyu=seductive,Hey, Miss Love Fairy.  I know you've got wings, but share the magic a little!  <i>I</i> want to fly too, you know!
5-female_masturbating,target:kyu=vain,Now <i>this</i> is a good use of wings.  Who wants to sit on the nasty old ground to masturbate?
5-female_masturbating,target:kyu=interested,I like your style, Miss Pixie.  You were born with wings, and now you've found the perfect use for them.
5-female_masturbating,target:kyu=stretching,Yeah, I'd probably fly like that, too.  But <i>some</i> fairies just won't share their magic with the rest of us.
5-female_finished_masturbating=vain,Looks like my looks haven't slipped a bit.  Good to know.
5-female_finished_masturbating=vain,Glad you enjoyed my breasts, ~name~.  I always do.
5-female_finished_masturbating=smug,Yeah, my chest usually makes Barnette go off like that, too.
5-female_finished_masturbating=vain,Always a joy, seeing a woman pushed to total bliss.  We all deserve it!
5-female_finished_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=vain,I knew Earth girls could love each other the way we do.  Men are just so superfluous!
5-female_finished_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=seductive,Talk about a Mejarian power couple.  You're stronger than the men I know anyway!
5-female_finished_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=teasing,I like the idea of men just picking me up...but it seems like you two could do that anyway.
5-female_finished_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=vain,I guess Earth isn't so different from Mejare after all.  Two strong women in love!  ...Like me and Barnette.
5-female_finished_masturbating,target:vriska=shocked,Wha--<i>ew!  W-what's all that blue stuff?  Don't get it on me!  It's gross</i>!
5-female_finished_masturbating,target:vriska=shocked,<i>Ack!  F-fluid!  B-blue fluid everywhere!  Is it poisonous</i>?
5-female_finished_masturbating,target:vriska=shocked,<i>Eeek!  V-Vriska!  What is this?  What did you do?  Why are you leaking blue stuff</i>?
5-female_finished_masturbating,target:vriska=shocked,<i>Ack!  K-keep that stuff away from me!  It's corrosive, isn't it?  M-magic corrosive blue fluid</i>!
5-female_finished_masturbating,target:launch=seductive,Ooh, the blue one again!  If you weren't so unstable, I'd invite you back for a drink, cutie.
5-female_finished_masturbating,target:launch=vain,Oh, thank God, the blue one's back.  Good to see a woman who's polite and sincere in my line of work!
5-female_finished_masturbating,target:launch=interested,Just in time.  I wasn't looking forward to hearing your counterpart bellyache about losing.
5-female_finished_masturbating,target:launch=teasing,Just the hair color I wanted to see!  You're so much nicer to be around, even if you're kind of a doormat.
5-female_finished_masturbating,target:moon=bored,Nice finish.  The white fluid really stands out against your blackened labia.
5-female_finished_masturbating,target:moon=annoyed,Class act, these Earth girls.  Absolutely marvelous to behold.
5-female_finished_masturbating,target:moon=annoyed,Would you believe I thought I was superior to Earth girls?  Moon here's shown me I have a long way to go.
5-female_finished_masturbating,target:moon=bored,Perfect.  Yeah.  Mm-hm.  Glad you had fun.  See you next time.
5-female_finished_masturbating,target:black_canary=angry,<i>Oooow</i>!  Hey, shut up, you freak!
5-female_finished_masturbating,target:black_canary=angry,<i>Ow</i>!  What was <i>that</i> for?  <i>Ugh</i>!
5-female_finished_masturbating,target:black_canary=angry,<i>Oooooow</i>!  Ooh, the <i>nerve</i> of some people!  Take your weird voice powers and beat it, freak!
5-female_finished_masturbating,target:black_canary=annoyed,<i>AM I TALKING TOO LOUD?  I THINK I JUST WENT DEAF</i>.
5-female_finished_masturbating,target:amalia=stretching,<i>And it just dumps you off, disgusted with your behavior</i>.
5-female_finished_masturbating,target:amalia=smug,Earth women are so bestial, having sex with men and plants in equal measures.
5-female_finished_masturbating,target:amalia=laughing,You ought to be ashamed of yourself, young lady!  Now go get your servant to clean you up!
5-female_finished_masturbating,target:amalia=vain,Looks like Little Miss Princess was just another dirty commoner, begging to be ravished and tossed aside.
5-female_finished_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,...That ended as quickly as it began.  What <i>was</i> that?
5-female_finished_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,You don't even seem bothered!  W-why didn't you say you could do stuff like that?
5-female_finished_masturbating,target:elizabeth=awkward,...And this sort of thing just comes naturally to you?  Didn't bat an eye?
5-female_finished_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,OK.  Yes.  It's over now, apparently.  Very enlightening, Elizabeth.  Never judge by appearances.
5-female_finished_masturbating,target:meia=laughing,Damn.  Didn't know you had that kind of explosive firepower in <i>your own body</i>.
5-female_finished_masturbating,target:meia=teasing,So who was in your mind last?  Someone back on the ship, I imagine, you introspective little nymph.
5-female_finished_masturbating,target:meia=laughing,So who'd you think of that finally made you cum?  Don't tell me it was a <i>man</i>, you horrible witch!
5-female_finished_masturbating,target:meia=seductive-2,Oh, Leader, you embarrass me.  Now all I'll think of is how the sight of my breasts made you cum.
5-female_finished_masturbating,target:meia=laughing,Look at you <i>go</i>!  You can put your icy glare back on, Meia, but I'll always know you're a little <i>slut</i>.
5-female_finished_masturbating,target:meia=seductive,Look at that explosiveness!  Mission accomplished.  Now all you need is a girlfriend, so you never get that pent-up again.
5-female_finished_masturbating,target:aimee=shocked,A-ah!  See?  I <i>told</i> you!
5-female_finished_masturbating,target:aimee=bored,...Yeah, <i>definitely</i> making sure Barnette doesn't go this far.
5-female_finished_masturbating,target:aimee=bored,Guess we all knew that was coming, but I wanted to believe you'd pull it off.
5-female_finished_masturbating,target:aimee=frustrated,...I think I prefer <i>Barnette's</i> level of gun-hobby.  As in, not shooting herself.
5-female_finished_masturbating,target:morrigan=seductive,What, she's leaving?  Stay a while!  We can talk about woman relationships together!
5-female_finished_masturbating,target:morrigan=seductive,Hey, don't leave so soon, dear!  You're a steal yourself--I can tell you more about more girlfriend!
5-female_finished_masturbating,target:morrigan=seductive,Aww, don't leave, honey!  We just got to meet each other, and you spent it all underneath Morrigan's butt!
5-female_finished_masturbating,target:morrigan=vain,<i>Leave if you must.  I guess I'm not beautiful enough to warrant sticking around</i>.
5-female_finished_masturbating,target:uravity=seductive,And she just plops down like a doofus!  You get cuter the longer I look at you, darling.
5-female_finished_masturbating,target:uravity=laughing,Have a good time, Miss Gravity?  Seems like you lost control of your little floating maneuver.
5-female_finished_masturbating,target:uravity=teasing,I think you might be the most adorable girl I've ever met, from stuffing your figure into that suit to just plopping on the ground.
5-female_finished_masturbating,target:uravity=laughing,Ha!  I guess you really <i>have</i> overcome your embarrassment, to just drop down like that.  Or maybe that was an accident.

-3-male_must_masturbate=teasing,Do the deed, show some seed.
-3-male_must_masturbate=teasing,Couldn't quite finish me off, ~name~?  Guess men just can't handle themselves down the stretch.
-3-male_must_masturbate=laughing,Come on, ~name~, really?  I was barely looking at the cards anymore.
-3-male_must_masturbate=interested,Wow, men are worse at this than I thought.  I certainly can't <i>pilot</i> absentmindedly.
-3-male_must_masturbate,saidMarker:1v1=vain,Well, hey.  You lost, but a full view of Jura Basil Elden makes this the best masturbation session any man has ever had.
-3-male_must_masturbate,saidMarker:1v1=teasing,Show me what I've won, ~name~...I want to see what my instincts do when a man jerks his tube next to my naked body.
-3-male_must_masturbate,saidMarker:1v1=vain,Me naked, a man masturbating, and, of couse, winning...<i>this is all so exciting</i>.
-3-male_must_masturbate,saidMarker:1v1=seductive,<i>Mmm</i>...who cares who won?  <i>Let me see what men are capable of</i>.
-3-male_must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:meia,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0,priority:1001=smug,And you were <i>this</i> close to finding out by making <i>me</i> do it.  But no, just some silly man.
-3-male_must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:meia,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0,priority:1001=laughing,Close one.  I thought it might have been <i>me</i> breaking the secret to you!  But instead, we get to watch a man tug on his tube.
-3-male_must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:meia,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0,priority:1001=vain,Oh, calm down.  I'm one loss away from doing it right next to this man, and you don't see fear in <i>my</i> eyes.
-3-male_must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:meia,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0,priority:1001=teasing,Something wrong, boss?  Afraid of what men are capable of?
-3-male_must_masturbate,target:9s=smug,And now for the <i>ultimate</i> test of your humanity.  If he bleeds, he masturbates.
-3-male_must_masturbate,target:9s=stretching,Well, time to cast aside your artificiality, honey.  Let's see if a fake man can outperform a real one!
-3-male_must_masturbate,target:9s=vain,Don't feel bad if your fakeness makes this weird for you.  I don't have much frame of reference.
-3-male_must_masturbate,target:9s=seductive,<i>Have fun, dear</i>!  Do you have to rev yourself up a bit, or are you actually like a real person in this regard?
-3-male_must_masturbate,target:captain_falcon=teasing,Well, Mr. Shouts-a-minute, now you get to yell at us and have it actually be appropriate.  Go nuts.
-3-male_must_masturbate,target:captain_falcon=laughing,You were shouting enough already, so I shudder to think at how noisy you'll be <i>now</i>.
-3-male_must_masturbate,target:captain_falcon=stretching,Oh, good.  The man who already wouldn't shut up has to <i>masturbate</i> now.  Can't we just make him leave?
-3-male_must_masturbate,target:captain_falcon=laughing,Well, I'll learn about men from this, but you might deafen me in the process.
-3-male_must_masturbate,target:captain_america,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0=laughing,<i>Pfft</i>!  You didn't <i>know</i> that?  Some heroic man you are, not even knowing the rules of a silly game.
-3-male_must_masturbate,target:captain_america,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0=laughing,That's some excellent situational awareness, dear.  Then again, I lied to Meia to make her believe the same thing.
-3-male_must_masturbate,target:captain_america,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0=interested,Nice job doing your homework, Mr. Muscle.  I guess they didn't pump up your brain at all.
-3-male_must_masturbate,target:captain_america,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0=laughing,What, Mr. Goody-Two-Shoes didn't read the rulebook before he got here?  Come <i>on</i>.
-3-male_start_masturbating=laughing,Meia's icy, but don't let that fool you.  She's just as curious about men--I can tell.
-3-male_start_masturbating=teasing,Meia's icy, but start this up around her and she'd melt.  Well, maybe if she were naked too.
-3-male_start_masturbating=laughing,Men are so adorably simple-minded.  Their idea of masturbating is to just beat away like idiots!
-3-male_start_masturbating=interested,That's all the style you've got for me, huh?  This seed release better be quite the spectacle.
-3-male_start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,That trademark iciness doesn't fool <i>me</i>, boss.  You're just as curious about men--I can tell.
-3-male_start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Keep it up, handsome.  You'll melt Meia's ice, even if it's the size of a glacier.
-3-male_start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,Men are so adorably simple-minded.  Their idea of masturbating is to just beat away like idiots!
-3-male_start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia=interested,That's all the style you've got for me, huh?  This seed release better be quite the spectacle.
-3-male_start_masturbating,target:9s=laughing,What does an android think about, exactly?  Silicone breasts?  Mechanical hips?
-3-male_start_masturbating,target:9s=interested,I'm quite curious what's going through your mind.  The exact optimal jerking speed, factoring in fuel efficiency?
-3-male_start_masturbating,target:9s=seductive,Anyone on your mind, Little Dungeon Bot?  Someone at this table...or maybe your cute little "2B" partner?
-3-male_start_masturbating,target:9s=vain,What gets a robot going, huh?  If I could make a <i>machine</i> like me, I'm officially the most gorgeous woman alive.
-3-male_masturbating=laughing,So, Jura Basil Elden is standing nude in front of you.  Kinda automatically makes this the best masturbation session you've ever had, huh?
-3-male_masturbating=vain,There's something so <i>exotic</i> about a man ogling me.  I'm too used to women doing it.
-3-male_masturbating=teasing,Earth men are all over women, right?  Well...ever been with a woman like <i>me</i>?
-3-male_masturbating=seductive,Let me see that seed of yours, ~name~.  If you're lucky, it might have a home in my womb.
-3-male_masturbating=seductive-2,Oh, my.  Nude, and so close to a man pleasuring himself...Barnette would be having a fit.
-3-male_masturbating,target:9s=laughing,Hey, 9S.  You're thinking about how much you want to...well, you know.  Aren't you?
-3-male_masturbating,target:9s=vain,I just can't get over the look on your face, honey.  A robot in ecstasy!  Marvelous.
-3-male_masturbating,target:9s=thinking,Seriously, I'm wondering what a robot thinks about when he masturbates.  I can't even figure out <i>human</i> men.
-3-male_masturbating,target:9s=thinking,It's hard to find this erotic when I'm confused about your gender <i>and</i> your mechanics.
-3-male_finished_masturbating=shocked,H-hey, not on the breasts!  Or the face!  Or the hair!
-3-male_finished_masturbating=teasing,Hey, keep your seed where I can reach it.  Unless you expect me to scoop it off the floor.
-3-male_finished_masturbating=bored,Well, there goes <i>that</i> sample.  Should've brought a cup to catch it in.
-3-male_finished_masturbating=confused,So if I wanted to take that stuff home, would I have to keep it cold?
-3-male_finished_masturbating=laughing,Wow.  It's like you shot your soul out...and got some on my leg.
-3-male_finished_masturbating,target:corrin_m=shocked,<i>Eeeeeek!  I knew men were monsters!  How dare you try to enter my womb</i>!
-3-male_finished_masturbating,target:corrin_m=shocked,<i>Wait!  I take it all back!  I don't want man-beasts clawing at my breasts!  Stay away from my womb</i>!
-3-male_finished_masturbating,target:corrin_m=bored,...I don't want talons anywhere near my cervix.  Earth women can have you for themselves.
-3-male_finished_masturbating,target:corrin_m=shocked,<i>Wha--wha--a monster!  Stay back!  I have a girlfriend-and she has guns!  I don't need men</i>!
-3-male_finished_masturbating,target:jin=shocked,<i>Eep</i>!  W-why's it glowing so much?  The book just said it was pearly, not <i>radioactive</i>!
-3-male_finished_masturbating,target:jin=awkward,...Uh, did I miss a paragraph in the book?  Does men's sperm come out all lustrous and then fade?
-3-male_finished_masturbating,target:jin=seductive,Oh, wow!  Does it really glow that much?  That looks like <i>I'd</i> glow if you came inside me.
-3-male_finished_masturbating,target:jin=seductive,Wow, men's seed is even more glorious than I imagined!  You must pump your heart and soul into that stuff to make it shine like that!
-3-male_finished_masturbating,target:9s=awkward,<i>Let me see it, now</i>!  ...Where is it?  You know, your seed?
-3-male_finished_masturbating,target:9s=angry,...Do you seriously not have any seed?  The one thing I was most interested in?
-3-male_finished_masturbating,target:9s=bored,...Oh.  You're a machine, so you don't have the <i>semen</i> stuff.  Well, you're worthless to me, then.
-3-male_finished_masturbating,target:9s=angry,Wha--w-where's all the seed?  I wanted to see men's <i>sperm</i> things!  Hey!
-3-female_must_masturbate=laughing,Come on, ~name~, I wasn't even paying attention to the game!  Are Earth women really that inexperienced?
-3-female_must_masturbate=laughing,Meia doesn't know about the masturbation rule.  The look on her face is gonna be <i>priceless</i>.
-3-female_must_masturbate=interested,Poor showing for Earth, ~name~.  I was literally just throwing random cards back.
-3-female_must_masturbate=vain,Wait till I tell Meia I didn't crack under pressure.  Maybe she'll let me practice leading the squadron for once.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:aimee=teasing,Now if you could masturbate with the <i>bullets</i>, that'd <i>really</i> impress me.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:aimee=smug,Surely she doesn't have to do it, right?  I mean, she already came earlier.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:aimee=interested,We'd better find some cover, considering how she made herself cum <i>last</i> time.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:aimee=teasing,Well, <i>this</i> is a predicament.  Or is your aim good enough to <i>juuust</i> graze yourself to orgasm?
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:meia,alsoPlaying:kyu=vain,Hey, <i>I'm</i> fun.  Meia barely knows what "fun" means.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:meia,alsoPlaying:kyu=stretching,Hey, don't give Meia any credit for all the fun <i>I'm</i> bringing.  Her job is to stand there and look miserable.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:meia,alsoPlaying:kyu=teasing,It's a hard life being a pirate, Miss Pixie!  So I try to make it fun for myself, while Meia is content is live in misery.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:meia,alsoPlaying:kyu=vain,It's nice to be appreciated for lighting up a room the way I do.  I have to work extra hard when Meia's killing the mood nearby.
-3-female_must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:meia,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0,priority:1001=smug,And you were <i>this</i> close to finding out by making <i>me</i> do it.
-3-female_must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:meia,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0,priority:1001=seductive-2,Close one.  I thought it might have been <i>me</i> breaking the secret to you!  How awkward would <i>that</i> be?
-3-female_must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:meia,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0,priority:1001=vain,Oh, calm down.  I'm one loss away from doing it too, and you don't see fear in <i>my</i> eyes.
-3-female_must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:meia,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0,priority:1001=teasing,What's the big deal, boss?  Aren't you <i>proud</i> of your body?
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:meia,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0,priority:1001=laughing,I really didn't think we'd be this even--or that you'd lose first.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:meia,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0,priority:1001=teasing,OK, so <i>maybe</i> I should have told you about that.  But cool, stoic Meia Gisborn can handle surprises!
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:meia,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0,priority:1001=smug,I knew you wouldn't come otherwise.  Like you have a body to be ashamed of displaying or something.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:meia,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0,priority:1001=teasing,That's the price you pay for losing, honey.  Gotta gather your intel before charging into a mission!
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:alpha,marker:planet-countries=confused,What's a <i>yoo-ess-bee</i>?  Something only Planet Japan has?
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:alpha=thinking,"Yoo-ess-bees" make you real?  Do <i>I</i> have one without even knowing it?
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:alpha=smug,Oh look, she's actually speaking instead of singing.  And even then, she's goin on about nonsense like "yoo-ess-bees."
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:alpha=stretching,A "yoo-ess-bee"?  Sounds like some fancy gadget Parfet would understand.  Is Miss Popstar a secret genius?
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:amalia=smug,I can only <i>dream</i> of how embarrassed you must be, dear.  There's no possible chance you're actually an exhibitionist.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:amalia=laughing,This must be <i>so</i> devastating.  Surely you don't get off on being watched like us lecherous commoners.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:amalia=stretching,Oh, woe is you!  A princess forced to exhibit her base desires like her lowly subjects.  No chance she's into it.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:amalia=teasing,Nobility, reduced to her primal instincts for an audience...it's a good thing you're so above it all.
-3-female_must_masturbate,saidMarker:1v1=teasing,Too bad, honey.  Show me how an Earth girl does it...and maybe, <i>just maybe</i>, I'll show you how a Mejarian does.
-3-female_must_masturbate,saidMarker:1v1=vain,Really came down to the wire there.  And honestly, what more could an Earth woman hope for against a fearsome Mejarian pirate?
-3-female_must_masturbate,saidMarker:1v1=teasing,<i>You nasty little thing, losing to me like that</i>.  Now I'm all worked up, and my sweet Barnette is going to have to do something about that!
-3-female_must_masturbate,saidMarker:1v1=stretching,<i>Yawn</i>...oh, did I beat you all alone like that?  I hardly even noticed, it was so easy.
-3-female_must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,Come on, ~name~, I wasn't even paying attention to the game!  Are Earth women really that inexperienced?
-3-female_must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:meia=interested,Poor showing for Earth, ~name~.  I was literally just throwing random cards back.
-3-female_must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,Look, Meia, I didn't crack under pressure.  Feel like letting me lead the squadron for a change?
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:meia=vain,Well, Meia, we sure hung around together.  I'm going to keep on hanging, thanks.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:meia=laughing,<i>You</i> lost to <i>me</i>?  Something tells me you <i>wanted</i> this.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:meia=interested,Yeah, I don't buy this whole losing-to-me thing, Meia.  I think the idea of masturbating for these Earth people has gotten you all excited.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:meia=vain,<i>I</i> beat you?  Cool, collected Meia Gisborn?  All the stars have aligned.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:vriska=smug,Oh, what's the big deal?  Masturbating in front of us would be less embarrassing than the state you're in now.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:vriska=interested,Dealer, doesn't this count as naked?  Hasn't she lost now?  Come on.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:vriska=interested,Come <i>on</i>, Vriska.  You're naked.  You lost.  It's OK.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:vriska=laughing,Everyone loses eventually, sweetie.  Even cheaters with speech impediments.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:streaming-chan=laughing,What are you--oh.  <i>Oh</i>.  So you're <i>that</i> kind of woman...a toy woman.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:streaming-chan=stretching,Toys, huh?  Yeah, I can see you poor single women resorting to them without a girlfriend around.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:streaming-chan=teasing,A <i>toy</i>?  What, don't you Earth girls have pet men you summon to ravish you on command?
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:streaming-chan=vain,Should've known Miss Media would use a toy--the most conspicuous way to get yourself off, besides enlisting a partner.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:rainbow_mika=laughing,What now, Miss Wrestler?  Is your partner going to help you <i>masturbate</i>, too?
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:rainbow_mika=teasing,Well, there's only one thing that girl can help you with now, honey.  If you're up to task, of course.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:rainbow_mika=teasing,Is your partner going all the way with "assisting" you?  Because that would make this Mejarian feel right at home.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:rainbow_mika=vain,Well, you should know the drill, dear.  Or will you invite your partner along for <i>this</i>, too?
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:nagisa=laughing,You're putting on a <i>performance</i> for us?  Isn't that what the masturbation is anyway?
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:nagisa=teasing,Hey, honey--if you want to put on a play, play with <i>yourself</i>.  That's what we all came here for.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:nagisa=smug,Yeah, Mejare has some plays I know of.  Mostly about men eating a poor helpless woman, then getting gutted themselves.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:nagisa=vain,A play, huh?  Let's see if it's more riveting than the man-killing, rough-and-tumble world of Mejarian theater.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:nagisa=smug,Oh, you're doing a play?  I was never big on theater myself--my own life as a pilot is far more interesting, after all.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:morrigan=bored,<i>Now how does a succubus do it</i>--oh.  She gets help.  Makes sense.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:morrigan=shocked,<i>Eeep  W-where'd she come from?  Help</i>!
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:morrigan=shocked,Who's "Lilith"?  Wait, where'd <i>she</i> come from?  Help!  No!
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:morrigan=stretching,Oh, you brought a friend to help?  Just like a succubus...then again, I should've brought Barnette.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:moon=frustrated,Great.  Yeah.  Masturbate instead of seeking medical attention.  See if <i>I</i> care.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:moon=bored,...Sometimes I wonder why I like teasing people so much.  Maybe it's just to prove I can toe the line others can't.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:moon=frustrated,Some people you just can't help.  Or even talk to.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:moon=annoyed,What a shock.  Yeah, have fun.  Whatever.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:misato=teasing,Sure you've still got the coordination to <i>find</i> you vagina, Boozeball?  Either way, this'll be entertaining.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:misato=laughing,I think this works out perfectly.  Either you manage to masturbate and it's sexy, or you fall over and it's funny.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:misato=vain,Have fun pawing at both your vaginas, Miss Doublevision.  You look like you're going to fall asleep any minute now.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:misato=teasing,Sorry I couldn't drink too much with you, but I'm in enemy territory, after all.  Now have fun trying to find your vagina, Blurry-eyes.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=smug,Oh, <i>God</i>.  Miss Busybee has to masturbate now?  We're going to drown in her tears.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=laughing,Should we really make her do this?  She's so scared of her own body, she'll run in circles.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=vain,Maybe I'd have some sympathy if you had a body to be ashamed of.  As it stands, this embarrassment is an insult to poor ugly girls.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=interested,Do we really want to make her do this?  She's <i>already</i> a blubbering mess, and she's just standing around naked.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=stretching,Get the cleanup crew ready.  If this girl hasn't peed herself yet, she's going to do it now.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=stretching,<i>God</i>, Earth girls grow up soft.  Fighting men all your life really toughens you up!
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=stretching,Look, Florina masturbating is bad for everyone here.  She cries, and she annoys <i>us</i> in the process.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=teasing,I'm tempted to plant a big smooch right on your mouth, dear.  That'll shock you right out of your embarrassment!
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:felicia=teasing,Wow, you weren't kidding!  Come on, honey, what were you thinking?  Couldn't stuff yourself into an overcoat?
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:felicia=laughing,Well, you sure made this easy, honey.  That's what you get for showing up naked.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:felicia=stretching,Not much of a tease, are you?  Just up and arriving naked to start with.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:felicia=laughing,I thought you had clothes to start with, however skimpy, but no.  You were actually naked this whole time.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:sei=laughing,That last drink was the dagger, huh?  Maybe you would've held up otherwise.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:sei=interested,Looks like that last drink was the one that blurred out all the numbers on the cards.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:sei=teasing,All you've got, eh, dearie?  Did the alcohol finally reach your brain and short out your poker face?
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:sei=vain,A noble effort, made all the more tragic in how you just kept shooting yourself in the foot with that booze.  Now get to the good stuff.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:sei=seductive,You're a horny little blue ball of booze, aren't you?  You sound like you've been waiting for this--drunks aren't exactly subtle.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:elizabeth=shocked,It's been fun, Liz, but you--you--<i>there's more than one of you</i>.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:elizabeth=shocked,Well, Liz, it was nice getting to know--<i>both of you</i>.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:elizabeth=shocked,<i>Ack!  No!  The Harvest!  They're mulitplying!  Help</i>!
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:elizabeth=shocked,...<i>What?  What's happening?  Elizabeth</i>?
-3-female_start_masturbating=laughing,Get to it, ~name~.  I'll let you see whatever you want.
-3-female_start_masturbating=smug,Mejarians are masters at this sort of thing, believe me.  You won't surprise me.
-3-female_start_masturbating=smug,The Nirvana crew's got a bit of honor system going as to how long we can last.  No, we don't ask the men.
-3-female_start_masturbating=teasing,Save some fluids when you're done, because they're now the property of Magno Vivan's pirates.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:joey=seductive,Oh, my!  That's the biggest vibrator I've ever seen--I guess there's a lot more room on Earth!
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:joey=interested,Is this just a clown thing where everything is comically large?  Or more of a general Earth style?
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:joey=vain,A vibrator?  And my, it's enormous--and shaped like men's tubes!  All I need are Barnette's lovely fingers, not these massive toys.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:joey=vain,My, such <i>girth</i> on that thing!  Is this men's influence?  Because Mejare's toys are rather inconspicuous.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=laughing,<i>Ooh</i>.  Should've known a magical woman dressed in all scarlet would pull something like this...I think I'm good.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=teasing,That's...quite a lot of hands.  More than I think I could keep track of...<i>but that's half the fun</i>.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=vain,Not sure I like being tied up and fondled, dear...well, maybe with the right person.  A certain green-haired cutie, specifically.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=vain,To each her own, I suppose...that level of vulnerability is for Barnette's eyes only, as far as I'm concerned.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu=smug,And now Miss Pixie takes to the air to masturbate?  I don't know what I expected out of you.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu=teasing,I should've expected you to use those wings at some point, Miss Fairytale.  Now give me a good view.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu=laughing,I'd call you a skank for flying up and presenting to us, but I think you'd relish that.  So have your fun.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu=seductive,You're a little crazy, Miss Pixie, but you certainly put the effort in.  Check out that fairy flight!
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=shocked,<i>Wait, I was kidding!  Ack</i>!
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=shocked,<i>Wait, I wasn't serious!  Don't!  You'll kill us</i>!
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=awkward,<i>...I wasn't being serious.  Please don't catch anyone in the crossfire</i>.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=shocked,<i>Eek!  I said she should help you, not wrestle you</i>!
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:meia=seductive-2,You're wet already, you little nymph!  The sexless Meia I knew and loved, it was all a facade covering a public masturbator!
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:meia=interested,I didn't <i>really</i> think you were sexless, but I definitely had a hard time picturing you <i>doing</i> anything sexual.  Now you actually look pretty into it.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:meia=laughing,So do you approach this like your precious flight formations?  Rigidly scheduled and planned?  Because you look wet already.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:meia=teasing,After keeping your adorable body all wrapped up in that tight bodysuit, this has <i>got</i> to feel liberating.  And you look eager, too.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:morrigan=vain,<i>Oh, my</i>!  Just like me and Barnette...except we can't fly.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:morrigan=laughing,Maybe Barnette and I would try that position if one of us had wings.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:morrigan=seductive,You're certainly proving yourself to be every bit the succubus you claim to be, dear.  I'm falling under <i>both</i> your spells!
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:morrigan=teasing,Well, Miss Succubus, the addition of this "Lilith" is making me feel right at home.  That's how Mejarians have sex--mostly.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:nagisa=teasing,Well, here we go.  Take me on a thrilling, dramatic adventure...shy little sheltered Earth girl.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:nagisa=vain,This had better be more thrilling than what I do every day, you know.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:nagisa=teasing,Hey, coming here was like an anatomy and culture lesson already.  This story better be crazy!
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:nagisa=vain,I crave drama, you know...that's why I'm a ruthless pirate and cunning pilot.  So don't let me down with this story.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:shego=interested,Legs getting tired, dear?  Or are you afraid we won't see enough of you on the floor?
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:shego=laughing,Seems Miss Lean-and-Green's butt is a little too delicate for the cold floor...or maybe she's just a total exhibitionist.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:shego=seductive,Aww, does the poor bodysuited villain not like how cold the floor is on her little backside?  Take a chair and show off, then.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:shego=teasing,Yeah, standing all this time is a little grating.  But hey, you could hide a little more if you sat on the floor...maybe.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:aella=interested,You've <i>never</i> masturbated, huh?  Locked away in a house all your life and your hands never wandered south of the border?
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:aella=teasing,What are you, a robot?  <i>Everyone</i> masturbates, dearie...unless you're <i>that</i> popular with the girls.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:aella=stretching,Yeah, you've never masturbated.  <i>Mm-hm</i>.  And I've never taken a bath.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:aella=smug,Oh, give me a break, honey.  Sex I can see people shying away from, but never <i>masturbating</i>?  Does your heart not beat?
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:aella=interested,Ooh, Miss Big-Boned over here has never masturbated.  That's why you came to a public strip poker game, right?
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:aella=teasing,Never masturbated, huh?  You must think you're better than the rest of us, Miss Chastity.  Well, <i>you're missing out</i>.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:hermione=laughing,<i>Oh, my</i>!  That's <i>one</i> way to use magic, you little skank!  But I understand.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:hermione=interested,Well, dear, you're not fooling anyone with the good-girl act now.  That's way too many hands to be wholesome.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:hermione=vain,Now <i>that</i> looks pretty magical.  Suddenly my two-handed approach with Barnette seems inadequate.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:hermione=teasing,<i>My, my, my</i>!  Miss Witch knows what she wants, alright.  And she's not afraid to magic her way there.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:moon=sad,I'm honestly rethinking my entire life.  You're like a prophetic angel.  I shouldn't come to these sorts of places.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:moon=frustrated,Are you an apparition sent to punish me for being curious about men?
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:moon=sad,You don't have to whore yourself out for money.  Just come to Mejare...you'll make excellent anti-men propaganda.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:moon=bored,For the first time in my life, I'm regretting a decision.  Coming here was a bad idea.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=laughing,Barnette's got a few toys...which have helped give us some perspective on men's tubes.  But not <i>quite</i> that big.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=teasing,Toys are hard to come by on Mejare, you know...they're symbols of men.  Unless you're a pirate, where you get your pick.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=stretching,I can't believe you carry that unwieldy thing around.  Earth women can't go five minutes without something phallic!
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=vain,Such ridiculous things...Barnette's lovely fingers are all I need to be happy.  And maybe her gun-shaped toys.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:aimee=shocked,O-oh, you're--using the gun.  ...Maybe you should unload it first?
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:aimee=shocked,...OK, I call Barnette a gun nut, but she doesn't go <i>that</i> far.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:aimee=awkward,...Barnette has some toys shaped like guns.  Just for fun, you know?  But...the <i>real thing</i>?
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:aimee=awkward,...I really thought you were cool, but now I'm worried.  Isn't that kind of dangerous?
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:vriska=shocked,Wha--you--<i>oh dear</i>.  Maybe we <i>should</i> let her keep playing.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:vriska=shocked,...I take it back.  Let her keep playing, Dealer.  Let her leave, actually.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:vriska=awkward,...Oh my.  That die <i>really</i> hates you.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:vriska=bored,...This is getting too weird for me.  Earth is a strange planet.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:amalia=awkward,...Oh.  OK.  Well, way to prove me wrong right away.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:amalia=shocked,Uh...<i>what are you doing?  I was just teasing</i>!
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:amalia=shocked,...I was just kidding around!  It was a joke!  You don't have to...uh...
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:amalia=awkward,...Or you could go ahead and actually be an exhibitionist.  That works too, I guess.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:florina=seductive,Oh look, she's going to sing to make herself feel better!  That's...actually kind of sweet.  I think I like you, darling!
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:florina=seductive,Ooh, a song?  Sorry I made fun--I <i>love</i> music!  Go for it, cutie.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:florina=teasing,Yeah, I try to make Barnette sing, too.  But that's by accident...and the tune's all over the place.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:florina=excited,You are just so <i>unbearably</i> cute.  Now you're <i>singing</i>?  I just want to squeeze you!
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:videl=excited,Wow, you <i>are</i> flying!  I'm so much taller, it was hard to tell--<i>how're you doing that</i>?
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:videl=seductive,Hard to be sure in crazy places like this, but you've been flying this whole time, Videl!  I should've noticed!
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:videl=excited,Videl!  Videl!  Omigosh, can you teach me how to fly?  I don't see any wings, so that means I can learn, right?
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:videl=vain,Can you show me how to fly, Videl?  That'd make the most talented woman alive in addition to the most beautiful!
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,OK.  Yes.  This is happening now.  Elizabeth is capable of this.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,Neat powers, Elizabeth.  Real...real <i>Mejarian</i>.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,Who...who <i>are</i> you?  Which one is Elizabeth?
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,I--I thought you were just a sweet little Earth girl!  Who are you?
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:alpha=shocked,...OK.  Yeah.  I'm starting to believe you about this <i>virtual</i> business.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:alpha=awkward,That's...new.  Nice color shift.  Glad I could see you become a real woman.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:alpha=shocked,<i>Eek</i>!  I-I mean, uh, great skin tone there, Alpha.  Much more natural.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:alpha=awkward,...Well, it worked.  I shouldn't have doubted you...but I still don't understand you.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:felicia=shocked,<i>Gah</i>!  W-where'd you keep that thing?  It's enormous...and phallic!
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:felicia=laughing,A <i>vibrator</i>?  Never seen one shaped like that...must be like a man's tube.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:felicia=smug,Figures Earth women would even have <i>toys</i> shaped like men's things.  Can't you be independent?
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:felicia=vain,Oh, of course.  I should've known any toys on this planet would resemble men's tubes.  You Earth girls are hopeless.
-3-female_masturbating=seductive,You know, I fell in love with Barnette when we got trapped in asteroid field together...think you could excite me just as much?
-3-female_masturbating=seductive-2,Don't feel bad.  Barnette can't control herself when I'm nude either.
-3-female_masturbating=teasing,You don't have to explain anything, ~name~.  I'll shake whatever part you want me to.
-3-female_masturbating=teasing,Feeling good, ~name~?  I could make you feel <i>amazing</i>.
-3-female_masturbating=teasing,That feeling washing over you is the awakening of your love for the female body.  <i>Embrace it</i>.
-3-female_masturbating=teasing,Feel that tingling in your heart?  The Mejarian's touch.
-3-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=teasing,<i>Hoo</i>.  Well, at least you seem like you're in control.  Have fun, girls!
-3-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=seductive,Well, you're not killing anyone, so fine by me.  This is fun to watch!
-3-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=teasing,Just stand a safe distance away...this <i>is</i> pretty sexy.
-3-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=seductive,I <i>knew</i> you two were lovers!  Can't keep your hands off each other...or anything else.
-3-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=vain,As long as you don't clothesline me, you can keep this up all you want, cuties.  Just watch those muscles ripple!
-3-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=seductive,Barnette and I aren't as strong as you two, but maybe I should take notes anyway.
-3-female_masturbating,target:kyu=seductive,Hey, Miss Love Fairy.  I know you've got wings, but share the magic a little!  <i>I</i> want to fly too, you know!
-3-female_masturbating,target:kyu=vain,Now <i>this</i> is a good use of wings.  Who wants to sit on the nasty old ground to masturbate?
-3-female_masturbating,target:kyu=interested,I like your style, Miss Pixie.  You were born with wings, and now you've found the perfect use for them.
-3-female_masturbating,target:kyu=stretching,Yeah, I'd probably fly like that, too.  But <i>some</i> fairies just won't share their magic with the rest of us.
-3-female_masturbating,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:8=teasing,I can't believe I met <i>two</i> women who can fly...and that both would use it for such <i>unsavory</i> reasons.  <i>Teach me</i>!
-3-female_masturbating,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:8=vain,Two women showing off the goods in the air, and neither will bother to show me how!  <i>I</i> want to fly, too, you know.
-3-female_masturbating,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:8=seductive,Hey, what's a beautiful woman got to do to get some flying lessons?  <i>I</i> want to join in on the airborne fun you two are having!
-3-female_masturbating,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:8=vain,You damn Earthling teases are keeping secrets from me!  Can't a gorgeous girl like me learn to fly, too?  I learned to pilot!
-3-female_masturbating,target:gwen=smug,...I can't really fault you for this.  If <i>I</i> had spider-web powers, I'd give that a try, too.
-3-female_masturbating,target:gwen=teasing,I'm going to go ahead and guess this isn't <i>all</i> you use that webbing for...if you've got someone else with you.
-3-female_masturbating,target:gwen=vain,That webbing looks like quite a bit of fun!  If only I could give it a try with Barnette.
-3-female_masturbating,target:gwen=seductive,Hey, I like those angles you're pulling, cutie!  Go upside down again!
-3-female_masturbating,target:vriska=confused,You, uh, holding up over there, Vriska?  Wriggling free sometime soon?
-3-female_masturbating,target:vriska=frustrated,...I'm just going to assume she's into this.  I really don't want to touch her.
-3-female_masturbating,target:vriska=bored,...I think I would've preferred you <i>gaining</i> clothes, Vriska.
-3-female_masturbating,target:vriska=bored,That magic was cool, but <i>yeesh</i>.  What a weirdo...
-3-female_masturbating,target:rinkah=laughing,Did you just--you <i>did</i>!  You're such a beast of a woman, Rinkah...
-3-female_masturbating,target:rinkah=laughing,Are you putting your finger where I think you are?  You've done nothing but confirm stereotypes all evening...you <i>animal</i>.
-3-female_masturbating,target:rinkah=smug,I guess Miss Warrior is so tempered from all her harsh battles, she needs to stick fingers in her rear to feel anything.
-3-female_masturbating,target:rinkah=teasing,I don't know what I expected from you, Miss Fireball, but a finger in the butt checks out.  Barnette and I would never be that dirty.
-3-female_masturbating,target:videl=teasing,At least you're making this interesting, just bobbing up and down like that...<i>you're such a pervert</i>.
-3-female_masturbating,target:videl=vain,Just gliding along, letting your instincts guide you...<i>oh, to be young again</i>!  Well, younger.
-3-female_masturbating,target:videl=seductive,If only I could fly like you and make my beauty more fully visible.  Do you realize how lucky you are?
-3-female_masturbating,target:videl=seductive,Videl, Videl, <i>Videl</i>!  You're a complete package, dear--cute, fit, adorable pigtails, and superpowers!
-3-female_masturbating,target:marceline=confused,What exactly is letting you float like that?  You've been doing it all game, and it doesn't even look strenuous.
-3-female_masturbating,target:marceline=seductive,You're inhuman in so many ways...no eyes, blue skin, floating.  But you sure masturbate like a normal girl.
-3-female_masturbating,target:marceline=teasing,I guess you're pretty human after all, Eyeballs.  Just look at you floating there, having the time of your life!
-3-female_masturbating,target:marceline=teasing,Going to perform any fancy tricks for us, Miss Levitator?  Masturbate upside down or something?
-3-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=awkward,...I guess you don't need a girlfriend, do you?
-3-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=awkward,...You know, I didn't peg you as the kind of girl who'd be open to this sort of thing.  Or that had superpowers.
-3-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=awkward,You know, I've done that...with Barnette.  You know, <i>another</i> woman.  Not myself.
-3-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=thinking,Now I'm curious how good a clone of me would be at this sort of thing...
-3-female_masturbating,target:aimee=awkward,I'm...kind of worried about you, Aimee.  Is there something we should know about men's guns?
-3-female_masturbating,target:aimee=bored,I'd definitely give Barnette an intervention if she started masturbating with loaded guns.
-3-female_masturbating,target:aimee=smug,That thing is gonna make a bigger racket than even <i>you</i> are.
-3-female_masturbating,target:aimee=awkward,This is getting way too weird for me, Aimee.  The clothes thing was cool, but <i>this</i>?  It's a death wish!
-3-female_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=interested,Holding up, dear?  You seem a little incapable of saying the safe word.
-3-female_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=stretching,I guess when you've got superpowers at your disposal, you need to feel unsafe for once to be excited.
-3-female_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=laughing,See, this is why I don't want magic.  <i>This</i> is the kind of thing I'd need to get a thrill again.
-3-female_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=laughing,Hanging in there, Miss Bloodred?  Any tighter and it won't just be your outfit that's scarlet.
-3-female_masturbating,target:uravity=vain,You're so rude, Ochako, to not share your levitation powers with everyone else.  I share my beauty!
-3-female_masturbating,target:uravity=smug,Miss Gravity is certainly making the best use of her powers that <i>I</i> could think of.  Shame the rest of us can't join in.
-3-female_masturbating,target:uravity=seductive,Are you <i>sure</i> you were born with these powers?  There isn't some crazy Earth doctor I can visit to fly, too?
-3-female_masturbating,target:uravity=vain,Is there nothing crueler than showing off the powers the rest of us can't enjoy?  At least <i>I</i> can't hide how beautiful I am.
-3-female_masturbating,target:shego=teasing,Hey, honey, I'm been talking dirty all game...no sense waiting till the end on <i>that</i> front.
-3-female_masturbating,target:shego=laughing,Just listen to the things coming out of Green-bean's mouth!  She's trying to catch up to what I've been doing all evening.
-3-female_masturbating,target:shego=teasing,Too bad I got such a head start on the dirty talk, because Shego's doing her best now to match me.
-3-female_masturbating,target:shego=seductive,You've got a filthy mouth on you to match the green complexion.  Can't you be a sweetheart for once?
-3-female_masturbating,target:amalia=excited,Omigosh, is that vine doing what men's tubes do?  It looks like it!  Show me more!
-3-female_masturbating,target:amalia=awkward,...I was just ribbing you about being naughty.  I guess I was right...or I really got to you.
-3-female_masturbating,target:amalia=excited,Ooh, show me more angles!  That's <i>so cool</i>...it's like a really long men's tube, right?  Right?
-3-female_masturbating,target:amalia=laughing,You really <i>are</i> a little skank!  I should've known all princesses are like this, all sheltered and itching for adventure.
-3-female_masturbating,target:amalia=laughing,Can't reach orgasm without a giant tube shoved inside of you, huh?  Glad I didn't grow up stuck with men for my sexual needs.
-3-female_masturbating,target:meia=teasing,So who's on your mind, Meia?  <i>Valore</i>?  <i>Misty</i>?  <i>Hi-bi-ki</i>?
-3-female_masturbating,target:meia=seductive-2,Have these horrible men corrupted even <i>your</i> prude heart, Meia?  Is your mind drifting towards thoughts of tubes and seed?
-3-female_masturbating,target:meia=vain,Plenty of eye candy, am I right?  I'm always happy to help my squadron leader, no matter what she's doing.
-3-female_masturbating,target:meia=vain,You can masturbate to me, boss.  It won't make things weird, I promise.
-3-female_masturbating,target:meia=teasing,Hey, you already lost.  Don't worry about silly old dignity.
-3-female_masturbating,target:meia=teasing,This is your one and only chance to masturbate to your beautiful crewmate without Barnette getting all miffed.  Use it well.
-3-female_masturbating,target:meia=interested,So are you this nice to yourself when you do it alone in your bedroom?  I sure hope so.
-3-female_masturbating,target:moon=frustrated,Please don't look at me.  Please don't talk.  I'm very afraid.
-3-female_masturbating,target:moon=frustrated,God, just let it end already...I'll go straight after this, I promise.
-3-female_masturbating,target:moon=bored,Yes.  Cute.  Elegant.  You have the grace of those swans I see in zoos.
-3-female_masturbating,target:moon=bored,Marvelous.  Having fun, Moon?  Good.  Glad, even.
-3-female_masturbating,target:morrigan=teasing,I was hoping to learn something new here to surprise Barnette tomorrow evening...or maybe even when I get back.
-3-female_masturbating,target:morrigan=vain,It's so comforting to see two women enjoying each others' bodies.  I thought Earth had never heard of such a thing!
-3-female_masturbating,target:morrigan=stretching,Par for the course where I'm from, Morrigan--sorry it's not leaving an impact.  Well, Mejarians don't fly, but still.
-3-female_masturbating,target:morrigan=vain,Hey, keep it up, Miss Succubus.  You're making my heart swell with memories of my darling Barnette--it's hard to be away from her!
-3-female_finished_masturbating=vain,Yeah, I have that effect on women.  <i>Especially</i> nude.
-3-female_finished_masturbating=vain,Barnette's been dating me forever and still can't handle me, so don't feel bad.
-3-female_finished_masturbating=laughing,The idea of Meia reaching orgasm is hysterical.  She'd probably think the Harvest got a hold of her brain.
-3-female_finished_masturbating=vain,I remember when all it took for Barnette was to see me nude.  Good thing my fingers can pick up the slack.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:aimee=shocked,A-ah!  See?  I <i>told</i> you!
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:aimee=bored,...Yeah, <i>definitely</i> making sure Barnette doesn't go this far.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:aimee=bored,Guess we all knew that was coming, but I wanted to believe you'd pull it off.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:aimee=frustrated,...I think I prefer <i>Barnette's</i> level of gun-hobby.  As in, not shooting herself.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:amalia=stretching,<i>And it just dumps you off, disgusted with your behavior</i>.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:amalia=smug,Earth women are so bestial, having sex with men and plants in equal measures.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:amalia=laughing,You ought to be ashamed of yourself, young lady!  Now go get your servant to clean you up!
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:amalia=vain,Looks like Little Miss Princess was just another dirty commoner, begging to be ravished and tossed aside.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:vriska=shocked,Wha--<i>ew!  W-what's all that blue stuff?  Don't get it on me!  It's gross</i>!
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:vriska=shocked,<i>Ack!  F-fluid!  B-blue fluid everywhere!  Is it poisonous</i>?
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:vriska=shocked,<i>Eeek!  V-Vriska!  What is this?  What did you do?  Why are you leaking blue stuff</i>?
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:vriska=shocked,<i>Ack!  K-keep that stuff away from me!  It's corrosive, isn't it?  M-magic corrosive blue fluid</i>!
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:uravity=seductive,And she just plops down like a doofus!  You get cuter the longer I look at you, darling.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:uravity=laughing,Have a good time, Miss Gravity?  Seems like you lost control of your little floating maneuver.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:uravity=teasing,I think you might be the most adorable girl I've ever met, from stuffing your figure into that suit to just plopping on the ground.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:uravity=laughing,Ha!  I guess you really <i>have</i> overcome your embarrassment, to just drop down like that.  Or maybe that was an accident.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:moon=bored,Nice finish.  The white fluid really stands out against your blackened labia.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:moon=annoyed,Class act, these Earth girls.  Absolutely marvelous to behold.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:moon=annoyed,Would you believe I thought I was superior to Earth girls?  Moon here's shown me I have a long way to go.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:moon=bored,Perfect.  Yeah.  Mm-hm.  Glad you had fun.  See you next time.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:meia=vain,I tend to have this effect on women, but I really thought <i>you</i> of all people might be immune to it.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:meia=seductive-2,Meia, Meia, Meia.  <i>I'll never see you the same way after this</i>!
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:meia=laughing,Really thought you'd stay dry as a bone, like your tone usually is.  But it looks like we need to hit the showers when we get back to the ship.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:meia=seductive,Think we would have had fun doing it together?  <i>I do</i>.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:meia=seductive,We've been through a lot, you and I.  This doesn't strain things...<i>not one bit</i>.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:meia=teasing,I didn't know you felt this way about me, Meia.  I'm sure I can convince Barnette to let you join us, if you want.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:meia=laughing,Is this the <i>real you</i>, Meia?  Is this the side you've always hidden from us?
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=vain,I knew Earth girls could love each other the way we do.  Men are just so superfluous!
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=seductive,Talk about a Mejarian power couple.  You're stronger than the men I know anyway!
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=teasing,I like the idea of men just picking me up...but it seems like you two could do that anyway.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=vain,I guess Earth isn't so different from Mejare after all.  Two strong women in love!  ...Like me and Barnette.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:launch=seductive,Ooh, the blue one again!  If you weren't so unstable, I'd invite you back for a drink, cutie.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:launch=vain,Oh, thank God, the blue one's back.  Good to see a woman who's polite and sincere in my line of work!
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:launch=interested,Just in time.  I wasn't looking forward to hearing your counterpart bellyache about losing.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:launch=teasing,Just the hair color I wanted to see!  You're so much nicer to be around, even if you're kind of a doormat.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:black_canary=angry,<i>Oooow</i>!  Hey, shut up, you freak!
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:black_canary=angry,<i>Ow</i>!  What was <i>that</i> for?  <i>Ugh</i>!
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:black_canary=angry,<i>Oooooow</i>!  Ooh, the <i>nerve</i> of some people!  Take your weird voice powers and beat it, freak!
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:black_canary=annoyed,<i>AM I TALKING TOO LOUD?  I THINK I JUST WENT DEAF</i>.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,Yeah, I have that effect on women.  <i>Especially</i> nude.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,Barnette's been dating me forever and still can't handle me, so don't feel bad.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,I remember when all it took for Barnette was to see me nude.  Good thing my fingers can pick up the slack.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:morrigan=seductive,What, she's leaving?  Stay a while!  We can talk about woman relationships together!
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:morrigan=seductive,Hey, don't leave so soon, dear!  You're a steal yourself--I can tell you more about more girlfriend!
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:morrigan=seductive,Aww, don't leave, honey!  We just got to meet each other, and you spent it all underneath Morrigan's butt!
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:morrigan=vain,<i>Leave if you must.  I guess I'm not beautiful enough to warrant sticking around</i>.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,...That ended as quickly as it began.  What <i>was</i> that?
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,You don't even seem bothered!  W-why didn't you say you could do stuff like that?
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:elizabeth=awkward,...And this sort of thing just comes naturally to you?  Didn't bat an eye?
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,OK.  Yes.  It's over now, apparently.  Very enlightening, Elizabeth.  Never judge by appearances.

-2-male_must_masturbate=smug,Time to see what a man does at his most instinctual...next to a woman doing the same.
-2-male_must_masturbate=interested,Too bad, ~name~.  But now we can have some fun together, right?
-2-male_must_masturbate=smug,This is better anyway, ~name~.  Unless masturbating is super painful for men or something.
-2-male_must_masturbate=vain,Don't get so down on yourself.  You beat a Mejarian ace pilot...and now you get to ogle her.
-2-male_must_masturbate=teasing,Hey, you still outwitted a Mejarian.  Better than I expected from a man.
-2-male_must_masturbate=vain,Don't feel bad.  Now we get to masturbate together...and I bet you've never done it to a woman of <i>my</i> caliber.
-2-male_must_masturbate,target:captain_falcon=teasing,Well, Mr. Shouts-a-minute, now you get to yell at us and have it actually be appropriate.  Go nuts.
-2-male_must_masturbate,target:captain_falcon=laughing,You were shouting enough already, so I shudder to think at how noisy you'll be <i>now</i>.
-2-male_must_masturbate,target:captain_falcon=stretching,Oh, good.  The man who already wouldn't shut up has to <i>masturbate</i> now.  Can't we just make him leave?
-2-male_must_masturbate,target:captain_falcon=laughing,Well, I'll learn about men from this, but you might deafen me in the process.
-2-male_must_masturbate,target:9s=smug,And now for the <i>ultimate</i> test of your humanity.  If he bleeds, he masturbates.
-2-male_must_masturbate,target:9s=stretching,Well, time to cast aside your artificiality, honey.  Let's see if a fake man can outperform a real one!
-2-male_must_masturbate,target:9s=vain,Don't feel bad if your fakeness makes this weird for you.  I don't have much frame of reference.
-2-male_must_masturbate,target:9s=seductive,<i>Have fun, dear</i>!  Do you have to rev yourself up a bit, or are you actually like a real person in this regard?
-2-male_start_masturbating=interested,This is enough of a view for a man, right?  I mean, normally you just have your imagination for this.
-2-male_start_masturbating=seductive,Do men do this all the time?  You can tell me...I'll let the crew know.
-2-male_start_masturbating=excited,I came to see this...and maybe I'll cum to the sight of it.
-2-male_start_masturbating=vain,Barnette would have a fit if she knew I was doing this with a man so close...<i>she's so protective of me</i>.
-2-male_start_masturbating,target:9s=laughing,What does an android think about, exactly?  Silicone breasts?  Mechanical hips?
-2-male_start_masturbating,target:9s=interested,I'm quite curious what's going through your mind.  The exact optimal jerking speed, factoring in fuel efficiency?
-2-male_start_masturbating,target:9s=seductive,Anyone on your mind, Little Dungeon Bot?  Someone at this table...or maybe your cute little "2B" partner?
-2-male_start_masturbating,target:9s=vain,What gets a robot going, huh?  If I could make a <i>machine</i> like me, I'm officially the most gorgeous woman alive.
-2-male_masturbating=vain,I'll show <i>whatever</i> you want.  Hands off the merchandise, though.
-2-male_masturbating=teasing,I want to make sure your seed comes out, so feel free to submit requests.
-2-male_masturbating=seductive-2,Anything you want me to make visible, ~name~?  Who <i>knows</i> what gets men going...
-2-male_masturbating=vain,Don't actually spray any seed <i>on</i> me.  I'm an expensive commodity, so to speak.
-2-male_masturbating=seductive,So, ~name~, think that tube of yours could please me better than Barnette does?
-2-male_masturbating=stretching,Can't you go any faster?  Trust me, I can keep up.
-2-male_masturbating=seductive,I know I act all coy, ~name~...but this really <i>is</i> exciting!
-2-male_masturbating=seductive,Do you...think I'm beautiful, ~name~?  Women tell me that all the time...but I want to know what a <i>man</i> thinks.
-2-male_masturbating,target:9s=laughing,Hey, 9S.  You're thinking about how much you want to...well, you know.  Aren't you?
-2-male_masturbating,target:9s=vain,I just can't get over the look on your face, honey.  A robot in ecstasy!  Marvelous.
-2-male_masturbating,target:9s=thinking,Seriously, I'm wondering what a robot thinks about when he masturbates.  I can't even figure out <i>human</i> men.
-2-male_masturbating,target:9s=thinking,It's hard to find this erotic when I'm confused about your gender <i>and</i> your mechanics.
-2-male_finished_masturbating=frustrated,Ew!  What's all that goo?  ...<i>That's</i> seed?
-2-male_finished_masturbating=angry,Hey, I said <i>don't</i> get any on me!  Are you listening?
-2-male_finished_masturbating=awkward,Looks all warm and viscous...kinda gross.
-2-male_finished_masturbating=frustrated,Ew!  Ew!  It's getting everywhere!  Keep it out of my hair!
-2-male_finished_masturbating,target:jin=shocked,<i>Eep</i>!  W-why's it glowing so much?  The book just said it was pearly, not <i>radioactive</i>!
-2-male_finished_masturbating,target:jin=awkward,...Uh, did I miss a paragraph in the book?  Does men's sperm come out all lustrous and then fade?
-2-male_finished_masturbating,target:jin=seductive,Oh, wow!  Does it really glow that much?  That looks like <i>I'd</i> glow if you came inside me.
-2-male_finished_masturbating,target:jin=seductive,Wow, men's seed is even more glorious than I imagined!  You must pump your heart and soul into that stuff to make it shine like that!
-2-male_finished_masturbating,target:corrin_m=shocked,<i>Eeeeeek!  I knew men were monsters!  How dare you try to enter my womb</i>!
-2-male_finished_masturbating,target:corrin_m=shocked,<i>Wait!  I take it all back!  I don't want man-beasts clawing at my breasts!  Stay away from my womb</i>!
-2-male_finished_masturbating,target:corrin_m=bored,...I don't want talons anywhere near my cervix.  Earth women can have you for themselves.
-2-male_finished_masturbating,target:corrin_m=shocked,<i>Wha--wha--a monster!  Stay back!  I have a girlfriend-and she has guns!  I don't need men</i>!
-2-male_finished_masturbating,target:9s=awkward,<i>Let me see it, now</i>!  ...Where is it?  You know, your seed?
-2-male_finished_masturbating,target:9s=angry,...Do you seriously not have any seed?  The one thing I was most interested in?
-2-male_finished_masturbating,target:9s=bored,...Oh.  You're a machine, so you don't have the <i>semen</i> stuff.  Well, you're worthless to me, then.
-2-male_finished_masturbating,target:9s=angry,Wha--w-where's all the seed?  I wanted to see men's <i>sperm</i> things!  Hey!
-2-female_must_masturbate=interested,Just what I needed.  Women are easier on the eyes.
-2-female_must_masturbate=seductive-2,A <i>woman</i> masturbating?  Well, I never!
-2-female_must_masturbate=seductive-2,Women masturbating in public?  Why, what kind of sick place is this?
-2-female_must_masturbate=vain,Hey, you still outlasted Jura Basil Elden.  <i>That's</i> worth a little public humiliation.
-2-female_must_masturbate=stretching,Now you can go back to your hometown and tell everyone you masturbated with a gorgeous Mejarian space pirate.  What a poker game!
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:nagisa=laughing,You're putting on a <i>performance</i> for us?  Isn't that what the masturbation is anyway?
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:nagisa=teasing,Hey, honey--if you want to put on a play, play with <i>yourself</i>.  That's what we all came here for.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:nagisa=smug,Yeah, Mejare has some plays I know of.  Mostly about men eating a poor helpless woman, then getting gutted themselves.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:nagisa=vain,A play, huh?  Let's see if it's more riveting than the man-killing, rough-and-tumble world of Mejarian theater.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:nagisa=smug,Oh, you're doing a play?  I was never big on theater myself--my own life as a pilot is far more interesting, after all.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:morrigan=bored,<i>Now how does a succubus do it</i>--oh.  She gets help.  Makes sense.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:morrigan=shocked,<i>Eeep  W-where'd she come from?  Help</i>!
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:morrigan=shocked,Who's "Lilith"?  Wait, where'd <i>she</i> come from?  Help!  No!
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:morrigan=stretching,Oh, you brought a friend to help?  Just like a succubus...then again, I should've brought Barnette.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:alpha,marker:planet-countries=confused,What's a <i>yoo-ess-bee</i>?  Something only Planet Japan has?
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:alpha=thinking,"Yoo-ess-bees" make you real?  Do <i>I</i> have one without even knowing it?
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:alpha=smug,Oh look, she's actually speaking instead of singing.  And even then, she's goin on about nonsense like "yoo-ess-bees."
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:alpha=stretching,A "yoo-ess-bee"?  Sounds like some fancy gadget Parfet would understand.  Is Miss Popstar a secret genius?
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:misato=teasing,Sure you've still got the coordination to <i>find</i> you vagina, Boozeball?  Either way, this'll be entertaining.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:misato=laughing,I think this works out perfectly.  Either you manage to masturbate and it's sexy, or you fall over and it's funny.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:misato=vain,Have fun pawing at both your vaginas, Miss Doublevision.  You look like you're going to fall asleep any minute now.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:misato=teasing,Sorry I couldn't drink too much with you, but I'm in enemy territory, after all.  Now have fun trying to find your vagina, Blurry-eyes.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:meia=smug,My, my, my.  Well, isn't <i>this</i> awkward?
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:meia=smug,Bad time to lose, Meia.  Now we'll have to live the rest of our lives knowing we masturbated together.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:meia=excited,Ouch.  Now we have to do it together...because I'm not finished yet.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:meia=smug,Oh, dear.  This...has unfortunate implications.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:meia=laughing,I mean...<i>I</i> won't mind, but this seems like the kind of thing that'd bother you, Meia.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:meia=vain,Never before have I seen Meia Gisborn have such bad timing.  Your Vandread is so fast, after all.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:amalia=smug,I can only <i>dream</i> of how embarrassed you must be, dear.  There's no possible chance you're actually an exhibitionist.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:amalia=laughing,This must be <i>so</i> devastating.  Surely you don't get off on being watched like us lecherous commoners.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:amalia=stretching,Oh, woe is you!  A princess forced to exhibit her base desires like her lowly subjects.  No chance she's into it.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:amalia=teasing,Nobility, reduced to her primal instincts for an audience...it's a good thing you're so above it all.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:aimee=teasing,Now if you could masturbate with the <i>bullets</i>, that'd <i>really</i> impress me.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:aimee=smug,Surely she doesn't have to do it, right?  I mean, she already came earlier.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:aimee=interested,We'd better find some cover, considering how she made herself cum <i>last</i> time.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:aimee=teasing,Well, <i>this</i> is a predicament.  Or is your aim good enough to <i>juuust</i> graze yourself to orgasm?
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=smug,Oh, <i>God</i>.  Miss Busybee has to masturbate now?  We're going to drown in her tears.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=laughing,Should we really make her do this?  She's so scared of her own body, she'll run in circles.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=vain,Maybe I'd have some sympathy if you had a body to be ashamed of.  As it stands, this embarrassment is an insult to poor ugly girls.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=interested,Do we really want to make her do this?  She's <i>already</i> a blubbering mess, and she's just standing around naked.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=stretching,Get the cleanup crew ready.  If this girl hasn't peed herself yet, she's going to do it now.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=stretching,<i>God</i>, Earth girls grow up soft.  Fighting men all your life really toughens you up!
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=stretching,Look, Florina masturbating is bad for everyone here.  She cries, and she annoys <i>us</i> in the process.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=teasing,I'm tempted to plant a big smooch right on your mouth, dear.  That'll shock you right out of your embarrassment!
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:elizabeth=shocked,It's been fun, Liz, but you--you--<i>there's more than one of you</i>.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:elizabeth=shocked,Well, Liz, it was nice getting to know--<i>both of you</i>.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:elizabeth=shocked,<i>Ack!  No!  The Harvest!  They're mulitplying!  Help</i>!
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:elizabeth=shocked,...<i>What?  What's happening?  Elizabeth</i>?
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:moon=frustrated,Great.  Yeah.  Masturbate instead of seeking medical attention.  See if <i>I</i> care.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:moon=bored,...Sometimes I wonder why I like teasing people so much.  Maybe it's just to prove I can toe the line others can't.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:moon=frustrated,Some people you just can't help.  Or even talk to.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:moon=annoyed,What a shock.  Yeah, have fun.  Whatever.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:meia,alsoPlaying:kyu=vain,Hey, <i>I'm</i> fun.  Meia barely knows what "fun" means.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:meia,alsoPlaying:kyu=stretching,Hey, don't give Meia any credit for all the fun <i>I'm</i> bringing.  Her job is to stand there and look miserable.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:meia,alsoPlaying:kyu=teasing,It's a hard life being a pirate, Miss Pixie!  So I try to make it fun for myself, while Meia is content is live in misery.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:meia,alsoPlaying:kyu=vain,It's nice to be appreciated for lighting up a room the way I do.  I have to work extra hard when Meia's killing the mood nearby.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:sei=laughing,That last drink was the dagger, huh?  Maybe you would've held up otherwise.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:sei=interested,Looks like that last drink was the one that blurred out all the numbers on the cards.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:sei=teasing,All you've got, eh, dearie?  Did the alcohol finally reach your brain and short out your poker face?
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:sei=vain,A noble effort, made all the more tragic in how you just kept shooting yourself in the foot with that booze.  Now get to the good stuff.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:sei=seductive,You're a horny little blue ball of booze, aren't you?  You sound like you've been waiting for this--drunks aren't exactly subtle.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:streaming-chan=laughing,What are you--oh.  <i>Oh</i>.  So you're <i>that</i> kind of woman...a toy woman.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:streaming-chan=stretching,Toys, huh?  Yeah, I can see you poor single women resorting to them without a girlfriend around.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:streaming-chan=teasing,A <i>toy</i>?  What, don't you Earth girls have pet men you summon to ravish you on command?
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:streaming-chan=vain,Should've known Miss Media would use a toy--the most conspicuous way to get yourself off, besides enlisting a partner.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:rainbow_mika=laughing,What now, Miss Wrestler?  Is your partner going to help you <i>masturbate</i>, too?
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:rainbow_mika=teasing,Well, there's only one thing that girl can help you with now, honey.  If you're up to task, of course.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:rainbow_mika=teasing,Is your partner going all the way with "assisting" you?  Because that would make this Mejarian feel right at home.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:rainbow_mika=vain,Well, you should know the drill, dear.  Or will you invite your partner along for <i>this</i>, too?
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:vriska=smug,Oh, what's the big deal?  Masturbating in front of us would be less embarrassing than the state you're in now.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:vriska=interested,Dealer, doesn't this count as naked?  Hasn't she lost now?  Come on.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:vriska=interested,Come <i>on</i>, Vriska.  You're naked.  You lost.  It's OK.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:vriska=laughing,Everyone loses eventually, sweetie.  Even cheaters with speech impediments.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:felicia=teasing,Wow, you weren't kidding!  Come on, honey, what were you thinking?  Couldn't stuff yourself into an overcoat?
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:felicia=laughing,Well, you sure made this easy, honey.  That's what you get for showing up naked.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:felicia=stretching,Not much of a tease, are you?  Just up and arriving naked to start with.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:felicia=laughing,I thought you had clothes to start with, however skimpy, but no.  You were actually naked this whole time.
-2-female_start_masturbating=smug,You know, the one time I managed to pry an answer out of Meia, she said she could last longer than me.  I can see it.
-2-female_start_masturbating=mast-2,Meia said she takes <i>forever</i>.  Makes sense--I doubt she even knows what she's doing down there.
-2-female_start_masturbating=stretching,I hope Barnette doesn't get too jealous of me.  Maybe I just won't mention this to her.
-2-female_start_masturbating=vain,I know all sorts of piloting maneuvers, so I'm not expecting yours to really stun me.
-2-female_start_masturbating=seductive,Come on, ~name~.  I like strong women who can keep me safe...like Barnette does.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:florina=seductive,Oh look, she's going to sing to make herself feel better!  That's...actually kind of sweet.  I think I like you, darling!
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:florina=seductive,Ooh, a song?  Sorry I made fun--I <i>love</i> music!  Go for it, cutie.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:florina=teasing,Yeah, I try to make Barnette sing, too.  But that's by accident...and the tune's all over the place.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:florina=excited,You are just so <i>unbearably</i> cute.  Now you're <i>singing</i>?  I just want to squeeze you!
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,OK.  Yes.  This is happening now.  Elizabeth is capable of this.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,Neat powers, Elizabeth.  Real...real <i>Mejarian</i>.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,Who...who <i>are</i> you?  Which one is Elizabeth?
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,I--I thought you were just a sweet little Earth girl!  Who are you?
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:vriska=shocked,Wha--you--<i>oh dear</i>.  Maybe we <i>should</i> let her keep playing.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:vriska=shocked,...I take it back.  Let her keep playing, Dealer.  Let her leave, actually.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:vriska=awkward,...Oh my.  That die <i>really</i> hates you.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:vriska=bored,...This is getting too weird for me.  Earth is a strange planet.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:shego=interested,Legs getting tired, dear?  Or are you afraid we won't see enough of you on the floor?
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:shego=laughing,Seems Miss Lean-and-Green's butt is a little too delicate for the cold floor...or maybe she's just a total exhibitionist.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:shego=seductive,Aww, does the poor bodysuited villain not like how cold the floor is on her little backside?  Take a chair and show off, then.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:shego=teasing,Yeah, standing all this time is a little grating.  But hey, you could hide a little more if you sat on the floor...maybe.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:hermione=laughing,<i>Oh, my</i>!  That's <i>one</i> way to use magic, you little skank!  But I understand.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:hermione=interested,Well, dear, you're not fooling anyone with the good-girl act now.  That's way too many hands to be wholesome.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:hermione=vain,Now <i>that</i> looks pretty magical.  Suddenly my two-handed approach with Barnette seems inadequate.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:hermione=teasing,<i>My, my, my</i>!  Miss Witch knows what she wants, alright.  And she's not afraid to magic her way there.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:aella=interested,You've <i>never</i> masturbated, huh?  Locked away in a house all your life and your hands never wandered south of the border?
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:aella=teasing,What are you, a robot?  <i>Everyone</i> masturbates, dearie...unless you're <i>that</i> popular with the girls.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:aella=stretching,Yeah, you've never masturbated.  <i>Mm-hm</i>.  And I've never taken a bath.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:aella=smug,Oh, give me a break, honey.  Sex I can see people shying away from, but never <i>masturbating</i>?  Does your heart not beat?
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:aella=interested,Ooh, Miss Big-Boned over here has never masturbated.  That's why you came to a public strip poker game, right?
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:aella=teasing,Never masturbated, huh?  You must think you're better than the rest of us, Miss Chastity.  Well, <i>you're missing out</i>.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:felicia=shocked,<i>Gah</i>!  W-where'd you keep that thing?  It's enormous...and phallic!
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:felicia=laughing,A <i>vibrator</i>?  Never seen one shaped like that...must be like a man's tube.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:felicia=smug,Figures Earth women would even have <i>toys</i> shaped like men's things.  Can't you be independent?
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:felicia=vain,Oh, of course.  I should've known any toys on this planet would resemble men's tubes.  You Earth girls are hopeless.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:videl=excited,Wow, you <i>are</i> flying!  I'm so much taller, it was hard to tell--<i>how're you doing that</i>?
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:videl=seductive,Hard to be sure in crazy places like this, but you've been flying this whole time, Videl!  I should've noticed!
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:videl=excited,Videl!  Videl!  Omigosh, can you teach me how to fly?  I don't see any wings, so that means I can learn, right?
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:videl=vain,Can you show me how to fly, Videl?  That'd make the most talented woman alive in addition to the most beautiful!
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=laughing,Barnette's got a few toys...which have helped give us some perspective on men's tubes.  But not <i>quite</i> that big.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=teasing,Toys are hard to come by on Mejare, you know...they're symbols of men.  Unless you're a pirate, where you get your pick.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=stretching,I can't believe you carry that unwieldy thing around.  Earth women can't go five minutes without something phallic!
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=vain,Such ridiculous things...Barnette's lovely fingers are all I need to be happy.  And maybe her gun-shaped toys.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:joey=seductive,Oh, my!  That's the biggest vibrator I've ever seen--I guess there's a lot more room on Earth!
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:joey=interested,Is this just a clown thing where everything is comically large?  Or more of a general Earth style?
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:joey=vain,A vibrator?  And my, it's enormous--and shaped like men's tubes!  All I need are Barnette's lovely fingers, not these massive toys.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:joey=vain,My, such <i>girth</i> on that thing!  Is this men's influence?  Because Mejare's toys are rather inconspicuous.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:aimee=shocked,O-oh, you're--using the gun.  ...Maybe you should unload it first?
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:aimee=shocked,...OK, I call Barnette a gun nut, but she doesn't go <i>that</i> far.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:aimee=awkward,...Barnette has some toys shaped like guns.  Just for fun, you know?  But...the <i>real thing</i>?
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:aimee=awkward,...I really thought you were cool, but now I'm worried.  Isn't that kind of dangerous?
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:alpha=shocked,...OK.  Yeah.  I'm starting to believe you about this <i>virtual</i> business.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:alpha=awkward,That's...new.  Nice color shift.  Glad I could see you become a real woman.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:alpha=shocked,<i>Eek</i>!  I-I mean, uh, great skin tone there, Alpha.  Much more natural.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:alpha=awkward,...Well, it worked.  I shouldn't have doubted you...but I still don't understand you.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:nagisa=teasing,Well, here we go.  Take me on a thrilling, dramatic adventure...shy little sheltered Earth girl.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:nagisa=vain,This had better be more thrilling than what I do every day, you know.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:nagisa=teasing,Hey, coming here was like an anatomy and culture lesson already.  This story better be crazy!
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:nagisa=vain,I crave drama, you know...that's why I'm a ruthless pirate and cunning pilot.  So don't let me down with this story.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:amalia=awkward,...Oh.  OK.  Well, way to prove me wrong right away.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:amalia=shocked,Uh...<i>what are you doing?  I was just teasing</i>!
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:amalia=shocked,...I was just kidding around!  It was a joke!  You don't have to...uh...
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:amalia=awkward,...Or you could go ahead and actually be an exhibitionist.  That works too, I guess.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:meia=smug,Now, I believe you said you take <i>forever</i> to do this?  I can see it...watch me for some pointers.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:meia=laughing,Sure you know what you're doing down there, Meia?  It's OK, just copy me.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:meia=interested,Copy what I do, and maybe you'll land a girlfriend one of these days.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:meia=teasing,Just two women enjoying each other's bodies.  We're model Mejarians, clearly...and you can ask for help if you want.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:meia=laughing,Can you believe these Earthlings' luck?  Two gorgeous Mejarian women masturbating for them?  I can help if you want.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:meia=vain,Want some advice?  Maybe you're a better pilot and poker player...but now you're playing <i>my</i> game.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=shocked,<i>Wait, I was kidding!  Ack</i>!
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=shocked,<i>Wait, I wasn't serious!  Don't!  You'll kill us</i>!
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=awkward,<i>...I wasn't being serious.  Please don't catch anyone in the crossfire</i>.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=shocked,<i>Eek!  I said she should help you, not wrestle you</i>!
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:morrigan=vain,<i>Oh, my</i>!  Just like me and Barnette...except we can't fly.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:morrigan=laughing,Maybe Barnette and I would try that position if one of us had wings.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:morrigan=seductive,You're certainly proving yourself to be every bit the succubus you claim to be, dear.  I'm falling under <i>both</i> your spells!
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:morrigan=teasing,Well, Miss Succubus, the addition of this "Lilith" is making me feel right at home.  That's how Mejarians have sex--mostly.
-2-female_start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,You know, the one time I managed to pry an answer out of Meia, she said she could last longer than me.  I can see it.
-2-female_start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,Just take as long as you need, cutie.  Meia here always overthinks this sort of thing.
-2-female_start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia=stretching,I hope Barnette doesn't get too jealous of me.  Maybe I just won't mention this to her.
-2-female_start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,I know all sorts of piloting maneuvers, so I'm not expecting yours to really stun me.
-2-female_start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia=seductive,Come on, ~name~.  I like strong women who can keep me safe...like Barnette does.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:moon=sad,I'm honestly rethinking my entire life.  You're like a prophetic angel.  I shouldn't come to these sorts of places.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:moon=frustrated,Are you an apparition sent to punish me for being curious about men?
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:moon=sad,You don't have to whore yourself out for money.  Just come to Mejare...you'll make excellent anti-men propaganda.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:moon=bored,For the first time in my life, I'm regretting a decision.  Coming here was a bad idea.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=laughing,<i>Ooh</i>.  Should've known a magical woman dressed in all scarlet would pull something like this...I think I'm good.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=teasing,That's...quite a lot of hands.  More than I think I could keep track of...<i>but that's half the fun</i>.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=vain,Not sure I like being tied up and fondled, dear...well, maybe with the right person.  A certain green-haired cutie, specifically.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=vain,To each her own, I suppose...that level of vulnerability is for Barnette's eyes only, as far as I'm concerned.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu=smug,And now Miss Pixie takes to the air to masturbate?  I don't know what I expected out of you.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu=teasing,I should've expected you to use those wings at some point, Miss Fairytale.  Now give me a good view.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu=laughing,I'd call you a skank for flying up and presenting to us, but I think you'd relish that.  So have your fun.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu=seductive,You're a little crazy, Miss Pixie, but you certainly put the effort in.  Check out that fairy flight!
-2-female_masturbating=seductive,Picture yourself wrapped in my hair...snuggled beneath my breasts...letting my fingers work their magic.
-2-female_masturbating=seductive,Don't let these boorish Earth men hog up your body, ~name~.  Let a <i>Mejarian</i> come and treat you right.
-2-female_masturbating=vain,What's a sexually frustrated Earth woman to do when her needs aren't being met?  Come to Mejare, of course.
-2-female_masturbating=smug,That finger movement isn't impressing me.  You Earth girls are so sexually deprived.
-2-female_masturbating=excited,Getting tired, ~name~?  Mejarians are the experts...let <i>me</i> take over.
-2-female_masturbating=teasing,I have a wonderfully comfortable private chamber on the Nirvana, being such a valuable pilot and all.  <i>It has room for three</i>.
-2-female_masturbating,target:videl=teasing,At least you're making this interesting, just bobbing up and down like that...<i>you're such a pervert</i>.
-2-female_masturbating,target:videl=vain,Just gliding along, letting your instincts guide you...<i>oh, to be young again</i>!  Well, younger.
-2-female_masturbating,target:videl=seductive,If only I could fly like you and make my beauty more fully visible.  Do you realize how lucky you are?
-2-female_masturbating,target:videl=seductive,Videl, Videl, <i>Videl</i>!  You're a complete package, dear--cute, fit, adorable pigtails, and superpowers!
-2-female_masturbating,target:marceline=confused,What exactly is letting you float like that?  You've been doing it all game, and it doesn't even look strenuous.
-2-female_masturbating,target:marceline=seductive,You're inhuman in so many ways...no eyes, blue skin, floating.  But you sure masturbate like a normal girl.
-2-female_masturbating,target:marceline=teasing,I guess you're pretty human after all, Eyeballs.  Just look at you floating there, having the time of your life!
-2-female_masturbating,target:marceline=teasing,Going to perform any fancy tricks for us, Miss Levitator?  Masturbate upside down or something?
-2-female_masturbating,target:morrigan=teasing,I was hoping to learn something new here to surprise Barnette tomorrow evening...or maybe even when I get back.
-2-female_masturbating,target:morrigan=vain,It's so comforting to see two women enjoying each others' bodies.  I thought Earth had never heard of such a thing!
-2-female_masturbating,target:morrigan=stretching,Par for the course where I'm from, Morrigan--sorry it's not leaving an impact.  Well, Mejarians don't fly, but still.
-2-female_masturbating,target:morrigan=vain,Hey, keep it up, Miss Succubus.  You're making my heart swell with memories of my darling Barnette--it's hard to be away from her!
-2-female_masturbating,target:moon=frustrated,Please don't look at me.  Please don't talk.  I'm very afraid.
-2-female_masturbating,target:moon=frustrated,God, just let it end already...I'll go straight after this, I promise.
-2-female_masturbating,target:moon=bored,Yes.  Cute.  Elegant.  You have the grace of those swans I see in zoos.
-2-female_masturbating,target:moon=bored,Marvelous.  Having fun, Moon?  Good.  Glad, even.
-2-female_masturbating,target:vriska=confused,You, uh, holding up over there, Vriska?  Wriggling free sometime soon?
-2-female_masturbating,target:vriska=frustrated,...I'm just going to assume she's into this.  I really don't want to touch her.
-2-female_masturbating,target:vriska=bored,...I think I would've preferred you <i>gaining</i> clothes, Vriska.
-2-female_masturbating,target:vriska=bored,That magic was cool, but <i>yeesh</i>.  What a weirdo...
-2-female_masturbating,target:kyu=seductive,Hey, Miss Love Fairy.  I know you've got wings, but share the magic a little!  <i>I</i> want to fly too, you know!
-2-female_masturbating,target:kyu=vain,Now <i>this</i> is a good use of wings.  Who wants to sit on the nasty old ground to masturbate?
-2-female_masturbating,target:kyu=interested,I like your style, Miss Pixie.  You were born with wings, and now you've found the perfect use for them.
-2-female_masturbating,target:kyu=stretching,Yeah, I'd probably fly like that, too.  But <i>some</i> fairies just won't share their magic with the rest of us.
-2-female_masturbating,target:uravity=vain,You're so rude, Ochako, to not share your levitation powers with everyone else.  I share my beauty!
-2-female_masturbating,target:uravity=smug,Miss Gravity is certainly making the best use of her powers that <i>I</i> could think of.  Shame the rest of us can't join in.
-2-female_masturbating,target:uravity=seductive,Are you <i>sure</i> you were born with these powers?  There isn't some crazy Earth doctor I can visit to fly, too?
-2-female_masturbating,target:uravity=vain,Is there nothing crueler than showing off the powers the rest of us can't enjoy?  At least <i>I</i> can't hide how beautiful I am.
-2-female_masturbating,target:aimee=awkward,I'm...kind of worried about you, Aimee.  Is there something we should know about men's guns?
-2-female_masturbating,target:aimee=bored,I'd definitely give Barnette an intervention if she started masturbating with loaded guns.
-2-female_masturbating,target:aimee=smug,That thing is gonna make a bigger racket than even <i>you</i> are.
-2-female_masturbating,target:aimee=awkward,This is getting way too weird for me, Aimee.  The clothes thing was cool, but <i>this</i>?  It's a death wish!
-2-female_masturbating,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:8=teasing,I can't believe I met <i>two</i> women who can fly...and that both would use it for such <i>unsavory</i> reasons.  <i>Teach me</i>!
-2-female_masturbating,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:8=vain,Two women showing off the goods in the air, and neither will bother to show me how!  <i>I</i> want to fly, too, you know.
-2-female_masturbating,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:8=seductive,Hey, what's a beautiful woman got to do to get some flying lessons?  <i>I</i> want to join in on the airborne fun you two are having!
-2-female_masturbating,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:8=vain,You damn Earthling teases are keeping secrets from me!  Can't a gorgeous girl like me learn to fly, too?  I learned to pilot!
-2-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=awkward,...I guess you don't need a girlfriend, do you?
-2-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=awkward,...You know, I didn't peg you as the kind of girl who'd be open to this sort of thing.  Or that had superpowers.
-2-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=awkward,You know, I've done that...with Barnette.  You know, <i>another</i> woman.  Not myself.
-2-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=thinking,Now I'm curious how good a clone of me would be at this sort of thing...
-2-female_masturbating,target:rinkah=laughing,Did you just--you <i>did</i>!  You're such a beast of a woman, Rinkah...
-2-female_masturbating,target:rinkah=laughing,Are you putting your finger where I think you are?  You've done nothing but confirm stereotypes all evening...you <i>animal</i>.
-2-female_masturbating,target:rinkah=smug,I guess Miss Warrior is so tempered from all her harsh battles, she needs to stick fingers in her rear to feel anything.
-2-female_masturbating,target:rinkah=teasing,I don't know what I expected from you, Miss Fireball, but a finger in the butt checks out.  Barnette and I would never be that dirty.
-2-female_masturbating,target:shego=teasing,Hey, honey, I'm been talking dirty all game...no sense waiting till the end on <i>that</i> front.
-2-female_masturbating,target:shego=laughing,Just listen to the things coming out of Green-bean's mouth!  She's trying to catch up to what I've been doing all evening.
-2-female_masturbating,target:shego=teasing,Too bad I got such a head start on the dirty talk, because Shego's doing her best now to match me.
-2-female_masturbating,target:shego=seductive,You've got a filthy mouth on you to match the green complexion.  Can't you be a sweetheart for once?
-2-female_masturbating,target:amalia=excited,Omigosh, is that vine doing what men's tubes do?  It looks like it!  Show me more!
-2-female_masturbating,target:amalia=awkward,...I was just ribbing you about being naughty.  I guess I was right...or I really got to you.
-2-female_masturbating,target:amalia=excited,Ooh, show me more angles!  That's <i>so cool</i>...it's like a really long men's tube, right?  Right?
-2-female_masturbating,target:amalia=laughing,You really <i>are</i> a little skank!  I should've known all princesses are like this, all sheltered and itching for adventure.
-2-female_masturbating,target:amalia=laughing,Can't reach orgasm without a giant tube shoved inside of you, huh?  Glad I didn't grow up stuck with men for my sexual needs.
-2-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=teasing,<i>Hoo</i>.  Well, at least you seem like you're in control.  Have fun, girls!
-2-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=seductive,Well, you're not killing anyone, so fine by me.  This is fun to watch!
-2-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=teasing,Just stand a safe distance away...this <i>is</i> pretty sexy.
-2-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=seductive,I <i>knew</i> you two were lovers!  Can't keep your hands off each other...or anything else.
-2-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=vain,As long as you don't clothesline me, you can keep this up all you want, cuties.  Just watch those muscles ripple!
-2-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=seductive,Barnette and I aren't as strong as you two, but maybe I should take notes anyway.
-2-female_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=interested,Holding up, dear?  You seem a little incapable of saying the safe word.
-2-female_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=stretching,I guess when you've got superpowers at your disposal, you need to feel unsafe for once to be excited.
-2-female_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=laughing,See, this is why I don't want magic.  <i>This</i> is the kind of thing I'd need to get a thrill again.
-2-female_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=laughing,Hanging in there, Miss Bloodred?  Any tighter and it won't just be your outfit that's scarlet.
-2-female_masturbating,target:meia=seductive-2,Don't look this way, Meia.  <i>I don't want our relationship to get complicated</i>.
-2-female_masturbating,target:meia=seductive-2,This is oh-so embarrassing.  Don't think of me, Meia, I'm <i>taken</i>!
-2-female_masturbating,target:meia=laughing,Think the others will be able to tell at our flight practice tomorrow, just from the looks on our faces?
-2-female_masturbating,target:meia=laughing,It's OK.  I'll pretend you're Barnette, and you pretend I'm a formations list.
-2-female_masturbating,target:meia=seductive-2,This game's getting to be a little too much for me.
-2-female_masturbating,target:meia=smug,Yeah, we didn't really plan on this happening, did we?
-2-female_masturbating,target:meia=stretching,Really thought you'd be winning this, Meia.  I didn't think these Earth people would get <i>this</i> good of a show.
-2-female_masturbating,target:meia=interested,Talk about giving a good first impression of Mejare, eh, Meia?
-2-female_masturbating,target:gwen=smug,...I can't really fault you for this.  If <i>I</i> had spider-web powers, I'd give that a try, too.
-2-female_masturbating,target:gwen=teasing,I'm going to go ahead and guess this isn't <i>all</i> you use that webbing for...if you've got someone else with you.
-2-female_masturbating,target:gwen=vain,That webbing looks like quite a bit of fun!  If only I could give it a try with Barnette.
-2-female_masturbating,target:gwen=seductive,Hey, I like those angles you're pulling, cutie!  Go upside down again!
-2-female_finished_masturbating=stretching,Guess you couldn't last as long as me, either.  Oh, well.  Fun while it lasted.
-2-female_finished_masturbating=seductive-2,Well, now!  I hope <i>I</i> don't spray that much.  It'd be an awful mess.
-2-female_finished_masturbating=seductive,Shame we couldn't finish at the same time.  Barnette and I usually aim for that.
-2-female_finished_masturbating=smug,Meia says she lasts forever.  I believe her...mostly because I doubt she knows what she's doing.
-2-female_finished_masturbating=interested,What a wonderful little journey through the stars we just had together.
-2-female_finished_masturbating=teasing,Now imagine how good a whole planet of women could make you feel.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia=stretching,Guess you couldn't last as long as me, either.  Oh, well.  Fun while it lasted.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia=seductive-2,Well, now!  I hope <i>I</i> don't spray that much.  It'd be an awful mess.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia=seductive,Shame we couldn't finish at the same time.  Barnette and I usually aim for that.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,Guess you knew what you were doing after all.  Hopefully I can one-up you there.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia=interested,What a wonderful little journey through the stars we just had together.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Now imagine how good a whole planet of women could make you feel.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:aimee=shocked,A-ah!  See?  I <i>told</i> you!
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:aimee=bored,...Yeah, <i>definitely</i> making sure Barnette doesn't go this far.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:aimee=bored,Guess we all knew that was coming, but I wanted to believe you'd pull it off.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:aimee=frustrated,...I think I prefer <i>Barnette's</i> level of gun-hobby.  As in, not shooting herself.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,...That ended as quickly as it began.  What <i>was</i> that?
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,You don't even seem bothered!  W-why didn't you say you could do stuff like that?
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:elizabeth=awkward,...And this sort of thing just comes naturally to you?  Didn't bat an eye?
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,OK.  Yes.  It's over now, apparently.  Very enlightening, Elizabeth.  Never judge by appearances.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:morrigan=seductive,What, she's leaving?  Stay a while!  We can talk about woman relationships together!
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:morrigan=seductive,Hey, don't leave so soon, dear!  You're a steal yourself--I can tell you more about more girlfriend!
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:morrigan=seductive,Aww, don't leave, honey!  We just got to meet each other, and you spent it all underneath Morrigan's butt!
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:morrigan=vain,<i>Leave if you must.  I guess I'm not beautiful enough to warrant sticking around</i>.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:amalia=stretching,<i>And it just dumps you off, disgusted with your behavior</i>.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:amalia=smug,Earth women are so bestial, having sex with men and plants in equal measures.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:amalia=laughing,You ought to be ashamed of yourself, young lady!  Now go get your servant to clean you up!
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:amalia=vain,Looks like Little Miss Princess was just another dirty commoner, begging to be ravished and tossed aside.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:vriska=shocked,Wha--<i>ew!  W-what's all that blue stuff?  Don't get it on me!  It's gross</i>!
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:vriska=shocked,<i>Ack!  F-fluid!  B-blue fluid everywhere!  Is it poisonous</i>?
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:vriska=shocked,<i>Eeek!  V-Vriska!  What is this?  What did you do?  Why are you leaking blue stuff</i>?
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:vriska=shocked,<i>Ack!  K-keep that stuff away from me!  It's corrosive, isn't it?  M-magic corrosive blue fluid</i>!
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:moon=bored,Nice finish.  The white fluid really stands out against your blackened labia.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:moon=annoyed,Class act, these Earth girls.  Absolutely marvelous to behold.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:moon=annoyed,Would you believe I thought I was superior to Earth girls?  Moon here's shown me I have a long way to go.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:moon=bored,Perfect.  Yeah.  Mm-hm.  Glad you had fun.  See you next time.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:black_canary=angry,<i>Oooow</i>!  Hey, shut up, you freak!
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:black_canary=angry,<i>Ow</i>!  What was <i>that</i> for?  <i>Ugh</i>!
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:black_canary=angry,<i>Oooooow</i>!  Ooh, the <i>nerve</i> of some people!  Take your weird voice powers and beat it, freak!
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:black_canary=annoyed,<i>AM I TALKING TOO LOUD?  I THINK I JUST WENT DEAF</i>.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:launch=seductive,Ooh, the blue one again!  If you weren't so unstable, I'd invite you back for a drink, cutie.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:launch=vain,Oh, thank God, the blue one's back.  Good to see a woman who's polite and sincere in my line of work!
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:launch=interested,Just in time.  I wasn't looking forward to hearing your counterpart bellyache about losing.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:launch=teasing,Just the hair color I wanted to see!  You're so much nicer to be around, even if you're kind of a doormat.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=vain,I knew Earth girls could love each other the way we do.  Men are just so superfluous!
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=seductive,Talk about a Mejarian power couple.  You're stronger than the men I know anyway!
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=teasing,I like the idea of men just picking me up...but it seems like you two could do that anyway.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=vain,I guess Earth isn't so different from Mejare after all.  Two strong women in love!  ...Like me and Barnette.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:uravity=seductive,And she just plops down like a doofus!  You get cuter the longer I look at you, darling.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:uravity=laughing,Have a good time, Miss Gravity?  Seems like you lost control of your little floating maneuver.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:uravity=teasing,I think you might be the most adorable girl I've ever met, from stuffing your figure into that suit to just plopping on the ground.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:uravity=laughing,Ha!  I guess you really <i>have</i> overcome your embarrassment, to just drop down like that.  Or maybe that was an accident.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:meia=laughing,Teehee.  You may be able to fly circles around me, but now you're in <i>my</i> arena.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:meia=smug,Surprised I outlasted you?  You're oversensitive, all single and untouched by human hands.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:meia=vain,Didn't last that long after all, huh?  I'll have to let the crew know you've overestimated yourself once again.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:meia=seductive,Just think how good that'd feel with another woman at the helm.  I hear Valore's got a crush on you, you know.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:meia=smug,Feel free to get a girlfriend to help you so you don't finish so fast.  Maybe you'll actually <i>enjoy</i> having sex...anything's possible.

-1-male_must_masturbate=smug,Well, I lost, but good to know a man didn't fare much better in the end.
-1-male_must_masturbate=confused,Masturbating's fun for a man, right?  I mean, I'm just assuming things here.
-1-male_must_masturbate=seductive-2,I'll just say we <i>all</i> lost so I don't have to say a man outlasted me.
-1-male_must_masturbate=teasing,Pat yourself on the back--you still beat the crown jewel of Mejare.  Now get masturbating so I can learn something.
-1-male_must_masturbate,target:captain_falcon=teasing,Well, Mr. Shouts-a-minute, now you get to yell at us and have it actually be appropriate.  Go nuts.
-1-male_must_masturbate,target:captain_falcon=laughing,You were shouting enough already, so I shudder to think at how noisy you'll be <i>now</i>.
-1-male_must_masturbate,target:captain_falcon=stretching,Oh, good.  The man who already wouldn't shut up has to <i>masturbate</i> now.  Can't we just make him leave?
-1-male_must_masturbate,target:captain_falcon=laughing,Well, I'll learn about men from this, but you might deafen me in the process.
-1-male_must_masturbate,target:9s=smug,And now for the <i>ultimate</i> test of your humanity.  If he bleeds, he masturbates.
-1-male_must_masturbate,target:9s=stretching,Well, time to cast aside your artificiality, honey.  Let's see if a fake man can outperform a real one!
-1-male_must_masturbate,target:9s=vain,Don't feel bad if your fakeness makes this weird for you.  I don't have much frame of reference.
-1-male_must_masturbate,target:9s=seductive,<i>Have fun, dear</i>!  Do you have to rev yourself up a bit, or are you actually like a real person in this regard?
-1-male_start_masturbating=interested,Hey, you should have done this sooner if you wanted me to be all excited about it.
-1-male_start_masturbating=confused,Do men masturbate all the time?  If so, our prisoners do a good job hiding it.
-1-male_start_masturbating=seductive,Oh, dear, ~name~!  Is this all for <i>me</i>?
-1-male_start_masturbating=vain,That girl Misty certainly knows how to handle men.  She ran circles around Dita--maybe I should consult her.
-1-male_start_masturbating,target:9s=laughing,What does an android think about, exactly?  Silicone breasts?  Mechanical hips?
-1-male_start_masturbating,target:9s=interested,I'm quite curious what's going through your mind.  The exact optimal jerking speed, factoring in fuel efficiency?
-1-male_start_masturbating,target:9s=seductive,Anyone on your mind, Little Dungeon Bot?  Someone at this table...or maybe your cute little "2B" partner?
-1-male_start_masturbating,target:9s=vain,What gets a robot going, huh?  If I could make a <i>machine</i> like me, I'm officially the most gorgeous woman alive.
-1-male_masturbating=teasing,Want me to shift around a little?  Spread something?  What do men want?
-1-male_masturbating=excited,I've <i>got</i> to find out what makes men tick.
-1-male_masturbating=interested,I can't believe men's masturbation is really that simple.  Mix it up a little, jeez.
-1-male_masturbating=vain,What exactly does a man want a good view of when he masturbates, huh?  I'm not shy about it.
-1-male_masturbating=seductive,<i>Tell me</i> that little show I put on got you going, dear.  I want to know I can please a man.
-1-male_masturbating,target:9s=laughing,Hey, 9S.  You're thinking about how much you want to...well, you know.  Aren't you?
-1-male_masturbating,target:9s=vain,I just can't get over the look on your face, honey.  A robot in ecstasy!  Marvelous.
-1-male_masturbating,target:9s=thinking,Seriously, I'm wondering what a robot thinks about when he masturbates.  I can't even figure out <i>human</i> men.
-1-male_masturbating,target:9s=thinking,It's hard to find this erotic when I'm confused about your gender <i>and</i> your mechanics.
-1-male_finished_masturbating=stretching,Sorry, ~name~, but maybe I don't want the seed of a man who can't even win a poker game.
-1-male_finished_masturbating=shocked,Ack!  G-give me a warning first!  What <i>is</i> that stuff?
-1-male_finished_masturbating=shocked,Eep!  Is--is that stuff <i>glowing</i>?  What is it?
-1-male_finished_masturbating=awkward,I mean...it looks kind of...warm, I guess.  Does that stuff really have to go inside me?
-1-male_finished_masturbating=angry,Blech!  Men's tubes are so cool, but their seed is just <i>gross</i>!
-1-male_finished_masturbating=shocked,H-hey, keep it off the hair!  Skin only!  And no face!
-1-male_finished_masturbating=teasing,Thank you very much, ~name~.  Consider this reconaissance on the male alien.
-1-male_finished_masturbating,target:9s=awkward,<i>Let me see it, now</i>!  ...Where is it?  You know, your seed?
-1-male_finished_masturbating,target:9s=angry,...Do you seriously not have any seed?  The one thing I was most interested in?
-1-male_finished_masturbating,target:9s=bored,...Oh.  You're a machine, so you don't have the <i>semen</i> stuff.  Well, you're worthless to me, then.
-1-male_finished_masturbating,target:9s=angry,Wha--w-where's all the seed?  I wanted to see men's <i>sperm</i> things!  Hey!
-1-male_finished_masturbating,target:corrin_m=shocked,<i>Eeeeeek!  I knew men were monsters!  How dare you try to enter my womb</i>!
-1-male_finished_masturbating,target:corrin_m=shocked,<i>Wait!  I take it all back!  I don't want man-beasts clawing at my breasts!  Stay away from my womb</i>!
-1-male_finished_masturbating,target:corrin_m=bored,...I don't want talons anywhere near my cervix.  Earth women can have you for themselves.
-1-male_finished_masturbating,target:corrin_m=shocked,<i>Wha--wha--a monster!  Stay back!  I have a girlfriend-and she has guns!  I don't need men</i>!
-1-male_finished_masturbating,target:jin=shocked,<i>Eep</i>!  W-why's it glowing so much?  The book just said it was pearly, not <i>radioactive</i>!
-1-male_finished_masturbating,target:jin=awkward,...Uh, did I miss a paragraph in the book?  Does men's sperm come out all lustrous and then fade?
-1-male_finished_masturbating,target:jin=seductive,Oh, wow!  Does it really glow that much?  That looks like <i>I'd</i> glow if you came inside me.
-1-male_finished_masturbating,target:jin=seductive,Wow, men's seed is even more glorious than I imagined!  You must pump your heart and soul into that stuff to make it shine like that!
-1-female_must_masturbate=teasing,Shame I couldn't finish you off myself.  Well, maybe I could some other way.
-1-female_must_masturbate=vain,That's a wrap, folks.  But at least you outwitted our resident Mejarian.
-1-female_must_masturbate=interested,At least you beat <i>me</i>.  I really thought Mejarians were smarter than Earth girls.
-1-female_must_masturbate=vain,I wonder if Barnette could beat me, too.  The two of us always have other things we'd rather do than play cards together.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:rainbow_mika=laughing,What now, Miss Wrestler?  Is your partner going to help you <i>masturbate</i>, too?
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:rainbow_mika=teasing,Well, there's only one thing that girl can help you with now, honey.  If you're up to task, of course.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:rainbow_mika=teasing,Is your partner going all the way with "assisting" you?  Because that would make this Mejarian feel right at home.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:rainbow_mika=vain,Well, you should know the drill, dear.  Or will you invite your partner along for <i>this</i>, too?
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:moon=frustrated,Great.  Yeah.  Masturbate instead of seeking medical attention.  See if <i>I</i> care.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:moon=bored,...Sometimes I wonder why I like teasing people so much.  Maybe it's just to prove I can toe the line others can't.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:moon=frustrated,Some people you just can't help.  Or even talk to.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:moon=annoyed,What a shock.  Yeah, have fun.  Whatever.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:meia=smug,Well, you beat <i>me</i>.  You know, like you always do.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:meia=stretching,Didn't think you'd lose.  Guess there's a few Gascognes running around Earth, so to speak.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:meia=teasing,You beat your second-in-command, right?  And now you get to masturbate, take the edge off.  It's a win-win!
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:meia=laughing,At least you didn't lose to <i>me</i>.  That'd probably shake your ego to its core.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:vriska=smug,Oh, what's the big deal?  Masturbating in front of us would be less embarrassing than the state you're in now.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:vriska=interested,Dealer, doesn't this count as naked?  Hasn't she lost now?  Come on.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:vriska=interested,Come <i>on</i>, Vriska.  You're naked.  You lost.  It's OK.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:vriska=laughing,Everyone loses eventually, sweetie.  Even cheaters with speech impediments.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:meia,alsoPlaying:kyu=vain,Hey, <i>I'm</i> fun.  Meia barely knows what "fun" means.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:meia,alsoPlaying:kyu=stretching,Hey, don't give Meia any credit for all the fun <i>I'm</i> bringing.  Her job is to stand there and look miserable.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:meia,alsoPlaying:kyu=teasing,It's a hard life being a pirate, Miss Pixie!  So I try to make it fun for myself, while Meia is content is live in misery.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:meia,alsoPlaying:kyu=vain,It's nice to be appreciated for lighting up a room the way I do.  I have to work extra hard when Meia's killing the mood nearby.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:streaming-chan=laughing,What are you--oh.  <i>Oh</i>.  So you're <i>that</i> kind of woman...a toy woman.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:streaming-chan=stretching,Toys, huh?  Yeah, I can see you poor single women resorting to them without a girlfriend around.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:streaming-chan=teasing,A <i>toy</i>?  What, don't you Earth girls have pet men you summon to ravish you on command?
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:streaming-chan=vain,Should've known Miss Media would use a toy--the most conspicuous way to get yourself off, besides enlisting a partner.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:misato=teasing,Sure you've still got the coordination to <i>find</i> you vagina, Boozeball?  Either way, this'll be entertaining.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:misato=laughing,I think this works out perfectly.  Either you manage to masturbate and it's sexy, or you fall over and it's funny.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:misato=vain,Have fun pawing at both your vaginas, Miss Doublevision.  You look like you're going to fall asleep any minute now.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:misato=teasing,Sorry I couldn't drink too much with you, but I'm in enemy territory, after all.  Now have fun trying to find your vagina, Blurry-eyes.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:aimee=teasing,Now if you could masturbate with the <i>bullets</i>, that'd <i>really</i> impress me.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:aimee=smug,Surely she doesn't have to do it, right?  I mean, she already came earlier.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:aimee=interested,We'd better find some cover, considering how she made herself cum <i>last</i> time.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:aimee=teasing,Well, <i>this</i> is a predicament.  Or is your aim good enough to <i>juuust</i> graze yourself to orgasm?
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:alpha,marker:planet-countries=confused,What's a <i>yoo-ess-bee</i>?  Something only Planet Japan has?
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:alpha=thinking,"Yoo-ess-bees" make you real?  Do <i>I</i> have one without even knowing it?
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:alpha=smug,Oh look, she's actually speaking instead of singing.  And even then, she's goin on about nonsense like "yoo-ess-bees."
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:alpha=stretching,A "yoo-ess-bee"?  Sounds like some fancy gadget Parfet would understand.  Is Miss Popstar a secret genius?
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:amalia=smug,I can only <i>dream</i> of how embarrassed you must be, dear.  There's no possible chance you're actually an exhibitionist.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:amalia=laughing,This must be <i>so</i> devastating.  Surely you don't get off on being watched like us lecherous commoners.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:amalia=stretching,Oh, woe is you!  A princess forced to exhibit her base desires like her lowly subjects.  No chance she's into it.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:amalia=teasing,Nobility, reduced to her primal instincts for an audience...it's a good thing you're so above it all.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:elizabeth=shocked,It's been fun, Liz, but you--you--<i>there's more than one of you</i>.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:elizabeth=shocked,Well, Liz, it was nice getting to know--<i>both of you</i>.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:elizabeth=shocked,<i>Ack!  No!  The Harvest!  They're mulitplying!  Help</i>!
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:elizabeth=shocked,...<i>What?  What's happening?  Elizabeth</i>?
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:felicia=teasing,Wow, you weren't kidding!  Come on, honey, what were you thinking?  Couldn't stuff yourself into an overcoat?
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:felicia=laughing,Well, you sure made this easy, honey.  That's what you get for showing up naked.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:felicia=stretching,Not much of a tease, are you?  Just up and arriving naked to start with.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:felicia=laughing,I thought you had clothes to start with, however skimpy, but no.  You were actually naked this whole time.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:nagisa=laughing,You're putting on a <i>performance</i> for us?  Isn't that what the masturbation is anyway?
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:nagisa=teasing,Hey, honey--if you want to put on a play, play with <i>yourself</i>.  That's what we all came here for.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:nagisa=smug,Yeah, Mejare has some plays I know of.  Mostly about men eating a poor helpless woman, then getting gutted themselves.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:nagisa=vain,A play, huh?  Let's see if it's more riveting than the man-killing, rough-and-tumble world of Mejarian theater.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:nagisa=smug,Oh, you're doing a play?  I was never big on theater myself--my own life as a pilot is far more interesting, after all.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:sei=laughing,That last drink was the dagger, huh?  Maybe you would've held up otherwise.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:sei=interested,Looks like that last drink was the one that blurred out all the numbers on the cards.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:sei=teasing,All you've got, eh, dearie?  Did the alcohol finally reach your brain and short out your poker face?
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:sei=vain,A noble effort, made all the more tragic in how you just kept shooting yourself in the foot with that booze.  Now get to the good stuff.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:sei=seductive,You're a horny little blue ball of booze, aren't you?  You sound like you've been waiting for this--drunks aren't exactly subtle.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=smug,Oh, <i>God</i>.  Miss Busybee has to masturbate now?  We're going to drown in her tears.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=laughing,Should we really make her do this?  She's so scared of her own body, she'll run in circles.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=vain,Maybe I'd have some sympathy if you had a body to be ashamed of.  As it stands, this embarrassment is an insult to poor ugly girls.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=interested,Do we really want to make her do this?  She's <i>already</i> a blubbering mess, and she's just standing around naked.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=stretching,Get the cleanup crew ready.  If this girl hasn't peed herself yet, she's going to do it now.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=stretching,<i>God</i>, Earth girls grow up soft.  Fighting men all your life really toughens you up!
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=stretching,Look, Florina masturbating is bad for everyone here.  She cries, and she annoys <i>us</i> in the process.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=teasing,I'm tempted to plant a big smooch right on your mouth, dear.  That'll shock you right out of your embarrassment!
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:morrigan=bored,<i>Now how does a succubus do it</i>--oh.  She gets help.  Makes sense.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:morrigan=shocked,<i>Eeep  W-where'd she come from?  Help</i>!
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:morrigan=shocked,Who's "Lilith"?  Wait, where'd <i>she</i> come from?  Help!  No!
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:morrigan=stretching,Oh, you brought a friend to help?  Just like a succubus...then again, I should've brought Barnette.
-1-female_start_masturbating=seductive-2,Barnette and I had sex in my Dread once.  I muscled her into the idea...kind of ended up being too tight.
-1-female_start_masturbating=vain,Masturbating wasn't easy for me, you know.  I can't keep my hands off Barnette...and I reserve my own body for her, too.
-1-female_start_masturbating=thinking,I hope Barnette doesn't get too jealous of me.  Maybe I'll just say I spent the night fixing my Dread...nah, she won't buy that.
-1-female_start_masturbating=teasing,I have a lot of beautiful crewmates I could think of right now, so give me a good show.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:shego=interested,Legs getting tired, dear?  Or are you afraid we won't see enough of you on the floor?
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:shego=laughing,Seems Miss Lean-and-Green's butt is a little too delicate for the cold floor...or maybe she's just a total exhibitionist.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:shego=seductive,Aww, does the poor bodysuited villain not like how cold the floor is on her little backside?  Take a chair and show off, then.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:shego=teasing,Yeah, standing all this time is a little grating.  But hey, you could hide a little more if you sat on the floor...maybe.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=laughing,Barnette's got a few toys...which have helped give us some perspective on men's tubes.  But not <i>quite</i> that big.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=teasing,Toys are hard to come by on Mejare, you know...they're symbols of men.  Unless you're a pirate, where you get your pick.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=stretching,I can't believe you carry that unwieldy thing around.  Earth women can't go five minutes without something phallic!
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=vain,Such ridiculous things...Barnette's lovely fingers are all I need to be happy.  And maybe her gun-shaped toys.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:videl=excited,Wow, you <i>are</i> flying!  I'm so much taller, it was hard to tell--<i>how're you doing that</i>?
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:videl=seductive,Hard to be sure in crazy places like this, but you've been flying this whole time, Videl!  I should've noticed!
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:videl=excited,Videl!  Videl!  Omigosh, can you teach me how to fly?  I don't see any wings, so that means I can learn, right?
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:videl=vain,Can you show me how to fly, Videl?  That'd make the most talented woman alive in addition to the most beautiful!
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,OK.  Yes.  This is happening now.  Elizabeth is capable of this.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,Neat powers, Elizabeth.  Real...real <i>Mejarian</i>.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,Who...who <i>are</i> you?  Which one is Elizabeth?
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,I--I thought you were just a sweet little Earth girl!  Who are you?
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=shocked,<i>Wait, I was kidding!  Ack</i>!
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=shocked,<i>Wait, I wasn't serious!  Don't!  You'll kill us</i>!
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=awkward,<i>...I wasn't being serious.  Please don't catch anyone in the crossfire</i>.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=shocked,<i>Eek!  I said she should help you, not wrestle you</i>!
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:alpha=shocked,...OK.  Yeah.  I'm starting to believe you about this <i>virtual</i> business.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:alpha=awkward,That's...new.  Nice color shift.  Glad I could see you become a real woman.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:alpha=shocked,<i>Eek</i>!  I-I mean, uh, great skin tone there, Alpha.  Much more natural.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:alpha=awkward,...Well, it worked.  I shouldn't have doubted you...but I still don't understand you.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:nagisa=teasing,Well, here we go.  Take me on a thrilling, dramatic adventure...shy little sheltered Earth girl.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:nagisa=vain,This had better be more thrilling than what I do every day, you know.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:nagisa=teasing,Hey, coming here was like an anatomy and culture lesson already.  This story better be crazy!
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:nagisa=vain,I crave drama, you know...that's why I'm a ruthless pirate and cunning pilot.  So don't let me down with this story.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:vriska=shocked,Wha--you--<i>oh dear</i>.  Maybe we <i>should</i> let her keep playing.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:vriska=shocked,...I take it back.  Let her keep playing, Dealer.  Let her leave, actually.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:vriska=awkward,...Oh my.  That die <i>really</i> hates you.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:vriska=bored,...This is getting too weird for me.  Earth is a strange planet.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:meia=vain,Masturbating together really <i>would</i> have been awkward.  Everything just works out for us!
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:meia=teasing,Good thing I finished first, right?  Our relationship would've been a little awkward if we did it together.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:meia=teasing,Glad I'm all done already.  Things need to stay professional between us.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:meia=seductive,Good thing I'm not still masturbating.  <i>I might've fallen for you</i>!
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:meia=laughing,Glad I'm all done already.  Imagine if Barnette heard we masturbated together!  I'd get a bullet in the back.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:meia=seductive-2,Imagine if I were still going!  How <i>unprofessional</i>.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:felicia=shocked,<i>Gah</i>!  W-where'd you keep that thing?  It's enormous...and phallic!
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:felicia=laughing,A <i>vibrator</i>?  Never seen one shaped like that...must be like a man's tube.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:felicia=smug,Figures Earth women would even have <i>toys</i> shaped like men's things.  Can't you be independent?
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:felicia=vain,Oh, of course.  I should've known any toys on this planet would resemble men's tubes.  You Earth girls are hopeless.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:morrigan=vain,<i>Oh, my</i>!  Just like me and Barnette...except we can't fly.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:morrigan=laughing,Maybe Barnette and I would try that position if one of us had wings.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:morrigan=seductive,You're certainly proving yourself to be every bit the succubus you claim to be, dear.  I'm falling under <i>both</i> your spells!
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:morrigan=teasing,Well, Miss Succubus, the addition of this "Lilith" is making me feel right at home.  That's how Mejarians have sex--mostly.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:aimee=shocked,O-oh, you're--using the gun.  ...Maybe you should unload it first?
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:aimee=shocked,...OK, I call Barnette a gun nut, but she doesn't go <i>that</i> far.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:aimee=awkward,...Barnette has some toys shaped like guns.  Just for fun, you know?  But...the <i>real thing</i>?
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:aimee=awkward,...I really thought you were cool, but now I'm worried.  Isn't that kind of dangerous?
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:moon=sad,I'm honestly rethinking my entire life.  You're like a prophetic angel.  I shouldn't come to these sorts of places.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:moon=frustrated,Are you an apparition sent to punish me for being curious about men?
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:moon=sad,You don't have to whore yourself out for money.  Just come to Mejare...you'll make excellent anti-men propaganda.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:moon=bored,For the first time in my life, I'm regretting a decision.  Coming here was a bad idea.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=laughing,<i>Ooh</i>.  Should've known a magical woman dressed in all scarlet would pull something like this...I think I'm good.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=teasing,That's...quite a lot of hands.  More than I think I could keep track of...<i>but that's half the fun</i>.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=vain,Not sure I like being tied up and fondled, dear...well, maybe with the right person.  A certain green-haired cutie, specifically.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=vain,To each her own, I suppose...that level of vulnerability is for Barnette's eyes only, as far as I'm concerned.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:florina=seductive,Oh look, she's going to sing to make herself feel better!  That's...actually kind of sweet.  I think I like you, darling!
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:florina=seductive,Ooh, a song?  Sorry I made fun--I <i>love</i> music!  Go for it, cutie.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:florina=teasing,Yeah, I try to make Barnette sing, too.  But that's by accident...and the tune's all over the place.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:florina=excited,You are just so <i>unbearably</i> cute.  Now you're <i>singing</i>?  I just want to squeeze you!
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:hermione=laughing,<i>Oh, my</i>!  That's <i>one</i> way to use magic, you little skank!  But I understand.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:hermione=interested,Well, dear, you're not fooling anyone with the good-girl act now.  That's way too many hands to be wholesome.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:hermione=vain,Now <i>that</i> looks pretty magical.  Suddenly my two-handed approach with Barnette seems inadequate.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:hermione=teasing,<i>My, my, my</i>!  Miss Witch knows what she wants, alright.  And she's not afraid to magic her way there.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:aella=interested,You've <i>never</i> masturbated, huh?  Locked away in a house all your life and your hands never wandered south of the border?
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:aella=teasing,What are you, a robot?  <i>Everyone</i> masturbates, dearie...unless you're <i>that</i> popular with the girls.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:aella=stretching,Yeah, you've never masturbated.  <i>Mm-hm</i>.  And I've never taken a bath.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:aella=smug,Oh, give me a break, honey.  Sex I can see people shying away from, but never <i>masturbating</i>?  Does your heart not beat?
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:aella=interested,Ooh, Miss Big-Boned over here has never masturbated.  That's why you came to a public strip poker game, right?
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:aella=teasing,Never masturbated, huh?  You must think you're better than the rest of us, Miss Chastity.  Well, <i>you're missing out</i>.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu=smug,And now Miss Pixie takes to the air to masturbate?  I don't know what I expected out of you.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu=teasing,I should've expected you to use those wings at some point, Miss Fairytale.  Now give me a good view.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu=laughing,I'd call you a skank for flying up and presenting to us, but I think you'd relish that.  So have your fun.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu=seductive,You're a little crazy, Miss Pixie, but you certainly put the effort in.  Check out that fairy flight!
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:joey=seductive,Oh, my!  That's the biggest vibrator I've ever seen--I guess there's a lot more room on Earth!
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:joey=interested,Is this just a clown thing where everything is comically large?  Or more of a general Earth style?
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:joey=vain,A vibrator?  And my, it's enormous--and shaped like men's tubes!  All I need are Barnette's lovely fingers, not these massive toys.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:joey=vain,My, such <i>girth</i> on that thing!  Is this men's influence?  Because Mejare's toys are rather inconspicuous.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:amalia=awkward,...Oh.  OK.  Well, way to prove me wrong right away.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:amalia=shocked,Uh...<i>what are you doing?  I was just teasing</i>!
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:amalia=shocked,...I was just kidding around!  It was a joke!  You don't have to...uh...
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:amalia=awkward,...Or you could go ahead and actually be an exhibitionist.  That works too, I guess.
-1-female_masturbating=teasing,Remember how I was doing it?  Yeah, do that.
-1-female_masturbating=stretching,You Earth women really overthink the whole masturbation thing.  So does Meia, I bet, but still.
-1-female_masturbating=excited,Just watching you is making my toes curl.  Isn't another woman's lust <i>thrilling</i>?
-1-female_masturbating=teasing,You don't need these men clawing at you, honey.  Come to Mejare and learn to love a <i>woman's</i> touch.
-1-female_masturbating=seductive,I can just <i>feel</i> how unsatisfied these clumsy Earth men have left you.  My heart goes out to you, as do my fingers.
-1-female_masturbating,target:videl=teasing,At least you're making this interesting, just bobbing up and down like that...<i>you're such a pervert</i>.
-1-female_masturbating,target:videl=vain,Just gliding along, letting your instincts guide you...<i>oh, to be young again</i>!  Well, younger.
-1-female_masturbating,target:videl=seductive,If only I could fly like you and make my beauty more fully visible.  Do you realize how lucky you are?
-1-female_masturbating,target:videl=seductive,Videl, Videl, <i>Videl</i>!  You're a complete package, dear--cute, fit, adorable pigtails, and superpowers!
-1-female_masturbating,target:uravity=vain,You're so rude, Ochako, to not share your levitation powers with everyone else.  I share my beauty!
-1-female_masturbating,target:uravity=smug,Miss Gravity is certainly making the best use of her powers that <i>I</i> could think of.  Shame the rest of us can't join in.
-1-female_masturbating,target:uravity=seductive,Are you <i>sure</i> you were born with these powers?  There isn't some crazy Earth doctor I can visit to fly, too?
-1-female_masturbating,target:uravity=vain,Is there nothing crueler than showing off the powers the rest of us can't enjoy?  At least <i>I</i> can't hide how beautiful I am.
-1-female_masturbating,target:morrigan=teasing,I was hoping to learn something new here to surprise Barnette tomorrow evening...or maybe even when I get back.
-1-female_masturbating,target:morrigan=vain,It's so comforting to see two women enjoying each others' bodies.  I thought Earth had never heard of such a thing!
-1-female_masturbating,target:morrigan=stretching,Par for the course where I'm from, Morrigan--sorry it's not leaving an impact.  Well, Mejarians don't fly, but still.
-1-female_masturbating,target:morrigan=vain,Hey, keep it up, Miss Succubus.  You're making my heart swell with memories of my darling Barnette--it's hard to be away from her!
-1-female_masturbating,target:shego=teasing,Hey, honey, I'm been talking dirty all game...no sense waiting till the end on <i>that</i> front.
-1-female_masturbating,target:shego=laughing,Just listen to the things coming out of Green-bean's mouth!  She's trying to catch up to what I've been doing all evening.
-1-female_masturbating,target:shego=teasing,Too bad I got such a head start on the dirty talk, because Shego's doing her best now to match me.
-1-female_masturbating,target:shego=seductive,You've got a filthy mouth on you to match the green complexion.  Can't you be a sweetheart for once?
-1-female_masturbating,target:moon=frustrated,Please don't look at me.  Please don't talk.  I'm very afraid.
-1-female_masturbating,target:moon=frustrated,God, just let it end already...I'll go straight after this, I promise.
-1-female_masturbating,target:moon=bored,Yes.  Cute.  Elegant.  You have the grace of those swans I see in zoos.
-1-female_masturbating,target:moon=bored,Marvelous.  Having fun, Moon?  Good.  Glad, even.
-1-female_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=interested,Holding up, dear?  You seem a little incapable of saying the safe word.
-1-female_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=stretching,I guess when you've got superpowers at your disposal, you need to feel unsafe for once to be excited.
-1-female_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=laughing,See, this is why I don't want magic.  <i>This</i> is the kind of thing I'd need to get a thrill again.
-1-female_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=laughing,Hanging in there, Miss Bloodred?  Any tighter and it won't just be your outfit that's scarlet.
-1-female_masturbating,target:meia=teasing,<i>I'm</i> feeling rather pleased.  Want some advice, Meia?  I know you don't do this much.
-1-female_masturbating,target:meia=seductive,Barnette's taught me well, you know.  I could give some pointers...just trying to help my leader out.
-1-female_masturbating,target:meia=teasing,Hang tough, Meia.  If you can pilot that Dread, you can pilot yourself.
-1-female_masturbating,target:meia=smug,There must be <i>some</i> part of you that likes this.  It might be under thirty feet of ice, but it's there.
-1-female_masturbating,target:meia=teasing,No one'll love you until you love yourself, Meia.
-1-female_masturbating,target:meia=vain,To see my cool, collected squadron leader in such a compromising position...is truly exhilarating.
-1-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=teasing,<i>Hoo</i>.  Well, at least you seem like you're in control.  Have fun, girls!
-1-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=seductive,Well, you're not killing anyone, so fine by me.  This is fun to watch!
-1-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=teasing,Just stand a safe distance away...this <i>is</i> pretty sexy.
-1-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=seductive,I <i>knew</i> you two were lovers!  Can't keep your hands off each other...or anything else.
-1-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=vain,As long as you don't clothesline me, you can keep this up all you want, cuties.  Just watch those muscles ripple!
-1-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=seductive,Barnette and I aren't as strong as you two, but maybe I should take notes anyway.
-1-female_masturbating,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:8=teasing,I can't believe I met <i>two</i> women who can fly...and that both would use it for such <i>unsavory</i> reasons.  <i>Teach me</i>!
-1-female_masturbating,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:8=vain,Two women showing off the goods in the air, and neither will bother to show me how!  <i>I</i> want to fly, too, you know.
-1-female_masturbating,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:8=seductive,Hey, what's a beautiful woman got to do to get some flying lessons?  <i>I</i> want to join in on the airborne fun you two are having!
-1-female_masturbating,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:8=vain,You damn Earthling teases are keeping secrets from me!  Can't a gorgeous girl like me learn to fly, too?  I learned to pilot!
-1-female_masturbating,target:marceline=confused,What exactly is letting you float like that?  You've been doing it all game, and it doesn't even look strenuous.
-1-female_masturbating,target:marceline=seductive,You're inhuman in so many ways...no eyes, blue skin, floating.  But you sure masturbate like a normal girl.
-1-female_masturbating,target:marceline=teasing,I guess you're pretty human after all, Eyeballs.  Just look at you floating there, having the time of your life!
-1-female_masturbating,target:marceline=teasing,Going to perform any fancy tricks for us, Miss Levitator?  Masturbate upside down or something?
-1-female_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Remember how I was doing it?  Yeah, do that.
-1-female_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia=stretching,You Earth women really overthink the whole masturbation thing.  Just have fun!
-1-female_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia=excited,Just watching you is making my toes curl.  Isn't another woman's lust <i>thrilling</i>?
-1-female_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,You don't need these men clawing at you, honey.  Come to Mejare and learn to love a <i>woman's</i> touch.
-1-female_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia=seductive,I can just <i>feel</i> how unsatisfied these clumsy Earth men have left you.  My heart goes out to you, as do my fingers.
-1-female_masturbating,target:vriska=confused,You, uh, holding up over there, Vriska?  Wriggling free sometime soon?
-1-female_masturbating,target:vriska=frustrated,...I'm just going to assume she's into this.  I really don't want to touch her.
-1-female_masturbating,target:vriska=bored,...I think I would've preferred you <i>gaining</i> clothes, Vriska.
-1-female_masturbating,target:vriska=bored,That magic was cool, but <i>yeesh</i>.  What a weirdo...
-1-female_masturbating,target:aimee=awkward,I'm...kind of worried about you, Aimee.  Is there something we should know about men's guns?
-1-female_masturbating,target:aimee=bored,I'd definitely give Barnette an intervention if she started masturbating with loaded guns.
-1-female_masturbating,target:aimee=smug,That thing is gonna make a bigger racket than even <i>you</i> are.
-1-female_masturbating,target:aimee=awkward,This is getting way too weird for me, Aimee.  The clothes thing was cool, but <i>this</i>?  It's a death wish!
-1-female_masturbating,target:amalia=excited,Omigosh, is that vine doing what men's tubes do?  It looks like it!  Show me more!
-1-female_masturbating,target:amalia=awkward,...I was just ribbing you about being naughty.  I guess I was right...or I really got to you.
-1-female_masturbating,target:amalia=excited,Ooh, show me more angles!  That's <i>so cool</i>...it's like a really long men's tube, right?  Right?
-1-female_masturbating,target:amalia=laughing,You really <i>are</i> a little skank!  I should've known all princesses are like this, all sheltered and itching for adventure.
-1-female_masturbating,target:amalia=laughing,Can't reach orgasm without a giant tube shoved inside of you, huh?  Glad I didn't grow up stuck with men for my sexual needs.
-1-female_masturbating,target:rinkah=laughing,Did you just--you <i>did</i>!  You're such a beast of a woman, Rinkah...
-1-female_masturbating,target:rinkah=laughing,Are you putting your finger where I think you are?  You've done nothing but confirm stereotypes all evening...you <i>animal</i>.
-1-female_masturbating,target:rinkah=smug,I guess Miss Warrior is so tempered from all her harsh battles, she needs to stick fingers in her rear to feel anything.
-1-female_masturbating,target:rinkah=teasing,I don't know what I expected from you, Miss Fireball, but a finger in the butt checks out.  Barnette and I would never be that dirty.
-1-female_masturbating,target:gwen=smug,...I can't really fault you for this.  If <i>I</i> had spider-web powers, I'd give that a try, too.
-1-female_masturbating,target:gwen=teasing,I'm going to go ahead and guess this isn't <i>all</i> you use that webbing for...if you've got someone else with you.
-1-female_masturbating,target:gwen=vain,That webbing looks like quite a bit of fun!  If only I could give it a try with Barnette.
-1-female_masturbating,target:gwen=seductive,Hey, I like those angles you're pulling, cutie!  Go upside down again!
-1-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=awkward,...I guess you don't need a girlfriend, do you?
-1-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=awkward,...You know, I didn't peg you as the kind of girl who'd be open to this sort of thing.  Or that had superpowers.
-1-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=awkward,You know, I've done that...with Barnette.  You know, <i>another</i> woman.  Not myself.
-1-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=thinking,Now I'm curious how good a clone of me would be at this sort of thing...
-1-female_masturbating,target:kyu=seductive,Hey, Miss Love Fairy.  I know you've got wings, but share the magic a little!  <i>I</i> want to fly too, you know!
-1-female_masturbating,target:kyu=vain,Now <i>this</i> is a good use of wings.  Who wants to sit on the nasty old ground to masturbate?
-1-female_masturbating,target:kyu=interested,I like your style, Miss Pixie.  You were born with wings, and now you've found the perfect use for them.
-1-female_masturbating,target:kyu=stretching,Yeah, I'd probably fly like that, too.  But <i>some</i> fairies just won't share their magic with the rest of us.
-1-female_finished_masturbating=laughing,Good job, ~name~.  Now clean yourself up and report for duty.
-1-female_finished_masturbating=laughing,<i>Now stop fooling around and report to the hangar!</i>  That was my Meia impression.  How do you like it?
-1-female_finished_masturbating=smug,I'll be taking that image back to the Nirvana with me.  Consider it a pirate's plunder.
-1-female_finished_masturbating=teasing,Anytime you want to feel <i>really</i> good, give me and Barnette a call.
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:moon=bored,Nice finish.  The white fluid really stands out against your blackened labia.
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:moon=annoyed,Class act, these Earth girls.  Absolutely marvelous to behold.
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:moon=annoyed,Would you believe I thought I was superior to Earth girls?  Moon here's shown me I have a long way to go.
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:moon=bored,Perfect.  Yeah.  Mm-hm.  Glad you had fun.  See you next time.
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=vain,I knew Earth girls could love each other the way we do.  Men are just so superfluous!
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=seductive,Talk about a Mejarian power couple.  You're stronger than the men I know anyway!
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=teasing,I like the idea of men just picking me up...but it seems like you two could do that anyway.
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=vain,I guess Earth isn't so different from Mejare after all.  Two strong women in love!  ...Like me and Barnette.
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:amalia=stretching,<i>And it just dumps you off, disgusted with your behavior</i>.
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:amalia=smug,Earth women are so bestial, having sex with men and plants in equal measures.
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:amalia=laughing,You ought to be ashamed of yourself, young lady!  Now go get your servant to clean you up!
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:amalia=vain,Looks like Little Miss Princess was just another dirty commoner, begging to be ravished and tossed aside.
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:uravity=seductive,And she just plops down like a doofus!  You get cuter the longer I look at you, darling.
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:uravity=laughing,Have a good time, Miss Gravity?  Seems like you lost control of your little floating maneuver.
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:uravity=teasing,I think you might be the most adorable girl I've ever met, from stuffing your figure into that suit to just plopping on the ground.
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:uravity=laughing,Ha!  I guess you really <i>have</i> overcome your embarrassment, to just drop down like that.  Or maybe that was an accident.
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:black_canary=angry,<i>Oooow</i>!  Hey, shut up, you freak!
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:black_canary=angry,<i>Ow</i>!  What was <i>that</i> for?  <i>Ugh</i>!
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:black_canary=angry,<i>Oooooow</i>!  Ooh, the <i>nerve</i> of some people!  Take your weird voice powers and beat it, freak!
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:black_canary=annoyed,<i>AM I TALKING TOO LOUD?  I THINK I JUST WENT DEAF</i>.
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:morrigan=seductive,What, she's leaving?  Stay a while!  We can talk about woman relationships together!
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:morrigan=seductive,Hey, don't leave so soon, dear!  You're a steal yourself--I can tell you more about more girlfriend!
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:morrigan=seductive,Aww, don't leave, honey!  We just got to meet each other, and you spent it all underneath Morrigan's butt!
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:morrigan=vain,<i>Leave if you must.  I guess I'm not beautiful enough to warrant sticking around</i>.
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:launch=seductive,Ooh, the blue one again!  If you weren't so unstable, I'd invite you back for a drink, cutie.
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:launch=vain,Oh, thank God, the blue one's back.  Good to see a woman who's polite and sincere in my line of work!
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:launch=interested,Just in time.  I wasn't looking forward to hearing your counterpart bellyache about losing.
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:launch=teasing,Just the hair color I wanted to see!  You're so much nicer to be around, even if you're kind of a doormat.
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:meia=seductive,Didn't think you'd be quite so explosive.  <i>But I'm glad you are</i>!
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:meia=seductive,See?  I knew you had a heart.  Don't you feel liberated now?
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:meia=teasing,Now you'll be able to focus next mission.  Or maybe you'll have wandering eyes!
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:meia=vain,There's nothing like your smile.  Except for Barnette's.
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:vriska=shocked,Wha--<i>ew!  W-what's all that blue stuff?  Don't get it on me!  It's gross</i>!
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:vriska=shocked,<i>Ack!  F-fluid!  B-blue fluid everywhere!  Is it poisonous</i>?
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:vriska=shocked,<i>Eeek!  V-Vriska!  What is this?  What did you do?  Why are you leaking blue stuff</i>?
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:vriska=shocked,<i>Ack!  K-keep that stuff away from me!  It's corrosive, isn't it?  M-magic corrosive blue fluid</i>!
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:aimee=shocked,A-ah!  See?  I <i>told</i> you!
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:aimee=bored,...Yeah, <i>definitely</i> making sure Barnette doesn't go this far.
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:aimee=bored,Guess we all knew that was coming, but I wanted to believe you'd pull it off.
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:aimee=frustrated,...I think I prefer <i>Barnette's</i> level of gun-hobby.  As in, not shooting herself.
-1-female_finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,Good job, ~name~.  Now clean yourself up and report for duty.
-1-female_finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia=laughing,<i>Now stop fooling around and report to the hangar!</i>  Thought that was <i>Meia</i> talking, didn't you?
-1-female_finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,I'll be taking that image back to the Nirvana with me.  Consider it a pirate's plunder.
-1-female_finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Anytime you want to feel <i>really</i> good, give me and Barnette a call.
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,...That ended as quickly as it began.  What <i>was</i> that?
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,You don't even seem bothered!  W-why didn't you say you could do stuff like that?
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:elizabeth=awkward,...And this sort of thing just comes naturally to you?  Didn't bat an eye?
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,OK.  Yes.  It's over now, apparently.  Very enlightening, Elizabeth.  Never judge by appearances.




#SELF MASTURBATING
#If your character is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must masturbate.
#These lines only come up in the relevant stages, so you don't need to include the stage numbers here. Just remember which stage is which when you make the images. The "starting" image is still in the naked stage.
#The "finished_masturbating" line will repeat many times if the game is not yet finished. This plays as opponents comment on the how good their hands are.
-3-must_masturbate_first=sad,Aww...it's no fun to just lose completely like that.
-3-must_masturbate_first=bored,The first to lose...better not tell Meia, or she'll give me a three-hour strategy lecture.
-3-must_masturbate_first=bored,This game is all luck...Meia would insist otherwise, though.  How does that girl not boil over already?
-3-must_masturbate_first=frustrated,Damn.  I thought I was kinda good at cards, too.
-3-must_masturbate_first=bored,Damn it all.  I was really looking forward to teasing someone else about this first.
-3-must_masturbate_first,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=bored,...Well, this is awkward.  Yeah, I have to...yeah.
-3-must_masturbate_first,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=frustrated,Not how I planned on you finding out...now you're annoyed <i>and</i> disappointed with me.
-3-must_masturbate_first,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=laughing,I guess lying to you <i>and</i> losing first isn't going to improve your opinion of me, is it?
-3-must_masturbate_first,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=smug,Well, at least masturbating will temporarily distract me from the mixture of hatred and disappointment you're putting out.
-3-must_masturbate_first,timeInStage:0-0=smug,Yeah, I figured that wouldn't last long.  But I'll keep my hair back, don't worry.
-3-must_masturbate_first,timeInStage:0-0=seductive,Impressive showing, ladies.  I didn't think Earth girls had it in them to finish me off in a hurry like that.
-3-must_masturbate_first,timeInStage:0-0=laughing,Ouch.  All those accessories must have really pissed you off, huh?
-3-must_masturbate_first,timeInStage:0-0=teasing,I took the shot, you got the kill.  <i>Enjoy the greatest show in space</i>.
-3-must_masturbate_first,timeInStage:7-99=interested,Somehow I held out for a while, but you still beat me.  I guess this game really <i>is</i> just luck.
-3-must_masturbate_first,timeInStage:7-99=stretching,The first to go, but it took a while.  And I was hardly paying attention!
-3-must_masturbate_first,timeInStage:7-99=laughing,I had a streak going, too.  You <i>sure</i> you want me to start things off?  You're not going to top it.
-3-must_masturbate_first,timeInStage:7-99=bored,Can't believe I was the first one out.  Yeah, I lost interest, but I was still sticking around, so I figured you didn't know how cards worked.
-3-must_masturbate_first,hasHand:Two Pair=frustrated,Yeesh--I had <i>two pair</i>!  You Earth people aren't just prude--you're <i>ruthless</i>.
-3-must_masturbate_first,hasHand:Two Pair=annoyed,Even with <i>that</i>, I'm the first one out?  You've all got killer instincts to make Meia proud.
-3-must_masturbate_first,hasHand:Two Pair=bored,Jeez!  I had <i>two pair</i>, and I go down like this...you should all join our crew with how ruthless you are.
-3-must_masturbate_first,alsoPlaying:pit=bored,No, I don't...and apparently all my teasing can't shake men's poker faces.
-3-must_masturbate_first,alsoPlaying:pit=frustrated,No men at all, Pit...and next to them, I just look like an idiot bimbo, apparently.
-3-must_masturbate_first,alsoPlaying:pit=bored,Not one man on Mejare...and apparently they're biologically better at poker.
-3-must_masturbate_first,alsoPlaying:pit=bored,No.  Apparently we don't have poker there, either.
-3-must_masturbate_first,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=bored,Well, that could have gone either way...looks like it went the wrong one.
-3-must_masturbate_first,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=laughing,Aw...and I was <i>thiiiiis</i> close to making <i>you</i> do it first.
-3-must_masturbate_first,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=laughing,OK, I'll admit.  My dream was to make you have to do this first, and find out <i>that</i> way.
-3-must_masturbate_first,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=frustrated,Aw, jeez.  I didn't want to lose first like this...now you have <i>two</i> reasons to be mad at me.
-3-must_masturbate_first,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=bored,OK, so this isn't how I planned things out, I'll admit.  You're too good at cards to be here.
-3-must_masturbate_first,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=stretching,What's the big deal?  You're a <i>loooong</i> way from being in my shoes...a few inches, too.
-3-must_masturbate_first,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=laughing,Ignorance is bliss, isn't it, Meia?  Well, looks like I'll be reaching bliss <i>another</i> way.
-3-must_masturbate_first,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=seductive,Well, maybe that wasn't the best performance, and maybe I lied to you a little.  But I'll give 110% next flight practice, OK?
-3-must_masturbate_first,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=frustrated,Damn.  Look, just settle down, OK?  Barnette and I are fine.
-3-must_masturbate_first,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=teasing,Hey, if Barnette and I were having issues, I'd be making it up to her <i>right now</i>.
-3-must_masturbate_first,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=seductive-2,A few white lies of omission have never harmed my relationship with Barnette.
-3-must_masturbate_first,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=smug,My, my, aren't <i>we</i> touchy?  Speaking of touching, and Barnette...
-3-must_masturbate_first,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=seductive-2,You don't have to <i>watch</i>.  I have to do it, though.  Shame.
-3-must_masturbate_first,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=bored,Aw, jeez.  Lost first <i>and</i> Meia's mad at me.  What a killer night.
-3-must_masturbate_first,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=laughing,OK, so I lied to you.  Yelling at me is only going to make me take longer to finish.
-3-must_masturbate_first,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=teasing,I mean, you could help me out if you want to get it over with.  Crewmates need to be there for each other!
-3-must_masturbate_first,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=bored,Yeah, I had a feeling you wouldn't be satisfied with beating me.  Not when this was the result.
-3-must_masturbate_first,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=bored,Well, jeez.  It wasn't my plan for you to find out this way...either me losing or you.
-3-must_masturbate_first,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=bored,Well, this is embarrassing.  I pictured you finding out by someone <i>else</i> losing.
-3-must_masturbate_first,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=awkward,Uh...<i>so how's the formation schedule looking, Meia</i>?
-3-must_masturbate=bored,I was lucky when it came to genetics...not so much here.
-3-must_masturbate=seductive-2,Meia would be so disappointed in me.  Good thing disappointment is her version of love.
-3-must_masturbate=bored,I'll be honest.  Once the dress came off, I kinda stopped caring.
-3-must_masturbate=bored,I've never beaten Meia...can't beat Earth women, either, apparently.
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=interested,Seems I'm further from beating you than ever.  How are you so damn <i>good</i> at this, Meia?
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=teasing,You really knocked me silly, boss.  Now I have knock <i>myself</i> silly, if you follow.
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=interested,I just came here to have a good time, not lord my poker skills over complete strangers.  That's <i>your</i> job.
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=vain,I mean, it wouldn't be fair if I were a beautiful pilot <i>and</i> good at cards.
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=vain,At least we're showing them the full spectrum of Mejarian women, personality-wise.
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=vain,I think I can be happy with beating you once.  Well, <i>masturbating</i> is what'll make me happy.
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=stretching,Oh, boss...so concerned with the outcome of a silly game, right up till the end.
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=seductive-2,Your poor crewmate has to humiliate herself in front of you, and all you've got is a critique of her poker face?
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=seductive,At least I didn't <i>totally</i> lose.  Hey, Leader...you can touch me if you want.  <i>I trust you</i>.
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=bored,Yeah, yeah...I'll try harder next time, alright?  Kind of lost focus...
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=smug,Well, I'm gonna do my best to have fun now, since the game isn't all that stimulating.
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=frustrated,I thought I was doing well for a while...but you pulled ahead, as usual.
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=seductive,Your emphasis on the game got me wrapped up in it a little, Leader.  But all for naught.
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=bored,Coming so close to getting you nude without pulling it off has <i>me</i> disappointed, frankly.
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=frustrated,Damn.  I really wanted to be the one to make you get your breasts out, at least...
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=stretching,I really thought I could beat you for a second there...oh, well.
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=sad,Hm.  Well, maybe next time I'll beat you...like I say <i>every</i> time.
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:pit=vain,That's exactly right, but I don't think I'm missing much.  Women's bodies are absolutely exquisite--ask Barnette how much I like them.
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:pit=confused,Nope.  Mejare's no paradise, but don't ask me how men and women are expected to coexist on Earth like you do.  We're so <i>different</i>!
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,Don't think for a second I'm afraid to do this with you around, Angel-boy.  I've worked with men...they're just big softies.
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:pit=smug,What gave it away, Pit?  My same-sex relationship?  My incessant questioning of male physiology?  The fact I said it flat-out?
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,We don't have much in the way of phallic objects, either, for the record.  So my experience there is really quite limited...
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=seductive,Aww.  Well, aren't <i>you</i> a sweetheart when you lose that stuffy clothing of yours!
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=vain,It's nice to hear some praise from you for once.  It wasn't even about my body!
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=stretching,You're getting soft, Meia.  I wouldn't expect praise from you unless I won, and flawlessly.
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=seductive,Aww, you're just a big <i>sweetie-pie</i>, aren't you?  I'll try not to bother you <i>too</i> much.
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=laughing,<i>My, my!</i>  Isn't <i>this</i> uncomfortable?
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=bored,Damn.  Now I have to masturbate as Meia squirms next to me, trying not to enjoy herself.
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=smug,Oh, great.  This is going to ruin it for both of us.
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=frustrated,Well, <i>that</i> was poor timing on my end.  Had this been a dogfight, we'd both be in scrapheaps now.
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=frustrated,I think you're rubbing off on me.  I actually kind of wanted to win there.
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=smug,I was really into that for a moment.  You're rubbing off on me...and now I have to rub off.
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=seductive-2,It would seem Mejare is no match for the sheer luck of these nasty Earth people.
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=vain,Should've piled on more accessories.  That would've done the trick.
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=laughing,Oh?  <i>Praise</i> from Meia Gisborn?  You really <i>have</i> loosened up.
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=vain,I can't believe you complimented me!  That's a first--must be all the lust in the air.
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=seductive,I think having your breasts out is softening you up, Meia.  Was that <i>praise</i> I just heard out of you?
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=seductive,Aww, thanks, Meia!  I actually kind of wanted to beat you.  I guess there's always next time!
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=teasing,Too bad I couldn't pry those shorts off myself.  You've still got some dignity left.
-3-must_masturbate,hasHand:Two Pair=bored,Not how I thought things would end.  I mean, I thought I might lose, but I figured it'd be with, you know, a <i>bad</i> hand.
-3-must_masturbate,hasHand:Two Pair=bored,Jeez, you all <i>really</i> want to see me masturbate.  I may be beautiful, but it's not <i>that</i> special...
-3-must_masturbate,hasHand:Two Pair=bored,Well, there was no stopping <i>that</i>.  You sure you didn't learn from Gascogne herself, beating hands like that?
-3-must_masturbate,timeInStage:0-0=sad,Aw, so soon?  I wanted to stand around and flaunt it a little.  You suck.
-3-must_masturbate,timeInStage:0-0=bored,Yeah, kinda just gave up there.  Meia's always harping on me about that...
-3-must_masturbate,timeInStage:0-0=stretching,Apparently my hair was the secret to my success.
-3-must_masturbate,timeInStage:0-0=interested,Hey, I'm gonna sit down to masturbate.  So you just pissed away your full-body view.
-3-must_masturbate,timeInStage:7-99=seductive,Well, hey.  I get to masturbate, and you got your full-body view for a while.  We all win!
-3-must_masturbate,timeInStage:7-99=vain,<i>Somehow</i> I went on for a while.  I was throwing random cards back!  Oh, well, time for some fun.
-3-must_masturbate,timeInStage:7-99=seductive,Can't believe I lasted so long.  You've enjoyed a full view--now you'll see <i>inside me</i>.
-3-must_masturbate,timeInStage:7-99=seductive-2,Oh, the horror!  My long lucky streak comes to a close, and I'm forced to caress my buxom body before these hostile aliens.  Fate, you cruel mistress!
-3-start_masturbating=mast-1,Oh, well.  This'll be fun, too!  And you'll see even more of me.
-3-start_masturbating=mast-1,Can you imagine <i>Meia</i> doing this?  I don't think she'd be able to <i>find</i> her vagina.
-3-start_masturbating=mast-1,My crewmates have seen my nude body...only Barnette's seen me like <i>this</i>.
-3-start_masturbating=mast-1,This'll take the edge off.  Who's the <i>real</i> winner?
-3-start_masturbating=mast-1,This'll feel great, though.  So no hard feelings, and you'll get quite the show!
-3-start_masturbating,totalMasturbating:1-4,priority:0=mast-1,Guess I have to join the fun.  But what great fun it'll be--and you'll all learn something!
-3-start_masturbating,totalMasturbating:1-4,priority:0=mast-1,Alright, ladies, time for me to show you how a <i>real</i> woman pleasures herself.  Take notes.
-3-start_masturbating,totalMasturbating:1-4,priority:0=mast-1,I hope my methods aren't too <i>alien</i> for you.  Watch closely before you finish!
-3-start_masturbating,totalMasturbating:1-4,priority:0=mast-1,Now watch <i>me</i>--this is how a home-grown Mejarian pirate does it, with skills honed from an insatiable gun-nut of a girlfriend.
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:6-7=mast-1,You're a cute little boy, Pit, so don't feel bad...but from what I've seen of men, <i>tall and muscular</i> is what gets me going.
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:6-7,marker:fama_and_oma=mast-1,Probably not, Pit.  Get Ezra over here...she's a Fama, so she'd probably be more into the whole young-children thing.
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:6-7=mast-1,Oh, please.  You think I need a <i>man</i> to masturbate?  Honey, you've got the wrong idea about Mejarians...
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:6-7=mast-1,Aww, it's so sweet when men get all shy.  I really thought they'd be at their boldest when playing with their tubes, but I guess the alien woman was just too scary.
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:6-7=mast-1,There's no need, Mr. Angel...I have my lovely little Barnette to think about, curled up back on the ship and waiting for me.
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=mast-1,What's that supposed to mean?  Mejarians have sex all the time--but I guess you're right, it <i>does</i> sort of resemble this.
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=mast-1,You don't honestly think we're all sexually frustrated on Mejare, right?  Women <i>love</i> each other...very much.
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=mast-1,Hey, a woman who can't appreciate the female form has no place on Mejare.  We <i>all</i> love each other...
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=mast-1,I'm pretty sure I've mentioned my girlfriend, Pit.  What, do you think Mejarians just lie around and masturbate over the men we're told to hate?
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=mast-1,Oh, please.  This is just for the game...back on the ship, my fingers are for Barnette's use only.
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=mast-1,You don't seem terribly experienced with girls yourself, sweetie.  But if <i>anyone</i> can appreciate women's bodies, it's a Mejarian.
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=mast-1,Am I <i>that</i> hideous, Meia?  Will this really make it harder to work with me later?
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=mast-1,This isn't really too much of a step beyond how I treat you in the showers.  Take it easy.
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=mast-1,Your words hurt me, Leader.  Don't you know how much I value my looks?
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=mast-1,Just don't look at my face and it won't get weird.  My body <i>deserves</i> to be masturbated to!
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=mast-1,Hey, it's no fun if you don't slow down and enjoy yourself.  Do you know what "enjoy yourself" means, Meia?
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=mast-1,Honestly, you can find a way to ruin even <i>masturbation.</i>  It's the purest form of love...and selfishness.
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=mast-1,Masturbation is sex with someone I love, Leader.  You have to keep your lover satisfied.
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=mast-1,Doesn't it take you <i>forever</i> to do this?  Yeah, I can see why you'd want to speed it up in general.
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=mast-1,But you're right, Meia.  I shouldn't need any assistance here...it's my favorite thing to do.
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=mast-1,Normally I have help, but I can manage all by my lonesome...<i>you heartless monster.</i>
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=mast-1,I'll be sure to wow everyone, Meia.  That'll still make you proud, right?
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=mast-1,Just let me do my thing.  You've already done yours, and what a show it was.
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=mast-1,I just know how to be myself in these situations, Meia.  You'd probably overthink it and never cum at all...
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=mast-1,Hey, it's just masturbation.  I'm the only one who has to be happy by the end.
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=mast-1,I love myself, so masturbation is like romantic sex to me.  You wouldn't understand, being all self-loathing.
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=mast-1,That's about enough sass out of <i>you</i>, Leader.  I need to enjoy myself here, so why don't you let me?
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=mast-1,Hey, <i>you're</i> the one who never accepts any help.  Feel free to give some.
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=mast-1,No help at <i>all</i>?  I thought my squadron leader was a mother to her women.
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=mast-1,Not going to help your poor crewmate, boss?  So much for your selfless professionalism.
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=mast-1,Well, <i>I'm</i> not so cruel.  I'll help you out whenever you want.  That's what crewmates do!
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=mast-1,Can't we talk about piloting and ranks later?  I'm a little busy now.
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=mast-1,Take your mind off our ranks for a second, Meia.  I'm trying to masturbate here.
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=mast-1,Let's try not to play squadron politics in the middle of a masturbation session.  Have a little tact, boss.
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=mast-1,We can talk about where I stand on the pecking order after I finish this up.
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=mast-1,I'll never understand why you equate cards with piloting skill.  All the same, let me focus on this.
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=mast-1,Don't mind my leader's musings.  I'm pretty sure she's some sort of asexual gynoid.
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=mast-1,Yeah, yeah, I wouldn't expect you understand the joys of sex.  Have you <i>had</i> sex?
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=mast-1,Hey now, Meia, self-love is important.  You could use a little of that...or maybe a lot.
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=mast-1,I'm going to enjoy myself now.  Try not to totally kill the mood, if you know how to avoid that.
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=mast-1,Oh, don't overthink things.  It'll just be a quick little session!
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=mast-1,I'm secure in my beauty, Meia.  I don't mind if people watch a little...and neither should you.
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=mast-1,You could do with a little more sexual adventurousness.  It's not like there's any touching.
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=mast-1,Hey, my body is for Barnette's hands only.  But <i>everyone</i> can look!
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=mast-1,Barnette's my one and only, but it'd be doing the universe a disservice to not put my body on display.

-2-masturbating=mast-2,I'm so used to making others feel good.  I've forgotten how to do it myself...
-2-masturbating=mast-3,I'll just think of Barnette.  That always works...she's so <i>cute</i>!
-2-masturbating=interested,Do you think I'm getting out of shape?  Barnette always leaves me out of breath these days.
-2-masturbating=smug,Getting a good look, ~player~?
-2-masturbating=seductive,I've had my eye on you, ~player~...any eyes on <i>me</i>?
-2-masturbating=interested,Playing against me just keeps getting better, doesn't it?
-2-masturbating=stretching,Barnette, Meia, Belvedere...so many lovely ladies on the Nirvana.  Give me a reason to think of <i>you</i>.
-2-masturbating=mast-2,You know how many Tarakkians would kill to see me do this?  ...That's right, zero.
-2-masturbating=mast-2,Better than I even thought it'd be...I'm so talented.
-2-masturbating=mast-2,See, <i>this</i> is fun.  Poker just gets boring after a while.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:amalia,alsoPlayingStage:5,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=seductive,Hey, what did you--did you just summon flowers?  Ooh, give <i>me</i> some!  I love flowers--they're so romantic!
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:amalia,alsoPlayingStage:5,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=seductive,Hey, flowers aren't clothing--but they <i>are</i> beautiful, so I don't mind!  Got any for me?
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:amalia,alsoPlayingStage:5,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=interested,Omigosh, you can <i>summon flowers</i>?  That's so cool!  Why didn't you pull some tricks like this earlier?  Can I have some?
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:amalia,alsoPlayingStage:5,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=confused,Did you--can you--you can just make plants appear?  What kind of weirdo magic are you working with?  ...Can I have some flowers?
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:joey,alsoPlayingStage:4,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=angry,Ew, now you're <i>eating</i> it?  What's the matter with you?
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:joey,alsoPlayingStage:4,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=annoyed,Oh, God, you're <i>eating</i> it.  I think all that makeup has soaked into your head and addled your brain, honey.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:joey,alsoPlayingStage:4,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=awkward,...Yeah, I don't know how Earth does it, but on Mejare we use refrigerators to store food, not our vaginas.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:joey,alsoPlayingStage:4,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=awkward,...Is this part of being a clown?  Eating rotten old juice-soaked bananas?  Is this what gets men going?
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6,priority:0=seductive,Any men on your mind, Leader?  I know you're just as curious about our prisoners as I am...
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6,priority:0=teasing,I refuse to believe there's no woman in your life, the way those hungry eyes are moving...you're keeping secrets from us.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6,priority:0=excited,Just two crewmates enjoying each other's company...<i>don't overthink things.</i>
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6,priority:0=seductive-2,At your behest, I'll try to avert my eyes...but you're so <i>cute!</i>  This isn't fair to me.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0,priority:0=laughing,Barnette, Belvedere, even you, Meia...so many lovely ladies on the Nirvana.  Give me a reason to think of someone else.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0,priority:0=seductive,Don't worry, Meia, you're still gorgeous, even if you're completely miserable.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0,priority:0=teasing,You just can't help how beautiful you are, Meia, even when you're in full glacier-mode.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0,priority:0=seductive-2,You can shoot all the death stares you want, boss.  You're still just so adorable!
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0,priority:0=smug,I know I've let you down, Meia, but cool it with the glares.  You're just making this take longer.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1,priority:0=teasing,Is there a reason I shouldn't stare at my beautiful squadron leader?  Because that suit leaves your form fully on display.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1,priority:0=seductive,Don't worry, Meia, you're still cute, wrapped up in that tight little bodysuit.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1,priority:0=smug,There's just no pleasing you, is there, Meia?  I mean, besides winning the game.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1,priority:0=stretching,Don't give me the stink-eye like that, Leader.  I'm just following the rules.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1,priority:0=interested,You're still a steal, Meia, even if that clunky armor hides your cute little shoulders.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2,priority:0=seductive,Good thing your form is fully on display.  Have I ever told you how pretty you are, Leader?
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2,priority:0=seductive-2,If only we were naked together.  I think it'd generate some sisterly affection.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2,priority:0=smug,It was so very rude of you to leave your crewmate to her fate, Meia.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2,priority:0=seductive-2,Don't let these nasty Earth people touch me, Meia.  I'm delicate...and taken.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3,priority:0=seductive,It was so very nice of you to strip the bodysuit for me.  I wish <i>I</i> were that beautifully pale.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3,priority:0=interested,There's something strangely appealing about how you just toss on that ratty gym clothing as underwear...and then stand proud in it.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3,priority:0=teasing,I'm nothing if not courageous, Meia.  You know that, don't you?
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3,priority:0=vain,Remember how brave I was to risk your wrath here the next time you call me cowardly during a mission.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3,priority:0=seductive-2,See, boss?  I'm <i>full</i> of surprises...and love.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4,priority:0=stretching,At least you're out of that bra.  I have such a pretty squadron leader.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4,priority:0=vain,Shame those nasty old gym shorts ruin your wonderful pale figure.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4,priority:0=seductive,I try to stay faithful, Meia, but there's so many beautiful women out there...like the cute topless pilot in front of me.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4,priority:0=laughing,It's so cute the way you stay all nonchalant, even without a bra.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4,priority:0=smug,I just know how to have fun.  Sorry if that's an alien concept to you.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5,priority:0=seductive,For my leader to be standing all tall and proud like this, even when naked...<i>you're so cool, Meia!</i>
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5,priority:0=vain,Standing up straight and rigid, even with your breasts swinging about.  Now that's what I call professional.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5,priority:0=smug,You don't have to flirt with me, but I <i>do</i> appreciate a lustful eye now and then.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5,priority:0=vain,I'm not ashamed to show off my body, Leader...it's beautiful to behold.  You shouldn't be ashamed, either.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5,priority:0=vain,It isn't the Mejarian way to be shy about these sorts of things, you know.  We're quite proud of our beauty as a people.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:pit,priority:0=vain,I'm just so very beautiful, Mr. Angel...and nothing has ever indicated otherwise.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:pit,priority:0=smug,Well, Pit, when every woman you've ever met has been totally overcome by your beauty, you start to believe them...
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:pit,priority:0=laughing,You're so sweet, Angel-boy...I wonder if you'd like to try that <i>paizuri</i> thing I read about.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:pit,priority:0=mast-2,Everyone I meet seems to justify my ego, actually...that's why my Barnette tries so hard to keep me happy, that jealous little thing.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:pit,priority:0=mast-2,I just love women's bodies, that's all...and since mine is the ideal woman's body, I love myself most of all.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:pit,priority:0=interested,Paying me compliments, now?  Good idea, Pit...women <i>love it</i> when someone notices how beautiful they are.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7,priority:0=stretching,I'm doing my best to remember the look on your face when you were doing this, but it all passed by so quickly.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7,priority:0=smug,Look at you, just sitting over there all pleased with yourself.  You're too much.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7,priority:0=vain,At least I got you to lighten up a little.  I'd call this a victory for Jura!
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7,priority:0=seductive,You've smirked more tonight than you have in all the years I've known you.  You <i>like</i> it here, don't you, Meia?
-2-heavy_masturbating=mast-4,Hoo...hah...I'm short of breath over here.
-2-heavy_masturbating=mast-4,Gotta...relax...stay steady...
-2-heavy_masturbating=mast-3,Mmm...<i>Barnette</i>.
-2-heavy_masturbating=mast-5,Oh...
-2-heavy_masturbating=mast-4,I'm getting there...
-2-heavy_masturbating=mast-4,Hey, ~player~, you wanna...you wanna...
-2-heavy_masturbating=mast-4,Hey, ~player~, you...ah, jeez.
-2-heavy_masturbating=mast-4,Can't even be coy anymore...can't think straight.
-2-finishing_masturbating=orgasm,Mmm...<i>mmm</i>!
-2-finishing_masturbating=orgasm,Oh...<i>mmm</i>!
-2-finishing_masturbating=orgasm,Agh--<i>mm</i>!
-2-finishing_masturbating=orgasm,<i>Gasp</i>!  Mmm...
-2-finishing_masturbating=orgasm,Ngh--<i>mmm</i>!
-2-finishing_masturbating=orgasm,Agh!  Nnh...

-1-finished_masturbating=vain,I'll have you know my thoughts were on Barnette that <i>entire</i> time.
-1-finished_masturbating=stretching,...Hoo.  What a workout.
-1-finished_masturbating=stretching,Now <i>that</i> was exhausting.  But I feel great!
-1-finished_masturbating=stretching,Just burns the calories right off!  Meia should spend less time in the gym and more time in the bedroom.  Y'know, if she had a girlfriend.
-1-finished_masturbating=vain,I can feel the fat just melting away!  Good thing, too, since Barnette's a wonderful cook.
-1-finished_masturbating=afterglow,...<i>So good</i>.
-1-finished_masturbating=stretching,I never get tired of that sensation.
-1-finished_masturbating=smug,Not as good as with Barnette, but hey, I was picturing her cute little face.
-1-finished_masturbating=thinking,Definitely better in the hot springs.  They boost female hormones, we think.
-1-finished_masturbating=laughing,...Oof.  Lost myself for a second there.
-1-finished_masturbating=vain,Maybe I'll just up and go home now.  You've seen enough of me, right?
-1-finished_masturbating=stretching,What a refresher.  Always puts me in a good mood.
-1-finished_masturbating=afterglow,....

-1-finished_masturbating=afterglow,...
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:amalia,alsoPlayingStage:5,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=seductive,Hey, what did you--did you just summon flowers?  Ooh, give <i>me</i> some!  I love flowers--they're so romantic!
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:amalia,alsoPlayingStage:5,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=seductive,Hey, flowers aren't clothing--but they <i>are</i> beautiful, so I don't mind!  Got any for me?

-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:joey,alsoPlayingStage:4,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=angry,Ew, now you're <i>eating</i> it?  What's the matter with you?
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:joey,alsoPlayingStage:4,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=awkward,Oh, God, you're <i>eating</i> it.  I think all that makeup has soaked into your head and addled your brain, honey.
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:joey,alsoPlayingStage:4,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=bored,...Yeah, I don't know how Earth does it, but on Mejare we use refrigerators to store food, not our vaginas.
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:joey,alsoPlayingStage:4,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=frustrated,...Is this part of being a clown?  Eating rotten old juice-soaked bananas?  Is this what gets men going?
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:0-5,timeInStage:0-0=smug,What, that's it?  I did a little more for you than <i>not</i> try to kill you.
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:0-5,timeInStage:0-0=teasing,Hey, Magno Vivan's pirates are all very sweet ladies, provided you're nice to us...and you're female.
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:0-5,timeInStage:0-0=vain,Hey, we don't just kill men indiscriminately...that's the job of Mejarian imperials.
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:0-5,timeInStage:0-0=smug,Hey, if you think <i>we're</i> the aggressors, take your little male self down on a trip to Mejare and see how <i>they</i> treat you.
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:6-7,timeInStage:0-0=laughing,Judging by how closely you're guarding that tube of yours, this seems pretty high-stakes to <i>me</i>.
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:6-7,timeInStage:0-0=stretching,Funny.  To a Tarakkian, there's no higher-stakes environment than being naked next to a ravenous woman.
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:6-7,timeInStage:0-0=laughing,Well, you've certainly got the enthusiasm for it.  Seems short men are always bursting at the seams with energy...guess it's got no space to escape.
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:6-7,timeInStage:0-0=smug,I'd rather you work on giving yourself a few extra inches, Pit, but sure, focus on the poker skills.
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:mahiru,timeInStage:0-0=confused,<i>Mmm</i>...hm?  What?  O-oh, uh, thanks, Mahiru!  Interesting time to take a photo.
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:mahiru,timeInStage:0-0=laughing,Huh?  Did you take a photograph when I came?  That's just <i>perverted</i>.
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:mahiru,timeInStage:0-0=vain,Good to know I'm beautiful even when I lose control of myself.  Thanks, Mahiru.
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:mahiru,timeInStage:0-0=seductive,Thanks, honey.  I don't have a camera on me, but I'm sure your O-face is just as cute.
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:mahiru,timeInStage:0-0=vain,Oh, did you take a photo of me <i>cumming</i>?  You little pervert.  At least I know Barnette's not seeing me at my ugliest.
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,I'll have you know my thoughts were on Barnette that <i>entire</i> time.
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia=afterglow,...

-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia=stretching,Now <i>that</i> was exhausting.  But I feel great!
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia=stretching,Just burns the calories right off!  This is <i>way</i> better than the gym, Meia.
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,I can feel the fat just melting away!  Good thing, too, since Barnette's a wonderful cook.
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:meia=afterglow,...<i>So good</i>.

0-game_over_victory=vain,What a sad display.  At least my outfit lets you enjoy my body anyway!
0-game_over_victory=smug,Beautiful <i>and</i> smart.  I really <i>am</i> perfect.
0-game_over_victory=vain,Not even <i>one</i> loss.  Meia won't believe me.
0-game_over_victory=teasing,Didn't you <i>want</i> to see me naked?
0-game_over_victory=vain,I guess I was already showing too much for you to care if you beat me.
0-game_over_victory,alsoPlaying:d.va,priority:0=laughing,...I don't know what <i>Starcraft</i> is, but I think I know what you mean all the same, you little skank.
0-game_over_victory,alsoPlaying:d.va,priority:0=vain,Oh, is that a fact?  You little slut--sure, my girlfriend films <i>me</i>, but that's private.
0-game_over_victory,alsoPlaying:d.va,priority:0=teasing,I seem to have learned all I need, D.Va--but you're cute, so maybe I'll curl up with my girlfriend and give it a shot.
0-game_over_victory,alsoPlaying:d.va,priority:0=smug,Maybe I will, cutie.  I didn't take you for the kind of nymph who'd masturbate in front of <i>that</i> many people.
0-game_over_victory,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,What a sad display.  At least my outfit lets you enjoy my body anyway!
0-game_over_victory,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,Beautiful <i>and</i> smart.  I really <i>am</i> perfect.
0-game_over_victory,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,Well, well, well.  How about that, Meia?  I finally beat you--and handily, at that.
0-game_over_victory,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Didn't you <i>want</i> to see me naked?
0-game_over_victory,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,I guess I was already showing too much for you to care if you beat me.
0-game_over_victory,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,I think I got to know you a little better, Meia.  The Paksis will like that.
0-game_over_victory,alsoPlaying:pit,priority:0=smug,Play another game, probably, since you're all such poor poker players.
0-game_over_victory,alsoPlaying:pit,priority:0=laughing,I was thinking I'd head to another table and see if they can actually strip me.  Don't come along--it's clear <i>you</i> can't.
0-game_over_victory,alsoPlaying:pit,priority:0=vain,I think I'll put my clothes back on, Pit--<i>oh wait, that won't be necessary</i>.
0-game_over_victory,alsoPlaying:pit,priority:0=teasing,Well, since I still have my rapier, I guess I'll cut out your liver and store it for dinner tomorrow.


#lost rapier
1-game_over_victory=smug,Better luck next time, ladies.
1-game_over_victory=vain,Don't feel bad.  I have the <i>brains</i> to match my beauty!
1-game_over_victory=vain,I'm better at cards than I look.  And better-looking than even my cards.
1-game_over_victory=teasing,You disarmed me, but all I needed was the cards.
1-game_over_victory,alsoPlaying:pit,priority:0=teasing,Pick up my rapier, first and foremost.  After that, I don't know.  Maybe <i>eat you alive</i>.
1-game_over_victory,alsoPlaying:pit,priority:0=laughing,Mejarians are known for eating men's organs, so I guess I better get started, Angel-Boy.
1-game_over_victory,alsoPlaying:pit,priority:0=stretching,The universe is my oyster, Pit!  But first I need to see where I left my rapier.
1-game_over_victory,alsoPlaying:pit,priority:0=vain,Play another game, probably--after all, Pit, I didn't even get to strip.
1-game_over_victory,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,Better luck next time, ladies.
1-game_over_victory,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,Don't feel bad.  I have the <i>brains</i> to match my beauty!
1-game_over_victory,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,I'm better at cards than I look.  And better-looking than even my cards.
1-game_over_victory,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,You disarmed me, but all I needed was the cards.
1-game_over_victory,alsoPlaying:meia=vain,Can't believe I beat you so easily, Meia!  Oh well, let's go home already.
1-game_over_victory,alsoPlaying:meia=teasing,Kinda disappointed we couldn't get naked together, Meia.  <i>Maybe we would have fallen fo each other</i>.
1-game_over_victory,alsoPlaying:d.va,priority:0=laughing,...I don't know what <i>Starcraft</i> is, but I think I know what you mean all the same, you little skank.
1-game_over_victory,alsoPlaying:d.va,priority:0=vain,Oh, is that a fact?  You little slut--sure, my girlfriend films <i>me</i>, but that's private.

#lost boots
2-game_over_victory=teasing,I hope you realize how humiliating it was for me to be in public without my wonderful boots.
2-game_over_victory=vain,Thought I was some brainless ditz?  I'm an ace pilot, I'll have you know.
2-game_over_victory=vain,I guess my beauty made you forget I'm a pirate, and a cunning one at that.
2-game_over_victory=teasing,Looks can be deceiving.  I'm quite the accomplished pilot, so poker is child's play!
2-game_over_victory=laughing,You weren't that close anyway.  I still had my armbands and jewelry!
2-game_over_victory,alsoPlaying:pit,priority:0=vain,What I'm going to <i>do</i> is get those boots.  Those gems alone are worth more than your entire outfit!
2-game_over_victory,alsoPlaying:pit,priority:0=teasing,Go home, most likely.  If you'd like to masturbate to my feet again, I wouldn't mind the flattery.

#GAME OVER DEFEAT
game_over_defeat=teasing,My Barnette will be so jealous of you...I'll have to calm her down, if you know what I mean.
game_over_defeat=laughing,Congratulations, ~name~.  Enjoy your sexual frustration!
game_over_defeat=seductive,Nice meeting you, ~player~.  You should come aboard the Nirvana sometime.
game_over_defeat=seductive,See you soon, ~player~.  Mejare's lovely this time of year...well, sort of.
game_over_defeat=seductive-2,Public nudity is so <i>embarrassing</i>.  What will I tell my Barnette, with all these strangers having ogled me?
game_over_defeat=teasing,Just you wait.  Next time, I won't just stop trying halfway through!
game_over_defeat=stretching,You got lucky, ~name~.  I lost interest in the cards after a while.
game_over_defeat=teasing,Congratulations, you've outplayed Jura Basil Elden.  More than Mejare's military can say.
game_over_defeat=stretching,Wow, am I feeling refreshed!  This was a great idea.  <i>Toodle--oo</i>!
game_over_defeat=seductive,This game was every bit as fun as I thought it'd be.  And I gave you a great show, right?
game_over_defeat=seductive,Sorry for jerking you around at first, but you made me pay for it, right?
game_over_defeat=vain,I hope I've improved everyone's opinions of Magno Vivan's Mejarian pirates...or at least their bodies.
game_over_defeat=vain,Be glad it was me here and not Meia.  All you'd have gotten there is some nasty glares.
game_over_defeat=meia,...Why didn't you tell me we had to masturbate, Jura?
game_over_defeat=meia,Ehehehe...seems my boss is here to take me home.
game_over_defeat=meia,<i>O-oh, hi, Meia</i>!  Did you...enjoy the little <i>extra</i> rule this place has?
game_over_defeat=meia,<i>There</i> you are.  You lost, too...at least you knew what the consequences were.
game_over_defeat=meia,<i>Meia</i>!  This cutie here is m-my boss...who I didn't tell about the whole <i>masturbation</i> thing.
game_over_defeat=meia,Oh, Meia!  Good to...see you.  I guess you lost too, huh?  ...Meet any cute girls?
game_over_defeat,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7,priority:400=meiablank,~silent~
game_over_defeat,target:jin=annoyed,Yeah, we're a little too busy fending off your organ harvesters to bother with invading you.
game_over_defeat,target:jin=annoyed,Hey, remember who's the aggressor here, Earth-man.  Or have you all been told we're hogging up your uteri?
game_over_defeat,target:jin=bored,First he makes me masturbate for him without returning the favor, and then he calls me aggressive.  Men are impossible.
game_over_defeat,target:jin=annoyed,Yeah, yeah, laugh it up, organ-harvester.  I don't appreciate being called aggressive by the aggressors.

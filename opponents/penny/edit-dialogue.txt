#When selecting the characters to play the game, the first line will always play, then it randomly picks from any of the start lines after you commence the game but before you deal the first hand.


#Items of clothing should be listed here in order of removal.
#The values are formal name, lower case name, how much they cover, what they cover
#Please do not put spaces around the commas.
#"Important" clothes cover genitals (lower) or chest/breasts (upper). For example: bras, panties, a skirt when going commando.
#"Major" clothes cover underwear. For example: skirts, pants, shirts, dresses.
#"Minor" clothes cover skin or are large pieces of clothing that do not cover skin. For example: jackets, socks, stockings, gloves.
#"Extra" clothes are small items that may or may not be clothing but do not cover anything interesting. For example: jewelry, shoes or boots with socks underneath, belts, hats. In the rest of the code, "extra" clothes are called "accessory".
#If for some reason you write another word for the type of clothes (e.g. "accessory"), other characters will not react at all when the clothing is removed.
#What they cover = upper (upper body), lower (lower body), other (neither).
#The game can support any number of entries, but typically we use 2-8, with at least one "important" layer for upper and lower (each).

#Notes on dialogue
#All lines that start with a # symbol are comments and will be ignored by the tool that converts this file into a xml file for the game.
#Where more than one line has an identical type, like "swap_cards" and "swap_cards", the game will randomly select one of these lines each time the character is in that situation.
#You should try to include multiple lines for most stages, especially the final (finished) stage, -1. 

#A character goes through multiple stages as they undress. The stage number starts at zero and indicates how many layers they have removed. Special stage numbers are used when they are nude (-3), masturbating (-2), and finished (-1).
#Line types that start with a number will only display during that stage. The will override any numberless stage-generic lines. For example, in stage 4 "4-swap_cards" will be used over "swap_cards" if it is not blank here. Giving a character unique dialogue for each stage is an effective way of showing their changing openness/shyness as the game progresses.
#You can combine the above points and make multiple lines for a particular situation in a particular stage, like "4-swap_cards" and "4-swap_cards".

#Some special words can be used that will be substituted by the game for context-appropriate ones: ~name~ is the name of the character they're speaking to, but this only works if someone else is in focus. ~clothing~ is the type of clothing that is being removed by another player. ~Clothing~ is almost the same, but it starts with a capital letter in case you want to start a sentence with it.
#~name~ can be used any time a line targets an opponent (game_over_defeat, _must_strip, _removing_, _removed, _must_masturbate, etc).
#~clothing~ can be used only when clothing is being removed (_removing and _removed, but NOT _must_strip).
#~player~ can be used at any time and refers to the human player.
#~cards~ can be used only in the swap_cards lines.
#All wildcards can be used once per line only! If you use ~name~ twice, the code will show up the second time.

#Lines can be written that are only spoken when specific other characters are present. For a detailed explanation, read this guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/spnati/comments/6nhaj0/the_easy_way_to_write_targeted_lines/
#Here is an example line (note that targeted lines must have a stage number):
#0-female_must_strip,target:hermioine=happy,Looks like your magic doesn't help with poker!

#This is what a character says while they're exchanging cards and commenting on their hands afterwards.
#When swapping cards, the game will automatically put a display a number between 0-5 where you write ~cards~.
#These lines display on the screen for only a brief time, so it is important to make them short enough to read at a glance.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written
swap_cards=calm,May I have ~cards~ cards?
swap_cards=calm,I'll take ~cards~.

0-must_strip_winning=loss,I still have my shoes, thank god!
0-must_strip_winning,totalRounds:0=loss,Losing the first hand isn't exactly a good omen.
0-must_strip_normal=loss,I lost. Didn't I?
0-must_strip_normal=loss,I guess I have to keep my word and remove something, huh?
0-must_strip_normal=loss,Bad luck, I guess.
0-must_strip_normal=loss,I always tell Vincent and Jas that keeping your promises is very important. I lost and need to keep mine now.
0-must_strip_normal,totalRounds:0=loss,Losing the first hand isn't exactly a good omen.
0-must_strip_losing=loss,I guess you won't see anything private yet. That's a positive.
0-must_strip_losing=loss,I can't afford to lose any more hands if I want to leave with my clothes on.
0-must_strip_losing=loss,I hope this trend doesn't continue.
0-must_strip_losing=loss,I know what I need to do. I'm not happy about it, but I'm a woman who keeps her promises.
0-must_strip_losing,totalRounds:0=loss,Losing the first hand isn't exactly a good omen.
0-stripping=strip,One second please...
0-stripping=strip,Luckily, these aren't very difficult to take off.
0-stripping=strip,I'm guessing I could take one now and the other later, in case I lose again, huh?
0-stripping=strip,My shoes are very old, but they're very comfortable too.
0-stripping=strip,Un momento por favor... I'm sorry I was reading a book on Spanish grammar before.


#losing socks
1-stripped=stripped,Off they go. Makes your feet feel more free, doesn't it?
1-stripped=stripped,I usually take my shoes off and let my feet touch Pelican Town's green grass. It makes me feel alive!
1-stripped=stripped,These shoes may not look like much to you, but they're very comfortable.
1-stripped=stripped,Well... Shall we continue?
1-stripped=stripped,.....Aaaaad shoes off! I'm ready!
1-must_strip_winning=loss,I guess you've earned this, huh? I won't show a lot of skin, though,
1-must_strip_winning=loss,It was meant to happen.
1-must_strip_winning=loss,Oh no!
1-must_strip_winning=loss,I'll try to win next hand.
1-must_strip_winning=loss,I hope this is the last time I loss a hand. I won't have anything small to spare.
1-must_strip_normal=loss,Well... My socks are next.
1-must_strip_normal=loss,At least we are all having fun, aren't we?
1-must_strip_normal=loss,At this rate we'll all end up without clothes.
1-must_strip_normal=loss,Oh my, me again?
1-must_strip_normal=loss,I didn't want to lose but it happened. Time to pay the price, huh?
1-must_strip_losing=loss,Why I feel I'm already running out of options... This doesn't look good.
1-must_strip_losing=loss,I guess it's better I lost my hands early in the game, huh?
1-must_strip_losing=loss,I'm not sure I can afford to lose any more hands.
1-must_strip_losing=loss,Well... Everyone is expecing me to... s- strip. I'll honor my word.
1-must_strip_losing=loss,I... I lost... I know what I must do next, even if I don't like it.
1-stripping=strip,Here I go...
1-stripping,marker:emily=strip,Emily told me I should talk to my socks more often...
1-stripping=strip,Do you like the color of my socks? It's nice, isn't it?
1-stripping=strip,I usually read barefoot under the shadow of a big tree near the saloon, so I'm sure, ~player~ has already seen me barefoot.
1-stripping,marker:barefoot=strip,I don't mind removing taking my socks off...


#losing shirt
2-stripped=stripped,This isn't Pelican Town's grass, but the floor is comfy..
2-stripped=stripped,I should've brought a necklace.
2-stripped=stripped,I certainly hope I don't lose again. I can't afford it.
2-stripped=stripped,I need to be more careful now.
2-stripped,saidMarker:barefoot=stripped,I love the feeling of the grass touching my feet.
2-stripped,saidMarker:emily=stripped,...Emily has a special mind.
2-stripped,saidMarker:emily=stripped,...I tried to do it once, but I felt silly. Don't tell her, though.
2-stripped,saidMarker:emily=stripped,... It's called "Clothes therapy" if I remember correctly.
2-must_strip_winning=loss,I really like this shirt, I have like 10 of them at home!
2-must_strip_winning=loss,I'm aware some may not like it, but I think yellow is a beautiful color.
2-must_strip_winning=loss,I truly thought I could win without exposing much. Silly me,huh?
2-must_strip_winning=loss,This isn't gonna be easy...
2-must_strip_normal=loss,Ugh... I guess I'm going shirtless.
2-must_strip_normal=loss,A shirtless Penny coming right up...
2-must_strip_normal=loss,I'll do it. Not because I'm comfortable doing it, but because I made a commitment with you all.
2-must_strip_normal=loss,Mmm... I hope you like my bra, at least.
2-must_strip_losing=loss,Already?! I wasn't prepared for this.
2-must_strip_losing=loss,This isn't going as expected.
2-must_strip_losing=loss,This doesn't bode very well...
2-must_strip_losing=loss,I hope nobody at Pelican Town see me now.
2-stripping=strip,Sorry... the unbuttoning always takes so long...
2-stripping=strip,One moment, please. Unbottoning this thing takes time.
2-stripping=strip,Here I go... I guess.
2-stripping=strip,Pl- please don't stare at me too much.
2-stripping=strip,I only have myself to blame.
2-stripping=strip,I do have a bra under... Sorry to disappoint.


#losing skirt
3-stripped=stripped,This bra wasn't meant to be seen, it's just so... comfy.
3-stripped=stripped,I like the color. Do you?
3-stripped=stripped,Eer... <i>Tada?!</i>
3-stripped=stripped,Please don't stare.
3-stripped=stripped,My bathing suit is the same color.
3-must_strip_winning=loss,At least I still have some clothes on.
3-must_strip_winning=loss,The good thing is: It still looks like I can win this.
3-must_strip_winning=loss,I- I think I can do this.
3-must_strip_winning=loss,This isn't that bad... If I look at you.
3-must_strip_normal=loss,That means I am down to my... not good, not good...
3-must_strip_normal=loss,I certainly hope this is the last time I loss.
3-must_strip_normal=loss,I'm a woman who keeps her promises. So, I'll do it.
3-must_strip_normal=loss,If you could just... close your eyes for a few seconds.
3-must_strip_losing=loss,Losing my favorite skirt... already...
3-must_strip_losing=loss,<i>This doesn't bode well... at all.</i>
3-must_strip_losing=loss,I <i>have to</i> win more (I hope my womanly attributes will distract them)
3-must_strip_losing=loss,I hope you aren't expecting me to remove my bra.
3-stripping=strip,This is so embarrassing...
3-stripping=strip,It will be just like wearing a swim suit to swim in the lake, right?
3-stripping=strip,I'm wearing panties under my skirt. In case you were wondering.
3-stripping=strip,Well... I'm sure you've seen women in underwear before.
3-stripping=strip,I guess there's no way to escape this, huh?


#losing bra
4-stripped=stripped,Please stop looking so closely.
4-stripped=stripped,<i>Matching underwear.</i>
4-stripped=stripped,Er... <i>Do you like what you see?</i>
4-stripped=stripped,I- I can't keep losing.
4-stripped=stripped,(<i>Okay, Penny... imagine you're in your bathing suit </i> I'm ready.
4-must_strip_winning=loss,Just because you're exposed it doesn't mean it's more comfortable for me.
4-must_strip_winning=loss,I guess I shouldn't keep you waiting, huh?
4-must_strip_winning=loss,I'm not ashamed of my body... but this is still <i>embarrassing</i>!
4-must_strip_winning=loss,I can still win this if I focus.
4-must_strip_winning,totalNaked:2-5=loss,You guys seem so happy being nude, it's probably not that bad... right?
4-must_strip_normal=loss,<i>But then you see my... </i>
4-must_strip_normal=loss,<i>This game doesn't look good at all </i>
4-must_strip_normal=loss,I-I'll do it, but please don't tell anyone at Pelican Town. <i>Especially Sam! Don't tell him</i>!
4-must_strip_normal=loss,This is gonna be awkward. Right, ~player~?
4-must_strip_losing=loss,Can't we end this here? This is <i>not</i> going good.
4-must_strip_losing=loss,I always tell the kids not be mad when losing but in <i>this situation</i>. I'm starting to understand their reaction.
4-must_strip_losing=loss,This has gone out of hands quickly... <i>I hope you're happy.</i>
4-must_strip_losing=loss,I can't back down now... <i>Can I?</i>
4-stripping=strip,<i>Don't look</i>
4-stripping=strip,Don't take pictures, please.
4-stripping=strip,<i>I'm really doing it, aren't I?</i>
4-stripping=strip,(<i>Just close your eyes, Penny</i>)


#losing panties
5-stripped=stripped,<i>Happy now?</i>
5-stripped=stripped,Stop staring at me! It makes me feel... funn- ... <i>uncomfortable!</i>
5-stripped=stripped,Playing cards got a lot more difficult now.
5-stripped=stripped,I suppose I can still cover myself.
5-stripped=stripped,<i>I'm cold</i>
5-must_strip_winning=loss,<i>This doesn't feel like I'm winning at all</i>.
5-must_strip_winning=loss,<i>I guess we 're back in even terms</i>.
5-must_strip_winning=loss,I knew this was a possibility, but...
5-must_strip_winning=loss,I can't believe what I have to do now...
5-must_strip_normal=loss,I am in no shape or form prepared for <i>This</i>.
5-must_strip_normal=loss,Please promise you won't tell anyone!
5-must_strip_normal=loss,If I must...
5-must_strip_normal=loss,I'll keep my end of the bargain. Please don't judge.
5-must_strip_losing=loss,Good thing mother is probably at the saloon right now.
5-must_strip_losing=loss,I can't believe my luck tonight.
5-must_strip_losing=loss,I never thought I'd <i>expose</i> myself in front of strangers. At least ~player~ is here... Wait! That's worse!
5-must_strip_losing=loss,I'm gonna need a few miracles to get out of here with some of my dignitty.
5-stripping=strip,Please look away...
5-stripping=strip,This is so embarrassing.
5-stripping=strip,If you could just... look away for a second.
5-stripping=strip,Big breaths... <i>sigh.</i>

#OPPONENT REMOVING ACCESSORY
#These lines are spoken when an opponent removes a small item that does not cover any skin.
#Typically, characters are fine with this when they are fully dressed but less satisfied as they become more naked.
#Note that all "removing" lines are NOT spoken to human players. Characters will skip straight from "6-male_human_must_strip" to "6-male_removed_accessory", for example.

#OPPONENT MASTURBATING
#When an opponent is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must pay the penalty by masturbating in front of everyone.
#The "must_masturbate" line is for just before it happens, and the "start_masturbating" line immediately follows.
#The "masturbating" line will be spoken a little after the opponent has started but before they climax.
#When the opponent climaxes, your character will say the "finished_masturbating" line.

#SELF MASTURBATING
#If your character is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must masturbate.
#These lines only come up in the relevant stages, so you don't need to include the stage numbers here. Just remember which stage is which when you make the images. The "starting" image is still in the naked stage.
#The "finished_masturbating" line will repeat many times if the game is not yet finished. This plays as opponents comment on the how good their hands are.

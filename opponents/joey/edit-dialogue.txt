#Items of clothing should be listed here in order of removal.
#The values are formal name, lower case name, how much they cover, what they cover
#Please do not put spaces around the commas.
#"Important" clothes cover genitals (lower) or chest/breasts (upper). For example: bras, panties, a skirt when going commando.
#"Major" clothes cover underwear. For example: skirts, pants, shirts, dresses.
#"Minor" clothes cover skin or are large pieces of clothing that do not cover skin. For example: jackets, socks, stockings, gloves.
#"Extra" clothes are small items that may or may not be clothing but do not cover anything interesting. For example: jewelry, shoes or boots with socks underneath, belts, hats. In the rest of the code, "extra" clothes are called "accessory".
#If for some reason you write another word for the type of clothes (e.g. "accessory"), other characters will not react at all when the clothing is removed.
#What they cover = upper (upper body), lower (lower body), other (neither).
#The game can support any number of entries, but typically we use 2-8, with at least one "important" layer for upper and lower (each).

#Notes on dialogue
#All lines that start with a # symbol are comments and will be ignored by the tool that converts this file into a xml file for the game.
#Where more than one line has an identical type, like "swap_cards" and "swap_cards", the game will randomly select one of these lines each time the character is in that situation.
#You should try to include multiple lines for most stages, especially the final (finished) stage, -1. 

#A character goes through multiple stages as they undress. The stage number starts at zero and indicates how many layers they have removed. Special stage numbers are used when they are nude (-3), masturbating (-2), and finished (-1).
#Line types that start with a number will only display during that stage. The will override any numberless stage-generic lines. For example, in stage 4 "4-swap_cards" will be used over "swap_cards" if it is not blank here. Giving a character unique dialogue for each stage is an effective way of showing their changing openness/shyness as the game progresses.
#You can combine the above points and make multiple lines for a particular situation in a particular stage, like "4-swap_cards" and "4-swap_cards".

#Some special words can be used that will be substituted by the game for context-appropriate ones: ~name~ is the name of the character they're speaking to, but this only works if someone else is in focus. ~clothing~ is the type of clothing that is being removed by another player. ~Clothing~ is almost the same, but it starts with a capital letter in case you want to start a sentence with it.
#~name~ can be used any time a line targets an opponent (game_over_defeat, _must_strip, _removing_, _removed, _must_masturbate, etc).
#~clothing~ can be used only when clothing is being removed (_removing and _removed, but NOT _must_strip).
#~player~ can be used at any time and refers to the human player.
#~cards~ can be used only in the swap_cards lines.
#All wildcards can be used once per line only! If you use ~name~ twice, the code will show up the second time.

#Lines can be written that are only spoken when specific other characters are present. For a detailed explanation, read this guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/spnati/comments/6nhaj0/the_easy_way_to_write_targeted_lines/
#Here is an example line (note that targeted lines must have a stage number):
#0-female_must_strip,target:hermione=happy,Looks like your magic doesn't help with poker!

#This is what a character says while they're exchanging cards and commenting on their hands afterwards.
#When swapping cards, the game will automatically put a display a number between 0-5 where you write ~cards~.
#These lines display on the screen for only a brief time, so it is important to make them short enough to read at a glance.

#OPPONENT MUST STRIP
#These lines are spoken when an opponent must strip, but the character does not yet know what they will take off.
#Writing different variations is important here, as these lines will be spoken about thirty times per game.
#The "human" versions of the lines will only be spoken if the human player is stripping.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

#OPPONENT REMOVING ACCESSORY
#These lines are spoken when an opponent removes a small item that does not cover any skin.
#Typically, characters are fine with this when they are fully dressed but less satisfied as they become more naked.
#Note that all "removing" lines are NOT spoken to human players. Characters will skip straight from "6-male_human_must_strip" to "6-male_removed_accessory", for example.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;1:=shrug.png,I dunno why, your costume just makes me think of balls.
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie:=happy.png,I'll just think of this as building suspense for your <i>next</i> pick!

1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2a:=excited.png,Ooh! I love pirates! That outfit's the best!
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1b:=thinking.png,Ooh! That outfit reminds me of a movie I saw! What was it called again...? "Tram?"
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1a:=thinking.png,Say, that outfit looks familiar! I can't put my finger on it, though...
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4a:=calm.png,Something tells me that outfit is quite popular!
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4a:=calm.png,Something tells me that outfit is a lot of people's favorite!
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4a:=calm.png,Something tells me you'd be very popular if you wore that outfit more often!
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4a:=calm.png,Something tells me someone who wears that outfit often would get a lot of attention!... And not just 'cause of the polka dots.
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;yuelia&stage;1&sayingmarker;real_name:=excited.png,That was a really cool trick! Can you teach me how to do it? It'd make popping out of cakes <i>way</i> easier!
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3a:=happy.png,That's a nice shade of red! It's like that popular red gemstone! What was it called...? Oh right: garnet!
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3a:=happy.png,That's a nice shade of red! It's like that popular red flower! What was it called...? Oh right: poppy!
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;aella&stage;1:=shrug.png,The first time, sure, but at this point, I can hardly call it "new."
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;aella&stage;2:=shrug.png,Well, there is no saying about them! But if they did, it'd probably be about how hard it is to find boots!
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;3:=calm.png,We're all here to have fun! No need to worry!
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;4:=laugh.png,Whoa! A fake-out! Ya got me with that one!

1-female_removed_accessory,priority:381,count-role;target&character;monique&stage;1&saidmarker;Stripping0-2:=shrug.png,Some people love that!... Probably...
1-female_removed_accessory,priority:381,count-role;target&character;monique&stage;2&saidmarker;Stripping1-3:=thinking.png,That was, uh... something! I wonder where it went...

1-female_removed_accessory,count-not_decent&role;target:=wink.png,I'm more a fan of full nudity, so this works out in my favor, at least!
1-female_removed_accessory,count-shy&role;target:=happy.png,You can strip in whatever order you like. Take your time!
1-female_removed_accessory,count-shy&role;target:=happy.png,There's no rush! If you've got items, we've got no choice but to let you remove them.

-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;aella&stage;1:=shrug.png,The first time, sure, but at this point, I can hardly call it "new."
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;aella&stage;2:=shrug.png,Well, there is no saying about them! But if they did, it'd probably be about how hard it is to find boots!

#OPPONENT REMOVING MAJOR CLOTHING
#Major clothing reveals a significant amount of skin and likely underwear.
#However, as we don't know if the opponent is taking off the top or the bottom, we can't presume that nice abs are showing; maybe she took of her skirt before her shirt.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written
male_removing_major=cheer.png,Alright, ~name~! Take it off!
male_removing_major=cheer.png,Woo! Finally! Off with your ~clothing~!
male_removing_major=cheer.png,Woohoo! ~name~ is catching up!
male_removed_major=happy.png,That's more like it!

0-male_removing_major=excited.png,It's <i>never</i> too early to take off your ~clothing~!
0-male_removing_major=shrug.png,Is this the result of bad luck, poor planning, or eagerness? Do tell, ~name~, 'cause I don't know!
0-male_removing_major=laugh.png,~name~ wastes no time getting comfortable!... Or having bad luck. Either way!
0-male_removing_major,count-role;target&character;mister_clean&stage;1:=calm.png,For instance, I could fart right now, and it might make you laugh. I could do that a few more times and you might still laugh, but how many times will it be funny? Only a few times, I imagine.
0-male_removing_major,count-role;target&character;el_shaggy_blanco:=happy.png,I mean, the first season was really great, and the show has a lot of potential, but I think it got too big for its britches.
0-male_removing_major,count-role;target&character;link&stage;3:=laugh.png,I should'a noticed sooner! The <i>real</i> Link has <i>pink</i> hair!
0-male_removing_major,count-shy&role;target:=cheer.png,You can do it, ~name~!
0-male_removing_major,count-shy&role;target:=cheer.png,You got this, ~name~! It's just clothing!

0-male_removed_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_m&stage;5:=happy.png,Hey, if that's how you like to ship your package, I won't judge.
0-male_removed_major,count-role;target&character;mister_clean&stage;2:=shrug.png,I dunno, maybe it's just me, but I think jokes you can keep coming back to are <i>far</i> better than the ones you stop laughing at after one or two times.
0-male_removed_major,count-role;target&character;el_shaggy_blanco:=shrug.png,The show spends too much time developing minor characters, and kinda butchers some of the messages it tries to get across.
0-male_removed_major,priority:0,count-athletic&role;target:,test:~clothing.position~:upper=gasp.png,Woah, you look pretty good! You play any sports?
0-male_removed_major,totalRounds:1-10=hot.png,It must be you, considering you took off your ~clothing~!

0-female_removing_major=shrug.png,Is this the result of bad luck, poor planning, or eagerness? Do tell, ~name~, 'cause I don't know!
0-female_removing_major=laugh.png,~name~ wastes no time getting comfortable!... Or having bad luck. Either way!
0-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;kizuna&stage;0:=shrug.png,... Or remove them in a completely normal fashion. That's cool too.
0-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;morrigan&stage;2:=duck.png,<i>Not the bats again!</i>
0-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;morrigan&stage;2:=duck.png,<i>No! Not the bats again!</i>

0-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;0:=duck.png,An amazing shot is <i>not</i> the kind of zinger I was hoping for!
0-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;aella&stage;3:=approve.png,C'mon, Aella, you can do it! It's not like you have nothing on under your leggings, right?
0-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska:=happy.png,Drumroll, please!
0-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska:=shrug.png,I'll be honest, I'm excited for a good <i>or</i> bad outcome!
0-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska:=excited.png,And the winner is...!
0-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska:=happy.png,This reminds me of a game I play where I spin a wheel to decide what to take off!
0-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska:=excited.png,What's it gonna be? The anticipation is killing me!
0-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska:=happy.png,You gotta share the secret of this trick after the match! I wanna learn to do it too!
0-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska:=excited.png,Cheating or not, this trick is fun!
0-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska:=excited.png,I love games of chance!
0-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;raven&stage;2:=calm.png,Finally, the moment Edna Mode has been waiting for!
0-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;erufuda&stage;2:,id:35=gasp.png,Golly!
0-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;spooky:=calm.png,How 'bout this one: what do ya call a ghost who's in her underwear?
0-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;1:=laugh.png,I guess you're dead set on showing us your underwear, huh?
0-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;rainbow_dash&stage;0:=calm.png,I mean that as a serious complement, of course! My single-color hair is hard enough to maintain, but <i>rainbow hair</i>? No way I'd be able to keep up with it!
0-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;rainbow_dash&stage;4:=happy.png,I'll help make sure nothing happens to your shirt! I know what it's like having a favorite shirt.
0-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;5:=laugh.png,Nah, just kidding! I love monkeys, no matter how many heads they have! I just thought you'd feel better if someone fell for your trick!
0-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;sayla&stage;3:=gasp.png,Oh my!
0-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;monique&stage;3&sayingmarker;Stripping3-2:=happy.png,Oh! Monique's been practicing my shirt-vanishing act, apparently! Let's see it, Monique!
0-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;monique&stage;6&sayingmarker;Stripping6-2:=calm.png,Oh, are you throwing the game? You sure you want to--
0-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;4:=happy.png,Okay! I'll keep my eyes closed!
0-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;april&stage;3:=shrug.png,Oof, looks like your bra trick didn't matter in the end.
0-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;buffy&stage;4:=excited.png,Ooh! You know magic too?
0-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;4:=happy.png,That's a pretty cute skirt, Saki! I have one just like it but in orange. I use it for a lot of my themed costumes, like my teacher outfit!

0-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;beatrix:=calm.png,Y'know, Beatrix, I think your genius is just misunderstood - like Willy Wonka's genius!
0-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;3:=approve.png,You can do this, Nagisa! I believe in you!
0-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;beatrix:,count-role;other&character;aella:=shrug.png,I mean, you could've decided it randomly, with some kinda internal dice roll or somethin'.
0-female_removing_major,priority:381,count-role;target&character;monique&stage;6&saidmarker;Stripping6-3:=shrug.png,Oh, this trick? Sorry, Monique, no one's gonna let you count that. Believe me, I asked.
0-female_removing_major,priority:381,count-role;target&character;monique&stage;6&saidmarker;Stripping6-3:=cross.png,Hey! That's a magic trick, not a mime trick! Stay in your lane!
0-female_removing_major,priority:381,count-role;target&character;monique&stage;6&saidmarker;Stripping6-3:,marker:MoniqueEndsThere=gasp.png,Woah! It was a scarf tied to another scarf! It ends there I bet, though.

0-female_removed_major=wink.png,Don't lie, you normally take off your ~clothing~ when you're at home, don'tcha?

0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;spooky:=shrug.png,"Spooky," apparently.

0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;marinette&stage;2:=laugh.png,Did you misread the rules? You're supposed to <i>lose</i> clothes when you've lost, not <i>put more on</i>!

1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;rainbow_dash&stage;0:=calm.png,I mean that as a serious complement, of course! My single-color hair is hard enough to maintain, but <i>rainbow hair</i>? No way I'd be able to keep up with it!

1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;4:=happy.png,That's a pretty cute skirt, Saki! I have one just like it but in orange. I use it for a lot of my themed costumes, like my teacher outfit!

3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;april&stage;4:=approve.png,Good call, counting that as two. Your jumpsuit is pretty much like a shirt and pants, anyway, might as well treat it like that!
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;rainbow_dash&stage;5:=shrug.png,I have this shirt that my brother gave me that has an elephant with a top hat on it. I dunno why, but I really love that shirt.

3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6b:=happy.png,I wore an outfit like that once - emphasis on <i>once</i>! I couldn't keep my hooters in it!

3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;kizuna&stage;3:=thinking.png,Wow! You actually had on panties!... Were they there the whole time, or did they only show up when you took off your shorts? I know clipping is quite a pain.

3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;beatrix:,count-role;other&character;aella:=approve.png,I, for one, admire your courage, Beatrix!

#lost pants
4-male_removing_major,count-role;target&character;mister_clean&stage;1:=calm.png,For instance, I could fart right now, and it might make you laugh. I could do that a few more times and you might still laugh, but how many times will it be funny? Only a few times, I imagine.
4-male_removing_major,count-role;target&character;el_shaggy_blanco:=happy.png,I mean, the first season was really great, and the show has a lot of potential, but I think it got too big for its britches.
4-male_removing_major,count-role;target&character;link&stage;3:=laugh.png,I should'a noticed sooner! The <i>real</i> Link has <i>pink</i> hair!
4-male_removing_major,count-shy&role;target:=cheer.png,You can do it, ~name~!
4-male_removing_major,count-shy&role;target:=cheer.png,You got this, ~name~! It's just clothing!

4-male_removed_major,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;7:=wink.png,Aw, I'm disappointed. I was looking forward to meeting the Thing.
4-male_removed_major,count-role;target&character;link&stage;4:=wink.png,Don't worry, I won't tell anyone!
4-male_removed_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_m&stage;5:=happy.png,Hey, if that's how you like to ship your package, I won't judge.
4-male_removed_major,count-role;target&character;mister_clean&stage;2:=shrug.png,I dunno, maybe it's just me, but I think jokes you can keep coming back to are <i>far</i> better than the ones you stop laughing at after one or two times.
4-male_removed_major,count-role;target&character;el_shaggy_blanco:=shrug.png,The show spends too much time developing minor characters, and kinda butchers some of the messages it tries to get across.
4-male_removed_major,priority:0,count-athletic&role;target:,test:~clothing.position~:upper=gasp.png,Woah, you look pretty good! You play any sports?
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;kizuna&stage;0:=shrug.png,... Or remove them in a completely normal fashion. That's cool too.

4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;aella&stage;3:=approve.png,C'mon, Aella, you can do it! It's not like you have nothing on under your leggings, right?
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska:=happy.png,Drumroll, please!
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska:=shrug.png,I'll be honest, I'm excited for a good <i>or</i> bad outcome!
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska:=excited.png,And the winner is...!
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska:=happy.png,This reminds me of a game I play where I spin a wheel to decide what to take off!
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska:=excited.png,What's it gonna be? The anticipation is killing me!
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska:=happy.png,You gotta share the secret of this trick after the match! I wanna learn to do it too!
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska:=excited.png,Cheating or not, this trick is fun!
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska:=excited.png,I love games of chance!

4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;1:=laugh.png,I guess you're dead set on showing us your underwear, huh?
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;rainbow_dash&stage;0:=calm.png,I mean that as a serious complement, of course! My single-color hair is hard enough to maintain, but <i>rainbow hair</i>? No way I'd be able to keep up with it!
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;rainbow_dash&stage;4:=happy.png,I'll help make sure nothing happens to your shirt! I know what it's like having a favorite shirt.
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;5:=laugh.png,Nah, just kidding! I love monkeys, no matter how many heads they have! I just thought you'd feel better if someone fell for your trick!
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;sayla&stage;3:=gasp.png,Oh my!
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;monique&stage;3&sayingmarker;Stripping3-2:=happy.png,Oh! Monique's been practicing my shirt-vanishing act, apparently! Let's see it, Monique!
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;monique&stage;6&sayingmarker;Stripping6-2:=calm.png,Oh, are you throwing the game? You sure you want to--
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;4:=happy.png,Okay! I'll keep my eyes closed!
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;april&stage;3:=shrug.png,Oof, looks like your bra trick didn't matter in the end.
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;buffy&stage;4:=excited.png,Ooh! You know magic too?
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;4:=happy.png,That's a pretty cute skirt, Saki! I have one just like it but in orange. I use it for a lot of my themed costumes, like my teacher outfit!

4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;0:=happy.png,Whoa, shirt first, huh? I like to be a tease, myself, but I'm glad you're not the same!
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;beatrix:=calm.png,Y'know, Beatrix, I think your genius is just misunderstood - like Willy Wonka's genius!

#masturbating
-2-male_removing_major=excited.png,Alright, ~name~! Way to help a gal out!
-2-male_removing_major,count-role;target&character;mister_clean&stage;1:=calm.png,For instance, I could fart right now, and it might make you laugh. I could do that a few more times and you might still laugh, but how many times will it be funny? Only a few times, I imagine.
-2-male_removing_major,count-role;target&character;el_shaggy_blanco:=happy.png,I mean, the first season was really great, and the show has a lot of potential, but I think it got too big for its britches.
-2-male_removing_major,count-role;target&character;link&stage;3:=laugh.png,I should'a noticed sooner! The <i>real</i> Link has <i>pink</i> hair!
-2-male_removed_major=happy.png,Now, if you could keep losing, that'd be great!
-2-male_removed_major=wink.png,Oh, you're done? I thought you were gonna keep stripping for me!

-2-male_removed_major,count-role;target&character;mister_clean&stage;2:=shrug.png,I dunno, maybe it's just me, but I think jokes you can keep coming back to are <i>far</i> better than the ones you stop laughing at after one or two times.
-2-male_removed_major,count-role;target&character;el_shaggy_blanco:=shrug.png,The show spends too much time developing minor characters, and kinda butchers some of the messages it tries to get across.
-2-male_removed_major,priority:0,count-athletic&role;target:,test:~clothing.position~:upper=gasp.png,Woah, you look pretty good! You play any sports?

-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska:=shrug.png,I'll be honest, I'm excited for a good <i>or</i> bad outcome!
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska:=excited.png,And the winner is...!
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska:=happy.png,This reminds me of a game I play where I spin a wheel to decide what to take off!
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska:=excited.png,What's it gonna be? The anticipation is killing me!
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska:=happy.png,You gotta share the secret of this trick after the match! I wanna learn to do it too!

-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;rainbow_dash&stage;0:=calm.png,I mean that as a serious complement, of course! My single-color hair is hard enough to maintain, but <i>rainbow hair</i>? No way I'd be able to keep up with it!
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;rainbow_dash&stage;4:=happy.png,I'll help make sure nothing happens to your shirt! I know what it's like having a favorite shirt.
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;5:=laugh.png,Nah, just kidding! I love monkeys, no matter how many heads they have! I just thought you'd feel better if someone fell for your trick!

-1-male_removing_major,count-role;target&character;el_shaggy_blanco:=happy.png,I mean, the first season was really great, and the show has a lot of potential, but I think it got too big for its britches.
-1-male_removing_major,count-role;target&character;link&stage;3:=laugh.png,I should'a noticed sooner! The <i>real</i> Link has <i>pink</i> hair!

-1-male_removed_major,count-role;target&character;mister_clean&stage;2:=shrug.png,I dunno, maybe it's just me, but I think jokes you can keep coming back to are <i>far</i> better than the ones you stop laughing at after one or two times.
-1-male_removed_major,count-role;target&character;el_shaggy_blanco:=shrug.png,The show spends too much time developing minor characters, and kinda butchers some of the messages it tries to get across.

-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska:=excited.png,And the winner is...!

-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;rainbow_dash&stage;0:=calm.png,I mean that as a serious complement, of course! My single-color hair is hard enough to maintain, but <i>rainbow hair</i>? No way I'd be able to keep up with it!
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;rainbow_dash&stage;4:=happy.png,I'll help make sure nothing happens to your shirt! I know what it's like having a favorite shirt.
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;5:=laugh.png,Nah, just kidding! I love monkeys, no matter how many heads they have! I just thought you'd feel better if someone fell for your trick!

-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;april&stage;3:=shrug.png,Oof, looks like your bra trick didn't matter in the end.
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;buffy&stage;4:=excited.png,Ooh! You know magic too?
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;4:=happy.png,That's a pretty cute skirt, Saki! I have one just like it but in orange. I use it for a lot of my themed costumes, like my teacher outfit!

-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;0:=happy.png,Whoa, shirt first, huh? I like to be a tease, myself, but I'm glad you're not the same!
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;beatrix:=calm.png,Y'know, Beatrix, I think your genius is just misunderstood - like Willy Wonka's genius!
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;3:=approve.png,You can do this, Nagisa! I believe in you!

-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;april&stage;4:=approve.png,Good call, counting that as two. Your jumpsuit is pretty much like a shirt and pants, anyway, might as well treat it like that!
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;rainbow_dash&stage;5:=shrug.png,I have this shirt that my brother gave me that has an elephant with a top hat on it. I dunno why, but I really love that shirt.

5-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska:=wink.png,Seems like you're runnin' out of luck, Vriska. Seems like some sorta... scripted event or something.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska:=wink.png,Golly, seems like the more you roll, the worse your luck gets! Seems almost... predetermined or something.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;kizuna:=thinking.png,So are you a hard light constuct or just a projection? If someone tried to touch you, would their hand go through you?

5-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;erufuda&sayingmarker;fries_boobs:=thinking.png,Hmm. I'm not sure if I want bigger boobs. I like my medium boobs, but I also like french fries...

5-female_crotch_is_visible=shrug.png,Y'know, people sometimes ask me if the "wet spaghetti" theory is true. I tell them "It's not a theory, that's how you're <i>supposed</i> to cook spaghetti!"
5-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;nagisa:=happy.png,... Done?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&saidmarker;pinka_start&notsaidmarker;pinka_end2:=happy.png,... Say, that gives me an idea for a new set. "The clumsy chef!"
5-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;aimee:=happy.png,And what a zinger it was!
5-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;1:=happy.png,As long as you're comfortable, it doesn't matter what order you strip in!
5-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska&saidmarker;8b:=shrug.png,At this rate, you may as well just drop the towel! It's not really covering anything anyway!
5-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska&saidmarker;8a:=gasp.png,Golly! That's barely an outfit!
5-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;raven:=shrug.png,No panties, huh? Yeah, like I said, I wouldnt've worn any, either.

5-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;saki&saying;shave:=shrug.png,That's okay. If it weren't for the whole blue hair thing, I wouldn't shave either!
5-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;saki:=happy.png,That's the spirit!
5-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;derpy_hooves&stage;1:=gasp.png,Uh, Muffins, you're top is--

5-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;ini:=happy.png,Y'know, if you're gonna dye your hair and then go stripping, it's generally a good idea to shave too.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;ini:=happy.png,Take it from me, Ini, shaving is a great idea when you've dyed your hair.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;ini:=happy.png,And <i>that</i>, my friends, is exactly why I shave.

-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska:=wink.png,Seems like you're runnin' out of luck, Vriska. Seems like some sorta... scripted event or something.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska:=wink.png,Golly, seems like the more you roll, the worse your luck gets! Seems almost... predetermined or something.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;kizuna:=thinking.png,So are you a hard light constuct or just a projection? If someone tried to touch you, would their hand go through you?

-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;erufuda&sayingmarker;fries_boobs:=thinking.png,Hmm. I'm not sure if I want bigger boobs. I like my medium boobs, but I also like french fries...

-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;ini:=happy.png,And <i>that</i>, my friends, is exactly why I shave.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;aella:=cheer.png,You did it! You're naked! I knew you could do it!

-2-female_chest_will_be_visible=shrug.png,Time to see if I'm into boobs!
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible=shrug.png,Maybe secretly, deep down, I'm <i>really</i> into boobs, and I've just been lying this whole time?

#OPPONENT MASTURBATING
#When an opponent is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must pay the penalty by masturbating in front of everyone.
#The "must_masturbate" line is for just before it happens, and the "start_masturbating" line immediately follows.
#The "masturbating" line will be spoken a little after the opponent has started but before they climax.
#When the opponent climaxes, your character will say the "finished_masturbating" line.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

#SELF MASTURBATING
#If your character is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must masturbate.
#These lines only come up in the relevant stages, so you don't need to include the stage numbers here. Just remember which stage is which when you make the images. The "starting" image is still in the naked stage.
#The "finished_masturbating" line will repeat many times if the game is not yet finished. This plays as opponents comment on the how good their hands are.

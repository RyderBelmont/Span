        <text>Isn't it weird how almost all of the other April Fools characters had collectables, and Nanoko-chan didn't? Probably because I had to shit her out the day before the event started and the thought didn't even cross me. But, I guess you can have something as a reward. Thanks for all the support you've given my projects, both serious and non-serious. I don't know who I'll be working on when you're reading this, but I hope you enjoy them when they come out.
Also, I'm not sorry.

        <title>A Sexy Picture Of A Guitar</title>
        <subtitle>Oh, and Ibuki's there too.</subtitle>
        <text>A picture of Ibuki with her guitar, a Dean Flying V. She saved up for quite a while to buy it. There were cheaper guitars available, but she really wanted a Flying V and Dean was the only maker she could find that builds them for left-handed guitarists.</text>

        <text>Ibuki and her bandmates, Charlotte (top left), Kara (top right), and Emily (bottom right), posing for a publicity photo.

She taught her the differences between differently-handed guitars, and later introduced her to Kara and Emily. Charlotte and Kara shared a music theory class in college, and they met Emily when she signed up for bass lessons from Charlotte.</text>

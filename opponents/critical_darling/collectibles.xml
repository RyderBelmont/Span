        <subtitle>Oh, and Ibuki's there too.</subtitle>
        <text>A picture of Ibuki with her guitar, a Dean Flying V. She saved up for quite a while to buy it. There were cheaper guitars available, but she really wanted a Flying V and Dean was the only maker she could find that builds them for left-handed guitarists.</text>

                <state img="#-laugh.png">Good thing y'all got &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt; and not Elevator Girl! She's all stoic and stuff. &lt;i&gt;Totally&lt;/i&gt; not fun to hang around. Plus, she doesn't even have elevator powers. Lame!</state>
                <state img="#-laugh.png">Good thing y'all got &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt; and not, like, Dr. Worm or something! He's not a real doctor but he &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a real worm -- like, an &lt;i&gt;actual&lt;/i&gt; worm! I've seen him in person! He's crazy!</state>
                <state img="#-disappointed.png">Good thing y'all got &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt; and not, like... John Flansburgh!... Nah, that's not true. Even &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; wish I were John Flansburgh instead...</state>
                <state img="#-laugh.png">I got a real good feelin' about this match! Even if there's no prize, I got a feelin' that we won't be crashin' in my uncle's RV tonight!</state>
                <state img="#-disgust.png">It's me, Critical Darling. &lt;i&gt;Yes, the one that got beat by La Dragonesa...&lt;/i&gt; But hey, I beat a buncha dudes &lt;i&gt;before&lt;/i&gt; losin' to her!</state>
                <state img="#-wink.png">Me: Ibuki Akiyama. My band: Melting Dreamscape. You: Probably gonna see me naked, but probably also gonna see my band play after this.</state>
                <state img="#-laugh.png">On a scale from Gilgamesh to Hammurabi, I'm feelin' pretty Hammurabi right now! Let's get this show on the road!</state>
                <state img="#-confused.png">Hey, real quick, in case you're wonderin', these things hangin' off my skirt here? They're suspenders. A lotta people don't get that for some reason.</state>
                <state img="#-wink.png">Y'all are gonna get to see just how good with my fingers I am! Cuz I suck at poker... But I do got guitar skills!</state>
                <state img="#-disappointed.png">Any chance the winner of this will get a golden fiddle?... No?... Well, at least I'm not bettin' my soul either...</state>
                <state img="#-excited.png">I'll take your bet, and you're gonna regret, cuz I'm the best there's ever been!</state>
                <state img="#-skyward.png">♪On a cold winter morning, in the time before the light, in flames of death's eternal reign we ride towards the fight!♪</state>
                <state img="#-flustered.png">I'm probably not the Ibuki you're hopin' for, but I hope you enjoy playin' with me anyway!</state>

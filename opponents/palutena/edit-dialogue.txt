#When selecting the characters to play the game, the first line will always play, then it randomly picks from any of the start lines after you commence the game but before you deal the first hand.


#Items of clothing should be listed here in order of removal.
#The values are formal name, lower case name, how much they cover, what they cover
#Please do not put spaces around the commas.
#"Important" clothes cover genitals (lower) or chest/breasts (upper). For example: bras, panties, a skirt when going commando.
#"Major" clothes cover underwear. For example: skirts, pants, shirts, dresses.
#"Minor" clothes cover skin or are large pieces of clothing that do not cover skin. For example: jackets, socks, stockings, gloves.
#"Extra" clothes are small items that may or may not be clothing but do not cover anything interesting. For example: jewelry, shoes or boots with socks underneath, belts, hats. In the rest of the code, "extra" clothes are called "accessory".
#If for some reason you write another word for the type of clothes (e.g. "accessory"), other characters will not react at all when the clothing is removed.
#What they cover = upper (upper body), lower (lower body), other (neither).
#The game can support any number of entries, but typically we use 2-8, with at least one "important" layer for upper and lower (each).

#Notes on dialogue
#All lines that start with a # symbol are comments and will be ignored by the tool that converts this file into a xml file for the game.
#Where more than one line has an identical type, like "swap_cards" and "swap_cards", the game will randomly select one of these lines each time the character is in that situation.
#You should try to include multiple lines for most stages, especially the final (finished) stage, -1. 

#A character goes through multiple stages as they undress. The stage number starts at zero and indicates how many layers they have removed. Special stage numbers are used when they are nude (-3), masturbating (-2), and finished (-1).
#Line types that start with a number will only display during that stage. The will override any numberless stage-generic lines. For example, in stage 4 "4-swap_cards" will be used over "swap_cards" if it is not blank here. Giving a character unique dialogue for each stage is an effective way of showing their changing openness/shyness as the game progresses.
#You can combine the above points and make multiple lines for a particular situation in a particular stage, like "4-swap_cards" and "4-swap_cards".

#Some special words can be used that will be substituted by the game for context-appropriate ones: ~name~ is the name of the character they're speaking to, but this only works if someone else is in focus. ~clothing~ is the type of clothing that is being removed by another player. ~Clothing~ is almost the same, but it starts with a capital letter in case you want to start a sentence with it.
#~name~ can be used any time a line targets an opponent (game_over_defeat, _must_strip, _removing_, _removed, _must_masturbate, etc).
#~clothing~ can be used only when clothing is being removed (_removing and _removed, but NOT _must_strip).
#~player~ can be used at any time and refers to the human player.
#~cards~ can be used only in the swap_cards lines.
#All wildcards can be used once per line only! If you use ~name~ twice, the code will show up the second time.

#Lines can be written that are only spoken when specific other characters are present. For a detailed explanation, read this guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/spnati/comments/6nhaj0/the_easy_way_to_write_targeted_lines/
#Here is an example line (note that targeted lines must have a stage number):
#0-female_must_strip,target:hermioine=happy,Looks like your magic doesn't help with poker!

#This is what a character says while they're exchanging cards and commenting on their hands afterwards.
#When swapping cards, the game will automatically put a display a number between 0-5 where you write ~cards~.
#These lines display on the screen for only a brief time, so it is important to make them short enough to read at a glance.

#OPPONENT MUST STRIP
#These lines are spoken when an opponent must strip, but the character does not yet know what they will take off.
#Writing different variations is important here, as these lines will be spoken about thirty times per game.
#The "human" versions of the lines will only be spoken if the human player is stripping.

#OPPONENT REMOVING ACCESSORY
#These lines are spoken when an opponent removes a small item that does not cover any skin.
#Typically, characters are fine with this when they are fully dressed but less satisfied as they become more naked.
#Note that all "removing" lines are NOT spoken to human players. Characters will skip straight from "6-male_human_must_strip" to "6-male_removed_accessory", for example.

0-male_removing_accessory=surprised,C'mon, really?
0-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:saki=thinking,I've seen a good few robots in my day, but never an android.
0-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rinkah=surprised,Oh? Does it come with a low-health sound too?
0-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=glad,I doubt that'd take much. Space pirates probably have messed up vision.
0-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:2,totalRounds:0-3,count-aggressive:1=annoyed,At this rate, I'll be sub-zero.
0-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:rinkah=thinking,I still fail to see how a blindfold could be useful. But I'm not from the future or wherever you're from.
0-male_removing_accessory,target:human,targetStage:0=annoyed,You'd think ~player~ would try harder to make a good first impression, but I guess not.
0-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:futaba=thinking,I wonder if I have a persona. Or maybe as a goddess, I <i>am</i> the persona?
0-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0=glad,You normally love my advice, Pit. What happened? Too embarrassing?
0-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=teasing,Aw, poor little Pit. Want me to come help with that belt?
0-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=glad,Don't worry. I'm sure this is plenty thrilling for some of us. Or at least ~player~.
0-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=teasing,Good! Now you can lose all the more efficiently.
0-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3,totalRounds:0-3,count-aggressive:1=worried,Yeesh, four rounds in a row? Who's puppy did <i>you</i> kick?
0-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:futaba=calm,I can see why you'd think that 9S. I don't blame you for wanting to stay in another round.
0-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,An "anti-grav aug" <i>I</i> have to control, thank you very much.
0-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:2=calm,Should've just taken 'em off with the shoes. As a courtesy, you know?
0-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3=tranquil,Ah, yes. An honorable base, keeping that plaid wall of yours from collapsing.
0-male_removed_accessory=annoyed,I'm sure you didn't come here to watch <i>us</i> take off trinkets!
0-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1=tranquil,Surprisingly confident. Don't worry, that confidence will all go away in just a few more hands.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba=worried,A better name might do you good. I keep associating you with Mr. Game and Watch...
0-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,Oh Pit. Making rivals in a place like this?
0-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:rinkah=teasing,Moisture tracking? I didn't know your maker was so naughty, 9s.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:futaba=horny,Really? I could see you two getting <i>much</i> more intimate after tonight...
0-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,Are you <i>complaining</i>, Pit?
0-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:rinkah=glad,Looks like you got caught in the act, Rinkah.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=surprised,Oh, so it's like looking through a TV?
0-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba,count-pit:1=glad,The designation works well. I prefer it, too.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=teasing,Uh-huh. Maybe stick to your actual guns.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2=glad,You know it!
0-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:4=horny,Hopefully, the collapse comes <i>soon</i>.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=teasing,A tactical visor disguised as a blindfold. Clever.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3=glad,You'd sound more convincing if it wasn't for the fact this is a standing game.
0-female_removing_accessory=awkward,Well, that's disappointing.
0-female_removing_accessory=awkward,Oh... how mundane.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=calm,Now you're getting the hang of it!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=awkward,Complaining about stripping smaller things. I wonder how you ended up like this?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=awkward,You mean to tell me even the <i>staff</i> doesn't want you undressing so much?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2=calm,I'm of firm belief that holsters are unneccesary. You want to use a weapon, wield it at all times.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette=thinking,(Not focused enough to escape a loss, though.)
0-female_removing_accessory,target:winter,targetStage:1=glad,Ah, right. You're fond of gloves, aren't you?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:0=glad,Has Monkey Island fallen on hard times?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rainbow_mika,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=teasing,You, Kyu? You're scrawny! Pit or even Viridi could outwrestle you.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rainbow_mika,alsoPlayingStage:5=teasing,You, Kyu? You're scrawny! Pit or even Viridi could outwrestle you.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:0=calm,Brave of you. Not very smart, but brave.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=worried,Oh. And just when it looked like your arms healed up.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=surprised,Is that <i>fire</i>? Why...?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:lux,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:pit=calm,I don't play favorites here.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1=calm,Shoes in this game <i>are</i> as annoying as little bugs.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=worried,There are no video games on other planets, I'm afraid, Chiaki.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:1=tranquil,Ghost pirate zombies are always fun.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=annoyed,Seeing as that's a threat and at least one of us here is mortal, I'll let it count.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=worried,Wait, that was all around your head... if you have a brain, it probably took a hit or two there.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=calm,I take it you play around fire a lot? Very few burns. Impressive.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=glad,Better stand up quickly before she decks you.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=thinking,You might want to hurry it up, then. That'll just get in the way of a real fight.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=tranquil,Don't worry, spirits like you and I still appear on film. Everyone will see your nudity in due time.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=tranquil,I'm not sure either. Although I'm sure Pit would say a hot dog.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:0,targetTimeInStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=glad,It's not like she's lying to her self. She's just not in a hurry to admit it.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:pit=tranquil,Look Pit! Even <i>humans</i> learned to fly before you!
0-female_removing_accessory,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:pico_day=thinking,Odd. I've never heard of any "Pico Day."
0-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=glad,Maybe later, you two?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3=glad,Talk about your anachronisms...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2=tranquil,I like the way you think, Tojiko!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:1=worried,Bit presumptuous, aren't you?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:5=worried,I was afraid it'd come to this.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=thinking,Hmm. Must be tough finding socks when you're a cold-hearted killer.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:2=glad,Oh, a circlet! Are you sure you're not the real deal?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1=thinking,I didn't know the people of Hyrule used sandals.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:aella=thinking,Looking at this girl, I doubt she's ever "gotten lucky".
0-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:harley=thinking,Your both white clowns to me. At least, you're both wearing white make-up.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:0=tranquil,I see you like your jewelery as well.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=tranquil,Ah, so that's a belt? Very cool. Very, very cool.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=calm,Well! Let's see where this takes us.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:chiaki=thinking,Do you know what a video game is, Jenetta?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:1-10=surprised,Calling her out seems a bit silly, don't you think?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:1=thinking,Has <i>anything</i> on a heroes belt been helpful to anyone? Ever?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:won=worried,I knew it wouldn't be this easy.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elaine,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=glad,Not a very convincing facade.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zizou,count-elizabeth:1=awkward,Are you sure about that?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:sarcasm=worried,I was afraid it'd come to this.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:firstNude=worried,I was afraid it'd come to this.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:SpookyWinning1=loss,You're winning, but you still use the knife as a buffer?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0,totalRounds:0=glad,Maybe Go Fish is more your speed?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:marceline,alsoPlayingStage:9=thinking,A knife really has no place here. Unless you intended to stab the cards or something.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:1,totalRounds:10-99,totalAlive:5=glad,I suppose we can let it slip. Only fair, seeing how you're not wearing pants for whatever reason.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:pit=calm,Just sit back and watch, Pit. It'll do you good.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:zizou=teasing,Take it from a goddess: you don't need powers to see that.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jasmine=calm,How modest. I like that.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=teasing,I'd love to see how you two could make a pair of boots awkward.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:mia,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=worried,Ghosts have all kinds of tricks up their incorporeal sleeves, huh?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:pit=surprised,Are you sure? Magnus can be a real jerk about it.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=glad,What an awkward place to meet up at.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:9s=glad,Rinkah looks about as much as a Yorha as I do.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:sei=glad,You really need it. Especially against Sei here.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zizou=teasing,All the hormones must have gone to her head.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:xander,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=thinking,It came off as passive-aggressive, Spooky.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette=glad,This is fine.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:chica=calm,Sure, sure. I imagine a ghost would have all the time in the world.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:aimee=thinking,(I wonder who'd win in a knife fight between these two.)
0-female_removing_accessory,target:winter,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:weiss=horny,Hiding secrets, are we, Winter? Awfully distant of you.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:shaggy,alsoPlayingStage:0=surprised,That doesn't sound like an expression you should know. Who taught it to you?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2=thinking,Speaking of, why is it I'm sensing two souls inhabiting your body?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:orendi,targetStage:0=surprised,What an interesting individual you are! Like the child of man and monster!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0=thinking,(<i>I wish all souls could wield weapons. Maybe then the Underworld threat wouldn't have gotten so big...</i>)
0-female_removing_accessory,target:winter,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:buffy,alsoPlayingStage:4-5=calm,Married to the job, I think is the right term? How boring.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:saki=thinking,(Was it really? Saki looks like she has something on her mind.)
0-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1=worried,What I want to know is what school gives out shoes that gaudy.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0=glad,And as cute as a ribbon, too. <i>That</i> ribbon, specifically.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=thinking,Chelsea, Chelsea... doesn't ring a bell. Must be famous in just your world.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:0=worried,Doesn't it get sweat and whatnot trapped underneath it?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:3=thinking,I imagine retying that must be a pain, day after day.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0=thinking,You know, this is still a public area. You don't have to take off both.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=glad,That's fine. I figured no shoes would sort of be your default state, anyway.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:uravity=glad,I don't think so. Trust me, I know the guy. Or hand, rather.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:8=calm,A ribbon would just accentuate her nudity. She's better off without.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1=thinking,But do they still squeak?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0=tranquil,Quite the renaissance girl, aren't you?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:0=teasing,You don't need padded gloves. Especially considering there may be an ace or two hidden up it.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=annoyed,Oh yes, the collar. Attached to your invisible shirt, I assume?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:9=awkward,The fact there are two of her says it all, really.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:amalia,targetStage:0=thinking,Just a little pouch? How... pedestrian.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:zizou=horny,Really now? I'm going to enjoy this.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1=calm,Seems it's about that time. Of course, I won't stop you if you decide to throw a curveball.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:0=calm,Human armor always amuses me. Us gods rarely need it.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=thinking,So as the Ultimate Gamer, I'm sure you've played my game, right?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:10=glad,Those hands are doing better than any flimsy old ribbon could.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=surprised,A human with the Power of Flight? Amazing!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=calm,You know, I knew someone else who used yo-yos as their weapon of choice. Although Ness always looked more like a bee than a ladybug...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:zoey,targetStage:4=annoyed,It's rude to have lead us on like that.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:misato=tranquil,Like mine! Who knew humans had that variety as well?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:2=surprised,Six toes? Is that normal?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=teasing,What frilly shoes! But then again, your whole outfit is... immodest.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rinkah=awkward,(Wish I knw there were so many half-rabbits during the revolt...)
0-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:sei=glad,I'm surprised you even had somewhere to store an ID.
0-female_removed_accessory=calm,Well, time keeps on ticking. Moving on.
0-female_removed_accessory=calm,A win's a win, I suppose.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:lux,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,I think you and Pit have a lot in common, Lux.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:aella=glad,Doesn't seem too hard. Who makes bulky shoes for tiny feet?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=worried,I have no words.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=teasing,A girl like you? Dancing burlesque? I'd <i>love</i>to see that.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:2=tranquil,<i>Finally</i> someone who gets it!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=tranquil,Those of us in Skyworld prefer the cold. Interesting contrast, I think.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:aella=glad,So it did. Probably for the best.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:harley=annoyed,Are you just making all this up?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:joey=tranquil,Interesting how you don't deny it, Kyu.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=annoyed,Why does <i>everyone</i> say that?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:videogametriviatime,alsoPlaying:meia=tranquil,Would you perhaps like my help, Chiaki? I know many, many video game facts.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jura,count-meia:1=calm,Seems we've got a bit of a split between beauties and muscle-girls. And ~player~, I guess.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zizou,count-elizabeth:1=worried,She didn't say anything. Are you a mind reader, perhaps?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=calm,I'd love to hear your thoughts on it. Come see me after the game.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingStage:4-5=glad,I don't see the correlation of why the Flame Tribe is any different.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:9=tranquil,The reasons don't matter that much. All that matters is that it's happened.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:rinkah=thinking,(I still have no evidence that goblins aren't just an elaborate hoax created by the humans.)
0-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:3=teasing,Trust me, Rinkah. I <i>never</i> let up once I've started.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:marinette=teasing,Another gaming enthusiast? Then I assume you know, say, the Smash tournaments?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:uravity=teasing,Who do you like to play as? I'll be sure to give them an extra-special pounding next time I face them.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:3=teasing,No, couldn't be. You're far too generous to be one.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:9s=tranquil,Not many secrets among the Flame Tribe, I see.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,Controlling angels is surprisingly easy. Not surprised you've done it, Spooky.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:alice=teasing,Don't have a lot? Good to know.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:rinkah=teasing,After the game, ladies. There's still stripping to do!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:2=calm,Or is this just a Labrynnan thing?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jin=tranquil,What you're saying is he has a shot. Congrats, Jin! That's probably the best you've ever gotten.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=annoyed,We'll see. Actually, can you even see the cards?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:chiaki=teasing,As the authority on many games represented at the Inventory, I know that Chiaki's right. Perhaps I can give you some proof at another time?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:zizou=tranquil,Just like a certain other petite goddess I know!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1=calm,Regardless, it's a sensible first choice.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zizou=teasing,<i>This</i> girl's your rival? Talk about a low standard, Zizou.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:mahiru=horny,Wouldn't exactly be "Ultimate" if they weren't.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=surprised,...You know, your personality is actually pretty fitting for someone who's part cat.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:aimee=annoyed,(People will just get inflicted with bullet wounds instead.)
0-female_removed_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:2=horny,That sounds fun, too.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:6=thinking,It's a mystery to me why you chose to lose your bra <i>before</i> your glasses...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:0=glad,There's a lot of ghosts in the multiverse, Hermione. You of all people should know that.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:1=calm,I'd say Winslow has a much better deal here than you and Guybrush.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:4=tranquil,I suppose so. Next hand will hopefully be more eventful.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:2=thinking,A bit too basic for my tastes, I'm afraid.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:1=calm,Must be a relief to remove it, yes?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1=calm,That's fine. One ribbon won't break the outfit, right?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=thinking,Well, this is a good alternative. And Z-moves are overrated, anyway.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2=glad,And you're all the better for it.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:2=horny,Well, clearly it wasn't helpful to you.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=calm,You talk a big game, but in my experience, that's all it is.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2=teasing,You know I'm a goddess, right? Trying to shoot me with one of those is the equivalent of trying to break through a tank with a plastic fork.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=annoyed,You know, a drink might do you good. Slow down your heart rate and whatnot.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1=tranquil,You have good taste, Jenetta. Don't listen to your sister.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:winter,targetStage:2=teasing,I think you're being too confident. Remember, no matter what rank you have, it means nothing to the divine.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:2=glad,You'll get holes in your stockings if you go around like that!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=awkward,Those are some seriously deep burns... are you sure you'll be okay?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=glad,Although, somehow it looks like your stockings made it out completely fine.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=annoyed,Apologizing? Don't. I'd rather this be a fair fight.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:1=tranquil,Of course. I'd rather deal with someone my own size, anyway.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=calm,I suppose this was just the first act in your little game. Moving on.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:2=teasing,If you were <i>really</i> nice, you'd do even more for us.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:winter,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=calm,This'll probably be easier if you let the girl think for herself, Winter. You can complain <i>after</i> she's lost completely.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zoey,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=teasing,It's fine, Zoey. Take your time, I'll just get them out the old-fashioned way.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:natsuki,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=teasing,She's just pretending to make it seem like she wasn't totally eyeing you.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=glad,You're staring at one right now.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=tranquil,So you <i>are</i> a fan? How surreal.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1=calm,Sorry, I can't really take anyone with beady black eyes seriously.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:sayori,alsoPlayingStage:0-7,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:filter-fancy=tranquil,As does the higher-ups.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:winter,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=teasing,Is that a hint of smugness I sense? Even for someone named Winter, that's cold.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:0-6,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:Cross=awkward,Let's avoid the personal jabs, okay ladies? We're here to unwind.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:2=teasing,Oh? What would you know about standing on clouds?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:amalia,targetStage:1=glad,Are you willing to prove that?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:1=calm,I'll let it slide. It's not like you have any authority here anyways.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=thinking,You know, I can feel everyone's arousal level from that reveal. Yours is the highest, Kyu. Care to explain?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:2=teasing,Projecting now, are we?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:4=thinking,Wait, I'm pretty sure that bag would've had to come off anyway for you to get totally naked...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1=worried,Unfortunate. Seems you're just another human for tonight.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1=tranquil,Right back into it, huh? Great!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=thinking,This is a bit different from sparring, but I see the point.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4=teasing,Not bad. You're made of surprisingly sturdy stuff!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:dont_judge_me_too_hardly=thinking,It's a goddess's job to remain impartial to things like this.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,totalRounds:0=annoyed,Calling in in early? Go ahead. We'll find someone more suitable to the table.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2=glad,Yeah, I'd say you were a bit too rough with your stripping.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:5=surprised,Our hair is so similar when you have it like that. Are you ripping off my style?
0-female_removed_accessory,filter:silent=annoyed,It's a lot harder to make conversation with a mute than I expected.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:something_off=calm,...What are you looking at me for? I didn't make the rules.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:firstNude2=angry,That's right. This is her true form. And someone <i>I</i> may have to fight... if it comes to it.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:dizzy=glad,Sure enough. You should sit down for a bit.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:dress_off_first=calm,Uh, Sola? Bit late to the punchline.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:install_skill=calm,No one at this table, clearly.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:luck_syega=annoyed,Doesn't sound like any magic I've ever known...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:here_i_go=teasing,I dunno, you sure you don't want to take off anything else? It's perfectly legal.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:hermione,targetStage:4=calm,You have some weird priorities, Hermione.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:1=thinking,(<i>Wow. She seems so normal compared to most of the others here.</i>)
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:hope_you_all_forgive_me=glad,Forgiven. <i>For now.</i>
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:spare_my_ribbon=teasing,You're not really sparing it. More like sacrificing it.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3=thinking,I wish my servants could be this assertive at times...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:6=angry,That's right. This is her true form. And someone <i>I</i> may have to fight... if it comes to it.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:I_guess_I_can_take_off=calm,Expecting? No. Hoping? You bet.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:navi=calm,You know, I like this form a lot more. I bet most others do too.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:I_had_to_lose_something=glad,It's amazing how one silly ribbon can make you look so formal.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:4=teasing,Says you. This is a card game, you know.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jura=calm,A woman who loves muscles? What, is she the type who'd love to be crushed by a woman's thighs?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:pick_something_small=teasing,A brilliant deduction, Sola.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:sarcasm2=angry,Don't just play this off! ~player~, this is her true form. And someone <i>I</i> may have to fight... if it comes to it.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:4=teasing,<i>Maybe you'd be in better shape if you didn't have such a foul mouth.</i>
0-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,You've got an active imagination, Pit. She's from the Fire Tribe, not a tribe made of fire.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:live_without_shoes=teasing,And that's how you lose your tights.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,Don't encourage him. Please.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:tada=awkward,You... may need glasses.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:kira=annoyed,Your comments are unneccessary, Kira.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:1=calm,You're awfully chipper for a vampire... and someone about to lose all her clothes.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:kyoko=glad,Whoever had gloves, really.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:lyn=teasing,Speaking of, when are you getting into Heroes, Rinkah? Hm?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:3=calm,No, please, do go on.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:mahiru=calm,Why are you apologizing? They're just gloves.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:need_shoes_back=angry,But seriously? <i>Bright red</i>? What were they thinking?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:what_to_take_off=glad,Who else's would you use? ~player~'s?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:2=tranquil,A helmet like that didn't really suit you anyway. You look <i>somewhat</i> normal with it off.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:Fast1=worried,I think you're missing the point. You want to <i>keep</i> your clothes. And, you know, <i>not</i> blow them up.


#lost armbands
1-male_removing_accessory=teasing,You know, your ~clothing~ won't really win you many points with the ladies.
1-male_removing_accessory=annoyed,Yeah, great choice there. <i>Really</i> titillating.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:rinkah=thinking,I still fail to see how a blindfold could be useful. But I'm not from the future or wherever you're from.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rinkah=surprised,Oh? Does it come with a low-health sound too?
1-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:saki=thinking,I've seen a good few robots in my day, but never an android.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:2,totalRounds:0-3,count-aggressive:1=annoyed,At this rate, I'll be sub-zero.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:human,targetStage:0=annoyed,You'd think ~player~ would try harder to make a good first impression, but I guess not.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:futaba=thinking,I wonder if I have a persona. Or maybe as a goddess, I <i>am</i> the persona?
1-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=glad,I doubt that'd take much. Space pirates probably have messed up vision.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:futaba=calm,I can see why you'd think that 9S. I don't blame you for wanting to stay in another round.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=teasing,Good! Now you can lose all the more efficiently.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,An "anti-grav aug" <i>I</i> have to control, thank you very much.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0=glad,You normally love my advice, Pit. What happened? Too embarrassing?
1-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3=tranquil,Ah, yes. An honorable base, keeping that plaid wall of yours from collapsing.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3,totalRounds:0-3,count-aggressive:1=worried,Yeesh, four rounds in a row? Who's puppy did <i>you</i> kick?
1-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=glad,Don't worry. I'm sure this is plenty thrilling for some of us. Or at least ~player~.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:2=calm,Should've just taken 'em off with the shoes. As a courtesy, you know?
1-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=teasing,Aw, poor little Pit. Want me to come help with that belt?
1-male_removed_accessory=tranquil,Now then, let's move on to <i>actual</i> gameplay.
1-male_removed_accessory=calm,I know we can't get right to the good stuff, but that doesn't mean I can't hope.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2=glad,You know it!
1-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba,count-pit:1=glad,The designation works well. I prefer it, too.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:rinkah=glad,Looks like you got caught in the act, Rinkah.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1=tranquil,Surprisingly confident. Don't worry, that confidence will all go away in just a few more hands.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba=worried,A better name might do you good. I keep associating you with Mr. Game and Watch...
1-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=teasing,Uh-huh. Maybe stick to your actual guns.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:4=horny,Hopefully, the collapse comes <i>soon</i>.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,Are you <i>complaining</i>, Pit?
1-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:rinkah=teasing,Moisture tracking? I didn't know your maker was so naughty, 9s.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:futaba=horny,Really? I could see you two getting <i>much</i> more intimate after tonight...
1-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=teasing,A tactical visor disguised as a blindfold. Clever.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3=glad,You'd sound more convincing if it wasn't for the fact this is a standing game.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,Oh Pit. Making rivals in a place like this?
1-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=surprised,Oh, so it's like looking through a TV?
1-female_removing_accessory=thinking,Why the ~clothing~? Not really anything, you know, worthwhile.
1-female_removing_accessory=glad,Guess this won't be a cakewalk, then.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1=calm,Shoes in this game <i>are</i> as annoying as little bugs.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=surprised,Is that <i>fire</i>? Why...?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0=thinking,(<i>I wish all souls could wield weapons. Maybe then the Underworld threat wouldn't have gotten so big...</i>)
1-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=worried,Oh. And just when it looked like your arms healed up.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=tranquil,I'm not sure either. Although I'm sure Pit would say a hot dog.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=worried,Wait, that was all around your head... if you have a brain, it probably took a hit or two there.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rainbow_mika,alsoPlayingStage:5=teasing,You, Kyu? You're scrawny! Pit or even Viridi could outwrestle you.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:winter,targetStage:1=glad,Ah, right. You're fond of gloves, aren't you?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=awkward,You mean to tell me even the <i>staff</i> doesn't want you undressing so much?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=awkward,Complaining about stripping smaller things. I wonder how you ended up like this?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:orendi,targetStage:0=surprised,What an interesting individual you are! Like the child of man and monster!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=calm,Now you're getting the hang of it!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rainbow_mika,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=teasing,You, Kyu? You're scrawny! Pit or even Viridi could outwrestle you.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:aella=thinking,Looking at this girl, I doubt she's ever "gotten lucky".
1-female_removing_accessory,target:winter,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:buffy,alsoPlayingStage:4-5=calm,Married to the job, I think is the right term? How boring.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3=glad,Talk about your anachronisms...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1=worried,What I want to know is what school gives out shoes that gaudy.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:0=calm,Brave of you. Not very smart, but brave.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:0=calm,Human armor always amuses me. Us gods rarely need it.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1=calm,Seems it's about that time. Of course, I won't stop you if you decide to throw a curveball.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:amalia,targetStage:0=thinking,Just a little pouch? How... pedestrian.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:9=awkward,The fact there are two of her says it all, really.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:10=glad,Those hands are doing better than any flimsy old ribbon could.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=teasing,What frilly shoes! But then again, your whole outfit is... immodest.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=surprised,A human with the Power of Flight? Amazing!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=annoyed,Oh yes, the collar. Attached to your invisible shirt, I assume?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0=tranquil,Quite the renaissance girl, aren't you?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:sei=glad,I'm surprised you even had somewhere to store an ID.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1=thinking,But do they still squeak?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:8=calm,A ribbon would just accentuate her nudity. She's better off without.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=glad,That's fine. I figured no shoes would sort of be your default state, anyway.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=calm,You know, I knew someone else who used yo-yos as their weapon of choice. Although Ness always looked more like a bee than a ladybug...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0=thinking,You know, this is still a public area. You don't have to take off both.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=tranquil,Don't worry, spirits like you and I still appear on film. Everyone will see your nudity in due time.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:3=thinking,I imagine retying that must be a pain, day after day.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:0=worried,Doesn't it get sweat and whatnot trapped underneath it?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=thinking,Chelsea, Chelsea... doesn't ring a bell. Must be famous in just your world.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:zoey,targetStage:4=annoyed,It's rude to have lead us on like that.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0=glad,And as cute as a ribbon, too. <i>That</i> ribbon, specifically.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:1=thinking,Has <i>anything</i> on a heroes belt been helpful to anyone? Ever?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:0=teasing,You don't need padded gloves. Especially considering there may be an ace or two hidden up it.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:1-10=surprised,Calling her out seems a bit silly, don't you think?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:2=surprised,Six toes? Is that normal?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=thinking,Hmm. Must be tough finding socks when you're a cold-hearted killer.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:pit=tranquil,Look Pit! Even <i>humans</i> learned to fly before you!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2=calm,I'm of firm belief that holsters are unneccesary. You want to use a weapon, wield it at all times.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=annoyed,Seeing as that's a threat and at least one of us here is mortal, I'll let it count.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=worried,There are no video games on other planets, I'm afraid, Chiaki.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:0=glad,Has Monkey Island fallen on hard times?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=glad,Better stand up quickly before she decks you.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:1=tranquil,Ghost pirate zombies are always fun.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:saki=thinking,(Was it really? Saki looks like she has something on her mind.)
1-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:marceline,alsoPlayingStage:9=thinking,A knife really has no place here. Unless you intended to stab the cards or something.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:1,totalRounds:10-99,totalAlive:5=glad,I suppose we can let it slip. Only fair, seeing how you're not wearing pants for whatever reason.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:pit=calm,Just sit back and watch, Pit. It'll do you good.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=thinking,So as the Ultimate Gamer, I'm sure you've played my game, right?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jasmine=calm,How modest. I like that.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:zizou=horny,Really now? I'm going to enjoy this.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=teasing,I'd love to see how you two could make a pair of boots awkward.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:misato=tranquil,Like mine! Who knew humans had that variety as well?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:mia,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=worried,Ghosts have all kinds of tricks up their incorporeal sleeves, huh?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:pit=surprised,Are you sure? Magnus can be a real jerk about it.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zizou,count-elizabeth:1=awkward,Are you sure about that?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=glad,What an awkward place to meet up at.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:9s=glad,Rinkah looks about as much as a Yorha as I do.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:sei=glad,You really need it. Especially against Sei here.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:zizou=teasing,Take it from a goddess: you don't need powers to see that.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:xander,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=thinking,It came off as passive-aggressive, Spooky.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zizou=teasing,All the hormones must have gone to her head.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette=glad,This is fine.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:chica=calm,Sure, sure. I imagine a ghost would have all the time in the world.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:chiaki=thinking,Do you know what a video game is, Jenetta?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:aimee=thinking,(I wonder who'd win in a knife fight between these two.)
1-female_removing_accessory,target:winter,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:weiss=horny,Hiding secrets, are we, Winter? Awfully distant of you.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rinkah=awkward,(Wish I knw there were so many half-rabbits during the revolt...)
1-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:shaggy,alsoPlayingStage:0=surprised,That doesn't sound like an expression you should know. Who taught it to you?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0,totalRounds:0=glad,Maybe Go Fish is more your speed?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:SpookyWinning1=loss,You're winning, but you still use the knife as a buffer?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:uravity=glad,I don't think so. Trust me, I know the guy. Or hand, rather.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:harley=thinking,Your both white clowns to me. At least, you're both wearing white make-up.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:1=worried,Bit presumptuous, aren't you?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2=tranquil,I like the way you think, Tojiko!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=glad,Maybe later, you two?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elaine,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=glad,Not a very convincing facade.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=tranquil,Ah, so that's a belt? Very cool. Very, very cool.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:won=worried,I knew it wouldn't be this easy.
1-female_removing_accessory,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:pico_day=thinking,Odd. I've never heard of any "Pico Day."
1-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette=thinking,(Not focused enough to escape a loss, though.)
1-female_removing_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:5=worried,I was afraid it'd come to this.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:sarcasm=worried,I was afraid it'd come to this.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:lux,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:pit=calm,I don't play favorites here.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1=thinking,I didn't know the people of Hyrule used sandals.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=calm,Well! Let's see where this takes us.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:0,targetTimeInStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=glad,It's not like she's lying to her self. She's just not in a hurry to admit it.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2=thinking,Speaking of, why is it I'm sensing two souls inhabiting your body?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=calm,I take it you play around fire a lot? Very few burns. Impressive.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:firstNude=worried,I was afraid it'd come to this.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:2=glad,Oh, a circlet! Are you sure you're not the real deal?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=thinking,You might want to hurry it up, then. That'll just get in the way of a real fight.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:0=tranquil,I see you like your jewelery as well.
1-female_removed_accessory=glad,Maybe you have stage fright? It's fine. I can wait.
1-female_removed_accessory=teasing,And so the war of attrition continues.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2=glad,Yeah, I'd say you were a bit too rough with your stripping.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:2=calm,Or is this just a Labrynnan thing?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4=teasing,Not bad. You're made of surprisingly sturdy stuff!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1=calm,Regardless, it's a sensible first choice.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1=calm,Sorry, I can't really take anyone with beady black eyes seriously.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=tranquil,Those of us in Skyworld prefer the cold. Interesting contrast, I think.
1-female_removed_accessory,filter:silent=annoyed,It's a lot harder to make conversation with a mute than I expected.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:4=thinking,Wait, I'm pretty sure that bag would've had to come off anyway for you to get totally naked...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3=thinking,I wish my servants could be this assertive at times...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:winter,targetStage:2=teasing,I think you're being too confident. Remember, no matter what rank you have, it means nothing to the divine.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:navi=calm,You know, I like this form a lot more. I bet most others do too.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=annoyed,Why does <i>everyone</i> say that?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=thinking,Well, this is a good alternative. And Z-moves are overrated, anyway.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:2=horny,That sounds fun, too.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=annoyed,Apologizing? Don't. I'd rather this be a fair fight.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:6=angry,That's right. This is her true form. And someone <i>I</i> may have to fight... if it comes to it.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:4=teasing,Says you. This is a card game, you know.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:1=calm,I'd say Winslow has a much better deal here than you and Guybrush.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:3=teasing,Trust me, Rinkah. I <i>never</i> let up once I've started.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:3=teasing,No, couldn't be. You're far too generous to be one.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:1=calm,You're awfully chipper for a vampire... and someone about to lose all her clothes.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=awkward,Those are some seriously deep burns... are you sure you'll be okay?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,totalRounds:0=annoyed,Calling in in early? Go ahead. We'll find someone more suitable to the table.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,You've got an active imagination, Pit. She's from the Fire Tribe, not a tribe made of fire.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,Don't encourage him. Please.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:mahiru=calm,Why are you apologizing? They're just gloves.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:lyn=teasing,Speaking of, when are you getting into Heroes, Rinkah? Hm?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:kyoko=glad,Whoever had gloves, really.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:2=tranquil,A helmet like that didn't really suit you anyway. You look <i>somewhat</i> normal with it off.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:kira=annoyed,Your comments are unneccessary, Kira.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jura=calm,A woman who loves muscles? What, is she the type who'd love to be crushed by a woman's thighs?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:1=thinking,(<i>Wow. She seems so normal compared to most of the others here.</i>)
1-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=thinking,This is a bit different from sparring, but I see the point.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,Controlling angels is surprisingly easy. Not surprised you've done it, Spooky.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:alice=teasing,Don't have a lot? Good to know.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:rinkah=teasing,After the game, ladies. There's still stripping to do!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jin=tranquil,What you're saying is he has a shot. Congrats, Jin! That's probably the best you've ever gotten.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=annoyed,We'll see. Actually, can you even see the cards?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:6=thinking,It's a mystery to me why you chose to lose your bra <i>before</i> your glasses...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:chiaki=teasing,As the authority on many games represented at the Inventory, I know that Chiaki's right. Perhaps I can give you some proof at another time?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:zizou=tranquil,Just like a certain other petite goddess I know!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zizou=teasing,<i>This</i> girl's your rival? Talk about a low standard, Zizou.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:9s=tranquil,Not many secrets among the Flame Tribe, I see.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:mahiru=horny,Wouldn't exactly be "Ultimate" if they weren't.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:dont_judge_me_too_hardly=thinking,It's a goddess's job to remain impartial to things like this.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:here_i_go=teasing,I dunno, you sure you don't want to take off anything else? It's perfectly legal.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:5=surprised,Our hair is so similar when you have it like that. Are you ripping off my style?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:4=teasing,<i>Maybe you'd be in better shape if you didn't have such a foul mouth.</i>
1-female_removed_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:sarcasm2=angry,Don't just play this off! ~player~, this is her true form. And someone <i>I</i> may have to fight... if it comes to it.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:firstNude2=angry,That's right. This is her true form. And someone <i>I</i> may have to fight... if it comes to it.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:3=calm,No, please, do go on.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:dizzy=glad,Sure enough. You should sit down for a bit.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:Fast1=worried,I think you're missing the point. You want to <i>keep</i> your clothes. And, you know, <i>not</i> blow them up.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:tada=awkward,You... may need glasses.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:need_shoes_back=angry,But seriously? <i>Bright red</i>? What were they thinking?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:dress_off_first=calm,Uh, Sola? Bit late to the punchline.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:luck_syega=annoyed,Doesn't sound like any magic I've ever known...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:install_skill=calm,No one at this table, clearly.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:what_to_take_off=glad,Who else's would you use? ~player~'s?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:spare_my_ribbon=teasing,You're not really sparing it. More like sacrificing it.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:something_off=calm,...What are you looking at me for? I didn't make the rules.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:pick_something_small=teasing,A brilliant deduction, Sola.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:hermione,targetStage:4=calm,You have some weird priorities, Hermione.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:I_had_to_lose_something=glad,It's amazing how one silly ribbon can make you look so formal.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:I_guess_I_can_take_off=calm,Expecting? No. Hoping? You bet.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:hope_you_all_forgive_me=glad,Forgiven. <i>For now.</i>
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:live_without_shoes=teasing,And that's how you lose your tights.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=glad,Although, somehow it looks like your stockings made it out completely fine.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:aimee=annoyed,(People will just get inflicted with bullet wounds instead.)
1-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:marinette=teasing,Another gaming enthusiast? Then I assume you know, say, the Smash tournaments?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=tranquil,So you <i>are</i> a fan? How surreal.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1=tranquil,Right back into it, huh? Great!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:2=teasing,Oh? What would you know about standing on clouds?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:amalia,targetStage:1=glad,Are you willing to prove that?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:2=teasing,Projecting now, are we?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1=worried,Unfortunate. Seems you're just another human for tonight.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:2=teasing,If you were <i>really</i> nice, you'd do even more for us.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=calm,I suppose this was just the first act in your little game. Moving on.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:1=tranquil,Of course. I'd rather deal with someone my own size, anyway.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:0-6,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:Cross=awkward,Let's avoid the personal jabs, okay ladies? We're here to unwind.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:4=tranquil,I suppose so. Next hand will hopefully be more eventful.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:1=calm,Must be a relief to remove it, yes?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1=calm,That's fine. One ribbon won't break the outfit, right?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2=glad,And you're all the better for it.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:2=horny,Well, clearly it wasn't helpful to you.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=calm,You talk a big game, but in my experience, that's all it is.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2=teasing,You know I'm a goddess, right? Trying to shoot me with one of those is the equivalent of trying to break through a tank with a plastic fork.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=annoyed,You know, a drink might do you good. Slow down your heart rate and whatnot.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1=tranquil,You have good taste, Jenetta. Don't listen to your sister.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:2=glad,You'll get holes in your stockings if you go around like that!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:2=thinking,A bit too basic for my tastes, I'm afraid.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:uravity=teasing,Who do you like to play as? I'll be sure to give them an extra-special pounding next time I face them.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:sayori,alsoPlayingStage:0-7,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:filter-fancy=tranquil,As does the higher-ups.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:natsuki,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=teasing,She's just pretending to make it seem like she wasn't totally eyeing you.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:harley=annoyed,Are you just making all this up?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=surprised,...You know, your personality is actually pretty fitting for someone who's part cat.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:aella=glad,Doesn't seem too hard. Who makes bulky shoes for tiny feet?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=worried,I have no words.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=teasing,A girl like you? Dancing burlesque? I'd <i>love</i>to see that.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:aella=glad,So it did. Probably for the best.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:joey=tranquil,Interesting how you don't deny it, Kyu.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:rinkah=thinking,(I still have no evidence that goblins aren't just an elaborate hoax created by the humans.)
1-female_removed_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:2=tranquil,<i>Finally</i> someone who gets it!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=glad,You're staring at one right now.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:lux,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,I think you and Pit have a lot in common, Lux.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jura,count-meia:1=calm,Seems we've got a bit of a split between beauties and muscle-girls. And ~player~, I guess.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zizou,count-elizabeth:1=worried,She didn't say anything. Are you a mind reader, perhaps?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingStage:4-5=glad,I don't see the correlation of why the Flame Tribe is any different.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:9=tranquil,The reasons don't matter that much. All that matters is that it's happened.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:0=glad,There's a lot of ghosts in the multiverse, Hermione. You of all people should know that.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:winter,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=teasing,Is that a hint of smugness I sense? Even for someone named Winter, that's cold.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=calm,I'd love to hear your thoughts on it. Come see me after the game.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:winter,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=calm,This'll probably be easier if you let the girl think for herself, Winter. You can complain <i>after</i> she's lost completely.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zoey,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=teasing,It's fine, Zoey. Take your time, I'll just get them out the old-fashioned way.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:videogametriviatime,alsoPlaying:meia=tranquil,Would you perhaps like my help, Chiaki? I know many, many video game facts.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=thinking,You know, I can feel everyone's arousal level from that reveal. Yours is the highest, Kyu. Care to explain?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:1=calm,I'll let it slide. It's not like you have any authority here anyways.


#lost sandals
2-male_removing_accessory=annoyed,Words cannot express how absolutely <i>boring</i> that choice was.
2-male_removing_accessory=thinking,Well, that was expected.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:human,targetStage:0=annoyed,You'd think ~player~ would try harder to make a good first impression, but I guess not.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:rinkah=thinking,I still fail to see how a blindfold could be useful. But I'm not from the future or wherever you're from.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:2,totalRounds:0-3,count-aggressive:1=annoyed,At this rate, I'll be sub-zero.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3,totalRounds:0-3,count-aggressive:1=worried,Yeesh, four rounds in a row? Who's puppy did <i>you</i> kick?
2-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0=glad,You normally love my advice, Pit. What happened? Too embarrassing?
2-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=teasing,Aw, poor little Pit. Want me to come help with that belt?
2-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=teasing,Good! Now you can lose all the more efficiently.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:saki=thinking,I've seen a good few robots in my day, but never an android.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=glad,Don't worry. I'm sure this is plenty thrilling for some of us. Or at least ~player~.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:2=calm,Should've just taken 'em off with the shoes. As a courtesy, you know?
2-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3=tranquil,Ah, yes. An honorable base, keeping that plaid wall of yours from collapsing.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rinkah=surprised,Oh? Does it come with a low-health sound too?
2-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=glad,I doubt that'd take much. Space pirates probably have messed up vision.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,An "anti-grav aug" <i>I</i> have to control, thank you very much.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:futaba=thinking,I wonder if I have a persona. Or maybe as a goddess, I <i>am</i> the persona?
2-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:futaba=calm,I can see why you'd think that 9S. I don't blame you for wanting to stay in another round.
2-male_removed_accessory=calm,I'm not mad, just disappointed.
2-male_removed_accessory=angry,Let's keep going. I'll get the big stuff off you yet!
2-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:futaba=horny,Really? I could see you two getting <i>much</i> more intimate after tonight...
2-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=surprised,Oh, so it's like looking through a TV?
2-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba,count-pit:1=glad,The designation works well. I prefer it, too.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:rinkah=glad,Looks like you got caught in the act, Rinkah.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,Oh Pit. Making rivals in a place like this?
2-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=teasing,A tactical visor disguised as a blindfold. Clever.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=teasing,Uh-huh. Maybe stick to your actual guns.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:4=horny,Hopefully, the collapse comes <i>soon</i>.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2=glad,You know it!
2-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:rinkah=teasing,Moisture tracking? I didn't know your maker was so naughty, 9s.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba=worried,A better name might do you good. I keep associating you with Mr. Game and Watch...
2-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3=glad,You'd sound more convincing if it wasn't for the fact this is a standing game.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,Are you <i>complaining</i>, Pit?
2-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1=tranquil,Surprisingly confident. Don't worry, that confidence will all go away in just a few more hands.
2-female_removing_accessory=teasing,Taking the easy way out, huh?
2-female_removing_accessory=thinking,Pretty ordinary fare, I assume?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:1-10=surprised,Calling her out seems a bit silly, don't you think?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=glad,That's fine. I figured no shoes would sort of be your default state, anyway.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=glad,Maybe later, you two?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0=thinking,You know, this is still a public area. You don't have to take off both.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:firstNude=worried,I was afraid it'd come to this.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:zizou=teasing,Take it from a goddess: you don't need powers to see that.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3=glad,Talk about your anachronisms...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2=calm,I'm of firm belief that holsters are unneccesary. You want to use a weapon, wield it at all times.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0,totalRounds:0=glad,Maybe Go Fish is more your speed?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:0,targetTimeInStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=glad,It's not like she's lying to her self. She's just not in a hurry to admit it.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:aimee=thinking,(I wonder who'd win in a knife fight between these two.)
2-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:sei=glad,I'm surprised you even had somewhere to store an ID.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elaine,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=glad,Not a very convincing facade.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:3=thinking,I imagine retying that must be a pain, day after day.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=thinking,Chelsea, Chelsea... doesn't ring a bell. Must be famous in just your world.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:0=worried,Doesn't it get sweat and whatnot trapped underneath it?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=thinking,Hmm. Must be tough finding socks when you're a cold-hearted killer.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:winter,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:weiss=horny,Hiding secrets, are we, Winter? Awfully distant of you.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0=glad,And as cute as a ribbon, too. <i>That</i> ribbon, specifically.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rinkah=awkward,(Wish I knw there were so many half-rabbits during the revolt...)
2-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zizou=teasing,All the hormones must have gone to her head.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:chica=calm,Sure, sure. I imagine a ghost would have all the time in the world.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1=worried,What I want to know is what school gives out shoes that gaudy.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:1=thinking,Has <i>anything</i> on a heroes belt been helpful to anyone? Ever?
2-female_removing_accessory,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:pico_day=thinking,Odd. I've never heard of any "Pico Day."
2-female_removing_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:chiaki=thinking,Do you know what a video game is, Jenetta?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:0=teasing,You don't need padded gloves. Especially considering there may be an ace or two hidden up it.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:shaggy,alsoPlayingStage:0=surprised,That doesn't sound like an expression you should know. Who taught it to you?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette=glad,This is fine.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:8=calm,A ribbon would just accentuate her nudity. She's better off without.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2=thinking,Speaking of, why is it I'm sensing two souls inhabiting your body?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:1,totalRounds:10-99,totalAlive:5=glad,I suppose we can let it slip. Only fair, seeing how you're not wearing pants for whatever reason.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:orendi,targetStage:0=surprised,What an interesting individual you are! Like the child of man and monster!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:winter,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:buffy,alsoPlayingStage:4-5=calm,Married to the job, I think is the right term? How boring.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:pit=calm,Just sit back and watch, Pit. It'll do you good.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0=thinking,(<i>I wish all souls could wield weapons. Maybe then the Underworld threat wouldn't have gotten so big...</i>)
2-female_removing_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:2=surprised,Six toes? Is that normal?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jasmine=calm,How modest. I like that.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:zoey,targetStage:4=annoyed,It's rude to have lead us on like that.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=calm,You know, I knew someone else who used yo-yos as their weapon of choice. Although Ness always looked more like a bee than a ladybug...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=teasing,I'd love to see how you two could make a pair of boots awkward.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:10=glad,Those hands are doing better than any flimsy old ribbon could.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=surprised,A human with the Power of Flight? Amazing!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=thinking,So as the Ultimate Gamer, I'm sure you've played my game, right?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:pit=surprised,Are you sure? Magnus can be a real jerk about it.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:mia,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=worried,Ghosts have all kinds of tricks up their incorporeal sleeves, huh?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=tranquil,Don't worry, spirits like you and I still appear on film. Everyone will see your nudity in due time.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:xander,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=thinking,It came off as passive-aggressive, Spooky.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=annoyed,Seeing as that's a threat and at least one of us here is mortal, I'll let it count.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0=tranquil,Quite the renaissance girl, aren't you?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:sarcasm=worried,I was afraid it'd come to this.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=annoyed,Oh yes, the collar. Attached to your invisible shirt, I assume?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:sei=glad,You really need it. Especially against Sei here.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1=thinking,But do they still squeak?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=teasing,What frilly shoes! But then again, your whole outfit is... immodest.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:amalia,targetStage:0=thinking,Just a little pouch? How... pedestrian.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:9=awkward,The fact there are two of her says it all, really.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1=calm,Seems it's about that time. Of course, I won't stop you if you decide to throw a curveball.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=glad,What an awkward place to meet up at.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:0=calm,Human armor always amuses me. Us gods rarely need it.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:won=worried,I knew it wouldn't be this easy.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:9s=glad,Rinkah looks about as much as a Yorha as I do.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2=tranquil,I like the way you think, Tojiko!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:marceline,alsoPlayingStage:9=thinking,A knife really has no place here. Unless you intended to stab the cards or something.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=worried,There are no video games on other planets, I'm afraid, Chiaki.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=awkward,You mean to tell me even the <i>staff</i> doesn't want you undressing so much?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=thinking,You might want to hurry it up, then. That'll just get in the way of a real fight.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rainbow_mika,alsoPlayingStage:5=teasing,You, Kyu? You're scrawny! Pit or even Viridi could outwrestle you.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:zizou=horny,Really now? I'm going to enjoy this.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=surprised,Is that <i>fire</i>? Why...?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:5=worried,I was afraid it'd come to this.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1=thinking,I didn't know the people of Hyrule used sandals.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=glad,Better stand up quickly before she decks you.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:0=tranquil,I see you like your jewelery as well.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:winter,targetStage:1=glad,Ah, right. You're fond of gloves, aren't you?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=calm,I take it you play around fire a lot? Very few burns. Impressive.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:harley=thinking,Your both white clowns to me. At least, you're both wearing white make-up.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:2=glad,Oh, a circlet! Are you sure you're not the real deal?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=worried,Oh. And just when it looked like your arms healed up.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:saki=thinking,(Was it really? Saki looks like she has something on her mind.)
2-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:1=worried,Bit presumptuous, aren't you?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:1=tranquil,Ghost pirate zombies are always fun.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=calm,Now you're getting the hang of it!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:uravity=glad,I don't think so. Trust me, I know the guy. Or hand, rather.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=awkward,Complaining about stripping smaller things. I wonder how you ended up like this?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:0=calm,Brave of you. Not very smart, but brave.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:misato=tranquil,Like mine! Who knew humans had that variety as well?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zizou,count-elizabeth:1=awkward,Are you sure about that?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rainbow_mika,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=teasing,You, Kyu? You're scrawny! Pit or even Viridi could outwrestle you.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=calm,Well! Let's see where this takes us.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:lux,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:pit=calm,I don't play favorites here.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:SpookyWinning1=loss,You're winning, but you still use the knife as a buffer?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:pit=tranquil,Look Pit! Even <i>humans</i> learned to fly before you!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=tranquil,Ah, so that's a belt? Very cool. Very, very cool.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=tranquil,I'm not sure either. Although I'm sure Pit would say a hot dog.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:0=glad,Has Monkey Island fallen on hard times?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette=thinking,(Not focused enough to escape a loss, though.)
2-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=worried,Wait, that was all around your head... if you have a brain, it probably took a hit or two there.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1=calm,Shoes in this game <i>are</i> as annoying as little bugs.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:aella=thinking,Looking at this girl, I doubt she's ever "gotten lucky".
2-female_removed_accessory=calm,I would do the same. I like to think I'd have more style, though.
2-female_removed_accessory=glad,Bit of a slow start. Let's do our best to speed it up!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:1=calm,I'd say Winslow has a much better deal here than you and Guybrush.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:alice=teasing,Don't have a lot? Good to know.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:2=teasing,If you were <i>really</i> nice, you'd do even more for us.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:something_off=calm,...What are you looking at me for? I didn't make the rules.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:winter,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=calm,This'll probably be easier if you let the girl think for herself, Winter. You can complain <i>after</i> she's lost completely.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:rinkah=thinking,(I still have no evidence that goblins aren't just an elaborate hoax created by the humans.)
2-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=tranquil,So you <i>are</i> a fan? How surreal.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:hope_you_all_forgive_me=glad,Forgiven. <i>For now.</i>
2-female_removed_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:1=thinking,(<i>Wow. She seems so normal compared to most of the others here.</i>)
2-female_removed_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zoey,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=teasing,It's fine, Zoey. Take your time, I'll just get them out the old-fashioned way.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=calm,I suppose this was just the first act in your little game. Moving on.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=annoyed,Why does <i>everyone</i> say that?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:joey=tranquil,Interesting how you don't deny it, Kyu.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:hermione,targetStage:4=calm,You have some weird priorities, Hermione.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:lyn=teasing,Speaking of, when are you getting into Heroes, Rinkah? Hm?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=annoyed,Apologizing? Don't. I'd rather this be a fair fight.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,Controlling angels is surprisingly easy. Not surprised you've done it, Spooky.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:kyoko=glad,Whoever had gloves, really.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1=tranquil,You have good taste, Jenetta. Don't listen to your sister.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4=teasing,Not bad. You're made of surprisingly sturdy stuff!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=awkward,Those are some seriously deep burns... are you sure you'll be okay?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=thinking,You know, I can feel everyone's arousal level from that reveal. Yours is the highest, Kyu. Care to explain?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:mahiru=horny,Wouldn't exactly be "Ultimate" if they weren't.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:9=tranquil,The reasons don't matter that much. All that matters is that it's happened.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:videogametriviatime,alsoPlaying:meia=tranquil,Would you perhaps like my help, Chiaki? I know many, many video game facts.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jura=calm,A woman who loves muscles? What, is she the type who'd love to be crushed by a woman's thighs?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2=glad,Yeah, I'd say you were a bit too rough with your stripping.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:2=tranquil,<i>Finally</i> someone who gets it!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1=calm,Sorry, I can't really take anyone with beady black eyes seriously.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:0=glad,There's a lot of ghosts in the multiverse, Hermione. You of all people should know that.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zizou=teasing,<i>This</i> girl's your rival? Talk about a low standard, Zizou.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:2=teasing,Projecting now, are we?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=surprised,...You know, your personality is actually pretty fitting for someone who's part cat.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:6=angry,That's right. This is her true form. And someone <i>I</i> may have to fight... if it comes to it.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:2=horny,That sounds fun, too.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:I_had_to_lose_something=glad,It's amazing how one silly ribbon can make you look so formal.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:lux,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,I think you and Pit have a lot in common, Lux.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:kira=annoyed,Your comments are unneccessary, Kira.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:3=teasing,Trust me, Rinkah. I <i>never</i> let up once I've started.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:I_guess_I_can_take_off=calm,Expecting? No. Hoping? You bet.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:6=thinking,It's a mystery to me why you chose to lose your bra <i>before</i> your glasses...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:4=teasing,Says you. This is a card game, you know.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:winter,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=teasing,Is that a hint of smugness I sense? Even for someone named Winter, that's cold.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1=worried,Unfortunate. Seems you're just another human for tonight.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:winter,targetStage:2=teasing,I think you're being too confident. Remember, no matter what rank you have, it means nothing to the divine.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:2=tranquil,A helmet like that didn't really suit you anyway. You look <i>somewhat</i> normal with it off.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:aimee=annoyed,(People will just get inflicted with bullet wounds instead.)
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:pick_something_small=teasing,A brilliant deduction, Sola.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingStage:4-5=glad,I don't see the correlation of why the Flame Tribe is any different.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:2=glad,You'll get holes in your stockings if you go around like that!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:3=calm,No, please, do go on.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:1=calm,I'll let it slide. It's not like you have any authority here anyways.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:uravity=teasing,Who do you like to play as? I'll be sure to give them an extra-special pounding next time I face them.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:sarcasm2=angry,Don't just play this off! ~player~, this is her true form. And someone <i>I</i> may have to fight... if it comes to it.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:4=thinking,Wait, I'm pretty sure that bag would've had to come off anyway for you to get totally naked...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=calm,I'd love to hear your thoughts on it. Come see me after the game.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:marinette=teasing,Another gaming enthusiast? Then I assume you know, say, the Smash tournaments?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:dress_off_first=calm,Uh, Sola? Bit late to the punchline.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:firstNude2=angry,That's right. This is her true form. And someone <i>I</i> may have to fight... if it comes to it.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=worried,I have no words.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,You've got an active imagination, Pit. She's from the Fire Tribe, not a tribe made of fire.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1=calm,That's fine. One ribbon won't break the outfit, right?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:live_without_shoes=teasing,And that's how you lose your tights.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=calm,You talk a big game, but in my experience, that's all it is.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:dizzy=glad,Sure enough. You should sit down for a bit.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=tranquil,Those of us in Skyworld prefer the cold. Interesting contrast, I think.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zizou,count-elizabeth:1=worried,She didn't say anything. Are you a mind reader, perhaps?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=thinking,Well, this is a good alternative. And Z-moves are overrated, anyway.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:aella=glad,Doesn't seem too hard. Who makes bulky shoes for tiny feet?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:2=calm,Or is this just a Labrynnan thing?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:luck_syega=annoyed,Doesn't sound like any magic I've ever known...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:chiaki=teasing,As the authority on many games represented at the Inventory, I know that Chiaki's right. Perhaps I can give you some proof at another time?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2=glad,And you're all the better for it.
2-female_removed_accessory,filter:silent=annoyed,It's a lot harder to make conversation with a mute than I expected.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,totalRounds:0=annoyed,Calling in in early? Go ahead. We'll find someone more suitable to the table.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:Fast1=worried,I think you're missing the point. You want to <i>keep</i> your clothes. And, you know, <i>not</i> blow them up.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=annoyed,We'll see. Actually, can you even see the cards?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:dont_judge_me_too_hardly=thinking,It's a goddess's job to remain impartial to things like this.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:tada=awkward,You... may need glasses.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:need_shoes_back=angry,But seriously? <i>Bright red</i>? What were they thinking?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jura,count-meia:1=calm,Seems we've got a bit of a split between beauties and muscle-girls. And ~player~, I guess.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:2=horny,Well, clearly it wasn't helpful to you.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=thinking,This is a bit different from sparring, but I see the point.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1=calm,Regardless, it's a sensible first choice.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jin=tranquil,What you're saying is he has a shot. Congrats, Jin! That's probably the best you've ever gotten.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:0-6,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:Cross=awkward,Let's avoid the personal jabs, okay ladies? We're here to unwind.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:1=tranquil,Of course. I'd rather deal with someone my own size, anyway.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:here_i_go=teasing,I dunno, you sure you don't want to take off anything else? It's perfectly legal.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:natsuki,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=teasing,She's just pretending to make it seem like she wasn't totally eyeing you.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:aella=glad,So it did. Probably for the best.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:amalia,targetStage:1=glad,Are you willing to prove that?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:harley=annoyed,Are you just making all this up?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:spare_my_ribbon=teasing,You're not really sparing it. More like sacrificing it.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=annoyed,You know, a drink might do you good. Slow down your heart rate and whatnot.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:9s=tranquil,Not many secrets among the Flame Tribe, I see.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:4=tranquil,I suppose so. Next hand will hopefully be more eventful.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=glad,You're staring at one right now.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:rinkah=teasing,After the game, ladies. There's still stripping to do!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:mahiru=calm,Why are you apologizing? They're just gloves.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:3=teasing,No, couldn't be. You're far too generous to be one.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:1=calm,Must be a relief to remove it, yes?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,Don't encourage him. Please.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:1=calm,You're awfully chipper for a vampire... and someone about to lose all her clothes.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:4=teasing,<i>Maybe you'd be in better shape if you didn't have such a foul mouth.</i>
2-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=glad,Although, somehow it looks like your stockings made it out completely fine.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:2=teasing,Oh? What would you know about standing on clouds?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=teasing,A girl like you? Dancing burlesque? I'd <i>love</i>to see that.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1=tranquil,Right back into it, huh? Great!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2=teasing,You know I'm a goddess, right? Trying to shoot me with one of those is the equivalent of trying to break through a tank with a plastic fork.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:navi=calm,You know, I like this form a lot more. I bet most others do too.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:2=thinking,A bit too basic for my tastes, I'm afraid.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3=thinking,I wish my servants could be this assertive at times...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:5=surprised,Our hair is so similar when you have it like that. Are you ripping off my style?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:zizou=tranquil,Just like a certain other petite goddess I know!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:sayori,alsoPlayingStage:0-7,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:filter-fancy=tranquil,As does the higher-ups.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:what_to_take_off=glad,Who else's would you use? ~player~'s?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:install_skill=calm,No one at this table, clearly.

3-male_removing_accessory=thinking,Oh.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0=glad,You normally love my advice, Pit. What happened? Too embarrassing?
3-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,An "anti-grav aug" <i>I</i> have to control, thank you very much.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:futaba=thinking,I wonder if I have a persona. Or maybe as a goddess, I <i>am</i> the persona?
3-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:2,totalRounds:0-3,count-aggressive:1=annoyed,At this rate, I'll be sub-zero.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3=tranquil,Ah, yes. An honorable base, keeping that plaid wall of yours from collapsing.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:2=calm,Should've just taken 'em off with the shoes. As a courtesy, you know?
3-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=teasing,Aw, poor little Pit. Want me to come help with that belt?
3-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3,totalRounds:0-3,count-aggressive:1=worried,Yeesh, four rounds in a row? Who's puppy did <i>you</i> kick?
3-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rinkah=surprised,Oh? Does it come with a low-health sound too?
3-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:rinkah=thinking,I still fail to see how a blindfold could be useful. But I'm not from the future or wherever you're from.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=glad,Don't worry. I'm sure this is plenty thrilling for some of us. Or at least ~player~.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:saki=thinking,I've seen a good few robots in my day, but never an android.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:human,targetStage:0=annoyed,You'd think ~player~ would try harder to make a good first impression, but I guess not.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=teasing,Good! Now you can lose all the more efficiently.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:futaba=calm,I can see why you'd think that 9S. I don't blame you for wanting to stay in another round.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=glad,I doubt that'd take much. Space pirates probably have messed up vision.
3-male_removed_accessory=teasing,Tell you what: pick something better next time and I'll forgive you. Deal?
3-male_removed_accessory=annoyed,Gee, I sure am glad I came here.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba,count-pit:1=glad,The designation works well. I prefer it, too.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba=worried,A better name might do you good. I keep associating you with Mr. Game and Watch...
3-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:4=horny,Hopefully, the collapse comes <i>soon</i>.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:rinkah=teasing,Moisture tracking? I didn't know your maker was so naughty, 9s.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:futaba=horny,Really? I could see you two getting <i>much</i> more intimate after tonight...
3-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,Oh Pit. Making rivals in a place like this?
3-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:rinkah=glad,Looks like you got caught in the act, Rinkah.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,Are you <i>complaining</i>, Pit?
3-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2=glad,You know it!
3-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1=tranquil,Surprisingly confident. Don't worry, that confidence will all go away in just a few more hands.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3=glad,You'd sound more convincing if it wasn't for the fact this is a standing game.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=teasing,A tactical visor disguised as a blindfold. Clever.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=teasing,Uh-huh. Maybe stick to your actual guns.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=surprised,Oh, so it's like looking through a TV?
3-female_removing_accessory=worried,Oh no, whatever will you do without your ~clothing~?
3-female_removing_accessory=annoyed,Glad you chose the small stuff. Again.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:1=thinking,Has <i>anything</i> on a heroes belt been helpful to anyone? Ever?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:pit=tranquil,Look Pit! Even <i>humans</i> learned to fly before you!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:aimee=thinking,(I wonder who'd win in a knife fight between these two.)
3-female_removing_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:0,targetTimeInStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=glad,It's not like she's lying to her self. She's just not in a hurry to admit it.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:3=thinking,I imagine retying that must be a pain, day after day.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=thinking,Chelsea, Chelsea... doesn't ring a bell. Must be famous in just your world.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:winter,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:weiss=horny,Hiding secrets, are we, Winter? Awfully distant of you.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:0=teasing,You don't need padded gloves. Especially considering there may be an ace or two hidden up it.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:1-10=surprised,Calling her out seems a bit silly, don't you think?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0=glad,And as cute as a ribbon, too. <i>That</i> ribbon, specifically.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0=thinking,You know, this is still a public area. You don't have to take off both.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:chiaki=thinking,Do you know what a video game is, Jenetta?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rinkah=awkward,(Wish I knw there were so many half-rabbits during the revolt...)
3-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:shaggy,alsoPlayingStage:0=surprised,That doesn't sound like an expression you should know. Who taught it to you?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1=worried,What I want to know is what school gives out shoes that gaudy.
3-female_removing_accessory,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:pico_day=thinking,Odd. I've never heard of any "Pico Day."
3-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:SpookyWinning1=loss,You're winning, but you still use the knife as a buffer?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:chica=calm,Sure, sure. I imagine a ghost would have all the time in the world.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1=thinking,But do they still squeak?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=thinking,So as the Ultimate Gamer, I'm sure you've played my game, right?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:pit=surprised,Are you sure? Magnus can be a real jerk about it.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:mia,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=worried,Ghosts have all kinds of tricks up their incorporeal sleeves, huh?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=glad,What an awkward place to meet up at.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:0=calm,Human armor always amuses me. Us gods rarely need it.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1=calm,Seems it's about that time. Of course, I won't stop you if you decide to throw a curveball.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:9=awkward,The fact there are two of her says it all, really.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=glad,That's fine. I figured no shoes would sort of be your default state, anyway.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:amalia,targetStage:0=thinking,Just a little pouch? How... pedestrian.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=teasing,What frilly shoes! But then again, your whole outfit is... immodest.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:sei=glad,You really need it. Especially against Sei here.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=annoyed,Oh yes, the collar. Attached to your invisible shirt, I assume?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0=tranquil,Quite the renaissance girl, aren't you?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette=glad,This is fine.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:8=calm,A ribbon would just accentuate her nudity. She's better off without.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:xander,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=thinking,It came off as passive-aggressive, Spooky.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:9s=glad,Rinkah looks about as much as a Yorha as I do.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zizou=teasing,All the hormones must have gone to her head.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2=calm,I'm of firm belief that holsters are unneccesary. You want to use a weapon, wield it at all times.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=surprised,A human with the Power of Flight? Amazing!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=glad,Better stand up quickly before she decks you.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette=thinking,(Not focused enough to escape a loss, though.)
3-female_removing_accessory,target:lux,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:pit=calm,I don't play favorites here.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=awkward,Complaining about stripping smaller things. I wonder how you ended up like this?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rainbow_mika,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=teasing,You, Kyu? You're scrawny! Pit or even Viridi could outwrestle you.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=calm,Now you're getting the hang of it!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1=thinking,I didn't know the people of Hyrule used sandals.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:harley=thinking,Your both white clowns to me. At least, you're both wearing white make-up.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=awkward,You mean to tell me even the <i>staff</i> doesn't want you undressing so much?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:0=glad,Has Monkey Island fallen on hard times?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:aella=thinking,Looking at this girl, I doubt she's ever "gotten lucky".
3-female_removing_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:1=tranquil,Ghost pirate zombies are always fun.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=calm,I take it you play around fire a lot? Very few burns. Impressive.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=tranquil,Ah, so that's a belt? Very cool. Very, very cool.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=tranquil,Don't worry, spirits like you and I still appear on film. Everyone will see your nudity in due time.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=thinking,You might want to hurry it up, then. That'll just get in the way of a real fight.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=tranquil,I'm not sure either. Although I'm sure Pit would say a hot dog.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=calm,Well! Let's see where this takes us.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:0=tranquil,I see you like your jewelery as well.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=thinking,Hmm. Must be tough finding socks when you're a cold-hearted killer.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:2=glad,Oh, a circlet! Are you sure you're not the real deal?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:winter,targetStage:1=glad,Ah, right. You're fond of gloves, aren't you?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3=glad,Talk about your anachronisms...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:zizou=teasing,Take it from a goddess: you don't need powers to see that.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=annoyed,Seeing as that's a threat and at least one of us here is mortal, I'll let it count.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=glad,Maybe later, you two?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2=tranquil,I like the way you think, Tojiko!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=worried,There are no video games on other planets, I'm afraid, Chiaki.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:misato=tranquil,Like mine! Who knew humans had that variety as well?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:0=calm,Brave of you. Not very smart, but brave.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:saki=thinking,(Was it really? Saki looks like she has something on her mind.)
3-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zizou,count-elizabeth:1=awkward,Are you sure about that?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:1=worried,Bit presumptuous, aren't you?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:zizou=horny,Really now? I'm going to enjoy this.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=surprised,Is that <i>fire</i>? Why...?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=worried,Oh. And just when it looked like your arms healed up.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:5=worried,I was afraid it'd come to this.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rainbow_mika,alsoPlayingStage:5=teasing,You, Kyu? You're scrawny! Pit or even Viridi could outwrestle you.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:uravity=glad,I don't think so. Trust me, I know the guy. Or hand, rather.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=worried,Wait, that was all around your head... if you have a brain, it probably took a hit or two there.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1=calm,Shoes in this game <i>are</i> as annoying as little bugs.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:10=glad,Those hands are doing better than any flimsy old ribbon could.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:0=worried,Doesn't it get sweat and whatnot trapped underneath it?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:orendi,targetStage:0=surprised,What an interesting individual you are! Like the child of man and monster!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:sei=glad,I'm surprised you even had somewhere to store an ID.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2=thinking,Speaking of, why is it I'm sensing two souls inhabiting your body?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:1,totalRounds:10-99,totalAlive:5=glad,I suppose we can let it slip. Only fair, seeing how you're not wearing pants for whatever reason.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:zoey,targetStage:4=annoyed,It's rude to have lead us on like that.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:won=worried,I knew it wouldn't be this easy.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jasmine=calm,How modest. I like that.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:marceline,alsoPlayingStage:9=thinking,A knife really has no place here. Unless you intended to stab the cards or something.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:winter,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:buffy,alsoPlayingStage:4-5=calm,Married to the job, I think is the right term? How boring.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0,totalRounds:0=glad,Maybe Go Fish is more your speed?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elaine,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=glad,Not a very convincing facade.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=teasing,I'd love to see how you two could make a pair of boots awkward.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=calm,You know, I knew someone else who used yo-yos as their weapon of choice. Although Ness always looked more like a bee than a ladybug...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:pit=calm,Just sit back and watch, Pit. It'll do you good.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0=thinking,(<i>I wish all souls could wield weapons. Maybe then the Underworld threat wouldn't have gotten so big...</i>)
3-female_removing_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:sarcasm=worried,I was afraid it'd come to this.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:2=surprised,Six toes? Is that normal?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:firstNude=worried,I was afraid it'd come to this.
3-female_removed_accessory=angry,I didn't come here for stall tactics, you know.
3-female_removed_accessory=calm,Just wanted to remind ~name~ that we're betting with <i>all</i> our clothes.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:firstNude2=angry,That's right. This is her true form. And someone <i>I</i> may have to fight... if it comes to it.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,totalRounds:0=annoyed,Calling in in early? Go ahead. We'll find someone more suitable to the table.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=thinking,Well, this is a good alternative. And Z-moves are overrated, anyway.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:2=tranquil,<i>Finally</i> someone who gets it!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:9=tranquil,The reasons don't matter that much. All that matters is that it's happened.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:tada=awkward,You... may need glasses.
3-female_removed_accessory,filter:silent=annoyed,It's a lot harder to make conversation with a mute than I expected.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:4=teasing,<i>Maybe you'd be in better shape if you didn't have such a foul mouth.</i>
3-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=thinking,You know, I can feel everyone's arousal level from that reveal. Yours is the highest, Kyu. Care to explain?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:chiaki=teasing,As the authority on many games represented at the Inventory, I know that Chiaki's right. Perhaps I can give you some proof at another time?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:2=horny,Well, clearly it wasn't helpful to you.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=teasing,A girl like you? Dancing burlesque? I'd <i>love</i>to see that.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:4=thinking,Wait, I'm pretty sure that bag would've had to come off anyway for you to get totally naked...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:2=thinking,A bit too basic for my tastes, I'm afraid.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:aella=glad,Doesn't seem too hard. Who makes bulky shoes for tiny feet?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:Fast1=worried,I think you're missing the point. You want to <i>keep</i> your clothes. And, you know, <i>not</i> blow them up.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:4=teasing,Says you. This is a card game, you know.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:videogametriviatime,alsoPlaying:meia=tranquil,Would you perhaps like my help, Chiaki? I know many, many video game facts.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:1=calm,Must be a relief to remove it, yes?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=worried,I have no words.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:sarcasm2=angry,Don't just play this off! ~player~, this is her true form. And someone <i>I</i> may have to fight... if it comes to it.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,Don't encourage him. Please.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,You've got an active imagination, Pit. She's from the Fire Tribe, not a tribe made of fire.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jin=tranquil,What you're saying is he has a shot. Congrats, Jin! That's probably the best you've ever gotten.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2=glad,And you're all the better for it.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:0-6,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:Cross=awkward,Let's avoid the personal jabs, okay ladies? We're here to unwind.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jura=calm,A woman who loves muscles? What, is she the type who'd love to be crushed by a woman's thighs?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:dizzy=glad,Sure enough. You should sit down for a bit.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:2=calm,Or is this just a Labrynnan thing?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:mahiru=horny,Wouldn't exactly be "Ultimate" if they weren't.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1=calm,That's fine. One ribbon won't break the outfit, right?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=annoyed,We'll see. Actually, can you even see the cards?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2=glad,Yeah, I'd say you were a bit too rough with your stripping.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:need_shoes_back=angry,But seriously? <i>Bright red</i>? What were they thinking?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:luck_syega=annoyed,Doesn't sound like any magic I've ever known...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:harley=annoyed,Are you just making all this up?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:something_off=calm,...What are you looking at me for? I didn't make the rules.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:uravity=teasing,Who do you like to play as? I'll be sure to give them an extra-special pounding next time I face them.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1=tranquil,Right back into it, huh? Great!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:9s=tranquil,Not many secrets among the Flame Tribe, I see.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jura,count-meia:1=calm,Seems we've got a bit of a split between beauties and muscle-girls. And ~player~, I guess.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:hope_you_all_forgive_me=glad,Forgiven. <i>For now.</i>
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zizou,count-elizabeth:1=worried,She didn't say anything. Are you a mind reader, perhaps?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:pick_something_small=teasing,A brilliant deduction, Sola.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:3=teasing,Trust me, Rinkah. I <i>never</i> let up once I've started.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1=tranquil,You have good taste, Jenetta. Don't listen to your sister.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=annoyed,Apologizing? Don't. I'd rather this be a fair fight.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:aimee=annoyed,(People will just get inflicted with bullet wounds instead.)
3-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=awkward,Those are some seriously deep burns... are you sure you'll be okay?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:I_had_to_lose_something=glad,It's amazing how one silly ribbon can make you look so formal.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zizou=teasing,<i>This</i> girl's your rival? Talk about a low standard, Zizou.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3=thinking,I wish my servants could be this assertive at times...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:2=teasing,Oh? What would you know about standing on clouds?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:2=glad,You'll get holes in your stockings if you go around like that!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:I_guess_I_can_take_off=calm,Expecting? No. Hoping? You bet.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:here_i_go=teasing,I dunno, you sure you don't want to take off anything else? It's perfectly legal.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=calm,I'd love to hear your thoughts on it. Come see me after the game.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:spare_my_ribbon=teasing,You're not really sparing it. More like sacrificing it.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=annoyed,You know, a drink might do you good. Slow down your heart rate and whatnot.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:dont_judge_me_too_hardly=thinking,It's a goddess's job to remain impartial to things like this.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=thinking,This is a bit different from sparring, but I see the point.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:navi=calm,You know, I like this form a lot more. I bet most others do too.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:2=horny,That sounds fun, too.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingStage:4-5=glad,I don't see the correlation of why the Flame Tribe is any different.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:live_without_shoes=teasing,And that's how you lose your tights.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=calm,You talk a big game, but in my experience, that's all it is.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1=calm,Regardless, it's a sensible first choice.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:marinette=teasing,Another gaming enthusiast? Then I assume you know, say, the Smash tournaments?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:dress_off_first=calm,Uh, Sola? Bit late to the punchline.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,Controlling angels is surprisingly easy. Not surprised you've done it, Spooky.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:amalia,targetStage:1=glad,Are you willing to prove that?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:install_skill=calm,No one at this table, clearly.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2=teasing,You know I'm a goddess, right? Trying to shoot me with one of those is the equivalent of trying to break through a tank with a plastic fork.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=tranquil,Those of us in Skyworld prefer the cold. Interesting contrast, I think.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:zizou=tranquil,Just like a certain other petite goddess I know!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=tranquil,So you <i>are</i> a fan? How surreal.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:what_to_take_off=glad,Who else's would you use? ~player~'s?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:1=calm,I'd say Winslow has a much better deal here than you and Guybrush.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4=teasing,Not bad. You're made of surprisingly sturdy stuff!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:5=surprised,Our hair is so similar when you have it like that. Are you ripping off my style?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1=worried,Unfortunate. Seems you're just another human for tonight.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:lux,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,I think you and Pit have a lot in common, Lux.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:winter,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=calm,This'll probably be easier if you let the girl think for herself, Winter. You can complain <i>after</i> she's lost completely.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:winter,targetStage:2=teasing,I think you're being too confident. Remember, no matter what rank you have, it means nothing to the divine.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:kira=annoyed,Your comments are unneccessary, Kira.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=annoyed,Why does <i>everyone</i> say that?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1=calm,Sorry, I can't really take anyone with beady black eyes seriously.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:1=thinking,(<i>Wow. She seems so normal compared to most of the others here.</i>)
3-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:aella=glad,So it did. Probably for the best.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:mahiru=calm,Why are you apologizing? They're just gloves.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:2=teasing,Projecting now, are we?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:alice=teasing,Don't have a lot? Good to know.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:1=calm,I'll let it slide. It's not like you have any authority here anyways.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=surprised,...You know, your personality is actually pretty fitting for someone who's part cat.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:2=teasing,If you were <i>really</i> nice, you'd do even more for us.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:rinkah=thinking,(I still have no evidence that goblins aren't just an elaborate hoax created by the humans.)
3-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:4=tranquil,I suppose so. Next hand will hopefully be more eventful.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:0=glad,There's a lot of ghosts in the multiverse, Hermione. You of all people should know that.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:3=teasing,No, couldn't be. You're far too generous to be one.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:6=thinking,It's a mystery to me why you chose to lose your bra <i>before</i> your glasses...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:2=tranquil,A helmet like that didn't really suit you anyway. You look <i>somewhat</i> normal with it off.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:6=angry,That's right. This is her true form. And someone <i>I</i> may have to fight... if it comes to it.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:joey=tranquil,Interesting how you don't deny it, Kyu.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:winter,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=teasing,Is that a hint of smugness I sense? Even for someone named Winter, that's cold.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:hermione,targetStage:4=calm,You have some weird priorities, Hermione.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:rinkah=teasing,After the game, ladies. There's still stripping to do!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:lyn=teasing,Speaking of, when are you getting into Heroes, Rinkah? Hm?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=calm,I suppose this was just the first act in your little game. Moving on.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=glad,Although, somehow it looks like your stockings made it out completely fine.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:3=calm,No, please, do go on.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=glad,You're staring at one right now.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:kyoko=glad,Whoever had gloves, really.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:1=tranquil,Of course. I'd rather deal with someone my own size, anyway.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zoey,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=teasing,It's fine, Zoey. Take your time, I'll just get them out the old-fashioned way.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:1=calm,You're awfully chipper for a vampire... and someone about to lose all her clothes.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:natsuki,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=teasing,She's just pretending to make it seem like she wasn't totally eyeing you.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:sayori,alsoPlayingStage:0-7,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:filter-fancy=tranquil,As does the higher-ups.


#lost belts
4-male_removing_accessory=annoyed,Fantastic. That didn't even faze you.
4-male_removing_accessory=calm,If you think that's going to excite me, you are <i>sorely</i> mistaken, my friend.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3=tranquil,Ah, yes. An honorable base, keeping that plaid wall of yours from collapsing.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=glad,Don't worry. I'm sure this is plenty thrilling for some of us. Or at least ~player~.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:futaba=thinking,I wonder if I have a persona. Or maybe as a goddess, I <i>am</i> the persona?
4-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,An "anti-grav aug" <i>I</i> have to control, thank you very much.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=teasing,Aw, poor little Pit. Want me to come help with that belt?
4-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3,totalRounds:0-3,count-aggressive:1=worried,Yeesh, four rounds in a row? Who's puppy did <i>you</i> kick?
4-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:rinkah=thinking,I still fail to see how a blindfold could be useful. But I'm not from the future or wherever you're from.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:2,totalRounds:0-3,count-aggressive:1=annoyed,At this rate, I'll be sub-zero.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rinkah=surprised,Oh? Does it come with a low-health sound too?
4-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:2=calm,Should've just taken 'em off with the shoes. As a courtesy, you know?
4-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=glad,I doubt that'd take much. Space pirates probably have messed up vision.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:saki=thinking,I've seen a good few robots in my day, but never an android.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:human,targetStage:0=annoyed,You'd think ~player~ would try harder to make a good first impression, but I guess not.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0=glad,You normally love my advice, Pit. What happened? Too embarrassing?
4-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:futaba=calm,I can see why you'd think that 9S. I don't blame you for wanting to stay in another round.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=teasing,Good! Now you can lose all the more efficiently.
4-male_removed_accessory=teasing,Good to know humans don't have a lot of guts.
4-male_removed_accessory=glad,A smart move, even if it does annoy me to no end.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba,count-pit:1=glad,The designation works well. I prefer it, too.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba=worried,A better name might do you good. I keep associating you with Mr. Game and Watch...
4-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=surprised,Oh, so it's like looking through a TV?
4-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2=glad,You know it!
4-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=teasing,Uh-huh. Maybe stick to your actual guns.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3=glad,You'd sound more convincing if it wasn't for the fact this is a standing game.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=teasing,A tactical visor disguised as a blindfold. Clever.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:rinkah=teasing,Moisture tracking? I didn't know your maker was so naughty, 9s.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:rinkah=glad,Looks like you got caught in the act, Rinkah.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,Oh Pit. Making rivals in a place like this?
4-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1=tranquil,Surprisingly confident. Don't worry, that confidence will all go away in just a few more hands.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:futaba=horny,Really? I could see you two getting <i>much</i> more intimate after tonight...
4-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,Are you <i>complaining</i>, Pit?
4-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:4=horny,Hopefully, the collapse comes <i>soon</i>.
4-female_removing_accessory=worried,Seriously? That's all you can muster?
4-female_removing_accessory=angry,Are we still taking off the extra stuff? Really?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=worried,Oh. And just when it looked like your arms healed up.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:9s=glad,Rinkah looks about as much as a Yorha as I do.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rainbow_mika,alsoPlayingStage:5=teasing,You, Kyu? You're scrawny! Pit or even Viridi could outwrestle you.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:amalia,targetStage:0=thinking,Just a little pouch? How... pedestrian.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=tranquil,Ah, so that's a belt? Very cool. Very, very cool.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=thinking,You might want to hurry it up, then. That'll just get in the way of a real fight.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=worried,Wait, that was all around your head... if you have a brain, it probably took a hit or two there.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:sei=glad,I'm surprised you even had somewhere to store an ID.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=surprised,A human with the Power of Flight? Amazing!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=calm,I take it you play around fire a lot? Very few burns. Impressive.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=teasing,I'd love to see how you two could make a pair of boots awkward.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:uravity=glad,I don't think so. Trust me, I know the guy. Or hand, rather.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:5=worried,I was afraid it'd come to this.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:won=worried,I knew it wouldn't be this easy.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=tranquil,I'm not sure either. Although I'm sure Pit would say a hot dog.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=calm,Well! Let's see where this takes us.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elaine,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=glad,Not a very convincing facade.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:winter,targetStage:1=glad,Ah, right. You're fond of gloves, aren't you?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:pit=surprised,Are you sure? Magnus can be a real jerk about it.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=calm,Now you're getting the hang of it!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:0=calm,Human armor always amuses me. Us gods rarely need it.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:harley=thinking,Your both white clowns to me. At least, you're both wearing white make-up.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=glad,Better stand up quickly before she decks you.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=glad,What an awkward place to meet up at.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:mia,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=worried,Ghosts have all kinds of tricks up their incorporeal sleeves, huh?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1=thinking,I didn't know the people of Hyrule used sandals.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=surprised,Is that <i>fire</i>? Why...?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=awkward,Complaining about stripping smaller things. I wonder how you ended up like this?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:lux,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:pit=calm,I don't play favorites here.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rainbow_mika,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=teasing,You, Kyu? You're scrawny! Pit or even Viridi could outwrestle you.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:0=glad,Has Monkey Island fallen on hard times?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:1=tranquil,Ghost pirate zombies are always fun.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=calm,You know, I knew someone else who used yo-yos as their weapon of choice. Although Ness always looked more like a bee than a ladybug...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:sarcasm=worried,I was afraid it'd come to this.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette=thinking,(Not focused enough to escape a loss, though.)
4-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=awkward,You mean to tell me even the <i>staff</i> doesn't want you undressing so much?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:0=tranquil,I see you like your jewelery as well.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:10=glad,Those hands are doing better than any flimsy old ribbon could.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1=calm,Seems it's about that time. Of course, I won't stop you if you decide to throw a curveball.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=thinking,So as the Ultimate Gamer, I'm sure you've played my game, right?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:2=glad,Oh, a circlet! Are you sure you're not the real deal?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:saki=thinking,(Was it really? Saki looks like she has something on her mind.)
4-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0,totalRounds:0=glad,Maybe Go Fish is more your speed?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:aella=thinking,Looking at this girl, I doubt she's ever "gotten lucky".
4-female_removing_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:firstNude=worried,I was afraid it'd come to this.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:9=awkward,The fact there are two of her says it all, really.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:pit=tranquil,Look Pit! Even <i>humans</i> learned to fly before you!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:0=teasing,You don't need padded gloves. Especially considering there may be an ace or two hidden up it.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=teasing,What frilly shoes! But then again, your whole outfit is... immodest.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette=glad,This is fine.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=thinking,Hmm. Must be tough finding socks when you're a cold-hearted killer.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:winter,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:buffy,alsoPlayingStage:4-5=calm,Married to the job, I think is the right term? How boring.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zizou=teasing,All the hormones must have gone to her head.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:orendi,targetStage:0=surprised,What an interesting individual you are! Like the child of man and monster!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zizou,count-elizabeth:1=awkward,Are you sure about that?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:pit=calm,Just sit back and watch, Pit. It'll do you good.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:shaggy,alsoPlayingStage:0=surprised,That doesn't sound like an expression you should know. Who taught it to you?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:chiaki=thinking,Do you know what a video game is, Jenetta?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1=thinking,But do they still squeak?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:1=thinking,Has <i>anything</i> on a heroes belt been helpful to anyone? Ever?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:1-10=surprised,Calling her out seems a bit silly, don't you think?
4-female_removing_accessory,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:pico_day=thinking,Odd. I've never heard of any "Pico Day."
4-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1=worried,What I want to know is what school gives out shoes that gaudy.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0=tranquil,Quite the renaissance girl, aren't you?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:chica=calm,Sure, sure. I imagine a ghost would have all the time in the world.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0=thinking,(<i>I wish all souls could wield weapons. Maybe then the Underworld threat wouldn't have gotten so big...</i>)
4-female_removing_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rinkah=awkward,(Wish I knw there were so many half-rabbits during the revolt...)
4-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0=glad,And as cute as a ribbon, too. <i>That</i> ribbon, specifically.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:xander,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=thinking,It came off as passive-aggressive, Spooky.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:2=surprised,Six toes? Is that normal?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=glad,That's fine. I figured no shoes would sort of be your default state, anyway.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:0,targetTimeInStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=glad,It's not like she's lying to her self. She's just not in a hurry to admit it.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:0=worried,Doesn't it get sweat and whatnot trapped underneath it?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:SpookyWinning1=loss,You're winning, but you still use the knife as a buffer?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:winter,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:weiss=horny,Hiding secrets, are we, Winter? Awfully distant of you.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=tranquil,Don't worry, spirits like you and I still appear on film. Everyone will see your nudity in due time.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:3=thinking,I imagine retying that must be a pain, day after day.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=thinking,Chelsea, Chelsea... doesn't ring a bell. Must be famous in just your world.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0=thinking,You know, this is still a public area. You don't have to take off both.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:marceline,alsoPlayingStage:9=thinking,A knife really has no place here. Unless you intended to stab the cards or something.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:8=calm,A ribbon would just accentuate her nudity. She's better off without.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jasmine=calm,How modest. I like that.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=glad,Maybe later, you two?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:sei=glad,You really need it. Especially against Sei here.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1=calm,Shoes in this game <i>are</i> as annoying as little bugs.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2=calm,I'm of firm belief that holsters are unneccesary. You want to use a weapon, wield it at all times.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:0=calm,Brave of you. Not very smart, but brave.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:zoey,targetStage:4=annoyed,It's rude to have lead us on like that.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:1=worried,Bit presumptuous, aren't you?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:misato=tranquil,Like mine! Who knew humans had that variety as well?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=annoyed,Oh yes, the collar. Attached to your invisible shirt, I assume?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2=thinking,Speaking of, why is it I'm sensing two souls inhabiting your body?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2=tranquil,I like the way you think, Tojiko!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:1,totalRounds:10-99,totalAlive:5=glad,I suppose we can let it slip. Only fair, seeing how you're not wearing pants for whatever reason.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=annoyed,Seeing as that's a threat and at least one of us here is mortal, I'll let it count.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:aimee=thinking,(I wonder who'd win in a knife fight between these two.)
4-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=worried,There are no video games on other planets, I'm afraid, Chiaki.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3=glad,Talk about your anachronisms...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:zizou=teasing,Take it from a goddess: you don't need powers to see that.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:zizou=horny,Really now? I'm going to enjoy this.
4-female_removed_accessory=tranquil,I can relish in the fact that you lost at least. No, gods aren't above pettiness.
4-female_removed_accessory=worried,You'll run out at some point, I'm sure.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:dont_judge_me_too_hardly=thinking,It's a goddess's job to remain impartial to things like this.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:lux,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,I think you and Pit have a lot in common, Lux.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:harley=annoyed,Are you just making all this up?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jura=calm,A woman who loves muscles? What, is she the type who'd love to be crushed by a woman's thighs?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:1=calm,I'd say Winslow has a much better deal here than you and Guybrush.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:hope_you_all_forgive_me=glad,Forgiven. <i>For now.</i>
4-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:videogametriviatime,alsoPlaying:meia=tranquil,Would you perhaps like my help, Chiaki? I know many, many video game facts.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=teasing,A girl like you? Dancing burlesque? I'd <i>love</i>to see that.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:2=horny,That sounds fun, too.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:aimee=annoyed,(People will just get inflicted with bullet wounds instead.)
4-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jin=tranquil,What you're saying is he has a shot. Congrats, Jin! That's probably the best you've ever gotten.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:joey=tranquil,Interesting how you don't deny it, Kyu.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:kira=annoyed,Your comments are unneccessary, Kira.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:rinkah=teasing,After the game, ladies. There's still stripping to do!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:zizou=tranquil,Just like a certain other petite goddess I know!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:kyoko=glad,Whoever had gloves, really.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=annoyed,Why does <i>everyone</i> say that?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zizou,count-elizabeth:1=worried,She didn't say anything. Are you a mind reader, perhaps?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:sayori,alsoPlayingStage:0-7,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:filter-fancy=tranquil,As does the higher-ups.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:0-6,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:Cross=awkward,Let's avoid the personal jabs, okay ladies? We're here to unwind.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:alice=teasing,Don't have a lot? Good to know.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:mahiru=calm,Why are you apologizing? They're just gloves.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:natsuki,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=teasing,She's just pretending to make it seem like she wasn't totally eyeing you.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingStage:4-5=glad,I don't see the correlation of why the Flame Tribe is any different.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:winter,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=calm,This'll probably be easier if you let the girl think for herself, Winter. You can complain <i>after</i> she's lost completely.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,Controlling angels is surprisingly easy. Not surprised you've done it, Spooky.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zoey,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=teasing,It's fine, Zoey. Take your time, I'll just get them out the old-fashioned way.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:aella=glad,Doesn't seem too hard. Who makes bulky shoes for tiny feet?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,totalRounds:0=annoyed,Calling in in early? Go ahead. We'll find someone more suitable to the table.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:9=tranquil,The reasons don't matter that much. All that matters is that it's happened.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:9s=tranquil,Not many secrets among the Flame Tribe, I see.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:rinkah=thinking,(I still have no evidence that goblins aren't just an elaborate hoax created by the humans.)
4-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:4=thinking,Wait, I'm pretty sure that bag would've had to come off anyway for you to get totally naked...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:lyn=teasing,Speaking of, when are you getting into Heroes, Rinkah? Hm?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:chiaki=teasing,As the authority on many games represented at the Inventory, I know that Chiaki's right. Perhaps I can give you some proof at another time?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jura,count-meia:1=calm,Seems we've got a bit of a split between beauties and muscle-girls. And ~player~, I guess.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=glad,You're staring at one right now.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,Don't encourage him. Please.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=tranquil,Those of us in Skyworld prefer the cold. Interesting contrast, I think.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=thinking,This is a bit different from sparring, but I see the point.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=annoyed,We'll see. Actually, can you even see the cards?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:dress_off_first=calm,Uh, Sola? Bit late to the punchline.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:uravity=teasing,Who do you like to play as? I'll be sure to give them an extra-special pounding next time I face them.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=worried,I have no words.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zizou=teasing,<i>This</i> girl's your rival? Talk about a low standard, Zizou.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:marinette=teasing,Another gaming enthusiast? Then I assume you know, say, the Smash tournaments?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,You've got an active imagination, Pit. She's from the Fire Tribe, not a tribe made of fire.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:aella=glad,So it did. Probably for the best.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:0=glad,There's a lot of ghosts in the multiverse, Hermione. You of all people should know that.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:I_guess_I_can_take_off=calm,Expecting? No. Hoping? You bet.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:winter,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=teasing,Is that a hint of smugness I sense? Even for someone named Winter, that's cold.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:here_i_go=teasing,I dunno, you sure you don't want to take off anything else? It's perfectly legal.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1=calm,Sorry, I can't really take anyone with beady black eyes seriously.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:mahiru=horny,Wouldn't exactly be "Ultimate" if they weren't.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=annoyed,Apologizing? Don't. I'd rather this be a fair fight.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4=teasing,Not bad. You're made of surprisingly sturdy stuff!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=calm,I'd love to hear your thoughts on it. Come see me after the game.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2=glad,Yeah, I'd say you were a bit too rough with your stripping.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:2=tranquil,<i>Finally</i> someone who gets it!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:6=thinking,It's a mystery to me why you chose to lose your bra <i>before</i> your glasses...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:2=tranquil,A helmet like that didn't really suit you anyway. You look <i>somewhat</i> normal with it off.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:6=angry,That's right. This is her true form. And someone <i>I</i> may have to fight... if it comes to it.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:1=thinking,(<i>Wow. She seems so normal compared to most of the others here.</i>)
4-female_removed_accessory,target:hermione,targetStage:4=calm,You have some weird priorities, Hermione.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:3=calm,No, please, do go on.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:1=calm,I'll let it slide. It's not like you have any authority here anyways.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:3=teasing,No, couldn't be. You're far too generous to be one.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:winter,targetStage:2=teasing,I think you're being too confident. Remember, no matter what rank you have, it means nothing to the divine.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:1=calm,You're awfully chipper for a vampire... and someone about to lose all her clothes.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:5=surprised,Our hair is so similar when you have it like that. Are you ripping off my style?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:4=teasing,<i>Maybe you'd be in better shape if you didn't have such a foul mouth.</i>
4-female_removed_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:sarcasm2=angry,Don't just play this off! ~player~, this is her true form. And someone <i>I</i> may have to fight... if it comes to it.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:firstNude2=angry,That's right. This is her true form. And someone <i>I</i> may have to fight... if it comes to it.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:2=calm,Or is this just a Labrynnan thing?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:dizzy=glad,Sure enough. You should sit down for a bit.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:Fast1=worried,I think you're missing the point. You want to <i>keep</i> your clothes. And, you know, <i>not</i> blow them up.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:tada=awkward,You... may need glasses.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=thinking,Well, this is a good alternative. And Z-moves are overrated, anyway.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=tranquil,So you <i>are</i> a fan? How surreal.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:need_shoes_back=angry,But seriously? <i>Bright red</i>? What were they thinking?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1=tranquil,Right back into it, huh? Great!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3=thinking,I wish my servants could be this assertive at times...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:2=glad,You'll get holes in your stockings if you go around like that!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1=tranquil,You have good taste, Jenetta. Don't listen to your sister.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=awkward,Those are some seriously deep burns... are you sure you'll be okay?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=annoyed,You know, a drink might do you good. Slow down your heart rate and whatnot.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2=teasing,You know I'm a goddess, right? Trying to shoot me with one of those is the equivalent of trying to break through a tank with a plastic fork.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=calm,You talk a big game, but in my experience, that's all it is.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:2=horny,Well, clearly it wasn't helpful to you.
4-female_removed_accessory,filter:silent=annoyed,It's a lot harder to make conversation with a mute than I expected.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2=glad,And you're all the better for it.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1=calm,That's fine. One ribbon won't break the outfit, right?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:1=calm,Must be a relief to remove it, yes?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:navi=calm,You know, I like this form a lot more. I bet most others do too.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:2=thinking,A bit too basic for my tastes, I'm afraid.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:4=tranquil,I suppose so. Next hand will hopefully be more eventful.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=glad,Although, somehow it looks like your stockings made it out completely fine.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:1=tranquil,Of course. I'd rather deal with someone my own size, anyway.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=calm,I suppose this was just the first act in your little game. Moving on.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:2=teasing,If you were <i>really</i> nice, you'd do even more for us.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:4=teasing,Says you. This is a card game, you know.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1=worried,Unfortunate. Seems you're just another human for tonight.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:2=teasing,Projecting now, are we?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=thinking,You know, I can feel everyone's arousal level from that reveal. Yours is the highest, Kyu. Care to explain?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:amalia,targetStage:1=glad,Are you willing to prove that?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:2=teasing,Oh? What would you know about standing on clouds?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:luck_syega=annoyed,Doesn't sound like any magic I've ever known...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=surprised,...You know, your personality is actually pretty fitting for someone who's part cat.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:3=teasing,Trust me, Rinkah. I <i>never</i> let up once I've started.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:live_without_shoes=teasing,And that's how you lose your tights.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:I_had_to_lose_something=glad,It's amazing how one silly ribbon can make you look so formal.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:install_skill=calm,No one at this table, clearly.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:something_off=calm,...What are you looking at me for? I didn't make the rules.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:spare_my_ribbon=teasing,You're not really sparing it. More like sacrificing it.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:what_to_take_off=glad,Who else's would you use? ~player~'s?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1=calm,Regardless, it's a sensible first choice.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:pick_something_small=teasing,A brilliant deduction, Sola.


#lost stocking
5-male_removing_accessory=angry,Look at this guy! Totally not winning any brownie points right now.
5-male_removing_accessory=annoyed,Yeah, yeah, rub it in more.
5-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:futaba=calm,I can see why you'd think that 9S. I don't blame you for wanting to stay in another round.
5-male_removing_accessory,target:human,targetStage:0=annoyed,You'd think ~player~ would try harder to make a good first impression, but I guess not.
5-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:saki=thinking,I've seen a good few robots in my day, but never an android.
5-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:futaba=thinking,I wonder if I have a persona. Or maybe as a goddess, I <i>am</i> the persona?
5-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3=tranquil,Ah, yes. An honorable base, keeping that plaid wall of yours from collapsing.
5-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:rinkah=thinking,I still fail to see how a blindfold could be useful. But I'm not from the future or wherever you're from.
5-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=glad,I doubt that'd take much. Space pirates probably have messed up vision.
5-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=glad,Don't worry. I'm sure this is plenty thrilling for some of us. Or at least ~player~.
5-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rinkah=surprised,Oh? Does it come with a low-health sound too?
5-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,An "anti-grav aug" <i>I</i> have to control, thank you very much.
5-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=teasing,Aw, poor little Pit. Want me to come help with that belt?
5-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0=glad,You normally love my advice, Pit. What happened? Too embarrassing?
5-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=teasing,Good! Now you can lose all the more efficiently.
5-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:2,totalRounds:0-3,count-aggressive:1=annoyed,At this rate, I'll be sub-zero.
5-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3,totalRounds:0-3,count-aggressive:1=worried,Yeesh, four rounds in a row? Who's puppy did <i>you</i> kick?
5-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:2=calm,Should've just taken 'em off with the shoes. As a courtesy, you know?
5-male_removed_accessory=awkward,Have to say I'm a bit jealous. Scorn aside, any sort of backup clothes could help...
5-male_removed_accessory=worried,I should've played more conservatively. I got cocky...
5-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:rinkah=glad,Looks like you got caught in the act, Rinkah.
5-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba,count-pit:1=glad,The designation works well. I prefer it, too.
5-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=surprised,Oh, so it's like looking through a TV?
5-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3=glad,You'd sound more convincing if it wasn't for the fact this is a standing game.
5-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,Are you <i>complaining</i>, Pit?
5-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:futaba=horny,Really? I could see you two getting <i>much</i> more intimate after tonight...
5-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=teasing,A tactical visor disguised as a blindfold. Clever.
5-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:rinkah=teasing,Moisture tracking? I didn't know your maker was so naughty, 9s.
5-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:4=horny,Hopefully, the collapse comes <i>soon</i>.
5-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba=worried,A better name might do you good. I keep associating you with Mr. Game and Watch...
5-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1=tranquil,Surprisingly confident. Don't worry, that confidence will all go away in just a few more hands.
5-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2=glad,You know it!
5-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,Oh Pit. Making rivals in a place like this?
5-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=teasing,Uh-huh. Maybe stick to your actual guns.
5-female_removing_accessory=tranquil,How about we just ditch all these meaningless baubles and go right to our last two items?
5-female_removing_accessory=thinking,Maybe I should've studied up a bit before taking this challenge.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=awkward,You mean to tell me even the <i>staff</i> doesn't want you undressing so much?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:won=worried,I knew it wouldn't be this easy.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rainbow_mika,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=teasing,You, Kyu? You're scrawny! Pit or even Viridi could outwrestle you.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1=calm,Shoes in this game <i>are</i> as annoying as little bugs.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:sarcasm=worried,I was afraid it'd come to this.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elaine,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=glad,Not a very convincing facade.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:firstNude=worried,I was afraid it'd come to this.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=thinking,You might want to hurry it up, then. That'll just get in the way of a real fight.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:SpookyWinning1=loss,You're winning, but you still use the knife as a buffer?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0,totalRounds:0=glad,Maybe Go Fish is more your speed?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=awkward,Complaining about stripping smaller things. I wonder how you ended up like this?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:chiaki=thinking,Do you know what a video game is, Jenetta?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2=thinking,Speaking of, why is it I'm sensing two souls inhabiting your body?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:harley=thinking,Your both white clowns to me. At least, you're both wearing white make-up.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:sei=glad,I'm surprised you even had somewhere to store an ID.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=calm,You know, I knew someone else who used yo-yos as their weapon of choice. Although Ness always looked more like a bee than a ladybug...
5-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:10=glad,Those hands are doing better than any flimsy old ribbon could.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=calm,Well! Let's see where this takes us.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:zoey,targetStage:4=annoyed,It's rude to have lead us on like that.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:2=surprised,Six toes? Is that normal?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1=thinking,I didn't know the people of Hyrule used sandals.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=tranquil,I'm not sure either. Although I'm sure Pit would say a hot dog.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=tranquil,Don't worry, spirits like you and I still appear on film. Everyone will see your nudity in due time.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:orendi,targetStage:0=surprised,What an interesting individual you are! Like the child of man and monster!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=calm,I take it you play around fire a lot? Very few burns. Impressive.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:winter,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:buffy,alsoPlayingStage:4-5=calm,Married to the job, I think is the right term? How boring.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:aella=thinking,Looking at this girl, I doubt she's ever "gotten lucky".
5-female_removing_accessory,target:lux,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:pit=calm,I don't play favorites here.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0=thinking,(<i>I wish all souls could wield weapons. Maybe then the Underworld threat wouldn't have gotten so big...</i>)
5-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=tranquil,Ah, so that's a belt? Very cool. Very, very cool.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:pit=calm,Just sit back and watch, Pit. It'll do you good.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette=thinking,(Not focused enough to escape a loss, though.)
5-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:shaggy,alsoPlayingStage:0=surprised,That doesn't sound like an expression you should know. Who taught it to you?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rinkah=awkward,(Wish I knw there were so many half-rabbits during the revolt...)
5-female_removing_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:1=tranquil,Ghost pirate zombies are always fun.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:winter,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:weiss=horny,Hiding secrets, are we, Winter? Awfully distant of you.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:aimee=thinking,(I wonder who'd win in a knife fight between these two.)
5-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:xander,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=thinking,It came off as passive-aggressive, Spooky.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:chica=calm,Sure, sure. I imagine a ghost would have all the time in the world.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:0=tranquil,I see you like your jewelery as well.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette=glad,This is fine.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zizou=teasing,All the hormones must have gone to her head.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:zizou=teasing,Take it from a goddess: you don't need powers to see that.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:pit=tranquil,Look Pit! Even <i>humans</i> learned to fly before you!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:0=glad,Has Monkey Island fallen on hard times?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:1,totalRounds:10-99,totalAlive:5=glad,I suppose we can let it slip. Only fair, seeing how you're not wearing pants for whatever reason.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:misato=tranquil,Like mine! Who knew humans had that variety as well?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:9s=glad,Rinkah looks about as much as a Yorha as I do.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:mia,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=worried,Ghosts have all kinds of tricks up their incorporeal sleeves, huh?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=glad,What an awkward place to meet up at.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=glad,Better stand up quickly before she decks you.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:pit=surprised,Are you sure? Magnus can be a real jerk about it.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=teasing,I'd love to see how you two could make a pair of boots awkward.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:zizou=horny,Really now? I'm going to enjoy this.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zizou,count-elizabeth:1=awkward,Are you sure about that?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:uravity=glad,I don't think so. Trust me, I know the guy. Or hand, rather.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jasmine=calm,How modest. I like that.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=calm,Now you're getting the hang of it!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:saki=thinking,(Was it really? Saki looks like she has something on her mind.)
5-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:marceline,alsoPlayingStage:9=thinking,A knife really has no place here. Unless you intended to stab the cards or something.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:sei=glad,You really need it. Especially against Sei here.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=surprised,A human with the Power of Flight? Amazing!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:1=worried,Bit presumptuous, aren't you?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:0=teasing,You don't need padded gloves. Especially considering there may be an ace or two hidden up it.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=annoyed,Seeing as that's a threat and at least one of us here is mortal, I'll let it count.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:amalia,targetStage:0=thinking,Just a little pouch? How... pedestrian.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:1-10=surprised,Calling her out seems a bit silly, don't you think?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2=calm,I'm of firm belief that holsters are unneccesary. You want to use a weapon, wield it at all times.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3=glad,Talk about your anachronisms...
5-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=teasing,What frilly shoes! But then again, your whole outfit is... immodest.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=worried,Wait, that was all around your head... if you have a brain, it probably took a hit or two there.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=thinking,Hmm. Must be tough finding socks when you're a cold-hearted killer.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1=calm,Seems it's about that time. Of course, I won't stop you if you decide to throw a curveball.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=surprised,Is that <i>fire</i>? Why...?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=worried,Oh. And just when it looked like your arms healed up.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1=worried,What I want to know is what school gives out shoes that gaudy.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=annoyed,Oh yes, the collar. Attached to your invisible shirt, I assume?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1=thinking,But do they still squeak?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:1=thinking,Has <i>anything</i> on a heroes belt been helpful to anyone? Ever?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rainbow_mika,alsoPlayingStage:5=teasing,You, Kyu? You're scrawny! Pit or even Viridi could outwrestle you.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:8=calm,A ribbon would just accentuate her nudity. She's better off without.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0=tranquil,Quite the renaissance girl, aren't you?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=glad,That's fine. I figured no shoes would sort of be your default state, anyway.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0=thinking,You know, this is still a public area. You don't have to take off both.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=worried,There are no video games on other planets, I'm afraid, Chiaki.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:0,targetTimeInStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=glad,It's not like she's lying to her self. She's just not in a hurry to admit it.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:3=thinking,I imagine retying that must be a pain, day after day.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:2=glad,Oh, a circlet! Are you sure you're not the real deal?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:0=worried,Doesn't it get sweat and whatnot trapped underneath it?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=thinking,So as the Ultimate Gamer, I'm sure you've played my game, right?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:0=calm,Human armor always amuses me. Us gods rarely need it.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=glad,Maybe later, you two?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2=tranquil,I like the way you think, Tojiko!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:0=calm,Brave of you. Not very smart, but brave.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:5=worried,I was afraid it'd come to this.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:winter,targetStage:1=glad,Ah, right. You're fond of gloves, aren't you?
5-female_removing_accessory,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:pico_day=thinking,Odd. I've never heard of any "Pico Day."
5-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:9=awkward,The fact there are two of her says it all, really.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=thinking,Chelsea, Chelsea... doesn't ring a bell. Must be famous in just your world.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0=glad,And as cute as a ribbon, too. <i>That</i> ribbon, specifically.
5-female_removed_accessory=glad,All or nothing mode! C'mon, any takers? No?
5-female_removed_accessory=loss,(<i>...I'm in such a bad spot...</i>)
5-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=teasing,A girl like you? Dancing burlesque? I'd <i>love</i>to see that.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:1=tranquil,Of course. I'd rather deal with someone my own size, anyway.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jin=tranquil,What you're saying is he has a shot. Congrats, Jin! That's probably the best you've ever gotten.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1=calm,That's fine. One ribbon won't break the outfit, right?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:4=tranquil,I suppose so. Next hand will hopefully be more eventful.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:0-6,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:Cross=awkward,Let's avoid the personal jabs, okay ladies? We're here to unwind.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:dizzy=glad,Sure enough. You should sit down for a bit.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=annoyed,We'll see. Actually, can you even see the cards?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=worried,I have no words.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:1=calm,Must be a relief to remove it, yes?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:pick_something_small=teasing,A brilliant deduction, Sola.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:sarcasm2=angry,Don't just play this off! ~player~, this is her true form. And someone <i>I</i> may have to fight... if it comes to it.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:2=thinking,A bit too basic for my tastes, I'm afraid.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:aella=glad,So it did. Probably for the best.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:firstNude2=angry,That's right. This is her true form. And someone <i>I</i> may have to fight... if it comes to it.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:2=calm,Or is this just a Labrynnan thing?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:navi=calm,You know, I like this form a lot more. I bet most others do too.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1=calm,Sorry, I can't really take anyone with beady black eyes seriously.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,Don't encourage him. Please.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:kira=annoyed,Your comments are unneccessary, Kira.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2=glad,And you're all the better for it.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:2=glad,You'll get holes in your stockings if you go around like that!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:mahiru=horny,Wouldn't exactly be "Ultimate" if they weren't.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1=calm,Regardless, it's a sensible first choice.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:luck_syega=annoyed,Doesn't sound like any magic I've ever known...
5-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=thinking,Well, this is a good alternative. And Z-moves are overrated, anyway.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:aimee=annoyed,(People will just get inflicted with bullet wounds instead.)
5-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1=tranquil,You have good taste, Jenetta. Don't listen to your sister.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:live_without_shoes=teasing,And that's how you lose your tights.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:need_shoes_back=angry,But seriously? <i>Bright red</i>? What were they thinking?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:dont_judge_me_too_hardly=thinking,It's a goddess's job to remain impartial to things like this.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zizou=teasing,<i>This</i> girl's your rival? Talk about a low standard, Zizou.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:uravity=teasing,Who do you like to play as? I'll be sure to give them an extra-special pounding next time I face them.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=annoyed,You know, a drink might do you good. Slow down your heart rate and whatnot.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,totalRounds:0=annoyed,Calling in in early? Go ahead. We'll find someone more suitable to the table.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=awkward,Those are some seriously deep burns... are you sure you'll be okay?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2=teasing,You know I'm a goddess, right? Trying to shoot me with one of those is the equivalent of trying to break through a tank with a plastic fork.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:tada=awkward,You... may need glasses.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:aella=glad,Doesn't seem too hard. Who makes bulky shoes for tiny feet?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:chiaki=teasing,As the authority on many games represented at the Inventory, I know that Chiaki's right. Perhaps I can give you some proof at another time?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:1=calm,I'd say Winslow has a much better deal here than you and Guybrush.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=annoyed,Apologizing? Don't. I'd rather this be a fair fight.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,You've got an active imagination, Pit. She's from the Fire Tribe, not a tribe made of fire.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:4=teasing,<i>Maybe you'd be in better shape if you didn't have such a foul mouth.</i>
5-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:hope_you_all_forgive_me=glad,Forgiven. <i>For now.</i>
5-female_removed_accessory,filter:silent=annoyed,It's a lot harder to make conversation with a mute than I expected.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:harley=annoyed,Are you just making all this up?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:2=horny,Well, clearly it wasn't helpful to you.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:zizou=tranquil,Just like a certain other petite goddess I know!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:I_had_to_lose_something=glad,It's amazing how one silly ribbon can make you look so formal.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=calm,You talk a big game, but in my experience, that's all it is.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:marinette=teasing,Another gaming enthusiast? Then I assume you know, say, the Smash tournaments?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:Fast1=worried,I think you're missing the point. You want to <i>keep</i> your clothes. And, you know, <i>not</i> blow them up.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:rinkah=teasing,After the game, ladies. There's still stripping to do!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=calm,I suppose this was just the first act in your little game. Moving on.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=glad,Although, somehow it looks like your stockings made it out completely fine.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=calm,I'd love to hear your thoughts on it. Come see me after the game.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=tranquil,Those of us in Skyworld prefer the cold. Interesting contrast, I think.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:what_to_take_off=glad,Who else's would you use? ~player~'s?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingStage:4-5=glad,I don't see the correlation of why the Flame Tribe is any different.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=tranquil,So you <i>are</i> a fan? How surreal.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:3=calm,No, please, do go on.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:2=horny,That sounds fun, too.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:natsuki,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=teasing,She's just pretending to make it seem like she wasn't totally eyeing you.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:dress_off_first=calm,Uh, Sola? Bit late to the punchline.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1=tranquil,Right back into it, huh? Great!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:1=calm,I'll let it slide. It's not like you have any authority here anyways.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zizou,count-elizabeth:1=worried,She didn't say anything. Are you a mind reader, perhaps?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:joey=tranquil,Interesting how you don't deny it, Kyu.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:3=teasing,No, couldn't be. You're far too generous to be one.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:something_off=calm,...What are you looking at me for? I didn't make the rules.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:hermione,targetStage:4=calm,You have some weird priorities, Hermione.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2=glad,Yeah, I'd say you were a bit too rough with your stripping.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=thinking,This is a bit different from sparring, but I see the point.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:9=tranquil,The reasons don't matter that much. All that matters is that it's happened.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:2=tranquil,A helmet like that didn't really suit you anyway. You look <i>somewhat</i> normal with it off.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:6=angry,That's right. This is her true form. And someone <i>I</i> may have to fight... if it comes to it.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:winter,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=calm,This'll probably be easier if you let the girl think for herself, Winter. You can complain <i>after</i> she's lost completely.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:winter,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=teasing,Is that a hint of smugness I sense? Even for someone named Winter, that's cold.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:6=thinking,It's a mystery to me why you chose to lose your bra <i>before</i> your glasses...
5-female_removed_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:1=thinking,(<i>Wow. She seems so normal compared to most of the others here.</i>)
5-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jura=calm,A woman who loves muscles? What, is she the type who'd love to be crushed by a woman's thighs?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,Controlling angels is surprisingly easy. Not surprised you've done it, Spooky.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:I_guess_I_can_take_off=calm,Expecting? No. Hoping? You bet.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:0=glad,There's a lot of ghosts in the multiverse, Hermione. You of all people should know that.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:spare_my_ribbon=teasing,You're not really sparing it. More like sacrificing it.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:2=tranquil,<i>Finally</i> someone who gets it!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:kyoko=glad,Whoever had gloves, really.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4=teasing,Not bad. You're made of surprisingly sturdy stuff!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:4=thinking,Wait, I'm pretty sure that bag would've had to come off anyway for you to get totally naked...
5-female_removed_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zoey,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=teasing,It's fine, Zoey. Take your time, I'll just get them out the old-fashioned way.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=surprised,...You know, your personality is actually pretty fitting for someone who's part cat.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:2=teasing,Oh? What would you know about standing on clouds?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:9s=tranquil,Not many secrets among the Flame Tribe, I see.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jura,count-meia:1=calm,Seems we've got a bit of a split between beauties and muscle-girls. And ~player~, I guess.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:alice=teasing,Don't have a lot? Good to know.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:lyn=teasing,Speaking of, when are you getting into Heroes, Rinkah? Hm?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:5=surprised,Our hair is so similar when you have it like that. Are you ripping off my style?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:sayori,alsoPlayingStage:0-7,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:filter-fancy=tranquil,As does the higher-ups.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:mahiru=calm,Why are you apologizing? They're just gloves.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1=worried,Unfortunate. Seems you're just another human for tonight.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:2=teasing,Projecting now, are we?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:1=calm,You're awfully chipper for a vampire... and someone about to lose all her clothes.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:videogametriviatime,alsoPlaying:meia=tranquil,Would you perhaps like my help, Chiaki? I know many, many video game facts.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:install_skill=calm,No one at this table, clearly.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:4=teasing,Says you. This is a card game, you know.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:3=teasing,Trust me, Rinkah. I <i>never</i> let up once I've started.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:lux,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,I think you and Pit have a lot in common, Lux.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:here_i_go=teasing,I dunno, you sure you don't want to take off anything else? It's perfectly legal.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=thinking,You know, I can feel everyone's arousal level from that reveal. Yours is the highest, Kyu. Care to explain?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:winter,targetStage:2=teasing,I think you're being too confident. Remember, no matter what rank you have, it means nothing to the divine.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:rinkah=thinking,(I still have no evidence that goblins aren't just an elaborate hoax created by the humans.)
5-female_removed_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=glad,You're staring at one right now.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:2=teasing,If you were <i>really</i> nice, you'd do even more for us.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:amalia,targetStage:1=glad,Are you willing to prove that?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3=thinking,I wish my servants could be this assertive at times...
5-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=annoyed,Why does <i>everyone</i> say that?


#lost dress
6-male_removing_accessory=awkward,Not sure why I even got my hopes up.
6-male_removing_accessory=loss,Adding insult to injury. Great.
6-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,An "anti-grav aug" <i>I</i> have to control, thank you very much.
6-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3,totalRounds:0-3,count-aggressive:1=worried,Yeesh, four rounds in a row? Who's puppy did <i>you</i> kick?
6-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=teasing,Aw, poor little Pit. Want me to come help with that belt?
6-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:futaba=calm,I can see why you'd think that 9S. I don't blame you for wanting to stay in another round.
6-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=glad,Don't worry. I'm sure this is plenty thrilling for some of us. Or at least ~player~.
6-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:futaba=thinking,I wonder if I have a persona. Or maybe as a goddess, I <i>am</i> the persona?
6-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:2=calm,Should've just taken 'em off with the shoes. As a courtesy, you know?
6-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=teasing,Good! Now you can lose all the more efficiently.
6-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=glad,I doubt that'd take much. Space pirates probably have messed up vision.
6-male_removing_accessory,target:human,targetStage:0=annoyed,You'd think ~player~ would try harder to make a good first impression, but I guess not.
6-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0=glad,You normally love my advice, Pit. What happened? Too embarrassing?
6-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:saki=thinking,I've seen a good few robots in my day, but never an android.
6-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:2,totalRounds:0-3,count-aggressive:1=annoyed,At this rate, I'll be sub-zero.
6-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:rinkah=thinking,I still fail to see how a blindfold could be useful. But I'm not from the future or wherever you're from.
6-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rinkah=surprised,Oh? Does it come with a low-health sound too?
6-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3=tranquil,Ah, yes. An honorable base, keeping that plaid wall of yours from collapsing.
6-male_removed_accessory=worried,I think this game is making me pessimistic.
6-male_removed_accessory=calm,I'm going to pretend like that never happened and move on.
6-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,Are you <i>complaining</i>, Pit?
6-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=surprised,Oh, so it's like looking through a TV?
6-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=teasing,Uh-huh. Maybe stick to your actual guns.
6-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba=worried,A better name might do you good. I keep associating you with Mr. Game and Watch...
6-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:futaba=horny,Really? I could see you two getting <i>much</i> more intimate after tonight...
6-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:rinkah=teasing,Moisture tracking? I didn't know your maker was so naughty, 9s.
6-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba,count-pit:1=glad,The designation works well. I prefer it, too.
6-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:rinkah=glad,Looks like you got caught in the act, Rinkah.
6-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,Oh Pit. Making rivals in a place like this?
6-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:4=horny,Hopefully, the collapse comes <i>soon</i>.
6-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1=tranquil,Surprisingly confident. Don't worry, that confidence will all go away in just a few more hands.
6-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2=glad,You know it!
6-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3=glad,You'd sound more convincing if it wasn't for the fact this is a standing game.
6-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=teasing,A tactical visor disguised as a blindfold. Clever.
6-female_removing_accessory=angry,Is there a word to describe colorful, intense hatred that is also E10+ friendly?
6-female_removing_accessory=surprised,How many more of these do you have?
6-female_removing_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1=calm,Shoes in this game <i>are</i> as annoying as little bugs.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:0=calm,Brave of you. Not very smart, but brave.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=annoyed,Seeing as that's a threat and at least one of us here is mortal, I'll let it count.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2=calm,I'm of firm belief that holsters are unneccesary. You want to use a weapon, wield it at all times.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=worried,There are no video games on other planets, I'm afraid, Chiaki.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=thinking,Hmm. Must be tough finding socks when you're a cold-hearted killer.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:1=thinking,Has <i>anything</i> on a heroes belt been helpful to anyone? Ever?
6-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1=worried,What I want to know is what school gives out shoes that gaudy.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:1-10=surprised,Calling her out seems a bit silly, don't you think?
6-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0=glad,And as cute as a ribbon, too. <i>That</i> ribbon, specifically.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:3=thinking,I imagine retying that must be a pain, day after day.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0=thinking,You know, this is still a public area. You don't have to take off both.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=thinking,Chelsea, Chelsea... doesn't ring a bell. Must be famous in just your world.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=glad,That's fine. I figured no shoes would sort of be your default state, anyway.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1=thinking,But do they still squeak?
6-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0=tranquil,Quite the renaissance girl, aren't you?
6-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=annoyed,Oh yes, the collar. Attached to your invisible shirt, I assume?
6-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:8=calm,A ribbon would just accentuate her nudity. She's better off without.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=teasing,What frilly shoes! But then again, your whole outfit is... immodest.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:0=worried,Doesn't it get sweat and whatnot trapped underneath it?
6-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rainbow_mika,alsoPlayingStage:5=teasing,You, Kyu? You're scrawny! Pit or even Viridi could outwrestle you.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=worried,Oh. And just when it looked like your arms healed up.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:sei=glad,I'm surprised you even had somewhere to store an ID.
6-female_removing_accessory,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:pico_day=thinking,Odd. I've never heard of any "Pico Day."
6-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3=glad,Talk about your anachronisms...
6-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2=tranquil,I like the way you think, Tojiko!
6-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:1=worried,Bit presumptuous, aren't you?
6-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=glad,Maybe later, you two?
6-female_removing_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:5=worried,I was afraid it'd come to this.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:2=glad,Oh, a circlet! Are you sure you're not the real deal?
6-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1=thinking,I didn't know the people of Hyrule used sandals.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:0=tranquil,I see you like your jewelery as well.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=glad,Better stand up quickly before she decks you.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=surprised,Is that <i>fire</i>? Why...?
6-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=tranquil,Ah, so that's a belt? Very cool. Very, very cool.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=calm,I take it you play around fire a lot? Very few burns. Impressive.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:1=tranquil,Ghost pirate zombies are always fun.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=thinking,You might want to hurry it up, then. That'll just get in the way of a real fight.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:0=glad,Has Monkey Island fallen on hard times?
6-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=calm,Now you're getting the hang of it!
6-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=awkward,Complaining about stripping smaller things. I wonder how you ended up like this?
6-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=awkward,You mean to tell me even the <i>staff</i> doesn't want you undressing so much?
6-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rainbow_mika,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=teasing,You, Kyu? You're scrawny! Pit or even Viridi could outwrestle you.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:winter,targetStage:1=glad,Ah, right. You're fond of gloves, aren't you?
6-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=worried,Wait, that was all around your head... if you have a brain, it probably took a hit or two there.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=calm,Well! Let's see where this takes us.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:amalia,targetStage:0=thinking,Just a little pouch? How... pedestrian.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:0=calm,Human armor always amuses me. Us gods rarely need it.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:0,targetTimeInStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=glad,It's not like she's lying to her self. She's just not in a hurry to admit it.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:sei=glad,You really need it. Especially against Sei here.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette=glad,This is fine.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:chica=calm,Sure, sure. I imagine a ghost would have all the time in the world.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:aimee=thinking,(I wonder who'd win in a knife fight between these two.)
6-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:xander,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=thinking,It came off as passive-aggressive, Spooky.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:winter,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:weiss=horny,Hiding secrets, are we, Winter? Awfully distant of you.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rinkah=awkward,(Wish I knw there were so many half-rabbits during the revolt...)
6-female_removing_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:chiaki=thinking,Do you know what a video game is, Jenetta?
6-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zizou=teasing,All the hormones must have gone to her head.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:shaggy,alsoPlayingStage:0=surprised,That doesn't sound like an expression you should know. Who taught it to you?
6-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:mia,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=worried,Ghosts have all kinds of tricks up their incorporeal sleeves, huh?
6-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:zizou=teasing,Take it from a goddess: you don't need powers to see that.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:zizou=horny,Really now? I'm going to enjoy this.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:uravity=glad,I don't think so. Trust me, I know the guy. Or hand, rather.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zizou,count-elizabeth:1=awkward,Are you sure about that?
6-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:saki=thinking,(Was it really? Saki looks like she has something on her mind.)
6-female_removing_accessory,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:pit=tranquil,Look Pit! Even <i>humans</i> learned to fly before you!
6-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette=thinking,(Not focused enough to escape a loss, though.)
6-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:harley=thinking,Your both white clowns to me. At least, you're both wearing white make-up.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:aella=thinking,Looking at this girl, I doubt she's ever "gotten lucky".
6-female_removing_accessory,target:lux,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:pit=calm,I don't play favorites here.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=tranquil,I'm not sure either. Although I'm sure Pit would say a hot dog.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:misato=tranquil,Like mine! Who knew humans had that variety as well?
6-female_removing_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1=calm,Seems it's about that time. Of course, I won't stop you if you decide to throw a curveball.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:9s=glad,Rinkah looks about as much as a Yorha as I do.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:pit=surprised,Are you sure? Magnus can be a real jerk about it.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:9=awkward,The fact there are two of her says it all, really.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=thinking,So as the Ultimate Gamer, I'm sure you've played my game, right?
6-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=surprised,A human with the Power of Flight? Amazing!
6-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=calm,You know, I knew someone else who used yo-yos as their weapon of choice. Although Ness always looked more like a bee than a ladybug...
6-female_removing_accessory,target:zoey,targetStage:4=annoyed,It's rude to have lead us on like that.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:10=glad,Those hands are doing better than any flimsy old ribbon could.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:2=surprised,Six toes? Is that normal?
6-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0=thinking,(<i>I wish all souls could wield weapons. Maybe then the Underworld threat wouldn't have gotten so big...</i>)
6-female_removing_accessory,target:orendi,targetStage:0=surprised,What an interesting individual you are! Like the child of man and monster!
6-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2=thinking,Speaking of, why is it I'm sensing two souls inhabiting your body?
6-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=glad,What an awkward place to meet up at.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:winter,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:buffy,alsoPlayingStage:4-5=calm,Married to the job, I think is the right term? How boring.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:sarcasm=worried,I was afraid it'd come to this.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:firstNude=worried,I was afraid it'd come to this.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:SpookyWinning1=loss,You're winning, but you still use the knife as a buffer?
6-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elaine,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=glad,Not a very convincing facade.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0,totalRounds:0=glad,Maybe Go Fish is more your speed?
6-female_removing_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:1,totalRounds:10-99,totalAlive:5=glad,I suppose we can let it slip. Only fair, seeing how you're not wearing pants for whatever reason.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:pit=calm,Just sit back and watch, Pit. It'll do you good.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jasmine=calm,How modest. I like that.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:marceline,alsoPlayingStage:9=thinking,A knife really has no place here. Unless you intended to stab the cards or something.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=teasing,I'd love to see how you two could make a pair of boots awkward.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:won=worried,I knew it wouldn't be this easy.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:0=teasing,You don't need padded gloves. Especially considering there may be an ace or two hidden up it.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=tranquil,Don't worry, spirits like you and I still appear on film. Everyone will see your nudity in due time.
6-female_removed_accessory=tranquil,Don't mind me, I'll just be seething quietly over here.
6-female_removed_accessory=awkward,I shouldn't complain, but this is just sad...
6-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:pick_something_small=teasing,A brilliant deduction, Sola.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1=worried,Unfortunate. Seems you're just another human for tonight.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:3=teasing,Trust me, Rinkah. I <i>never</i> let up once I've started.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:something_off=calm,...What are you looking at me for? I didn't make the rules.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:2=teasing,Projecting now, are we?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:chiaki=teasing,As the authority on many games represented at the Inventory, I know that Chiaki's right. Perhaps I can give you some proof at another time?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:spare_my_ribbon=teasing,You're not really sparing it. More like sacrificing it.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=thinking,You know, I can feel everyone's arousal level from that reveal. Yours is the highest, Kyu. Care to explain?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zizou,count-elizabeth:1=worried,She didn't say anything. Are you a mind reader, perhaps?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:mahiru=horny,Wouldn't exactly be "Ultimate" if they weren't.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:amalia,targetStage:1=glad,Are you willing to prove that?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:what_to_take_off=glad,Who else's would you use? ~player~'s?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1=calm,Sorry, I can't really take anyone with beady black eyes seriously.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:2=teasing,Oh? What would you know about standing on clouds?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,Controlling angels is surprisingly easy. Not surprised you've done it, Spooky.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:install_skill=calm,No one at this table, clearly.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jura,count-meia:1=calm,Seems we've got a bit of a split between beauties and muscle-girls. And ~player~, I guess.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1=tranquil,Right back into it, huh? Great!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3=thinking,I wish my servants could be this assertive at times...
6-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:harley=annoyed,Are you just making all this up?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:2=teasing,If you were <i>really</i> nice, you'd do even more for us.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:I_had_to_lose_something=glad,It's amazing how one silly ribbon can make you look so formal.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:navi=calm,You know, I like this form a lot more. I bet most others do too.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingStage:4-5=glad,I don't see the correlation of why the Flame Tribe is any different.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:2=thinking,A bit too basic for my tastes, I'm afraid.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:marinette=teasing,Another gaming enthusiast? Then I assume you know, say, the Smash tournaments?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:dress_off_first=calm,Uh, Sola? Bit late to the punchline.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:zizou=tranquil,Just like a certain other petite goddess I know!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=tranquil,Those of us in Skyworld prefer the cold. Interesting contrast, I think.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:here_i_go=teasing,I dunno, you sure you don't want to take off anything else? It's perfectly legal.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:4=tranquil,I suppose so. Next hand will hopefully be more eventful.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=annoyed,Apologizing? Don't. I'd rather this be a fair fight.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:hope_you_all_forgive_me=glad,Forgiven. <i>For now.</i>
6-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:1=tranquil,Of course. I'd rather deal with someone my own size, anyway.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:I_guess_I_can_take_off=calm,Expecting? No. Hoping? You bet.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=calm,I suppose this was just the first act in your little game. Moving on.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:4=teasing,Says you. This is a card game, you know.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:9s=tranquil,Not many secrets among the Flame Tribe, I see.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=glad,Although, somehow it looks like your stockings made it out completely fine.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:aella=glad,Doesn't seem too hard. Who makes bulky shoes for tiny feet?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:live_without_shoes=teasing,And that's how you lose your tights.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=thinking,Well, this is a good alternative. And Z-moves are overrated, anyway.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:1=calm,I'd say Winslow has a much better deal here than you and Guybrush.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:2=tranquil,A helmet like that didn't really suit you anyway. You look <i>somewhat</i> normal with it off.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:2=calm,Or is this just a Labrynnan thing?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=teasing,A girl like you? Dancing burlesque? I'd <i>love</i>to see that.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:sarcasm2=angry,Don't just play this off! ~player~, this is her true form. And someone <i>I</i> may have to fight... if it comes to it.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jin=tranquil,What you're saying is he has a shot. Congrats, Jin! That's probably the best you've ever gotten.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:4=teasing,<i>Maybe you'd be in better shape if you didn't have such a foul mouth.</i>
6-female_removed_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:1=thinking,(<i>Wow. She seems so normal compared to most of the others here.</i>)
6-female_removed_accessory,target:hermione,targetStage:4=calm,You have some weird priorities, Hermione.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:5=surprised,Our hair is so similar when you have it like that. Are you ripping off my style?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:winter,targetStage:2=teasing,I think you're being too confident. Remember, no matter what rank you have, it means nothing to the divine.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:rinkah=teasing,After the game, ladies. There's still stripping to do!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:9=tranquil,The reasons don't matter that much. All that matters is that it's happened.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:1=calm,You're awfully chipper for a vampire... and someone about to lose all her clothes.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:joey=tranquil,Interesting how you don't deny it, Kyu.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:3=calm,No, please, do go on.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:1=calm,I'll let it slide. It's not like you have any authority here anyways.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:3=teasing,No, couldn't be. You're far too generous to be one.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:rinkah=thinking,(I still have no evidence that goblins aren't just an elaborate hoax created by the humans.)
6-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:dont_judge_me_too_hardly=thinking,It's a goddess's job to remain impartial to things like this.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:firstNude2=angry,That's right. This is her true form. And someone <i>I</i> may have to fight... if it comes to it.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:6=thinking,It's a mystery to me why you chose to lose your bra <i>before</i> your glasses...
6-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:videogametriviatime,alsoPlaying:meia=tranquil,Would you perhaps like my help, Chiaki? I know many, many video game facts.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1=calm,Regardless, it's a sensible first choice.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:luck_syega=annoyed,Doesn't sound like any magic I've ever known...
6-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=tranquil,So you <i>are</i> a fan? How surreal.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2=glad,Yeah, I'd say you were a bit too rough with your stripping.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=calm,I'd love to hear your thoughts on it. Come see me after the game.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:need_shoes_back=angry,But seriously? <i>Bright red</i>? What were they thinking?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=annoyed,We'll see. Actually, can you even see the cards?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:2=tranquil,<i>Finally</i> someone who gets it!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:tada=awkward,You... may need glasses.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=worried,I have no words.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4=teasing,Not bad. You're made of surprisingly sturdy stuff!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:alice=teasing,Don't have a lot? Good to know.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=surprised,...You know, your personality is actually pretty fitting for someone who's part cat.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:Fast1=worried,I think you're missing the point. You want to <i>keep</i> your clothes. And, you know, <i>not</i> blow them up.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:lux,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,I think you and Pit have a lot in common, Lux.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:dizzy=glad,Sure enough. You should sit down for a bit.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:6=angry,That's right. This is her true form. And someone <i>I</i> may have to fight... if it comes to it.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:2=horny,That sounds fun, too.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:aella=glad,So it did. Probably for the best.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=calm,You talk a big game, but in my experience, that's all it is.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:uravity=teasing,Who do you like to play as? I'll be sure to give them an extra-special pounding next time I face them.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=thinking,This is a bit different from sparring, but I see the point.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,Don't encourage him. Please.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:2=horny,Well, clearly it wasn't helpful to you.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:kyoko=glad,Whoever had gloves, really.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=annoyed,You know, a drink might do you good. Slow down your heart rate and whatnot.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2=teasing,You know I'm a goddess, right? Trying to shoot me with one of those is the equivalent of trying to break through a tank with a plastic fork.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:winter,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=teasing,Is that a hint of smugness I sense? Even for someone named Winter, that's cold.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1=calm,That's fine. One ribbon won't break the outfit, right?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:winter,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=calm,This'll probably be easier if you let the girl think for herself, Winter. You can complain <i>after</i> she's lost completely.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=annoyed,Why does <i>everyone</i> say that?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2=glad,And you're all the better for it.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,You've got an active imagination, Pit. She's from the Fire Tribe, not a tribe made of fire.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:4=thinking,Wait, I'm pretty sure that bag would've had to come off anyway for you to get totally naked...
6-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1=tranquil,You have good taste, Jenetta. Don't listen to your sister.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,totalRounds:0=annoyed,Calling in in early? Go ahead. We'll find someone more suitable to the table.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zoey,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=teasing,It's fine, Zoey. Take your time, I'll just get them out the old-fashioned way.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:mahiru=calm,Why are you apologizing? They're just gloves.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:1=calm,Must be a relief to remove it, yes?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=awkward,Those are some seriously deep burns... are you sure you'll be okay?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:sayori,alsoPlayingStage:0-7,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:filter-fancy=tranquil,As does the higher-ups.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:0=glad,There's a lot of ghosts in the multiverse, Hermione. You of all people should know that.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=glad,You're staring at one right now.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:natsuki,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=teasing,She's just pretending to make it seem like she wasn't totally eyeing you.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:lyn=teasing,Speaking of, when are you getting into Heroes, Rinkah? Hm?
6-female_removed_accessory,filter:silent=annoyed,It's a lot harder to make conversation with a mute than I expected.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:kira=annoyed,Your comments are unneccessary, Kira.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zizou=teasing,<i>This</i> girl's your rival? Talk about a low standard, Zizou.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jura=calm,A woman who loves muscles? What, is she the type who'd love to be crushed by a woman's thighs?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:2=glad,You'll get holes in your stockings if you go around like that!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:0-6,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:Cross=awkward,Let's avoid the personal jabs, okay ladies? We're here to unwind.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:aimee=annoyed,(People will just get inflicted with bullet wounds instead.)


#naked
-3-male_removing_accessory=thinking,You know, in other worlds they blind unworthy men who see us gods nude.
-3-male_removing_accessory=awkward,Well this is just all-around awful.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=teasing,Aw, poor little Pit. Want me to come help with that belt?
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:human,targetStage:0=annoyed,You'd think ~player~ would try harder to make a good first impression, but I guess not.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:futaba=thinking,I wonder if I have a persona. Or maybe as a goddess, I <i>am</i> the persona?
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,An "anti-grav aug" <i>I</i> have to control, thank you very much.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rinkah=surprised,Oh? Does it come with a low-health sound too?
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:2=calm,Should've just taken 'em off with the shoes. As a courtesy, you know?
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:rinkah=thinking,I still fail to see how a blindfold could be useful. But I'm not from the future or wherever you're from.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:futaba=calm,I can see why you'd think that 9S. I don't blame you for wanting to stay in another round.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3=tranquil,Ah, yes. An honorable base, keeping that plaid wall of yours from collapsing.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0=glad,You normally love my advice, Pit. What happened? Too embarrassing?
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:saki=thinking,I've seen a good few robots in my day, but never an android.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:2,totalRounds:0-3,count-aggressive:1=annoyed,At this rate, I'll be sub-zero.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3,totalRounds:0-3,count-aggressive:1=worried,Yeesh, four rounds in a row? Who's puppy did <i>you</i> kick?
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=teasing,Good! Now you can lose all the more efficiently.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=glad,Don't worry. I'm sure this is plenty thrilling for some of us. Or at least ~player~.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=glad,I doubt that'd take much. Space pirates probably have messed up vision.
-3-male_removed_accessory=annoyed,You're lucky the match isn't over.
-3-male_removed_accessory=angry,Count your blessings, ~name~. They won't last forever.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:4=horny,Hopefully, the collapse comes <i>soon</i>.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=surprised,Oh, so it's like looking through a TV?
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,Oh Pit. Making rivals in a place like this?
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2=glad,You know it!
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:rinkah=teasing,Moisture tracking? I didn't know your maker was so naughty, 9s.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,Are you <i>complaining</i>, Pit?
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3=glad,You'd sound more convincing if it wasn't for the fact this is a standing game.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba=worried,A better name might do you good. I keep associating you with Mr. Game and Watch...
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=teasing,A tactical visor disguised as a blindfold. Clever.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=teasing,Uh-huh. Maybe stick to your actual guns.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:rinkah=glad,Looks like you got caught in the act, Rinkah.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1=tranquil,Surprisingly confident. Don't worry, that confidence will all go away in just a few more hands.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:futaba=horny,Really? I could see you two getting <i>much</i> more intimate after tonight...
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba,count-pit:1=glad,The designation works well. I prefer it, too.
-3-female_removing_accessory=loss,Hey, not cool man.
-3-female_removing_accessory=worried,Rude.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0=tranquil,Quite the renaissance girl, aren't you?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=thinking,Chelsea, Chelsea... doesn't ring a bell. Must be famous in just your world.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:0=worried,Doesn't it get sweat and whatnot trapped underneath it?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=calm,You know, I knew someone else who used yo-yos as their weapon of choice. Although Ness always looked more like a bee than a ladybug...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:9=awkward,The fact there are two of her says it all, really.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:winter,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:buffy,alsoPlayingStage:4-5=calm,Married to the job, I think is the right term? How boring.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:won=worried,I knew it wouldn't be this easy.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=glad,That's fine. I figured no shoes would sort of be your default state, anyway.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=thinking,So as the Ultimate Gamer, I'm sure you've played my game, right?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1=calm,Shoes in this game <i>are</i> as annoying as little bugs.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:sei=glad,I'm surprised you even had somewhere to store an ID.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0=glad,And as cute as a ribbon, too. <i>That</i> ribbon, specifically.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=annoyed,Oh yes, the collar. Attached to your invisible shirt, I assume?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:0=calm,Brave of you. Not very smart, but brave.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=tranquil,Don't worry, spirits like you and I still appear on film. Everyone will see your nudity in due time.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=teasing,What frilly shoes! But then again, your whole outfit is... immodest.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:sarcasm=worried,I was afraid it'd come to this.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:saki=thinking,(Was it really? Saki looks like she has something on her mind.)
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zizou,count-elizabeth:1=awkward,Are you sure about that?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=surprised,A human with the Power of Flight? Amazing!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1=thinking,But do they still squeak?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1=worried,What I want to know is what school gives out shoes that gaudy.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=annoyed,Seeing as that's a threat and at least one of us here is mortal, I'll let it count.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2=thinking,Speaking of, why is it I'm sensing two souls inhabiting your body?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:lux,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:pit=calm,I don't play favorites here.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:3=thinking,I imagine retying that must be a pain, day after day.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:zoey,targetStage:4=annoyed,It's rude to have lead us on like that.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:1=thinking,Has <i>anything</i> on a heroes belt been helpful to anyone? Ever?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:pit=tranquil,Look Pit! Even <i>humans</i> learned to fly before you!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:10=glad,Those hands are doing better than any flimsy old ribbon could.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:0=teasing,You don't need padded gloves. Especially considering there may be an ace or two hidden up it.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:2=surprised,Six toes? Is that normal?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:0=calm,Human armor always amuses me. Us gods rarely need it.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:harley=thinking,Your both white clowns to me. At least, you're both wearing white make-up.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1=calm,Seems it's about that time. Of course, I won't stop you if you decide to throw a curveball.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette=thinking,(Not focused enough to escape a loss, though.)
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:amalia,targetStage:0=thinking,Just a little pouch? How... pedestrian.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=thinking,Hmm. Must be tough finding socks when you're a cold-hearted killer.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=worried,There are no video games on other planets, I'm afraid, Chiaki.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rainbow_mika,alsoPlayingStage:5=teasing,You, Kyu? You're scrawny! Pit or even Viridi could outwrestle you.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:aella=thinking,Looking at this girl, I doubt she's ever "gotten lucky".
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0=thinking,(<i>I wish all souls could wield weapons. Maybe then the Underworld threat wouldn't have gotten so big...</i>)
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:orendi,targetStage:0=surprised,What an interesting individual you are! Like the child of man and monster!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=tranquil,I'm not sure either. Although I'm sure Pit would say a hot dog.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2=calm,I'm of firm belief that holsters are unneccesary. You want to use a weapon, wield it at all times.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:1-10=surprised,Calling her out seems a bit silly, don't you think?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0=thinking,You know, this is still a public area. You don't have to take off both.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:1=worried,Bit presumptuous, aren't you?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:firstNude=worried,I was afraid it'd come to this.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=calm,Well! Let's see where this takes us.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:zizou=teasing,Take it from a goddess: you don't need powers to see that.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:mia,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=worried,Ghosts have all kinds of tricks up their incorporeal sleeves, huh?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=calm,I take it you play around fire a lot? Very few burns. Impressive.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:1=tranquil,Ghost pirate zombies are always fun.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:9s=glad,Rinkah looks about as much as a Yorha as I do.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:shaggy,alsoPlayingStage:0=surprised,That doesn't sound like an expression you should know. Who taught it to you?
-3-female_removing_accessory,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:pico_day=thinking,Odd. I've never heard of any "Pico Day."
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:0,targetTimeInStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=glad,It's not like she's lying to her self. She's just not in a hurry to admit it.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=glad,What an awkward place to meet up at.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:misato=tranquil,Like mine! Who knew humans had that variety as well?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:pit=surprised,Are you sure? Magnus can be a real jerk about it.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=calm,Now you're getting the hang of it!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=teasing,I'd love to see how you two could make a pair of boots awkward.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:0=glad,Has Monkey Island fallen on hard times?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:sei=glad,You really need it. Especially against Sei here.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=tranquil,Ah, so that's a belt? Very cool. Very, very cool.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette=glad,This is fine.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rinkah=awkward,(Wish I knw there were so many half-rabbits during the revolt...)
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=glad,Maybe later, you two?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:5=worried,I was afraid it'd come to this.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2=tranquil,I like the way you think, Tojiko!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:chiaki=thinking,Do you know what a video game is, Jenetta?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:winter,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:weiss=horny,Hiding secrets, are we, Winter? Awfully distant of you.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:xander,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=thinking,It came off as passive-aggressive, Spooky.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:2=glad,Oh, a circlet! Are you sure you're not the real deal?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:aimee=thinking,(I wonder who'd win in a knife fight between these two.)
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1=thinking,I didn't know the people of Hyrule used sandals.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zizou=teasing,All the hormones must have gone to her head.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3=glad,Talk about your anachronisms...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:0=tranquil,I see you like your jewelery as well.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:chica=calm,Sure, sure. I imagine a ghost would have all the time in the world.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=glad,Better stand up quickly before she decks you.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:8=calm,A ribbon would just accentuate her nudity. She's better off without.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=awkward,Complaining about stripping smaller things. I wonder how you ended up like this?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=thinking,You might want to hurry it up, then. That'll just get in the way of a real fight.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:1,totalRounds:10-99,totalAlive:5=glad,I suppose we can let it slip. Only fair, seeing how you're not wearing pants for whatever reason.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0,totalRounds:0=glad,Maybe Go Fish is more your speed?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:SpookyWinning1=loss,You're winning, but you still use the knife as a buffer?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:pit=calm,Just sit back and watch, Pit. It'll do you good.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=worried,Oh. And just when it looked like your arms healed up.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rainbow_mika,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=teasing,You, Kyu? You're scrawny! Pit or even Viridi could outwrestle you.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:uravity=glad,I don't think so. Trust me, I know the guy. Or hand, rather.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:winter,targetStage:1=glad,Ah, right. You're fond of gloves, aren't you?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elaine,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=glad,Not a very convincing facade.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=awkward,You mean to tell me even the <i>staff</i> doesn't want you undressing so much?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=worried,Wait, that was all around your head... if you have a brain, it probably took a hit or two there.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jasmine=calm,How modest. I like that.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:marceline,alsoPlayingStage:9=thinking,A knife really has no place here. Unless you intended to stab the cards or something.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:zizou=horny,Really now? I'm going to enjoy this.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=surprised,Is that <i>fire</i>? Why...?
-3-female_removed_accessory=annoyed,I feel like you're mocking me. <i>I</i> should be the one who mocks here!
-3-female_removed_accessory=annoyed,Can't believe I just have to stand here and take it.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:zizou=tranquil,Just like a certain other petite goddess I know!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jin=tranquil,What you're saying is he has a shot. Congrats, Jin! That's probably the best you've ever gotten.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:4=tranquil,I suppose so. Next hand will hopefully be more eventful.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:hermione,targetStage:4=calm,You have some weird priorities, Hermione.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:2=teasing,Oh? What would you know about standing on clouds?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1=tranquil,You have good taste, Jenetta. Don't listen to your sister.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=calm,I'd love to hear your thoughts on it. Come see me after the game.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:3=teasing,No, couldn't be. You're far too generous to be one.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:aella=glad,Doesn't seem too hard. Who makes bulky shoes for tiny feet?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2=glad,Yeah, I'd say you were a bit too rough with your stripping.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:navi=calm,You know, I like this form a lot more. I bet most others do too.
-3-female_removed_accessory,filter:silent=annoyed,It's a lot harder to make conversation with a mute than I expected.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:aella=glad,So it did. Probably for the best.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=tranquil,So you <i>are</i> a fan? How surreal.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1=tranquil,Right back into it, huh? Great!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:3=calm,No, please, do go on.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:2=thinking,A bit too basic for my tastes, I'm afraid.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:uravity=teasing,Who do you like to play as? I'll be sure to give them an extra-special pounding next time I face them.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:2=glad,You'll get holes in your stockings if you go around like that!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:marinette=teasing,Another gaming enthusiast? Then I assume you know, say, the Smash tournaments?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:1=calm,Must be a relief to remove it, yes?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:mahiru=horny,Wouldn't exactly be "Ultimate" if they weren't.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=surprised,...You know, your personality is actually pretty fitting for someone who's part cat.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1=calm,That's fine. One ribbon won't break the outfit, right?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:1=tranquil,Of course. I'd rather deal with someone my own size, anyway.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:6=angry,That's right. This is her true form. And someone <i>I</i> may have to fight... if it comes to it.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zizou=teasing,<i>This</i> girl's your rival? Talk about a low standard, Zizou.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:1=calm,I'd say Winslow has a much better deal here than you and Guybrush.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:aimee=annoyed,(People will just get inflicted with bullet wounds instead.)
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1=worried,Unfortunate. Seems you're just another human for tonight.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=thinking,You know, I can feel everyone's arousal level from that reveal. Yours is the highest, Kyu. Care to explain?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4=teasing,Not bad. You're made of surprisingly sturdy stuff!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:6=thinking,It's a mystery to me why you chose to lose your bra <i>before</i> your glasses...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=annoyed,You know, a drink might do you good. Slow down your heart rate and whatnot.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:2=horny,Well, clearly it wasn't helpful to you.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=glad,Although, somehow it looks like your stockings made it out completely fine.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=calm,You talk a big game, but in my experience, that's all it is.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2=teasing,You know I'm a goddess, right? Trying to shoot me with one of those is the equivalent of trying to break through a tank with a plastic fork.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:1=thinking,(<i>Wow. She seems so normal compared to most of the others here.</i>)
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=teasing,A girl like you? Dancing burlesque? I'd <i>love</i>to see that.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:harley=annoyed,Are you just making all this up?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:2=tranquil,A helmet like that didn't really suit you anyway. You look <i>somewhat</i> normal with it off.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2=glad,And you're all the better for it.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:chiaki=teasing,As the authority on many games represented at the Inventory, I know that Chiaki's right. Perhaps I can give you some proof at another time?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:2=teasing,If you were <i>really</i> nice, you'd do even more for us.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:2=tranquil,<i>Finally</i> someone who gets it!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=annoyed,We'll see. Actually, can you even see the cards?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=awkward,Those are some seriously deep burns... are you sure you'll be okay?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:amalia,targetStage:1=glad,Are you willing to prove that?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=calm,I suppose this was just the first act in your little game. Moving on.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1=calm,Sorry, I can't really take anyone with beady black eyes seriously.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=worried,I have no words.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:4=teasing,Says you. This is a card game, you know.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3=thinking,I wish my servants could be this assertive at times...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:2=teasing,Projecting now, are we?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:2=horny,That sounds fun, too.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:1=calm,I'll let it slide. It's not like you have any authority here anyways.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,Don't encourage him. Please.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:dizzy=glad,Sure enough. You should sit down for a bit.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=tranquil,Those of us in Skyworld prefer the cold. Interesting contrast, I think.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=thinking,This is a bit different from sparring, but I see the point.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:Fast1=worried,I think you're missing the point. You want to <i>keep</i> your clothes. And, you know, <i>not</i> blow them up.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,You've got an active imagination, Pit. She's from the Fire Tribe, not a tribe made of fire.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=annoyed,Why does <i>everyone</i> say that?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:alice=teasing,Don't have a lot? Good to know.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:I_had_to_lose_something=glad,It's amazing how one silly ribbon can make you look so formal.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,Controlling angels is surprisingly easy. Not surprised you've done it, Spooky.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:tada=awkward,You... may need glasses.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,totalRounds:0=annoyed,Calling in in early? Go ahead. We'll find someone more suitable to the table.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:9=tranquil,The reasons don't matter that much. All that matters is that it's happened.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:something_off=calm,...What are you looking at me for? I didn't make the rules.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:lux,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,I think you and Pit have a lot in common, Lux.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:dont_judge_me_too_hardly=thinking,It's a goddess's job to remain impartial to things like this.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1=calm,Regardless, it's a sensible first choice.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:videogametriviatime,alsoPlaying:meia=tranquil,Would you perhaps like my help, Chiaki? I know many, many video game facts.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:what_to_take_off=glad,Who else's would you use? ~player~'s?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:I_guess_I_can_take_off=calm,Expecting? No. Hoping? You bet.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:dress_off_first=calm,Uh, Sola? Bit late to the punchline.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=annoyed,Apologizing? Don't. I'd rather this be a fair fight.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:luck_syega=annoyed,Doesn't sound like any magic I've ever known...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingStage:4-5=glad,I don't see the correlation of why the Flame Tribe is any different.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:9s=tranquil,Not many secrets among the Flame Tribe, I see.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:here_i_go=teasing,I dunno, you sure you don't want to take off anything else? It's perfectly legal.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:install_skill=calm,No one at this table, clearly.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:live_without_shoes=teasing,And that's how you lose your tights.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:hope_you_all_forgive_me=glad,Forgiven. <i>For now.</i>
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jura,count-meia:1=calm,Seems we've got a bit of a split between beauties and muscle-girls. And ~player~, I guess.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:need_shoes_back=angry,But seriously? <i>Bright red</i>? What were they thinking?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:0-6,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:Cross=awkward,Let's avoid the personal jabs, okay ladies? We're here to unwind.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:pick_something_small=teasing,A brilliant deduction, Sola.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=thinking,Well, this is a good alternative. And Z-moves are overrated, anyway.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zizou,count-elizabeth:1=worried,She didn't say anything. Are you a mind reader, perhaps?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:firstNude2=angry,That's right. This is her true form. And someone <i>I</i> may have to fight... if it comes to it.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zoey,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=teasing,It's fine, Zoey. Take your time, I'll just get them out the old-fashioned way.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:rinkah=thinking,(I still have no evidence that goblins aren't just an elaborate hoax created by the humans.)
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:winter,targetStage:2=teasing,I think you're being too confident. Remember, no matter what rank you have, it means nothing to the divine.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:rinkah=teasing,After the game, ladies. There's still stripping to do!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:4=teasing,<i>Maybe you'd be in better shape if you didn't have such a foul mouth.</i>
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:spare_my_ribbon=teasing,You're not really sparing it. More like sacrificing it.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:kira=annoyed,Your comments are unneccessary, Kira.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:natsuki,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=teasing,She's just pretending to make it seem like she wasn't totally eyeing you.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:lyn=teasing,Speaking of, when are you getting into Heroes, Rinkah? Hm?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:kyoko=glad,Whoever had gloves, really.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:5=surprised,Our hair is so similar when you have it like that. Are you ripping off my style?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:winter,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=teasing,Is that a hint of smugness I sense? Even for someone named Winter, that's cold.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:3=teasing,Trust me, Rinkah. I <i>never</i> let up once I've started.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:1=calm,You're awfully chipper for a vampire... and someone about to lose all her clothes.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:sarcasm2=angry,Don't just play this off! ~player~, this is her true form. And someone <i>I</i> may have to fight... if it comes to it.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:4=thinking,Wait, I'm pretty sure that bag would've had to come off anyway for you to get totally naked...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:2=calm,Or is this just a Labrynnan thing?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:joey=tranquil,Interesting how you don't deny it, Kyu.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:sayori,alsoPlayingStage:0-7,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:filter-fancy=tranquil,As does the higher-ups.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jura=calm,A woman who loves muscles? What, is she the type who'd love to be crushed by a woman's thighs?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:mahiru=calm,Why are you apologizing? They're just gloves.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:0=glad,There's a lot of ghosts in the multiverse, Hermione. You of all people should know that.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=glad,You're staring at one right now.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:winter,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=calm,This'll probably be easier if you let the girl think for herself, Winter. You can complain <i>after</i> she's lost completely.

-2-male_removing_accessory=angry,Think <i>really</i> hard if that's what you want your choice to be.
-2-male_removing_accessory=surprised,R-really? <i>That's</i> what you chose?
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0=glad,You normally love my advice, Pit. What happened? Too embarrassing?
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3=tranquil,Ah, yes. An honorable base, keeping that plaid wall of yours from collapsing.
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3,totalRounds:0-3,count-aggressive:1=worried,Yeesh, four rounds in a row? Who's puppy did <i>you</i> kick?
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:2=calm,Should've just taken 'em off with the shoes. As a courtesy, you know?
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=teasing,Aw, poor little Pit. Want me to come help with that belt?
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:2,totalRounds:0-3,count-aggressive:1=annoyed,At this rate, I'll be sub-zero.
-2-male_removed_accessory=annoyed,I'm doing you a service here! Least you could do is give me material to work with...
-2-male_removed_accessory=horny,I'm impressed at your self-restraint.
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=teasing,Uh-huh. Maybe stick to your actual guns.
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:4=horny,Hopefully, the collapse comes <i>soon</i>.
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2=glad,You know it!
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3=glad,You'd sound more convincing if it wasn't for the fact this is a standing game.
-2-female_removing_accessory=glad,Must be nice, having your ~clothing~ to just dispose of.
-2-female_removing_accessory=annoyed,Way to draw their attention away, ~name~.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=glad,Better stand up quickly before she decks you.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=calm,Now you're getting the hang of it!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:0=glad,Has Monkey Island fallen on hard times?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:1=tranquil,Ghost pirate zombies are always fun.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:sei=glad,You really need it. Especially against Sei here.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:pit=surprised,Are you sure? Magnus can be a real jerk about it.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=thinking,You might want to hurry it up, then. That'll just get in the way of a real fight.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:mia,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=worried,Ghosts have all kinds of tricks up their incorporeal sleeves, huh?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=awkward,Complaining about stripping smaller things. I wonder how you ended up like this?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=tranquil,Ah, so that's a belt? Very cool. Very, very cool.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=glad,What an awkward place to meet up at.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:marceline,alsoPlayingStage:9=thinking,A knife really has no place here. Unless you intended to stab the cards or something.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=calm,Well! Let's see where this takes us.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=calm,I take it you play around fire a lot? Very few burns. Impressive.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:chiaki=thinking,Do you know what a video game is, Jenetta?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:chica=calm,Sure, sure. I imagine a ghost would have all the time in the world.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=tranquil,Don't worry, spirits like you and I still appear on film. Everyone will see your nudity in due time.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=tranquil,I'm not sure either. Although I'm sure Pit would say a hot dog.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:aella=thinking,Looking at this girl, I doubt she's ever "gotten lucky".
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:harley=thinking,Your both white clowns to me. At least, you're both wearing white make-up.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette=thinking,(Not focused enough to escape a loss, though.)
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zizou,count-elizabeth:1=awkward,Are you sure about that?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:saki=thinking,(Was it really? Saki looks like she has something on her mind.)
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:uravity=glad,I don't think so. Trust me, I know the guy. Or hand, rather.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:zizou=horny,Really now? I'm going to enjoy this.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:misato=tranquil,Like mine! Who knew humans had that variety as well?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:shaggy,alsoPlayingStage:0=surprised,That doesn't sound like an expression you should know. Who taught it to you?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:0,targetTimeInStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=glad,It's not like she's lying to her self. She's just not in a hurry to admit it.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:zizou=teasing,Take it from a goddess: you don't need powers to see that.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0=thinking,That knife's a little too big for you, you know.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3=glad,Talk about your anachronisms...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2=tranquil,I like the way you think, Tojiko!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zizou=teasing,All the hormones must have gone to her head.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:1=worried,Bit presumptuous, aren't you?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rinkah=awkward,(Wish I knw there were so many half-rabbits during the revolt...)
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:xander,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=thinking,It came off as passive-aggressive, Spooky.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:5=worried,I was afraid it'd come to this.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=glad,Maybe later, you two?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:2=glad,Oh, a circlet! Are you sure you're not the real deal?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:winter,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:weiss=horny,Hiding secrets, are we, Winter? Awfully distant of you.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1=thinking,I didn't know the people of Hyrule used sandals.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:aimee=thinking,(I wonder who'd win in a knife fight between these two.)
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:0=tranquil,I see you like your jewelery as well.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette=glad,This is fine.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=teasing,I'd love to see how you two could make a pair of boots awkward.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:9s=glad,Rinkah looks about as much as a Yorha as I do.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=thinking,Chelsea, Chelsea... doesn't ring a bell. Must be famous in just your world.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:sei=glad,I'm surprised you even had somewhere to store an ID.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=worried,Wait, that was all around your head... if you have a brain, it probably took a hit or two there.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0,totalRounds:0=glad,Maybe Go Fish is more your speed?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=worried,Oh. And just when it looked like your arms healed up.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:3=thinking,I imagine retying that must be a pain, day after day.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:SpookyWinning1=loss,You're winning, but you still use the knife as a buffer?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=surprised,Is that <i>fire</i>? Why...?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:10=glad,Those hands are doing better than any flimsy old ribbon could.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:0=worried,Doesn't it get sweat and whatnot trapped underneath it?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:firstNude=worried,I was afraid it'd come to this.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1=calm,Shoes in this game <i>are</i> as annoying as little bugs.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:9=awkward,The fact there are two of her says it all, really.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rainbow_mika,alsoPlayingStage:5=teasing,You, Kyu? You're scrawny! Pit or even Viridi could outwrestle you.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:1-10=surprised,Calling her out seems a bit silly, don't you think?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:sarcasm=worried,I was afraid it'd come to this.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:0=calm,Brave of you. Not very smart, but brave.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:winter,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:buffy,alsoPlayingStage:4-5=calm,Married to the job, I think is the right term? How boring.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:won=worried,I knew it wouldn't be this easy.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=annoyed,Seeing as that's a threat and at least one of us here is mortal, I'll let it count.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0=glad,And as cute as a ribbon, too. <i>That</i> ribbon, specifically.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1=worried,What I want to know is what school gives out shoes that gaudy.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2=calm,I'm of firm belief that holsters are unneccesary. You want to use a weapon, wield it at all times.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:1=thinking,Has <i>anything</i> on a heroes belt been helpful to anyone? Ever?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:0=teasing,You don't need padded gloves. Especially considering there may be an ace or two hidden up it.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=worried,There are no video games on other planets, I'm afraid, Chiaki.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elaine,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=glad,Not a very convincing facade.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0=thinking,You know, this is still a public area. You don't have to take off both.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=thinking,Hmm. Must be tough finding socks when you're a cold-hearted killer.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=glad,That's fine. I figured no shoes would sort of be your default state, anyway.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:1,totalRounds:10-99,totalAlive:5=glad,I suppose we can let it slip. Only fair, seeing how you're not wearing pants for whatever reason.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:8=calm,A ribbon would just accentuate her nudity. She's better off without.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jasmine=calm,How modest. I like that.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0=tranquil,Quite the renaissance girl, aren't you?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:pit=calm,Just sit back and watch, Pit. It'll do you good.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=annoyed,Oh yes, the collar. Attached to your invisible shirt, I assume?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:amalia,targetStage:0=thinking,Just a little pouch? How... pedestrian.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=awkward,You mean to tell me even the <i>staff</i> doesn't want you undressing so much?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:winter,targetStage:1=glad,Ah, right. You're fond of gloves, aren't you?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1=thinking,But do they still squeak?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=teasing,What frilly shoes! But then again, your whole outfit is... immodest.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rainbow_mika,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=teasing,You, Kyu? You're scrawny! Pit or even Viridi could outwrestle you.
-2-female_removed_accessory=angry,The more hands you play, the more I might get to see something worthwhile, so play!
-2-female_removed_accessory=masturbate_a,Yeah, just keep playing...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2=glad,And you're all the better for it.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jura=calm,A woman who loves muscles? What, is she the type who'd love to be crushed by a woman's thighs?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:mahiru=calm,Why are you apologizing? They're just gloves.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:0-6,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:Cross=awkward,Let's avoid the personal jabs, okay ladies? We're here to unwind.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:2=horny,Well, clearly it wasn't helpful to you.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,You've got an active imagination, Pit. She's from the Fire Tribe, not a tribe made of fire.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:0=glad,There's a lot of ghosts in the multiverse, Hermione. You of all people should know that.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:2=glad,You'll get holes in your stockings if you go around like that!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=teasing,A girl like you? Dancing burlesque? I'd <i>love</i>to see that.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zizou=teasing,<i>This</i> girl's your rival? Talk about a low standard, Zizou.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,Don't encourage him. Please.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:4=thinking,Wait, I'm pretty sure that bag would've had to come off anyway for you to get totally naked...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4=teasing,Not bad. You're made of surprisingly sturdy stuff!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:dizzy=glad,Sure enough. You should sit down for a bit.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:Fast1=worried,I think you're missing the point. You want to <i>keep</i> your clothes. And, you know, <i>not</i> blow them up.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=awkward,Those are some seriously deep burns... are you sure you'll be okay?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=thinking,This is a bit different from sparring, but I see the point.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zoey,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=teasing,It's fine, Zoey. Take your time, I'll just get them out the old-fashioned way.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:2=horny,That sounds fun, too.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:1=calm,I'd say Winslow has a much better deal here than you and Guybrush.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:aimee=annoyed,(People will just get inflicted with bullet wounds instead.)
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:kyoko=glad,Whoever had gloves, really.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:aella=glad,So it did. Probably for the best.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=annoyed,You know, a drink might do you good. Slow down your heart rate and whatnot.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:winter,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=calm,This'll probably be easier if you let the girl think for herself, Winter. You can complain <i>after</i> she's lost completely.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:kira=annoyed,Your comments are unneccessary, Kira.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jin=tranquil,What you're saying is he has a shot. Congrats, Jin! That's probably the best you've ever gotten.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:rinkah=teasing,After the game, ladies. There's still stripping to do!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:mahiru=horny,Wouldn't exactly be "Ultimate" if they weren't.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:firstNude2=angry,That's right. This is her true form. And someone <i>I</i> may have to fight... if it comes to it.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:natsuki,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=teasing,She's just pretending to make it seem like she wasn't totally eyeing you.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=glad,You're staring at one right now.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:3=teasing,No, couldn't be. You're far too generous to be one.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:winter,targetStage:2=teasing,I think you're being too confident. Remember, no matter what rank you have, it means nothing to the divine.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:lyn=teasing,Speaking of, when are you getting into Heroes, Rinkah? Hm?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:sarcasm2=angry,Don't just play this off! ~player~, this is her true form. And someone <i>I</i> may have to fight... if it comes to it.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:uravity=teasing,Who do you like to play as? I'll be sure to give them an extra-special pounding next time I face them.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1=tranquil,You have good taste, Jenetta. Don't listen to your sister.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=calm,You talk a big game, but in my experience, that's all it is.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:winter,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=teasing,Is that a hint of smugness I sense? Even for someone named Winter, that's cold.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:sayori,alsoPlayingStage:0-7,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:filter-fancy=tranquil,As does the higher-ups.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:2=calm,Or is this just a Labrynnan thing?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2=teasing,You know I'm a goddess, right? Trying to shoot me with one of those is the equivalent of trying to break through a tank with a plastic fork.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:alice=teasing,Don't have a lot? Good to know.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1=calm,That's fine. One ribbon won't break the outfit, right?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:zizou=tranquil,Just like a certain other petite goddess I know!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1=calm,Sorry, I can't really take anyone with beady black eyes seriously.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:1=tranquil,Of course. I'd rather deal with someone my own size, anyway.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:hope_you_all_forgive_me=glad,Forgiven. <i>For now.</i>
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:4=teasing,Says you. This is a card game, you know.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:install_skill=calm,No one at this table, clearly.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=tranquil,Those of us in Skyworld prefer the cold. Interesting contrast, I think.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=calm,I suppose this was just the first act in your little game. Moving on.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=thinking,Well, this is a good alternative. And Z-moves are overrated, anyway.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:what_to_take_off=glad,Who else's would you use? ~player~'s?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:I_guess_I_can_take_off=calm,Expecting? No. Hoping? You bet.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:harley=annoyed,Are you just making all this up?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingStage:4-5=glad,I don't see the correlation of why the Flame Tribe is any different.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:4=angry,I don't get involved with small crimes like these. That's Centurion work.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:2=teasing,If you were <i>really</i> nice, you'd do even more for us.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:I_had_to_lose_something=glad,It's amazing how one silly ribbon can make you look so formal.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:joey=tranquil,Interesting how you don't deny it, Kyu.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:amalia,targetStage:1=glad,Are you willing to prove that?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=glad,Although, somehow it looks like your stockings made it out completely fine.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1=worried,Unfortunate. Seems you're just another human for tonight.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:pick_something_small=teasing,A brilliant deduction, Sola.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:3=teasing,Trust me, Rinkah. I <i>never</i> let up once I've started.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:spare_my_ribbon=teasing,You're not really sparing it. More like sacrificing it.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,Controlling angels is surprisingly easy. Not surprised you've done it, Spooky.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=thinking,You know, I can feel everyone's arousal level from that reveal. Yours is the highest, Kyu. Care to explain?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:2=teasing,Projecting now, are we?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zizou,count-elizabeth:1=worried,She didn't say anything. Are you a mind reader, perhaps?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:aella=glad,Doesn't seem too hard. Who makes bulky shoes for tiny feet?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:chiaki=teasing,As the authority on many games represented at the Inventory, I know that Chiaki's right. Perhaps I can give you some proof at another time?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:9s=tranquil,Not many secrets among the Flame Tribe, I see.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jura,count-meia:1=calm,Seems we've got a bit of a split between beauties and muscle-girls. And ~player~, I guess.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:live_without_shoes=teasing,And that's how you lose your tights.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=annoyed,Why does <i>everyone</i> say that?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:6=angry,That's right. This is her true form. And someone <i>I</i> may have to fight... if it comes to it.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:tada=awkward,You... may need glasses.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=annoyed,We'll see. Actually, can you even see the cards?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3=thinking,I wish my servants could be this assertive at times...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:marinette=teasing,Another gaming enthusiast? Then I assume you know, say, the Smash tournaments?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,totalRounds:0=annoyed,Calling in in early? Go ahead. We'll find someone more suitable to the table.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1=calm,Regardless, it's a sensible first choice.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:1=calm,Must be a relief to remove it, yes?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:videogametriviatime,alsoPlaying:meia=tranquil,Would you perhaps like my help, Chiaki? I know many, many video game facts.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:9=tranquil,The reasons don't matter that much. All that matters is that it's happened.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2=glad,Yeah, I'd say you were a bit too rough with your stripping.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:need_shoes_back=angry,But seriously? <i>Bright red</i>? What were they thinking?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:dont_judge_me_too_hardly=thinking,It's a goddess's job to remain impartial to things like this.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:something_off=calm,...What are you looking at me for? I didn't make the rules.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:here_i_go=teasing,I dunno, you sure you don't want to take off anything else? It's perfectly legal.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:4=tranquil,I suppose so. Next hand will hopefully be more eventful.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=tranquil,So you <i>are</i> a fan? How surreal.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:luck_syega=annoyed,Doesn't sound like any magic I've ever known...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:dress_off_first=calm,Uh, Sola? Bit late to the punchline.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=worried,I have no words.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:2=thinking,A bit too basic for my tastes, I'm afraid.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=annoyed,Apologizing? Don't. I'd rather this be a fair fight.


#finished
-1-male_removing_accessory=calm,As much as I hate you for that, know that I am way too turned on to care right now.
-1-male_removing_accessory=awkward,Shoot, wish you chose something better.
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:2,totalRounds:0-3,count-aggressive:1=annoyed,At this rate, I'll be sub-zero.
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3=tranquil,Ah, yes. An honorable base, keeping that plaid wall of yours from collapsing.
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0=glad,You normally love my advice, Pit. What happened? Too embarrassing?
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=teasing,Aw, poor little Pit. Want me to come help with that belt?
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:2=calm,Should've just taken 'em off with the shoes. As a courtesy, you know?
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3,totalRounds:0-3,count-aggressive:1=worried,Yeesh, four rounds in a row? Who's puppy did <i>you</i> kick?
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:human,targetStage:0=annoyed,You'd think ~player~ would try harder to make a good first impression, but I guess not.
-1-male_removed_accessory=tranquil,I'll just imagine that was your last piece instead!
-1-male_removed_accessory=glad,I'm counting on the rest of you to finish ~name~ off for me!
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:4=horny,Hopefully, the collapse comes <i>soon</i>.
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2=glad,You know it!
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=teasing,Uh-huh. Maybe stick to your actual guns.
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3=glad,You'd sound more convincing if it wasn't for the fact this is a standing game.
-1-female_removing_accessory=thinking,Maybe I would have cared a bit more if I was still in...
-1-female_removing_accessory=surprised,You still had something like that? I'm impressed.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:pit=tranquil,Look Pit! Even <i>humans</i> learned to fly before you!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1=worried,What I want to know is what school gives out shoes that gaudy.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2=calm,I'm of firm belief that holsters are unneccesary. You want to use a weapon, wield it at all times.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=thinking,Hmm. Must be tough finding socks when you're a cold-hearted killer.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=worried,There are no video games on other planets, I'm afraid, Chiaki.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:0=teasing,You don't need padded gloves. Especially considering there may be an ace or two hidden up it.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:1=thinking,Has <i>anything</i> on a heroes belt been helpful to anyone? Ever?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0=glad,And as cute as a ribbon, too. <i>That</i> ribbon, specifically.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:1-10=surprised,Calling her out seems a bit silly, don't you think?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:0=worried,Doesn't it get sweat and whatnot trapped underneath it?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:3=thinking,I imagine retying that must be a pain, day after day.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0=thinking,You know, this is still a public area. You don't have to take off both.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=annoyed,Seeing as that's a threat and at least one of us here is mortal, I'll let it count.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=glad,That's fine. I figured no shoes would sort of be your default state, anyway.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1=thinking,But do they still squeak?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0=tranquil,Quite the renaissance girl, aren't you?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=annoyed,Oh yes, the collar. Attached to your invisible shirt, I assume?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=teasing,What frilly shoes! But then again, your whole outfit is... immodest.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:8=calm,A ribbon would just accentuate her nudity. She's better off without.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:amalia,targetStage:0=thinking,Just a little pouch? How... pedestrian.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=thinking,So as the Ultimate Gamer, I'm sure you've played my game, right?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:9=awkward,The fact there are two of her says it all, really.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=surprised,A human with the Power of Flight? Amazing!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:1=worried,Bit presumptuous, aren't you?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=thinking,Chelsea, Chelsea... doesn't ring a bell. Must be famous in just your world.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:0=calm,Brave of you. Not very smart, but brave.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rainbow_mika,alsoPlayingStage:5=teasing,You, Kyu? You're scrawny! Pit or even Viridi could outwrestle you.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1=calm,Shoes in this game <i>are</i> as annoying as little bugs.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2=tranquil,I like the way you think, Tojiko!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=glad,Maybe later, you two?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3=glad,Talk about your anachronisms...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:0,targetTimeInStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=glad,It's not like she's lying to her self. She's just not in a hurry to admit it.
-1-female_removing_accessory,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:pico_day=thinking,Odd. I've never heard of any "Pico Day."
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:2=glad,Oh, a circlet! Are you sure you're not the real deal?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1=thinking,I didn't know the people of Hyrule used sandals.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:0=tranquil,I see you like your jewelery as well.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=tranquil,Ah, so that's a belt? Very cool. Very, very cool.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=glad,Better stand up quickly before she decks you.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=calm,Well! Let's see where this takes us.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=calm,I take it you play around fire a lot? Very few burns. Impressive.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:1=tranquil,Ghost pirate zombies are always fun.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:0=glad,Has Monkey Island fallen on hard times?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=thinking,You might want to hurry it up, then. That'll just get in the way of a real fight.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=calm,Now you're getting the hang of it!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=awkward,Complaining about stripping smaller things. I wonder how you ended up like this?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=awkward,You mean to tell me even the <i>staff</i> doesn't want you undressing so much?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:winter,targetStage:1=glad,Ah, right. You're fond of gloves, aren't you?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rainbow_mika,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=teasing,You, Kyu? You're scrawny! Pit or even Viridi could outwrestle you.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=worried,Wait, that was all around your head... if you have a brain, it probably took a hit or two there.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=worried,Oh. And just when it looked like your arms healed up.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=surprised,Is that <i>fire</i>? Why...?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:zoey,targetStage:4=annoyed,It's rude to have lead us on like that.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:2=surprised,Six toes? Is that normal?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=calm,You know, I knew someone else who used yo-yos as their weapon of choice. Although Ness always looked more like a bee than a ladybug...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:chica=calm,Sure, sure. I imagine a ghost would have all the time in the world.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:10=glad,Those hands are doing better than any flimsy old ribbon could.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:aimee=thinking,(I wonder who'd win in a knife fight between these two.)
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:winter,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:weiss=horny,Hiding secrets, are we, Winter? Awfully distant of you.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:xander,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=thinking,It came off as passive-aggressive, Spooky.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rinkah=awkward,(Wish I knw there were so many half-rabbits during the revolt...)
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:chiaki=thinking,Do you know what a video game is, Jenetta?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zizou=teasing,All the hormones must have gone to her head.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:zizou=teasing,Take it from a goddess: you don't need powers to see that.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:shaggy,alsoPlayingStage:0=surprised,That doesn't sound like an expression you should know. Who taught it to you?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:misato=tranquil,Like mine! Who knew humans had that variety as well?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:zizou=horny,Really now? I'm going to enjoy this.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:uravity=glad,I don't think so. Trust me, I know the guy. Or hand, rather.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:saki=thinking,(Was it really? Saki looks like she has something on her mind.)
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zizou,count-elizabeth:1=awkward,Are you sure about that?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette=thinking,(Not focused enough to escape a loss, though.)
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:harley=thinking,Your both white clowns to me. At least, you're both wearing white make-up.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:aella=thinking,Looking at this girl, I doubt she's ever "gotten lucky".
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=tranquil,I'm not sure either. Although I'm sure Pit would say a hot dog.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:lux,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:pit=calm,I don't play favorites here.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=tranquil,Don't worry, spirits like you and I still appear on film. Everyone will see your nudity in due time.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:sei=glad,I'm surprised you even had somewhere to store an ID.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette=glad,This is fine.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:mia,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=worried,Ghosts have all kinds of tricks up their incorporeal sleeves, huh?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:5=worried,I was afraid it'd come to this.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:sei=glad,You really need it. Especially against Sei here.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0=thinking,(<i>I wish all souls could wield weapons. Maybe then the Underworld threat wouldn't have gotten so big...</i>)
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:orendi,targetStage:0=surprised,What an interesting individual you are! Like the child of man and monster!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2=thinking,Speaking of, why is it I'm sensing two souls inhabiting your body?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:won=worried,I knew it wouldn't be this easy.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:winter,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:buffy,alsoPlayingStage:4-5=calm,Married to the job, I think is the right term? How boring.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:sarcasm=worried,I was afraid it'd come to this.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:firstNude=worried,I was afraid it'd come to this.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:SpookyWinning1=loss,You're winning, but you still use the knife as a buffer?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elaine,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=glad,Not a very convincing facade.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:1,totalRounds:10-99,totalAlive:5=glad,I suppose we can let it slip. Only fair, seeing how you're not wearing pants for whatever reason.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:pit=calm,Just sit back and watch, Pit. It'll do you good.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0,totalRounds:0=glad,Maybe Go Fish is more your speed?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:9s=glad,Rinkah looks about as much as a Yorha as I do.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jasmine=calm,How modest. I like that.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=glad,What an awkward place to meet up at.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:pit=surprised,Are you sure? Magnus can be a real jerk about it.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=teasing,I'd love to see how you two could make a pair of boots awkward.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:marceline,alsoPlayingStage:9=thinking,A knife really has no place here. Unless you intended to stab the cards or something.
-1-female_removed_accessory=tranquil,I can live with it now.
-1-female_removed_accessory=calm,I already lost, so I don't really care how this goes now, but I'm rooting for you, ~name~!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:2=calm,Or is this just a Labrynnan thing?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:4=teasing,Says you. This is a card game, you know.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:3=teasing,No, couldn't be. You're far too generous to be one.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3=thinking,I wish my servants could be this assertive at times...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:2=glad,You'll get holes in your stockings if you go around like that!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=tranquil,Those of us in Skyworld prefer the cold. Interesting contrast, I think.
-1-female_removed_accessory,filter:silent=annoyed,It's a lot harder to make conversation with a mute than I expected.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2=glad,Yeah, I'd say you were a bit too rough with your stripping.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1=calm,Regardless, it's a sensible first choice.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:3=teasing,Trust me, Rinkah. I <i>never</i> let up once I've started.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:navi=calm,You know, I like this form a lot more. I bet most others do too.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:6=angry,That's right. This is her true form. And someone <i>I</i> may have to fight... if it comes to it.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1=tranquil,You have good taste, Jenetta. Don't listen to your sister.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:0-6,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:Cross=awkward,Let's avoid the personal jabs, okay ladies? We're here to unwind.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:3=calm,No, please, do go on.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:1=calm,I'll let it slide. It's not like you have any authority here anyways.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:1=calm,You're awfully chipper for a vampire... and someone about to lose all her clothes.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:5=surprised,Our hair is so similar when you have it like that. Are you ripping off my style?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:4=teasing,<i>Maybe you'd be in better shape if you didn't have such a foul mouth.</i>
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:sarcasm2=angry,Don't just play this off! ~player~, this is her true form. And someone <i>I</i> may have to fight... if it comes to it.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:winter,targetStage:2=teasing,I think you're being too confident. Remember, no matter what rank you have, it means nothing to the divine.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:firstNude2=angry,That's right. This is her true form. And someone <i>I</i> may have to fight... if it comes to it.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:dizzy=glad,Sure enough. You should sit down for a bit.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:Fast1=worried,I think you're missing the point. You want to <i>keep</i> your clothes. And, you know, <i>not</i> blow them up.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:hermione,targetStage:4=calm,You have some weird priorities, Hermione.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:tada=awkward,You... may need glasses.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:luck_syega=annoyed,Doesn't sound like any magic I've ever known...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:live_without_shoes=teasing,And that's how you lose your tights.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:install_skill=calm,No one at this table, clearly.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:what_to_take_off=glad,Who else's would you use? ~player~'s?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=thinking,Well, this is a good alternative. And Z-moves are overrated, anyway.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:spare_my_ribbon=teasing,You're not really sparing it. More like sacrificing it.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:something_off=calm,...What are you looking at me for? I didn't make the rules.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:pick_something_small=teasing,A brilliant deduction, Sola.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:I_had_to_lose_something=glad,It's amazing how one silly ribbon can make you look so formal.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:I_guess_I_can_take_off=calm,Expecting? No. Hoping? You bet.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:need_shoes_back=angry,But seriously? <i>Bright red</i>? What were they thinking?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:1=thinking,(<i>Wow. She seems so normal compared to most of the others here.</i>)
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4=teasing,Not bad. You're made of surprisingly sturdy stuff!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=annoyed,Why does <i>everyone</i> say that?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=annoyed,You know, a drink might do you good. Slow down your heart rate and whatnot.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2=teasing,You know I'm a goddess, right? Trying to shoot me with one of those is the equivalent of trying to break through a tank with a plastic fork.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=calm,You talk a big game, but in my experience, that's all it is.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:2=horny,Well, clearly it wasn't helpful to you.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2=glad,And you're all the better for it.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=awkward,Those are some seriously deep burns... are you sure you'll be okay?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1=calm,That's fine. One ribbon won't break the outfit, right?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:1=calm,Must be a relief to remove it, yes?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:2=thinking,A bit too basic for my tastes, I'm afraid.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:4=tranquil,I suppose so. Next hand will hopefully be more eventful.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:1=tranquil,Of course. I'd rather deal with someone my own size, anyway.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=calm,I suppose this was just the first act in your little game. Moving on.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:2=teasing,If you were <i>really</i> nice, you'd do even more for us.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1=worried,Unfortunate. Seems you're just another human for tonight.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=glad,Although, somehow it looks like your stockings made it out completely fine.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:2=teasing,Projecting now, are we?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=thinking,You know, I can feel everyone's arousal level from that reveal. Yours is the highest, Kyu. Care to explain?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:amalia,targetStage:1=glad,Are you willing to prove that?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=tranquil,So you <i>are</i> a fan? How surreal.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=calm,I'd love to hear your thoughts on it. Come see me after the game.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:2=tranquil,<i>Finally</i> someone who gets it!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=surprised,...You know, your personality is actually pretty fitting for someone who's part cat.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:6=thinking,It's a mystery to me why you chose to lose your bra <i>before</i> your glasses...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:hope_you_all_forgive_me=glad,Forgiven. <i>For now.</i>
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:here_i_go=teasing,I dunno, you sure you don't want to take off anything else? It's perfectly legal.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:2=tranquil,A helmet like that didn't really suit you anyway. You look <i>somewhat</i> normal with it off.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:dont_judge_me_too_hardly=thinking,It's a goddess's job to remain impartial to things like this.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1=calm,Sorry, I can't really take anyone with beady black eyes seriously.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:mahiru=horny,Wouldn't exactly be "Ultimate" if they weren't.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:aimee=annoyed,(People will just get inflicted with bullet wounds instead.)
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:uravity=teasing,Who do you like to play as? I'll be sure to give them an extra-special pounding next time I face them.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:marinette=teasing,Another gaming enthusiast? Then I assume you know, say, the Smash tournaments?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:harley=annoyed,Are you just making all this up?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:aella=glad,Doesn't seem too hard. Who makes bulky shoes for tiny feet?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=worried,I have no words.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=teasing,A girl like you? Dancing burlesque? I'd <i>love</i>to see that.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:aella=glad,So it did. Probably for the best.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:1=calm,I'd say Winslow has a much better deal here than you and Guybrush.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:joey=tranquil,Interesting how you don't deny it, Kyu.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zizou=teasing,<i>This</i> girl's your rival? Talk about a low standard, Zizou.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:lux,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,I think you and Pit have a lot in common, Lux.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jura,count-meia:1=calm,Seems we've got a bit of a split between beauties and muscle-girls. And ~player~, I guess.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zizou,count-elizabeth:1=worried,She didn't say anything. Are you a mind reader, perhaps?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingStage:4-5=glad,I don't see the correlation of why the Flame Tribe is any different.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:9=tranquil,The reasons don't matter that much. All that matters is that it's happened.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:0=glad,There's a lot of ghosts in the multiverse, Hermione. You of all people should know that.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:winter,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=teasing,Is that a hint of smugness I sense? Even for someone named Winter, that's cold.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:2=horny,That sounds fun, too.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:winter,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=calm,This'll probably be easier if you let the girl think for herself, Winter. You can complain <i>after</i> she's lost completely.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:dress_off_first=calm,Uh, Sola? Bit late to the punchline.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:natsuki,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=teasing,She's just pretending to make it seem like she wasn't totally eyeing you.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=glad,You're staring at one right now.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:sayori,alsoPlayingStage:0-7,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:filter-fancy=tranquil,As does the higher-ups.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:videogametriviatime,alsoPlaying:meia=tranquil,Would you perhaps like my help, Chiaki? I know many, many video game facts.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:zizou=tranquil,Just like a certain other petite goddess I know!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zoey,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=teasing,It's fine, Zoey. Take your time, I'll just get them out the old-fashioned way.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=annoyed,Apologizing? Don't. I'd rather this be a fair fight.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=thinking,This is a bit different from sparring, but I see the point.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:kyoko=glad,Whoever had gloves, really.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:lyn=teasing,Speaking of, when are you getting into Heroes, Rinkah? Hm?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:4=thinking,Wait, I'm pretty sure that bag would've had to come off anyway for you to get totally naked...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:9s=tranquil,Not many secrets among the Flame Tribe, I see.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,Controlling angels is surprisingly easy. Not surprised you've done it, Spooky.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:alice=teasing,Don't have a lot? Good to know.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:rinkah=teasing,After the game, ladies. There's still stripping to do!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jin=tranquil,What you're saying is he has a shot. Congrats, Jin! That's probably the best you've ever gotten.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:mahiru=calm,Why are you apologizing? They're just gloves.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,Don't encourage him. Please.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,You've got an active imagination, Pit. She's from the Fire Tribe, not a tribe made of fire.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,totalRounds:0=annoyed,Calling in in early? Go ahead. We'll find someone more suitable to the table.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=annoyed,We'll see. Actually, can you even see the cards?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:chiaki=teasing,As the authority on many games represented at the Inventory, I know that Chiaki's right. Perhaps I can give you some proof at another time?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jura=calm,A woman who loves muscles? What, is she the type who'd love to be crushed by a woman's thighs?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:kira=annoyed,Your comments are unneccessary, Kira.




#OPPONENT REMOVING MINOR CLOTHING
#Minor pieces of clothing don't reveal much when removed, but probably indicate more progress than accessory removal.

#fully clothed
0-male_removing_minor=calm,Not a bad choice.
0-male_removing_minor=calm,Quality pick, ~name~.
0-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:1,totalRounds:0-3,count-aggressive:1=annoyed,Well, it's not like we expect you to whip off your pants right away.
0-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:0,totalRounds:0-3,count-aggressive:1=glad,Yes, we can all see that. Believe me, I'm cold as ice right now.
0-male_removing_minor,target:9s,targetStage:1=teasing,Sacrificing the warmth of your feet for fairness?
0-male_removing_minor,target:pit,targetStage:2=surprised,What, no good shoes, Pit? I thought you'd want to look your best for this.
0-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:0=calm,Ooh, how formal!
0-male_removing_minor,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba=glad,You two are way more entertaining than you should be together.
0-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:1=glad,Everybody has shoes. Had to happen eventually.
0-male_removed_minor=tranquil,I approve. Not as much as if you'd gone right for the throat, but hey.
0-male_removed_minor=horny,I like it quite a bit. Can't wait to see what's in store!
0-male_removed_minor,target:9s,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,Don't feel bad. Pit never uses his tactical network at full capacity.
0-male_removed_minor,target:9s,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:futaba,count-pit:1=calm,It sounds exactly like you, Pit.
0-male_removed_minor,target:xander,targetStage:1=glad,You've got enthusiasm, if nothing else.
0-male_removed_minor,target:pit,targetStage:3=teasing,Looks like you're out of small stuff now... unless you're hiding something in that tunic of yours.
0-male_removed_minor,target:9s,targetStage:2=tranquil,What a good boy you are. Actual humans could learn a thing or two from you.
0-male_removed_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:2=teasing,Think you're safe? That's cute.
0-male_removed_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:1=thinking,"Zomg"? I don't get it.
0-male_removed_minor,target:9s,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:futaba=thinking,Bit of an odd name, in my opinion. What oath are you keeping?
0-female_removing_minor=calm,Not bad. A pittance overall, but it'll do for now.
0-female_removing_minor=tranquil,Not bad! For this early on, I mean.
0-female_removing_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:2loss=teasing,Alright, I'll call your bluff. I'll even walk you to the door.
0-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:sorg=glad,Not that it'll matter in the end, but go on.
0-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:socks=teasing,I know love fairy anatomy, Kyu. And I also know they tend to be pathological liars.
0-female_removing_minor,target:rainbow_mika,alsoPlaying:pit=calm,Do you see that, Pit? A wonderful servant-mistress relationship.
0-female_removing_minor,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:gogo=surprised,(<i>Four hours?!</i>)
0-female_removing_minor,target:winter,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:weiss=calm,She's a natural. Either that or a shark.
0-female_removing_minor,target:winter,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:weiss=thinking,Coming to this game in the first place shows a lack of dignity and grace. <i>I</i> should know.
0-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:uravity=teasing,Who, little Chiaki? She's harmless.
0-female_removing_minor,target:juri,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:chun-li=tranquil,Yeah, I like to know the score, too.
0-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,Don't mind him. That's pretty much his natural state.
0-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:wiifitfemale=surprised,...How do you know that?
0-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,That sounds fun! In fact, you two ought to just go home in each other's clothes!
0-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:sorg,alsoPlaying:pit=tranquil,Great! And you've saved us from Pit making a "gloves coming off" joke for another round!
0-female_removing_minor,target:winter,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=calm,Probably. Tina's more of a performer, not a serious fighter.
0-female_removing_minor,target:winter,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:2-4=glad,I really should get versed in other languages.
0-female_removing_minor,target:jolyne,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:xander,alsoPlayingStage:0=tranquil,Careful. He might just be buttering you up.
0-female_removing_minor,target:amalia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:faye,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=calm,Checking for cheaters? Not a bad plan.
0-female_removing_minor,target:nayru,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=teasing,Take your time. I know it'll be worth it...
0-female_removing_minor,target:sola,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:zizou=glad,Well, they're impressive, I admit. For an amateur.
0-female_removing_minor,target:jolyne,targetStage:1,targetTimeInStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=glad,It's not like she's lying to her self. She's just not in a hurry to admit it.
0-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=thinking,I wouldn't know about the softness, but I dig the motif of it.
0-female_removing_minor,target:amy_rose,targetStage:2=annoyed,For a species all about speed, you sure seem to be dragging this out.
0-female_removing_minor,target:elaine,targetStage:2=thinking,One of those big, oversized ones, I'm guessing?
0-female_removing_minor,target:jolyne,targetStage:1=glad,Boots. A cornerstone of any self-respecting adventurer. Am I wrong?
0-female_removing_minor,target:nayru,targetStage:3=teasing,Trust me, Nayru. I know better than to doubt a follower of a friend.
0-female_removing_minor,target:sola,targetStage:3=thinking,So much desperation in your voice... you really hate this, huh?
0-female_removing_minor,target:juri,targetStage:1=teasing,Clothes are clothes, Juri. It'll all come off eventually.
0-female_removing_minor,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:0=angry,I know what you really are. So all I'll say is: don't try anything.
0-female_removing_minor,target:jenetta,targetStage:2=thinking,(Maybe you should invest in pants...)
0-female_removing_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=thinking,It's still amazing to me how controlled these burns are...
0-female_removing_minor,target:moon,targetStage:4=glad,Ah, yes. The chicken hat. Sorry, Torchic hat.
0-female_removing_minor,target:clover,targetStage:1=teasing,If only it were that easy to manipulate luck.
0-female_removing_minor,target:winter,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey now! Winter jackets are essential for you! Or so I hear.
0-female_removing_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:0=calm,A blazer's a bit cooler than the usual shoes or ribbons. I approve.
0-female_removing_minor,target:jenetta,targetStage:3=surprised,Really? Well, if you can sew an entirely new apron before you lose again, I'd let you wear it out of respect alone!
0-female_removing_minor,target:winter,targetStage:2=glad,Wise pick. Although a bit forced.
0-female_removing_minor,target:lux,targetStage:2=thinking,(<i>Whenever I hear the name "Lux", all I can think of is the Chariot Master's horse.</i>)
0-female_removing_minor,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:1=annoyed,We've all heard the joke a thousand times.
0-female_removing_minor,target:miko,targetStage:0=surprised,You're having a servant strip you? That seems... lazy.
0-female_removing_minor,target:rainbow_mika,count-pit:0=surprised,Oh! Is Nadeshiko your servant?
0-female_removing_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2=thinking,How about you keep it simple?
0-female_removing_minor,target:zone-tan=thinking,(<i>Are there really people who are "into" feet?</i>)
0-female_removing_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:1=horny,On the contrary, this is what we all came to see, Natsuki.
0-female_removing_minor,filter:kind=tranquil,Remember, ~name~: you gotta stay upbeat, upbeat, upbeat...
0-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3=teasing,Straight to the point. Good on you.
0-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3=teasing,Do you always talk with something in your mouth?
0-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2=horny,I <i>could</i> tell you what ~player~'s thinking, but where's the fun in that?
0-female_removing_minor,target:amalia,targetStage:2=glad,Boots aren't the first thing I'd call those.
0-female_removing_minor,target:aella,targetStage:2=annoyed,You <i>guess</i>. You either do it or not. Hurry up now, time's wasting.
0-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=thinking,I bet with how good you are with that thing, you'd probably be really good in Light vs. Dark.
0-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=thinking,Still can't believe <i>this</i> is how you're choosing to strip.
0-female_removing_minor,target:raven,targetStage:0=annoyed,Spare us the edge, please. I get enough of that with Pittoo around...
0-female_removing_minor,target:clover,targetStage:0=tranquil,Ah, that must be it. There's only three dots on your face.
0-female_removing_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:1=glad,Ah, a sweater. Very good.
0-female_removing_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:2=teasing,Touching the floor is usually a feeling everyone knows.
0-female_removed_minor=glad,Excellent. Let's get back to the game, then.
0-female_removed_minor=glad,I don't know about the rest of you, but I'm excited to see what comes next!
0-female_removed_minor,target:moon,targetStage:5=worried,She hasn't responded at all. Maybe she's deaf?
0-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3=glad,I don't really plan on moving from this spot, so...
0-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2,totalExposed:1-3=glad,So there are. Let's get you down to their level, okay?
0-female_removed_minor,target:rainbow_mika,alsoPlaying:pit=horny,Maybe I <i>should</i> have you remove my clothes for me... nah, just kidding.
0-female_removed_minor,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=calm,Ooh, aren't we excited? Okay, let's play, little oracle.
0-female_removed_minor,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:gogo=thinking,(<i>Should I be listening to this conversation?</i>)
0-female_removed_minor,target:elaine,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:chun-li=surprised,Hey! We aren't supposed to talk about that!
0-female_removed_minor,target:jolyne,targetStage:2=tranquil,Well, it hardly matters. Although not wearing socks might come back to bite you.
0-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:4=thinking,Bit early for that. Or are the type to get off on this?
0-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=thinking,Those burns are pretty severe. If you like, I can take you to the Rewind Spring and get them patched up.
0-female_removed_minor,target:winter,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:weiss=awkward,Keep trying. Although this might not end well for either of you...
0-female_removed_minor,target:sola,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:down_they_go=glad,You're acting like you had any to begin with, Ms. In-A-Strip-Poker-Game.
0-female_removed_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:3=glad,That goes both ways. Now you're closer to bigger things.
0-female_removed_minor,target:winter,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=calm,You're not doing bad so far, kid. You got a hit in on your sister with... minimal loss.
0-female_removed_minor,target:raven,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=awkward,Dungeons... aren't fun.
0-female_removed_minor,target:mei,targetStage:3=calm,Yeah, that ~clothing~ didn't really do you justice.

0-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:footfet=worried,Apparently you're more into it than ~player~ is, for that matter...
0-female_removed_minor,target:sola,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:please_dont_be_too_rough=teasing,At most, I'll question your decision to come here wearing such childish panties.
0-female_removed_minor,target:winter,targetStage:3=glad,Well, we can't even see your feet, so is that really important right now?
0-female_removed_minor,target:amalia,targetStage:3=tranquil,If you insist.
0-female_removed_minor,target:aella,targetStage:3=teasing,Ah yes. Very white. Fashionable.
0-female_removed_minor,target:sola,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:dont_tease_me=teasing,Clearly you don't know me.
0-female_removed_minor,target:sola,targetStage:4=surprised,That thing on your panties. What is that? And where can I get one?
0-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2loss=tranquil,Yeah, that's about what I expected. I knew you didn't have it in you.
0-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2=calm,Relax, you're not even showing skin yet!
0-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3=thinking,As a love fairy? That's questionable.
0-female_removed_minor,target:rainbow_mika,count-pit:0=tranquil,A shame Pit didn't wind up at our table. Otherwise, I'd have him do the same for me!
0-female_removed_minor,target:raven,targetStage:1=teasing,Then just stay in the air, pyschic girl.
0-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4=glad,How lazy.
0-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:innuendo=thinking,Well, not every joke needs to be explained. But most jokes tend to have, you know, punchlines.
0-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:socks=calm,Told you all.
0-female_removed_minor,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:2=worried,I'd rather not see the secrets behind that flower...
0-female_removed_minor,target:sola,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:im_actually_doing_this=tranquil,Key word being "yourself". You must not hate this if you've gone this far...
0-female_removed_minor,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:1=teasing,Now, now. We all knew ~player~ was into that, but that's no reason to call them out.
0-female_removed_minor,target:sola,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:i_hope_my_family_never_hears_about_this=annoyed,For something like this? It's their loss.
0-female_removed_minor,target:evie,targetStage:2=calm,How <i>cold</i> of you!
0-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:uravity=calm,Good call.
0-female_removed_minor,target:winter,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=teasing,Now <i>there's</i> an idea! Turning this into a passionate scene of torn clothes and body-to-body contact... Certainly beats boring old cards.
0-female_removed_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:2=calm,Technicalities aside, it's very fitting. If I ever wore one, I'm sure I'd be sweating like crazy!
0-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:saki=calm,She seems like the type who plays a lot of single-player. Show her a good co-op, maybe?
0-female_removed_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=calm,It defies all laws of nature! So, I'm guessing magic?
0-female_removed_minor,target:clover,targetStage:1=surprised,...Or maybe bad planning has a part in it.
0-female_removed_minor,target:nayru,targetStage:4=tranquil,Glad to see you're not taking the coward's way out.
0-female_removed_minor,target:winter,targetStage:1=thinking,Then again, those sleeves didn't seem even remotely functional.
0-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:kira=worried,(Glad I'm not the only one who thinks so.)
0-female_removed_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:1=tranquil,Too late to worry about that now, I'm afraid. Playing the game might take your mind off it, though.
0-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:mei=loss,I think it's just the atmosphere here...
0-female_removed_minor,target:clover,targetStage:2=glad,A shame. Such a warm-looking jacket.
0-female_removed_minor,target:elaine,targetStage:3=glad,Pistols are still a little pirate-y anyway.
0-female_removed_minor,target:zone-tan=glad,Good. We wouldn't want to cause any trouble, riiiiight?
0-female_removed_minor,target:aella,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:rinkah=thinking,A spar, huh? I bet Pit would want in on that.
0-female_removed_minor,target:aella,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,Maybe I ought to start playing poker with you, Pit. Teach you some humility.
0-female_removed_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2=tranquil,That certainly <i>does</i> make this more interesting.
0-female_removed_minor,target:miko,targetStage:1=teasing,Are you just playing dumb? Because her timing was a little <i>too</i> perfect.
0-female_removed_minor,target:juri,targetStage:2=horny,Looking forward to it.
0-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:3=calm,Cardigan works. And is apparently synonymous with "on the floor".

0-female_removed_minor,target:sola,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:zizou=thinking,(That was probably more a jab at her panties, anyway.)

#lost armbands
1-male_removing_minor=tranquil,Decided to start playing, huh?
1-male_removing_minor=glad,I'll admit, not a terrible choice.
1-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:0,totalRounds:0-3,count-aggressive:1=glad,Yes, we can all see that. Believe me, I'm cold as ice right now.
1-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:0=calm,Ooh, how formal!
1-male_removing_minor,target:pit,targetStage:2=surprised,What, no good shoes, Pit? I thought you'd want to look your best for this.
1-male_removing_minor,target:9s,targetStage:1=teasing,Sacrificing the warmth of your feet for fairness?
1-male_removing_minor,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba=glad,You two are way more entertaining than you should be together.
1-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:1,totalRounds:0-3,count-aggressive:1=annoyed,Well, it's not like we expect you to whip off your pants right away.
1-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:1=glad,Everybody has shoes. Had to happen eventually.
1-male_removed_minor=calm,A little small, but hey, what're you going to do?
1-male_removed_minor=teasing,Something about you makes me glad your ~clothing~ is off you now.
1-male_removed_minor,target:9s,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,Don't feel bad. Pit never uses his tactical network at full capacity.
1-male_removed_minor,target:xander,targetStage:1=glad,You've got enthusiasm, if nothing else.
1-male_removed_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:2=teasing,Think you're safe? That's cute.
1-male_removed_minor,target:pit,targetStage:3=teasing,Looks like you're out of small stuff now... unless you're hiding something in that tunic of yours.
1-male_removed_minor,target:9s,targetStage:2=tranquil,What a good boy you are. Actual humans could learn a thing or two from you.
1-male_removed_minor,target:9s,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:futaba,count-pit:1=calm,It sounds exactly like you, Pit.
1-male_removed_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:1=thinking,"Zomg"? I don't get it.
1-male_removed_minor,target:9s,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:futaba=thinking,Bit of an odd name, in my opinion. What oath are you keeping?
1-female_removing_minor=teasing,Did me taking off my armwear inspire you? I'm touched, truly.
1-female_removing_minor=tranquil,I think I'm on a roll!
1-female_removing_minor,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:0=angry,I know what you really are. So all I'll say is: don't try anything.
1-female_removing_minor,target:clover,targetStage:0=tranquil,Ah, that must be it. There's only three dots on your face.
1-female_removing_minor,target:clover,targetStage:1=teasing,If only it were that easy to manipulate luck.
1-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,That sounds fun! In fact, you two ought to just go home in each other's clothes!
1-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:uravity=teasing,Who, little Chiaki? She's harmless.
1-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:sorg,alsoPlaying:pit=tranquil,Great! And you've saved us from Pit making a "gloves coming off" joke for another round!
1-female_removing_minor,target:amalia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:faye,alsoPlayingStage:1-5=calm,Checking for cheaters? Not a bad plan.
1-female_removing_minor,target:winter,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=calm,Probably. Tina's more of a performer, not a serious fighter.
1-female_removing_minor,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:1=annoyed,We've all heard the joke a thousand times.
1-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3=teasing,Straight to the point. Good on you.
1-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:wiifitfemale=surprised,...How do you know that?
1-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=thinking,I bet with how good you are with that thing, you'd probably be really good in Light vs. Dark.
1-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=thinking,Still can't believe <i>this</i> is how you're choosing to strip.
1-female_removing_minor,target:amalia,targetStage:2=glad,Boots aren't the first thing I'd call those.
1-female_removing_minor,target:raven,targetStage:0=annoyed,Spare us the edge, please. I get enough of that with Pittoo around...
1-female_removing_minor,target:amy_rose,targetStage:2=annoyed,For a species all about speed, you sure seem to be dragging this out.
1-female_removing_minor,target:lux,targetStage:2=thinking,(<i>Whenever I hear the name "Lux", all I can think of is the Chariot Master's horse.</i>)
1-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2=horny,I <i>could</i> tell you what ~player~'s thinking, but where's the fun in that?
1-female_removing_minor,target:nayru,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=teasing,Take your time. I know it'll be worth it...
1-female_removing_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:2loss=teasing,Alright, I'll call your bluff. I'll even walk you to the door.
1-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3=teasing,Do you always talk with something in your mouth?
1-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:sorg=glad,Not that it'll matter in the end, but go on.
1-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:socks=teasing,I know love fairy anatomy, Kyu. And I also know they tend to be pathological liars.
1-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=thinking,I wouldn't know about the softness, but I dig the motif of it.
1-female_removing_minor,target:rainbow_mika,alsoPlaying:pit=calm,Do you see that, Pit? A wonderful servant-mistress relationship.
1-female_removing_minor,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:gogo=surprised,(<i>Four hours?!</i>)
1-female_removing_minor,target:winter,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:weiss=calm,She's a natural. Either that or a shark.
1-female_removing_minor,filter:kind=tranquil,Remember, ~name~: you gotta stay upbeat, upbeat, upbeat...
1-female_removing_minor,target:winter,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:weiss=thinking,Coming to this game in the first place shows a lack of dignity and grace. <i>I</i> should know.
1-female_removing_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:1=horny,On the contrary, this is what we all came to see, Natsuki.
1-female_removing_minor,target:sola,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:zizou=glad,Well, they're impressive, I admit. For an amateur.
1-female_removing_minor,target:zone-tan=thinking,(<i>Are there really people who are "into" feet?</i>)
1-female_removing_minor,target:juri,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:chun-li=tranquil,Yeah, I like to know the score, too.
1-female_removing_minor,target:rainbow_mika,count-pit:0=surprised,Oh! Is Nadeshiko your servant?
1-female_removing_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2=thinking,How about you keep it simple?
1-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,Don't mind him. That's pretty much his natural state.
1-female_removing_minor,target:miko,targetStage:0=surprised,You're having a servant strip you? That seems... lazy.
1-female_removing_minor,target:juri,targetStage:1=teasing,Clothes are clothes, Juri. It'll all come off eventually.
1-female_removing_minor,target:aella,targetStage:2=annoyed,You <i>guess</i>. You either do it or not. Hurry up now, time's wasting.
1-female_removing_minor,target:winter,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:2-4=glad,I really should get versed in other languages.
1-female_removing_minor,target:moon,targetStage:4=glad,Ah, yes. The chicken hat. Sorry, Torchic hat.
1-female_removing_minor,target:nayru,targetStage:3=teasing,Trust me, Nayru. I know better than to doubt a follower of a friend.
1-female_removing_minor,target:jolyne,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:xander,alsoPlayingStage:0=tranquil,Careful. He might just be buttering you up.
1-female_removing_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:0=calm,A blazer's a bit cooler than the usual shoes or ribbons. I approve.
1-female_removing_minor,target:sola,targetStage:3=thinking,So much desperation in your voice... you really hate this, huh?
1-female_removing_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=thinking,It's still amazing to me how controlled these burns are...
1-female_removing_minor,target:jenetta,targetStage:2=thinking,(Maybe you should invest in pants...)
1-female_removing_minor,target:jenetta,targetStage:3=surprised,Really? Well, if you can sew an entirely new apron before you lose again, I'd let you wear it out of respect alone!
1-female_removing_minor,target:winter,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey now! Winter jackets are essential for you! Or so I hear.
1-female_removing_minor,target:jolyne,targetStage:1,targetTimeInStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=glad,It's not like she's lying to her self. She's just not in a hurry to admit it.
1-female_removing_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:1=glad,Ah, a sweater. Very good.
1-female_removing_minor,target:jolyne,targetStage:1=glad,Boots. A cornerstone of any self-respecting adventurer. Am I wrong?
1-female_removing_minor,target:winter,targetStage:2=glad,Wise pick. Although a bit forced.
1-female_removing_minor,target:elaine,targetStage:2=thinking,One of those big, oversized ones, I'm guessing?
1-female_removing_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:2=teasing,Touching the floor is usually a feeling everyone knows.
1-female_removed_minor=glad,Personally, I think that it looks better off you anyway.
1-female_removed_minor=calm,I'm a big fan of winning, you know. Thanks for helping me out in that department.
1-female_removed_minor,target:elaine,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:chun-li=surprised,Hey! We aren't supposed to talk about that!
1-female_removed_minor,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:gogo=thinking,(<i>Should I be listening to this conversation?</i>)
1-female_removed_minor,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:2=worried,I'd rather not see the secrets behind that flower...
1-female_removed_minor,target:rainbow_mika,alsoPlaying:pit=horny,Maybe I <i>should</i> have you remove my clothes for me... nah, just kidding.
1-female_removed_minor,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:1=teasing,Now, now. We all knew ~player~ was into that, but that's no reason to call them out.
1-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4=glad,How lazy.
1-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:footfet=worried,Apparently you're more into it than ~player~ is, for that matter...
1-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:4=thinking,Bit early for that. Or are the type to get off on this?
1-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:socks=calm,Told you all.
1-female_removed_minor,target:jenetta,targetStage:4=awkward,Oh. Well, no one's tearing those tonight... I think.
1-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:innuendo=thinking,Well, not every joke needs to be explained. But most jokes tend to have, you know, punchlines.

1-female_removed_minor,target:winter,targetStage:3=glad,Well, we can't even see your feet, so is that really important right now?
1-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3=glad,I don't really plan on moving from this spot, so...
1-female_removed_minor,target:raven,targetStage:1=teasing,Then just stay in the air, pyschic girl.
1-female_removed_minor,target:raven,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=awkward,Dungeons... aren't fun.
1-female_removed_minor,target:moon,targetStage:5=worried,She hasn't responded at all. Maybe she's deaf?
1-female_removed_minor,target:aella,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:rinkah=thinking,A spar, huh? I bet Pit would want in on that.
1-female_removed_minor,target:aella,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,Maybe I ought to start playing poker with you, Pit. Teach you some humility.
1-female_removed_minor,target:jenetta,targetStage:3=teasing,Even you half-humans think the floor's cold! ALthough that may be my fault, for giving you all so much light...
1-female_removed_minor,target:clover,targetStage:2=glad,A shame. Such a warm-looking jacket.
1-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:mei=loss,I think it's just the atmosphere here...

1-female_removed_minor,target:sola,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:zizou=thinking,(That was probably more a jab at her panties, anyway.)
1-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2=calm,Relax, you're not even showing skin yet!
1-female_removed_minor,target:amalia,targetStage:3=tranquil,If you insist.
1-female_removed_minor,target:winter,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:weiss=awkward,Keep trying. Although this might not end well for either of you...
1-female_removed_minor,target:sola,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:dont_tease_me=teasing,Clearly you don't know me.
1-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2,totalExposed:1-3=glad,So there are. Let's get you down to their level, okay?
1-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=calm,Oh yeah, you'd <i>definitely</i> be a Flintlock Staff main.
1-female_removed_minor,target:jolyne,targetStage:2=tranquil,Well, it hardly matters. Although not wearing socks might come back to bite you.
1-female_removed_minor,target:sola,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:im_actually_doing_this=tranquil,Key word being "yourself". You must not hate this if you've gone this far...

1-female_removed_minor,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=calm,Ooh, aren't we excited? Okay, let's play, little oracle.
1-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=tranquil,Still, thanks for making this way more interesting!
1-female_removed_minor,target:aella,targetStage:3=teasing,Ah yes. Very white. Fashionable.
1-female_removed_minor,target:sola,targetStage:4=surprised,That thing on your panties. What is that? And where can I get one?
1-female_removed_minor,target:sola,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:down_they_go=glad,You're acting like you had any to begin with, Ms. In-A-Strip-Poker-Game.
1-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=thinking,Those burns are pretty severe. If you like, I can take you to the Rewind Spring and get them patched up.
1-female_removed_minor,target:evie,targetStage:2=calm,How <i>cold</i> of you!
1-female_removed_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:3=glad,That goes both ways. Now you're closer to bigger things.
1-female_removed_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2=tranquil,That certainly <i>does</i> make this more interesting.
1-female_removed_minor,target:mei,targetStage:3=calm,Yeah, that ~clothing~ didn't really do you justice.

2-male_removed_minor,target:pit,targetStage:3=teasing,Looks like you're out of small stuff now... unless you're hiding something in that tunic of yours.
2-male_removed_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:1=thinking,"Zomg"? I don't get it.
2-male_removed_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:2=teasing,Think you're safe? That's cute.
2-male_removed_minor,target:xander,targetStage:1=glad,You've got enthusiasm, if nothing else.
2-male_removed_minor,target:9s,targetStage:2=tranquil,What a good boy you are. Actual humans could learn a thing or two from you.
2-male_removed_minor,target:9s,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:futaba,count-pit:1=calm,It sounds exactly like you, Pit.
2-male_removed_minor,target:9s,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,Don't feel bad. Pit never uses his tactical network at full capacity.
2-female_removing_minor=teasing,How *ahem* adventurous of you.
2-female_removing_minor=teasing,And if you look directly in front of us, ~name~ is taking off her ~clothing~.
2-female_removing_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:0=calm,A blazer's a bit cooler than the usual shoes or ribbons. I approve.
2-female_removing_minor,target:jolyne,targetStage:1=glad,Boots. A cornerstone of any self-respecting adventurer. Am I wrong?
2-female_removing_minor,target:nayru,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=teasing,Take your time. I know it'll be worth it...
2-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:sorg,alsoPlaying:pit=tranquil,Great! And you've saved us from Pit making a "gloves coming off" joke for another round!
2-female_removing_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:2loss=teasing,Alright, I'll call your bluff. I'll even walk you to the door.
2-female_removing_minor,target:rainbow_mika,count-pit:0=surprised,Oh! Is Nadeshiko your servant?
2-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3=teasing,Do you always talk with something in your mouth?
2-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2=horny,I <i>could</i> tell you what ~player~'s thinking, but where's the fun in that?
2-female_removing_minor,target:winter,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey now! Winter jackets are essential for you! Or so I hear.
2-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:sorg=glad,Not that it'll matter in the end, but go on.
2-female_removing_minor,target:elaine,targetStage:2=thinking,One of those big, oversized ones, I'm guessing?
2-female_removing_minor,target:jenetta,targetStage:3=surprised,Really? Well, if you can sew an entirely new apron before you lose again, I'd let you wear it out of respect alone!
2-female_removing_minor,target:sola,targetStage:3=thinking,So much desperation in your voice... you really hate this, huh?
2-female_removing_minor,target:sola,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:zizou=glad,Well, they're impressive, I admit. For an amateur.
2-female_removing_minor,target:lux,targetStage:2=thinking,(<i>Whenever I hear the name "Lux", all I can think of is the Chariot Master's horse.</i>)
2-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:socks=teasing,I know love fairy anatomy, Kyu. And I also know they tend to be pathological liars.
2-female_removing_minor,target:juri,targetStage:1=teasing,Clothes are clothes, Juri. It'll all come off eventually.
2-female_removing_minor,target:aella,targetStage:2=annoyed,You <i>guess</i>. You either do it or not. Hurry up now, time's wasting.
2-female_removing_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:2=teasing,Touching the floor is usually a feeling everyone knows.
2-female_removing_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:1=glad,Ah, a sweater. Very good.
2-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=thinking,I bet with how good you are with that thing, you'd probably be really good in Light vs. Dark.
2-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=thinking,Still can't believe <i>this</i> is how you're choosing to strip.
2-female_removing_minor,target:nayru,targetStage:3=teasing,Trust me, Nayru. I know better than to doubt a follower of a friend.
2-female_removing_minor,target:amalia,targetStage:2=glad,Boots aren't the first thing I'd call those.
2-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:wiifitfemale=surprised,...How do you know that?
2-female_removing_minor,target:winter,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=calm,Probably. Tina's more of a performer, not a serious fighter.
2-female_removing_minor,target:miko,targetStage:0=surprised,You're having a servant strip you? That seems... lazy.
2-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,Don't mind him. That's pretty much his natural state.
2-female_removing_minor,target:jolyne,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:xander,alsoPlayingStage:0=tranquil,Careful. He might just be buttering you up.
2-female_removing_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=thinking,It's still amazing to me how controlled these burns are...
2-female_removing_minor,target:amy_rose,targetStage:2=annoyed,For a species all about speed, you sure seem to be dragging this out.
2-female_removing_minor,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:0=angry,I know what you really are. So all I'll say is: don't try anything.
2-female_removing_minor,target:amalia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:faye,alsoPlayingStage:2-5=calm,Checking for cheaters? Not a bad plan.
2-female_removing_minor,target:clover,targetStage:1=teasing,If only it were that easy to manipulate luck.
2-female_removing_minor,target:raven,targetStage:0=annoyed,Spare us the edge, please. I get enough of that with Pittoo around...
2-female_removing_minor,target:juri,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:chun-li=tranquil,Yeah, I like to know the score, too.
2-female_removing_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2=thinking,How about you keep it simple?
2-female_removing_minor,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:gogo=surprised,(<i>Four hours?!</i>)
2-female_removing_minor,target:moon,targetStage:4=glad,Ah, yes. The chicken hat. Sorry, Torchic hat.
2-female_removing_minor,target:jenetta,targetStage:2=thinking,(Maybe you should invest in pants...)
2-female_removing_minor,target:winter,targetStage:2=glad,Wise pick. Although a bit forced.
2-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:uravity=teasing,Who, little Chiaki? She's harmless.
2-female_removing_minor,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:1=annoyed,We've all heard the joke a thousand times.
2-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,That sounds fun! In fact, you two ought to just go home in each other's clothes!
2-female_removing_minor,target:winter,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:weiss=calm,She's a natural. Either that or a shark.
2-female_removing_minor,target:rainbow_mika,alsoPlaying:pit=calm,Do you see that, Pit? A wonderful servant-mistress relationship.
2-female_removing_minor,target:zone-tan=thinking,(<i>Are there really people who are "into" feet?</i>)
2-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=thinking,I wouldn't know about the softness, but I dig the motif of it.
2-female_removing_minor,target:winter,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:2-4=glad,I really should get versed in other languages.
2-female_removing_minor,target:jolyne,targetStage:1,targetTimeInStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=glad,It's not like she's lying to her self. She's just not in a hurry to admit it.
2-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3=teasing,Straight to the point. Good on you.
2-female_removing_minor,target:winter,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:weiss=thinking,Coming to this game in the first place shows a lack of dignity and grace. <i>I</i> should know.
2-female_removing_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:1=horny,On the contrary, this is what we all came to see, Natsuki.
2-female_removing_minor,target:clover,targetStage:0=tranquil,Ah, that must be it. There's only three dots on your face.
2-female_removing_minor,filter:kind=tranquil,Remember, ~name~: you gotta stay upbeat, upbeat, upbeat...
2-female_removed_minor=glad,Not gonna lie, I'm liking the way this has been going.
2-female_removed_minor=calm,Just keep doing what you're doing.
2-female_removed_minor,target:winter,targetStage:1=thinking,Then again, those sleeves didn't seem even remotely functional.
2-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:saki=calm,She seems like the type who plays a lot of single-player. Show her a good co-op, maybe?
2-female_removed_minor,target:sola,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:i_hope_my_family_never_hears_about_this=annoyed,For something like this? It's their loss.
2-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:footfet=worried,Apparently you're more into it than ~player~ is, for that matter...
2-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2,totalExposed:1-3=glad,So there are. Let's get you down to their level, okay?
2-female_removed_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:1=tranquil,Too late to worry about that now, I'm afraid. Playing the game might take your mind off it, though.
2-female_removed_minor,target:evie,targetStage:2=calm,How <i>cold</i> of you!
2-female_removed_minor,target:amalia,targetStage:3=tranquil,If you insist.
2-female_removed_minor,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:1=teasing,Now, now. We all knew ~player~ was into that, but that's no reason to call them out.
2-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:kira=worried,(Glad I'm not the only one who thinks so.)
2-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:4=thinking,Bit early for that. Or are the type to get off on this?
2-female_removed_minor,target:clover,targetStage:1=surprised,...Or maybe bad planning has a part in it.
2-female_removed_minor,target:aella,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:rinkah=thinking,A spar, huh? I bet Pit would want in on that.
2-female_removed_minor,target:nayru,targetStage:4=tranquil,Glad to see you're not taking the coward's way out.
2-female_removed_minor,target:jenetta,targetStage:3=teasing,Even you half-humans think the floor's cold! ALthough that may be my fault, for giving you all so much light...
2-female_removed_minor,target:sola,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:dont_tease_me=teasing,Clearly you don't know me.
2-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:socks=calm,Told you all.
2-female_removed_minor,target:clover,targetStage:2=glad,A shame. Such a warm-looking jacket.
2-female_removed_minor,target:aella,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,Maybe I ought to start playing poker with you, Pit. Teach you some humility.
2-female_removed_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2=tranquil,That certainly <i>does</i> make this more interesting.
2-female_removed_minor,target:rainbow_mika,count-pit:0=tranquil,A shame Pit didn't wind up at our table. Otherwise, I'd have him do the same for me!
2-female_removed_minor,target:mei,targetStage:3=calm,Yeah, that ~clothing~ didn't really do you justice.
2-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:mei=loss,I think it's just the atmosphere here...
2-female_removed_minor,target:winter,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=teasing,Now <i>there's</i> an idea! Turning this into a passionate scene of torn clothes and body-to-body contact... Certainly beats boring old cards.
2-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3=thinking,As a love fairy? That's questionable.
2-female_removed_minor,target:sola,targetStage:4=surprised,That thing on your panties. What is that? And where can I get one?
2-female_removed_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:2=calm,Technicalities aside, it's very fitting. If I ever wore one, I'm sure I'd be sweating like crazy!
2-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4=glad,How lazy.
2-female_removed_minor,target:winter,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=horny,And then there's the fact Weiss here lost everything almost immediately...
2-female_removed_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:3=glad,That goes both ways. Now you're closer to bigger things.
2-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:uravity=calm,Good call.
2-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2=calm,Relax, you're not even showing skin yet!
2-female_removed_minor,target:juri,targetStage:2=horny,Looking forward to it.
2-female_removed_minor,target:sola,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:im_actually_doing_this=tranquil,Key word being "yourself". You must not hate this if you've gone this far...
2-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=tranquil,Still, thanks for making this way more interesting!
2-female_removed_minor,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:gogo=thinking,(<i>Should I be listening to this conversation?</i>)
2-female_removed_minor,target:sola,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:zizou=thinking,(That was probably more a jab at her panties, anyway.)
2-female_removed_minor,target:sola,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:down_they_go=glad,You're acting like you had any to begin with, Ms. In-A-Strip-Poker-Game.
2-female_removed_minor,target:moon,targetStage:5=worried,She hasn't responded at all. Maybe she's deaf?
2-female_removed_minor,target:raven,targetStage:1=teasing,Then just stay in the air, pyschic girl.
2-female_removed_minor,target:raven,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=awkward,Dungeons... aren't fun.
2-female_removed_minor,target:elaine,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:chun-li=surprised,Hey! We aren't supposed to talk about that!
2-female_removed_minor,target:sola,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:please_dont_be_too_rough=teasing,At most, I'll question your decision to come here wearing such childish panties.
2-female_removed_minor,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:2=worried,I'd rather not see the secrets behind that flower...
2-female_removed_minor,target:jenetta,targetStage:4=awkward,Oh. Well, no one's tearing those tonight... I think.
2-female_removed_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=calm,It defies all laws of nature! So, I'm guessing magic?
2-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:3=calm,Cardigan works. And is apparently synonymous with "on the floor".
2-female_removed_minor,target:winter,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=calm,You're not doing bad so far, kid. You got a hit in on your sister with... minimal loss.
2-female_removed_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:pit=angry,The <i>better</i> goddess commands you to not do that.
2-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=calm,Oh yeah, you'd <i>definitely</i> be a Flintlock Staff main.
2-female_removed_minor,target:winter,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:weiss=awkward,Keep trying. Although this might not end well for either of you...
2-female_removed_minor,target:aella,targetStage:3=teasing,Ah yes. Very white. Fashionable.
2-female_removed_minor,target:jolyne,targetStage:2=tranquil,Well, it hardly matters. Although not wearing socks might come back to bite you.
2-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:innuendo=thinking,Well, not every joke needs to be explained. But most jokes tend to have, you know, punchlines.
2-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=thinking,Those burns are pretty severe. If you like, I can take you to the Rewind Spring and get them patched up.
2-female_removed_minor,target:juri,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:chun-li=calm,Ah, unrequited love.
2-female_removed_minor,target:rainbow_mika,alsoPlaying:pit=horny,Maybe I <i>should</i> have you remove my clothes for me... nah, just kidding.
2-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3=glad,I don't really plan on moving from this spot, so...
2-female_removed_minor,target:winter,targetStage:3=glad,Well, we can't even see your feet, so is that really important right now?
2-female_removed_minor,target:zone-tan=glad,Good. We wouldn't want to cause any trouble, riiiiight?
2-female_removed_minor,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=calm,Ooh, aren't we excited? Okay, let's play, little oracle.
2-female_removed_minor,target:elaine,targetStage:3=glad,Pistols are still a little pirate-y anyway.
2-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2loss=tranquil,Yeah, that's about what I expected. I knew you didn't have it in you.
2-female_removed_minor,target:miko,targetStage:1=teasing,Are you just playing dumb? Because her timing was a little <i>too</i> perfect.

3-female_removing_minor,target:winter,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:weiss=calm,She's a natural. Either that or a shark.
3-female_removing_minor,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:gogo=surprised,(<i>Four hours?!</i>)
3-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=thinking,I bet with how good you are with that thing, you'd probably be really good in Light vs. Dark.
3-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3=teasing,Straight to the point. Good on you.
3-female_removing_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:2loss=teasing,Alright, I'll call your bluff. I'll even walk you to the door.
3-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=thinking,Still can't believe <i>this</i> is how you're choosing to strip.
3-female_removed_minor=glad,The night is still young, I guess. It's still anyone's game!
3-female_removed_minor=thinking,Too early to celebrate.
3-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4=glad,How lazy.
3-female_removed_minor,target:juri,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:chun-li=calm,Ah, unrequited love.
3-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=calm,Oh yeah, you'd <i>definitely</i> be a Flintlock Staff main.
3-female_removed_minor,target:aella,targetStage:3=teasing,Ah yes. Very white. Fashionable.
3-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3=thinking,As a love fairy? That's questionable.
3-female_removed_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:pit=angry,The <i>better</i> goddess commands you to not do that.
3-female_removed_minor,target:winter,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=calm,You're not doing bad so far, kid. You got a hit in on your sister with... minimal loss.
3-female_removed_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:3=glad,That goes both ways. Now you're closer to bigger things.
3-female_removed_minor,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:1=teasing,Now, now. We all knew ~player~ was into that, but that's no reason to call them out.
3-female_removed_minor,target:amalia,targetStage:3=tranquil,If you insist.
3-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:footfet=worried,Apparently you're more into it than ~player~ is, for that matter...
3-female_removed_minor,target:moon,targetStage:5=worried,She hasn't responded at all. Maybe she's deaf?
3-female_removed_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=calm,It defies all laws of nature! So, I'm guessing magic?
3-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:uravity=calm,Good call.
3-female_removed_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:2=calm,Technicalities aside, it's very fitting. If I ever wore one, I'm sure I'd be sweating like crazy!
3-female_removed_minor,target:aella,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,Maybe I ought to start playing poker with you, Pit. Teach you some humility.
3-female_removed_minor,target:clover,targetStage:2=glad,A shame. Such a warm-looking jacket.
3-female_removed_minor,target:clover,targetStage:1=surprised,...Or maybe bad planning has a part in it.
3-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:3=calm,Cardigan works. And is apparently synonymous with "on the floor".
3-female_removed_minor,target:winter,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=teasing,Now <i>there's</i> an idea! Turning this into a passionate scene of torn clothes and body-to-body contact... Certainly beats boring old cards.
3-female_removed_minor,target:jenetta,targetStage:3=teasing,Even you half-humans think the floor's cold! ALthough that may be my fault, for giving you all so much light...
3-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:mei=loss,I think it's just the atmosphere here...
3-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2=calm,Relax, you're not even showing skin yet!
3-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:kira=worried,(Glad I'm not the only one who thinks so.)
3-female_removed_minor,target:juri,targetStage:2=horny,Looking forward to it.
3-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:saki=calm,She seems like the type who plays a lot of single-player. Show her a good co-op, maybe?
3-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:4=thinking,Bit early for that. Or are the type to get off on this?
3-female_removed_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:1=tranquil,Too late to worry about that now, I'm afraid. Playing the game might take your mind off it, though.
3-female_removed_minor,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:2=worried,I'd rather not see the secrets behind that flower...
3-female_removed_minor,target:winter,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=horny,And then there's the fact Weiss here lost everything almost immediately...
3-female_removed_minor,target:nayru,targetStage:4=tranquil,Glad to see you're not taking the coward's way out.
3-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3=glad,I don't really plan on moving from this spot, so...
3-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=tranquil,Still, thanks for making this way more interesting!
3-female_removed_minor,target:sola,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:please_dont_be_too_rough=teasing,At most, I'll question your decision to come here wearing such childish panties.
3-female_removed_minor,target:mei,targetStage:3=calm,Yeah, that ~clothing~ didn't really do you justice.
3-female_removed_minor,target:jenetta,targetStage:4=awkward,Oh. Well, no one's tearing those tonight... I think.
3-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:innuendo=thinking,Well, not every joke needs to be explained. But most jokes tend to have, you know, punchlines.
3-female_removed_minor,target:aella,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:rinkah=thinking,A spar, huh? I bet Pit would want in on that.
3-female_removed_minor,target:winter,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:weiss=awkward,Keep trying. Although this might not end well for either of you...
3-female_removed_minor,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:gogo=thinking,(<i>Should I be listening to this conversation?</i>)
3-female_removed_minor,target:sola,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:im_actually_doing_this=tranquil,Key word being "yourself". You must not hate this if you've gone this far...
3-female_removed_minor,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=calm,Ooh, aren't we excited? Okay, let's play, little oracle.
3-female_removed_minor,target:sola,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:i_hope_my_family_never_hears_about_this=annoyed,For something like this? It's their loss.
3-female_removed_minor,target:sola,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:down_they_go=glad,You're acting like you had any to begin with, Ms. In-A-Strip-Poker-Game.
3-female_removed_minor,target:rainbow_mika,count-pit:0=tranquil,A shame Pit didn't wind up at our table. Otherwise, I'd have him do the same for me!
3-female_removed_minor,target:elaine,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:chun-li=surprised,Hey! We aren't supposed to talk about that!
3-female_removed_minor,target:elaine,targetStage:3=glad,Pistols are still a little pirate-y anyway.
3-female_removed_minor,target:sola,targetStage:4=surprised,That thing on your panties. What is that? And where can I get one?
3-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2loss=tranquil,Yeah, that's about what I expected. I knew you didn't have it in you.
3-female_removed_minor,target:jolyne,targetStage:2=tranquil,Well, it hardly matters. Although not wearing socks might come back to bite you.
3-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=thinking,Those burns are pretty severe. If you like, I can take you to the Rewind Spring and get them patched up.
3-female_removed_minor,target:sola,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:dont_tease_me=teasing,Clearly you don't know me.
3-female_removed_minor,target:evie,targetStage:2=calm,How <i>cold</i> of you!
3-female_removed_minor,target:raven,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=awkward,Dungeons... aren't fun.
3-female_removed_minor,target:miko,targetStage:1=teasing,Are you just playing dumb? Because her timing was a little <i>too</i> perfect.
3-female_removed_minor,target:winter,targetStage:3=glad,Well, we can't even see your feet, so is that really important right now?
3-female_removed_minor,target:raven,targetStage:1=teasing,Then just stay in the air, pyschic girl.
3-female_removed_minor,target:zone-tan=glad,Good. We wouldn't want to cause any trouble, riiiiight?
3-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2,totalExposed:1-3=glad,So there are. Let's get you down to their level, okay?
3-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:socks=calm,Told you all.
3-female_removed_minor,target:winter,targetStage:1=thinking,Then again, those sleeves didn't seem even remotely functional.
3-female_removed_minor,target:sola,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:zizou=thinking,(That was probably more a jab at her panties, anyway.)
3-female_removed_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2=tranquil,That certainly <i>does</i> make this more interesting.
3-female_removed_minor,target:rainbow_mika,alsoPlaying:pit=horny,Maybe I <i>should</i> have you remove my clothes for me... nah, just kidding.

4-male_removing_minor=tranquil,Tell me, ~name~; have you ever been a pallbearer?
4-male_removing_minor=worried,...I was expecting something bigger, honestly.
4-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:0,totalRounds:0-3,count-aggressive:1=glad,Yes, we can all see that. Believe me, I'm cold as ice right now.
4-male_removing_minor,target:9s,targetStage:1=teasing,Sacrificing the warmth of your feet for fairness?
4-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:0=calm,Ooh, how formal!
4-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:1=glad,Everybody has shoes. Had to happen eventually.
4-male_removing_minor,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba=glad,You two are way more entertaining than you should be together.
4-male_removing_minor,target:pit,targetStage:2=surprised,What, no good shoes, Pit? I thought you'd want to look your best for this.
4-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:1,totalRounds:0-3,count-aggressive:1=annoyed,Well, it's not like we expect you to whip off your pants right away.
4-male_removed_minor=angry,You <i>really</i> seem to like letting us down.
4-male_removed_minor=annoyed,I don't know why I bother sometimes.
4-male_removed_minor,target:9s,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:futaba,count-pit:1=calm,It sounds exactly like you, Pit.
4-male_removed_minor,target:9s,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:futaba=thinking,Bit of an odd name, in my opinion. What oath are you keeping?
4-male_removed_minor,target:pit,targetStage:3=teasing,Looks like you're out of small stuff now... unless you're hiding something in that tunic of yours.
4-male_removed_minor,target:9s,targetStage:2=tranquil,What a good boy you are. Actual humans could learn a thing or two from you.
4-male_removed_minor,target:xander,targetStage:1=glad,You've got enthusiasm, if nothing else.
4-male_removed_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:2=teasing,Think you're safe? That's cute.
4-male_removed_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:1=thinking,"Zomg"? I don't get it.
4-male_removed_minor,target:9s,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,Don't feel bad. Pit never uses his tactical network at full capacity.
4-female_removing_minor=thinking,I <i>guess</i> I can see why you chose that.
4-female_removing_minor=tranquil,Ah, the "boring but practical" route.
4-female_removing_minor,target:nayru,targetStage:3=teasing,Trust me, Nayru. I know better than to doubt a follower of a friend.
4-female_removing_minor,target:elaine,targetStage:2=thinking,One of those big, oversized ones, I'm guessing?
4-female_removing_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:2=teasing,Touching the floor is usually a feeling everyone knows.
4-female_removing_minor,target:moon,targetStage:4=glad,Ah, yes. The chicken hat. Sorry, Torchic hat.
4-female_removing_minor,filter:kind=tranquil,Remember, ~name~: you gotta stay upbeat, upbeat, upbeat...
4-female_removing_minor,target:rainbow_mika,count-pit:0=surprised,Oh! Is Nadeshiko your servant?
4-female_removing_minor,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:1=annoyed,We've all heard the joke a thousand times.
4-female_removing_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=thinking,It's still amazing to me how controlled these burns are...
4-female_removing_minor,target:winter,targetStage:2=glad,Wise pick. Although a bit forced.
4-female_removing_minor,target:miko,targetStage:0=surprised,You're having a servant strip you? That seems... lazy.
4-female_removing_minor,target:winter,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey now! Winter jackets are essential for you! Or so I hear.
4-female_removing_minor,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:0=angry,I know what you really are. So all I'll say is: don't try anything.
4-female_removing_minor,target:zone-tan=thinking,(<i>Are there really people who are "into" feet?</i>)
4-female_removing_minor,target:clover,targetStage:1=teasing,If only it were that easy to manipulate luck.
4-female_removing_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:1=horny,On the contrary, this is what we all came to see, Natsuki.
4-female_removing_minor,target:jenetta,targetStage:3=surprised,Really? Well, if you can sew an entirely new apron before you lose again, I'd let you wear it out of respect alone!
4-female_removing_minor,target:lux,targetStage:2=thinking,(<i>Whenever I hear the name "Lux", all I can think of is the Chariot Master's horse.</i>)
4-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,That sounds fun! In fact, you two ought to just go home in each other's clothes!
4-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2=horny,I <i>could</i> tell you what ~player~'s thinking, but where's the fun in that?
4-female_removing_minor,target:jenetta,targetStage:2=thinking,(Maybe you should invest in pants...)
4-female_removing_minor,target:nayru,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=teasing,Take your time. I know it'll be worth it...
4-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:uravity=teasing,Who, little Chiaki? She's harmless.
4-female_removing_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:2loss=teasing,Alright, I'll call your bluff. I'll even walk you to the door.
4-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:wiifitfemale=surprised,...How do you know that?
4-female_removing_minor,target:sola,targetStage:3=thinking,So much desperation in your voice... you really hate this, huh?
4-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:sorg,alsoPlaying:pit=tranquil,Great! And you've saved us from Pit making a "gloves coming off" joke for another round!
4-female_removing_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2=thinking,How about you keep it simple?
4-female_removing_minor,target:jolyne,targetStage:1=glad,Boots. A cornerstone of any self-respecting adventurer. Am I wrong?
4-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:sorg=glad,Not that it'll matter in the end, but go on.
4-female_removing_minor,target:juri,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:chun-li=tranquil,Yeah, I like to know the score, too.
4-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:socks=teasing,I know love fairy anatomy, Kyu. And I also know they tend to be pathological liars.
4-female_removing_minor,target:rainbow_mika,alsoPlaying:pit=calm,Do you see that, Pit? A wonderful servant-mistress relationship.
4-female_removing_minor,target:sola,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:zizou=glad,Well, they're impressive, I admit. For an amateur.
4-female_removing_minor,target:juri,targetStage:1=teasing,Clothes are clothes, Juri. It'll all come off eventually.
4-female_removing_minor,target:clover,targetStage:0=tranquil,Ah, that must be it. There's only three dots on your face.
4-female_removing_minor,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:gogo=surprised,(<i>Four hours?!</i>)
4-female_removing_minor,target:winter,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:weiss=calm,She's a natural. Either that or a shark.
4-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,Don't mind him. That's pretty much his natural state.
4-female_removing_minor,target:amy_rose,targetStage:2=annoyed,For a species all about speed, you sure seem to be dragging this out.
4-female_removing_minor,target:winter,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:weiss=thinking,Coming to this game in the first place shows a lack of dignity and grace. <i>I</i> should know.
4-female_removing_minor,target:winter,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:2-4=glad,I really should get versed in other languages.
4-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3=teasing,Straight to the point. Good on you.
4-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=thinking,I bet with how good you are with that thing, you'd probably be really good in Light vs. Dark.
4-female_removing_minor,target:jolyne,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:xander,alsoPlayingStage:0=tranquil,Careful. He might just be buttering you up.
4-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=thinking,Still can't believe <i>this</i> is how you're choosing to strip.
4-female_removing_minor,target:winter,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=calm,Probably. Tina's more of a performer, not a serious fighter.
4-female_removing_minor,target:aella,targetStage:2=annoyed,You <i>guess</i>. You either do it or not. Hurry up now, time's wasting.
4-female_removing_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:1=glad,Ah, a sweater. Very good.
4-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=thinking,I wouldn't know about the softness, but I dig the motif of it.
4-female_removing_minor,target:jolyne,targetStage:1,targetTimeInStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=glad,It's not like she's lying to her self. She's just not in a hurry to admit it.
4-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3=teasing,Do you always talk with something in your mouth?
4-female_removing_minor,target:raven,targetStage:0=annoyed,Spare us the edge, please. I get enough of that with Pittoo around...
4-female_removing_minor,target:amalia,targetStage:2=glad,Boots aren't the first thing I'd call those.
4-female_removing_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:0=calm,A blazer's a bit cooler than the usual shoes or ribbons. I approve.
4-female_removing_minor,target:amalia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:faye,alsoPlayingStage:4-5=calm,Checking for cheaters? Not a bad plan.
4-female_removed_minor=glad,I won't hold it against you, but let's see something better later!
4-female_removed_minor=horny,Maybe it's a bit hypocritical to complain, but it's in my nature to tease, you know?
4-female_removed_minor,target:raven,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=awkward,Dungeons... aren't fun.

4-female_removed_minor,target:sola,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:please_dont_be_too_rough=teasing,At most, I'll question your decision to come here wearing such childish panties.
4-female_removed_minor,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:1=teasing,Now, now. We all knew ~player~ was into that, but that's no reason to call them out.
4-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3=glad,I don't really plan on moving from this spot, so...
4-female_removed_minor,target:aella,targetStage:3=teasing,Ah yes. Very white. Fashionable.
4-female_removed_minor,target:winter,targetStage:3=glad,Well, we can't even see your feet, so is that really important right now?
4-female_removed_minor,target:jenetta,targetStage:4=awkward,Oh. Well, no one's tearing those tonight... I think.
4-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:socks=calm,Told you all.
4-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=calm,Oh yeah, you'd <i>definitely</i> be a Flintlock Staff main.
4-female_removed_minor,target:amalia,targetStage:3=tranquil,If you insist.
4-female_removed_minor,target:raven,targetStage:1=teasing,Then just stay in the air, pyschic girl.
4-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=tranquil,Still, thanks for making this way more interesting!
4-female_removed_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=calm,It defies all laws of nature! So, I'm guessing magic?
4-female_removed_minor,target:mei,targetStage:3=calm,Yeah, that ~clothing~ didn't really do you justice.
4-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:innuendo=thinking,Well, not every joke needs to be explained. But most jokes tend to have, you know, punchlines.
4-female_removed_minor,target:juri,targetStage:2=horny,Looking forward to it.

5-male_removing_minor=tranquil,Time for a sacrifice!
5-male_removing_minor=teasing,So sorry about that.
5-male_removing_minor,target:9s,targetStage:1=teasing,Sacrificing the warmth of your feet for fairness?
5-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:1=glad,Everybody has shoes. Had to happen eventually.
5-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:1,totalRounds:0-3,count-aggressive:1=annoyed,Well, it's not like we expect you to whip off your pants right away.
5-male_removing_minor,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba=glad,You two are way more entertaining than you should be together.
5-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:0=calm,Ooh, how formal!
5-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:0,totalRounds:0-3,count-aggressive:1=glad,Yes, we can all see that. Believe me, I'm cold as ice right now.
5-male_removing_minor,target:pit,targetStage:2=surprised,What, no good shoes, Pit? I thought you'd want to look your best for this.
5-male_removed_minor=calm,That'll do, ~name~. That'll do.
5-male_removed_minor=horny,Now let's have more of that, shall we?
5-male_removed_minor,target:9s,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,Don't feel bad. Pit never uses his tactical network at full capacity.
5-male_removed_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:1=thinking,"Zomg"? I don't get it.
5-male_removed_minor,target:pit,targetStage:3=teasing,Looks like you're out of small stuff now... unless you're hiding something in that tunic of yours.
5-male_removed_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:2=teasing,Think you're safe? That's cute.
5-male_removed_minor,target:9s,targetStage:2=tranquil,What a good boy you are. Actual humans could learn a thing or two from you.
5-male_removed_minor,target:xander,targetStage:1=glad,You've got enthusiasm, if nothing else.
5-male_removed_minor,target:9s,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:futaba=thinking,Bit of an odd name, in my opinion. What oath are you keeping?
5-male_removed_minor,target:9s,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:futaba,count-pit:1=calm,It sounds exactly like you, Pit.
5-female_removing_minor=glad,I don't want to come off as pushy, but that was kind of lame.
5-female_removing_minor=thinking,No worries... all these small victories add up, you know.
5-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=thinking,I bet with how good you are with that thing, you'd probably be really good in Light vs. Dark.
5-female_removing_minor,target:rainbow_mika,alsoPlaying:pit=calm,Do you see that, Pit? A wonderful servant-mistress relationship.
5-female_removing_minor,target:jolyne,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:xander,alsoPlayingStage:0=tranquil,Careful. He might just be buttering you up.
5-female_removing_minor,target:sola,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:zizou=glad,Well, they're impressive, I admit. For an amateur.
5-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:sorg,alsoPlaying:pit=tranquil,Great! And you've saved us from Pit making a "gloves coming off" joke for another round!
5-female_removing_minor,target:jolyne,targetStage:1,targetTimeInStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=glad,It's not like she's lying to her self. She's just not in a hurry to admit it.
5-female_removing_minor,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:gogo=surprised,(<i>Four hours?!</i>)
5-female_removing_minor,target:amalia,targetStage:2=glad,Boots aren't the first thing I'd call those.
5-female_removing_minor,target:winter,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:weiss=calm,She's a natural. Either that or a shark.
5-female_removing_minor,target:aella,targetStage:2=annoyed,You <i>guess</i>. You either do it or not. Hurry up now, time's wasting.
5-female_removing_minor,target:winter,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:2-4=glad,I really should get versed in other languages.
5-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=thinking,Still can't believe <i>this</i> is how you're choosing to strip.
5-female_removing_minor,target:winter,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:weiss=thinking,Coming to this game in the first place shows a lack of dignity and grace. <i>I</i> should know.
5-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:socks=teasing,I know love fairy anatomy, Kyu. And I also know they tend to be pathological liars.
5-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,Don't mind him. That's pretty much his natural state.
5-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:sorg=glad,Not that it'll matter in the end, but go on.
5-female_removing_minor,target:winter,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=calm,Probably. Tina's more of a performer, not a serious fighter.
5-female_removing_minor,target:raven,targetStage:0=annoyed,Spare us the edge, please. I get enough of that with Pittoo around...
5-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:wiifitfemale=surprised,...How do you know that?
5-female_removing_minor,target:amy_rose,targetStage:2=annoyed,For a species all about speed, you sure seem to be dragging this out.
5-female_removing_minor,target:amalia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:faye,alsoPlayingStage:5-5=calm,Checking for cheaters? Not a bad plan.
5-female_removing_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:2loss=teasing,Alright, I'll call your bluff. I'll even walk you to the door.
5-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:uravity=teasing,Who, little Chiaki? She's harmless.
5-female_removing_minor,target:lux,targetStage:2=thinking,(<i>Whenever I hear the name "Lux", all I can think of is the Chariot Master's horse.</i>)
5-female_removing_minor,target:juri,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:chun-li=tranquil,Yeah, I like to know the score, too.
5-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,That sounds fun! In fact, you two ought to just go home in each other's clothes!
5-female_removing_minor,target:nayru,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=teasing,Take your time. I know it'll be worth it...
5-female_removing_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:1=horny,On the contrary, this is what we all came to see, Natsuki.
5-female_removing_minor,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:1=annoyed,We've all heard the joke a thousand times.
5-female_removing_minor,target:winter,targetStage:2=glad,Wise pick. Although a bit forced.
5-female_removing_minor,target:clover,targetStage:0=tranquil,Ah, that must be it. There's only three dots on your face.
5-female_removing_minor,target:jenetta,targetStage:2=thinking,(Maybe you should invest in pants...)
5-female_removing_minor,target:sola,targetStage:3=thinking,So much desperation in your voice... you really hate this, huh?
5-female_removing_minor,target:moon,targetStage:4=glad,Ah, yes. The chicken hat. Sorry, Torchic hat.
5-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3=teasing,Straight to the point. Good on you.
5-female_removing_minor,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:0=angry,I know what you really are. So all I'll say is: don't try anything.
5-female_removing_minor,target:jolyne,targetStage:1=glad,Boots. A cornerstone of any self-respecting adventurer. Am I wrong?
5-female_removing_minor,target:elaine,targetStage:2=thinking,One of those big, oversized ones, I'm guessing?
5-female_removing_minor,target:clover,targetStage:1=teasing,If only it were that easy to manipulate luck.
5-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=thinking,I wouldn't know about the softness, but I dig the motif of it.
5-female_removing_minor,target:juri,targetStage:1=teasing,Clothes are clothes, Juri. It'll all come off eventually.
5-female_removing_minor,target:nayru,targetStage:3=teasing,Trust me, Nayru. I know better than to doubt a follower of a friend.
5-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3=teasing,Do you always talk with something in your mouth?
5-female_removing_minor,target:jenetta,targetStage:3=surprised,Really? Well, if you can sew an entirely new apron before you lose again, I'd let you wear it out of respect alone!
5-female_removing_minor,filter:kind=tranquil,Remember, ~name~: you gotta stay upbeat, upbeat, upbeat...
5-female_removing_minor,target:winter,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey now! Winter jackets are essential for you! Or so I hear.
5-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2=horny,I <i>could</i> tell you what ~player~'s thinking, but where's the fun in that?
5-female_removing_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:1=glad,Ah, a sweater. Very good.
5-female_removing_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:0=calm,A blazer's a bit cooler than the usual shoes or ribbons. I approve.
5-female_removing_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2=thinking,How about you keep it simple?
5-female_removing_minor,target:zone-tan=thinking,(<i>Are there really people who are "into" feet?</i>)
5-female_removing_minor,target:miko,targetStage:0=surprised,You're having a servant strip you? That seems... lazy.
5-female_removing_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=thinking,It's still amazing to me how controlled these burns are...
5-female_removing_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:2=teasing,Touching the floor is usually a feeling everyone knows.
5-female_removing_minor,target:rainbow_mika,count-pit:0=surprised,Oh! Is Nadeshiko your servant?
5-female_removed_minor=tranquil,What'll happen next? Find out...right now!
5-female_removed_minor=teasing,Are you feeling the shame yet?
5-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2=calm,Relax, you're not even showing skin yet!
5-female_removed_minor,target:elaine,targetStage:3=glad,Pistols are still a little pirate-y anyway.
5-female_removed_minor,target:winter,targetStage:3=glad,Well, we can't even see your feet, so is that really important right now?
5-female_removed_minor,target:jenetta,targetStage:4=awkward,Oh. Well, no one's tearing those tonight... I think.
5-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2,totalExposed:1-3=glad,So there are. Let's get you down to their level, okay?
5-female_removed_minor,target:rainbow_mika,alsoPlaying:pit=horny,Maybe I <i>should</i> have you remove my clothes for me... nah, just kidding.
5-female_removed_minor,target:sola,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:zizou=thinking,(That was probably more a jab at her panties, anyway.)
5-female_removed_minor,target:clover,targetStage:2=glad,A shame. Such a warm-looking jacket.
5-female_removed_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:2=calm,Technicalities aside, it's very fitting. If I ever wore one, I'm sure I'd be sweating like crazy!
5-female_removed_minor,target:raven,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=awkward,Dungeons... aren't fun.
5-female_removed_minor,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:gogo=thinking,(<i>Should I be listening to this conversation?</i>)
5-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:footfet=worried,Apparently you're more into it than ~player~ is, for that matter...
5-female_removed_minor,target:zone-tan=glad,Good. We wouldn't want to cause any trouble, riiiiight?
5-female_removed_minor,target:elaine,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:chun-li=surprised,Hey! We aren't supposed to talk about that!
5-female_removed_minor,target:miko,targetStage:1=teasing,Are you just playing dumb? Because her timing was a little <i>too</i> perfect.
5-female_removed_minor,target:winter,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:weiss=awkward,Keep trying. Although this might not end well for either of you...
5-female_removed_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:pit=angry,The <i>better</i> goddess commands you to not do that.
5-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:4=thinking,Bit early for that. Or are the type to get off on this?
5-female_removed_minor,target:juri,targetStage:2=horny,Looking forward to it.
5-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:socks=calm,Told you all.
5-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=calm,Oh yeah, you'd <i>definitely</i> be a Flintlock Staff main.
5-female_removed_minor,target:aella,targetStage:3=teasing,Ah yes. Very white. Fashionable.
5-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=tranquil,Still, thanks for making this way more interesting!
5-female_removed_minor,target:mei,targetStage:3=calm,Yeah, that ~clothing~ didn't really do you justice.
5-female_removed_minor,target:jolyne,targetStage:2=tranquil,Well, it hardly matters. Although not wearing socks might come back to bite you.
5-female_removed_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2=tranquil,That certainly <i>does</i> make this more interesting.
5-female_removed_minor,target:amalia,targetStage:3=tranquil,If you insist.
5-female_removed_minor,target:evie,targetStage:2=calm,How <i>cold</i> of you!
5-female_removed_minor,target:nayru,targetStage:4=tranquil,Glad to see you're not taking the coward's way out.
5-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=thinking,Those burns are pretty severe. If you like, I can take you to the Rewind Spring and get them patched up.
5-female_removed_minor,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=calm,Ooh, aren't we excited? Okay, let's play, little oracle.
5-female_removed_minor,target:winter,targetStage:1=thinking,Then again, those sleeves didn't seem even remotely functional.
5-female_removed_minor,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:1=teasing,Now, now. We all knew ~player~ was into that, but that's no reason to call them out.
5-female_removed_minor,target:jenetta,targetStage:3=teasing,Even you half-humans think the floor's cold! ALthough that may be my fault, for giving you all so much light...
5-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3=thinking,As a love fairy? That's questionable.
5-female_removed_minor,target:rainbow_mika,count-pit:0=tranquil,A shame Pit didn't wind up at our table. Otherwise, I'd have him do the same for me!
5-female_removed_minor,target:sola,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:im_actually_doing_this=tranquil,Key word being "yourself". You must not hate this if you've gone this far...
5-female_removed_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=calm,It defies all laws of nature! So, I'm guessing magic?
5-female_removed_minor,target:sola,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:i_hope_my_family_never_hears_about_this=annoyed,For something like this? It's their loss.
5-female_removed_minor,target:sola,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:down_they_go=glad,You're acting like you had any to begin with, Ms. In-A-Strip-Poker-Game.
5-female_removed_minor,target:sola,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:dont_tease_me=teasing,Clearly you don't know me.
5-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4=glad,How lazy.
5-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2loss=tranquil,Yeah, that's about what I expected. I knew you didn't have it in you.
5-female_removed_minor,target:juri,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:chun-li=calm,Ah, unrequited love.
5-female_removed_minor,target:raven,targetStage:1=teasing,Then just stay in the air, pyschic girl.
5-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:innuendo=thinking,Well, not every joke needs to be explained. But most jokes tend to have, you know, punchlines.
5-female_removed_minor,target:sola,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:please_dont_be_too_rough=teasing,At most, I'll question your decision to come here wearing such childish panties.
5-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3=glad,I don't really plan on moving from this spot, so...
5-female_removed_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:3=glad,That goes both ways. Now you're closer to bigger things.
5-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:uravity=calm,Good call.
5-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:3=calm,Cardigan works. And is apparently synonymous with "on the floor".
5-female_removed_minor,target:aella,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:rinkah=thinking,A spar, huh? I bet Pit would want in on that.
5-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:kira=worried,(Glad I'm not the only one who thinks so.)
5-female_removed_minor,target:winter,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=teasing,Now <i>there's</i> an idea! Turning this into a passionate scene of torn clothes and body-to-body contact... Certainly beats boring old cards.
5-female_removed_minor,target:clover,targetStage:1=surprised,...Or maybe bad planning has a part in it.
5-female_removed_minor,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:2=worried,I'd rather not see the secrets behind that flower...
5-female_removed_minor,target:moon,targetStage:5=worried,She hasn't responded at all. Maybe she's deaf?
5-female_removed_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:1=tranquil,Too late to worry about that now, I'm afraid. Playing the game might take your mind off it, though.
5-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:saki=calm,She seems like the type who plays a lot of single-player. Show her a good co-op, maybe?
5-female_removed_minor,target:sola,targetStage:4=surprised,That thing on your panties. What is that? And where can I get one?
5-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:mei=loss,I think it's just the atmosphere here...
5-female_removed_minor,target:winter,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=calm,You're not doing bad so far, kid. You got a hit in on your sister with... minimal loss.
5-female_removed_minor,target:aella,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,Maybe I ought to start playing poker with you, Pit. Teach you some humility.
5-female_removed_minor,target:winter,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=horny,And then there's the fact Weiss here lost everything almost immediately...

6-female_removing_minor,target:winter,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:weiss=thinking,Coming to this game in the first place shows a lack of dignity and grace. <i>I</i> should know.
6-female_removing_minor,target:jolyne,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:xander,alsoPlayingStage:0=tranquil,Careful. He might just be buttering you up.
6-female_removing_minor,target:elaine,targetStage:2=thinking,One of those big, oversized ones, I'm guessing?
6-female_removing_minor,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:gogo=surprised,(<i>Four hours?!</i>)
6-female_removing_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2=thinking,How about you keep it simple?
6-female_removing_minor,target:miko,targetStage:0=surprised,You're having a servant strip you? That seems... lazy.
6-female_removing_minor,target:lux,targetStage:2=thinking,(<i>Whenever I hear the name "Lux", all I can think of is the Chariot Master's horse.</i>)
6-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:socks=teasing,I know love fairy anatomy, Kyu. And I also know they tend to be pathological liars.
6-female_removing_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:2=teasing,Touching the floor is usually a feeling everyone knows.
6-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2=horny,I <i>could</i> tell you what ~player~'s thinking, but where's the fun in that?
6-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:sorg=glad,Not that it'll matter in the end, but go on.
6-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:sorg,alsoPlaying:pit=tranquil,Great! And you've saved us from Pit making a "gloves coming off" joke for another round!
6-female_removing_minor,target:jenetta,targetStage:2=thinking,(Maybe you should invest in pants...)
6-female_removing_minor,target:jenetta,targetStage:3=surprised,Really? Well, if you can sew an entirely new apron before you lose again, I'd let you wear it out of respect alone!
6-female_removing_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:1=glad,Ah, a sweater. Very good.
6-female_removing_minor,target:amalia,targetStage:2=glad,Boots aren't the first thing I'd call those.
6-female_removing_minor,target:zone-tan=thinking,(<i>Are there really people who are "into" feet?</i>)
6-female_removing_minor,target:winter,targetStage:2=glad,Wise pick. Although a bit forced.
6-female_removing_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:1=horny,On the contrary, this is what we all came to see, Natsuki.
6-female_removing_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:2loss=teasing,Alright, I'll call your bluff. I'll even walk you to the door.
6-female_removing_minor,target:jolyne,targetStage:1,targetTimeInStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=glad,It's not like she's lying to her self. She's just not in a hurry to admit it.
6-female_removing_minor,target:rainbow_mika,alsoPlaying:pit=calm,Do you see that, Pit? A wonderful servant-mistress relationship.
6-female_removing_minor,target:amalia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:faye,alsoPlayingStage:6-5=calm,Checking for cheaters? Not a bad plan.
6-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=thinking,I bet with how good you are with that thing, you'd probably be really good in Light vs. Dark.
6-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3=teasing,Straight to the point. Good on you.
6-female_removing_minor,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:1=annoyed,We've all heard the joke a thousand times.
6-female_removing_minor,target:rainbow_mika,count-pit:0=surprised,Oh! Is Nadeshiko your servant?
6-female_removing_minor,target:winter,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey now! Winter jackets are essential for you! Or so I hear.
6-female_removing_minor,target:clover,targetStage:0=tranquil,Ah, that must be it. There's only three dots on your face.
6-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,That sounds fun! In fact, you two ought to just go home in each other's clothes!
6-female_removed_minor=worried,I didn't think I was doing <i>that</i> badly...
6-female_removed_minor=worried,Gotta admit, you're doing pretty good right now, ~name~.
6-female_removed_minor,target:sola,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:please_dont_be_too_rough=teasing,At most, I'll question your decision to come here wearing such childish panties.
6-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4=glad,How lazy.
6-female_removed_minor,target:rainbow_mika,count-pit:0=tranquil,A shame Pit didn't wind up at our table. Otherwise, I'd have had him do the same for me!
6-female_removed_minor,target:aella,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:rinkah=thinking,A spar, huh? I bet Pit would want in on that.
6-female_removed_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=calm,It defies all laws of nature! So, I'm guessing magic?
6-female_removed_minor,target:jenetta,targetStage:3=teasing,Even you half-humans think the floor's cold! ALthough that may be my fault, for giving you all so much light...
6-female_removed_minor,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:2=worried,I'd rather not see the secrets behind that flower...
6-female_removed_minor,target:sola,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:i_hope_my_family_never_hears_about_this=annoyed,For something like this? It's their loss.
6-female_removed_minor,target:raven,targetStage:1=teasing,Then just stay in the air, pyschic girl.
6-female_removed_minor,target:sola,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:down_they_go=glad,You're acting like you had any to begin with, Ms. In-A-Strip-Poker-Game.
6-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=thinking,Those burns are pretty severe. If you like, I can take you to the Rewind Spring and get them patched up.
6-female_removed_minor,target:aella,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,Maybe I ought to start playing poker with you, Pit. Teach you some humility.
6-female_removed_minor,target:winter,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=teasing,Now <i>there's</i> an idea! Turning this into a passionate scene of torn clothes and body-to-body contact... Certainly beats boring old cards.
6-female_removed_minor,target:winter,targetStage:1=thinking,Then again, those sleeves didn't seem even remotely functional.
6-female_removed_minor,target:clover,targetStage:1=surprised,...Or maybe bad planning has a part in it.
6-female_removed_minor,target:evie,targetStage:2=calm,How <i>cold</i> of you!
6-female_removed_minor,target:sola,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:dont_tease_me=teasing,Clearly you don't know me.
6-female_removed_minor,target:sola,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:im_actually_doing_this=tranquil,Key word being "yourself". You must not hate this if you've gone this far...
6-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:3=calm,Cardigan works. And is apparently synonymous with "on the floor".
6-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3=thinking,As a love fairy? That's questionable.
6-female_removed_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:3=glad,That goes both ways. Now you're closer to bigger things.
6-female_removed_minor,target:amalia,targetStage:3=tranquil,If you insist.
6-female_removed_minor,target:juri,targetStage:2=horny,Looking forward to it.
6-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2loss=tranquil,Yeah, that's about what I expected. I knew you didn't have it in you.
6-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:footfet=worried,Apparently you're more into it than ~player~ is, for that matter...
6-female_removed_minor,target:nayru,targetStage:4=tranquil,Glad to see you're not taking the coward's way out.
6-female_removed_minor,target:sola,targetStage:4=surprised,That thing on your panties. What is that? And where can I get one?
6-female_removed_minor,target:mei,targetStage:3=calm,Yeah, that ~clothing~ didn't really do you justice.
6-female_removed_minor,target:miko,targetStage:1=teasing,Are you just playing dumb? Because her timing was a little <i>too</i> perfect.
6-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=calm,Oh yeah, you'd <i>definitely</i> be a Flintlock Staff main.
6-female_removed_minor,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:gogo=thinking,(<i>Should I be listening to this conversation?</i>)
6-female_removed_minor,target:elaine,targetStage:3=glad,Pistols are still a little pirate-y anyway.
6-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:mei=loss,I think it's just the atmosphere here...
6-female_removed_minor,target:jolyne,targetStage:2=tranquil,Well, it hardly matters. Although not wearing socks might come back to bite you.
6-female_removed_minor,target:sola,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:zizou=thinking,(That was probably more a jab at her panties, anyway.)
6-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:saki=calm,She seems like the type who plays a lot of single-player. Show her a good co-op, maybe?
6-female_removed_minor,target:zone-tan=glad,Good. We wouldn't want to cause any trouble, riiiiight?
6-female_removed_minor,target:elaine,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:chun-li=surprised,Hey! We aren't supposed to talk about that!
6-female_removed_minor,target:moon,targetStage:5=worried,She hasn't responded at all. Maybe she's deaf?
6-female_removed_minor,target:winter,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=horny,And then there's the fact Weiss here lost everything almost immediately...
6-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:4=thinking,Bit early for that. Or are the type to get off on this?
6-female_removed_minor,target:winter,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:weiss=awkward,Keep trying. Although this might not end well for either of you...
6-female_removed_minor,target:clover,targetStage:2=glad,A shame. Such a warm-looking jacket.
6-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=tranquil,Still, thanks for making this way more interesting!
6-female_removed_minor,target:aella,targetStage:3=teasing,Ah yes. Very white. Fashionable.
6-female_removed_minor,target:raven,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=awkward,Dungeons... aren't fun.
6-female_removed_minor,target:jenetta,targetStage:4=awkward,Oh. Well, no one's tearing those tonight... I think.
6-female_removed_minor,target:rainbow_mika,alsoPlaying:pit=horny,Maybe I <i>should</i> have made you remove my clothes for me... nah, just kidding.
6-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:uravity=calm,Good call.
6-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2=calm,Relax, you're not even showing skin yet!
6-female_removed_minor,target:juri,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:chun-li=calm,Ah, unrequited love.
6-female_removed_minor,target:winter,targetStage:3=glad,Well, we can't even see your feet, so is that really important right now?
6-female_removed_minor,target:winter,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=calm,You're not doing bad so far, kid. You got a hit in on your sister with... minimal loss.
6-female_removed_minor,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=calm,Ooh, aren't we excited? Okay, let's play, little oracle.
6-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:kira=worried,(Glad I'm not the only one who thinks so.)
6-female_removed_minor,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:1=teasing,Now, now. We all knew ~player~ was into that, but that's no reason to call them out.
6-female_removed_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2=tranquil,That certainly <i>does</i> make this more interesting.
6-female_removed_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:pit=angry,The <i>better</i> goddess commands you to not do that.
6-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2,totalExposed:1-3=glad,So there are. Let's get you down to their level, okay?
6-female_removed_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:1=tranquil,Too late to worry about that now, I'm afraid. Playing the game might take your mind off it, though.
6-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:innuendo=thinking,Well, not every joke needs to be explained. But most jokes tend to have, you know, punchlines.
6-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3=glad,I don't really plan on moving from this spot, so...
6-female_removed_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:2=calm,Technicalities aside, it's very fitting. If I ever wore one, I'm sure I'd be sweating like crazy!
6-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:socks=calm,Told you all.

-3-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:1,totalRounds:0-3,count-aggressive:1=annoyed,Well, it's not like we expect you to whip off your pants right away.

-3-male_removed_minor=angry,Just you wait, ~name~: I can make a comeback yet!
-3-male_removed_minor,target:9s,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:futaba=thinking,Bit of an odd name, in my opinion. What oath are you keeping?
-3-male_removed_minor,target:9s,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,Don't feel bad. Pit never uses his tactical network at full capacity.
-3-male_removed_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:1=thinking,"Zomg"? I don't get it.

-3-male_removed_minor,target:9s,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:futaba,count-pit:1=calm,It sounds exactly like you, Pit.
-3-male_removed_minor,target:pit,targetStage:3=teasing,Looks like you're out of small stuff now... unless you're hiding something in that tunic of yours.
-3-female_removing_minor=angry,I see that look in your eye! Don't think you're hot stuff just 'cause I'm naked!
-3-female_removing_minor=worried,You still had that left... and here I am in all my glory...
-3-female_removing_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:2=teasing,Touching the floor is usually a feeling everyone knows.

-3-female_removing_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=thinking,It's still amazing to me how controlled these burns are...
-3-female_removing_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:0=calm,A blazer's a bit cooler than the usual shoes or ribbons. I approve.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:amalia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:faye,alsoPlayingStage:7-5=calm,Checking for cheaters? Not a bad plan.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:jolyne,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:xander,alsoPlayingStage:0=tranquil,Careful. He might just be buttering you up.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:jenetta,targetStage:3=surprised,Really? Well, if you can sew an entirely new apron before you lose again, I'd let you wear it out of respect alone!
-3-female_removing_minor,target:winter,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=calm,Probably. Tina's more of a performer, not a serious fighter.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:jolyne,targetStage:1,targetTimeInStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=glad,It's not like she's lying to her self. She's just not in a hurry to admit it.

-3-female_removing_minor,target:amy_rose,targetStage:2=annoyed,For a species all about speed, you sure seem to be dragging this out.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:winter,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:weiss=calm,She's a natural. Either that or a shark.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=thinking,I wouldn't know about the softness, but I dig the motif of it.

-3-female_removing_minor,target:sola,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:zizou=glad,Well, they're impressive, I admit. For an amateur.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:juri,targetStage:1=teasing,Clothes are clothes, Juri. It'll all come off eventually.

-3-female_removed_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:pit=angry,The <i>better</i> goddess commands you to not do that.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:juri,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:chun-li=calm,Ah, unrequited love.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:uravity=calm,Good call.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:saki=calm,She seems like the type who plays a lot of single-player. Show her a good co-op, maybe?
-3-female_removed_minor,target:moon,targetStage:5=worried,She hasn't responded at all. Maybe she's deaf?
-3-female_removed_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:1=tranquil,Too late to worry about that now, I'm afraid. Playing the game might take your mind off it, though.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:kira=worried,(Glad I'm not the only one who thinks so.)
-3-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:mei=loss,I think it's just the atmosphere here...
-3-female_removed_minor,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:2=worried,I'd rather not see the secrets behind that flower...
-3-female_removed_minor,target:aella,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,Maybe I ought to start playing poker with you, Pit. Teach you some humility.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:aella,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:rinkah=thinking,A spar, huh? I bet Pit would want in on that.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:winter,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=teasing,Now <i>there's</i> an idea! Turning this into a passionate scene of torn clothes and body-to-body contact... Certainly beats boring old cards.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:winter,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=horny,And then there's the fact Weiss here lost everything almost immediately...
-3-female_removed_minor,target:winter,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=calm,You're not doing bad so far, kid. You got a hit in on your sister with... minimal loss.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:2=calm,Technicalities aside, it's very fitting. If I ever wore one, I'm sure I'd be sweating like crazy!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:1=teasing,Now, now. We all knew ~player~ was into that, but that's no reason to call them out.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:elaine,targetStage:3=glad,Pistols are still a little pirate-y anyway.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:nayru,targetStage:4=tranquil,Glad to see you're not taking the coward's way out.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:socks=calm,Told you all.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:zone-tan=glad,Good. We wouldn't want to cause any trouble, riiiiight?
-3-female_removed_minor,target:mei,targetStage:3=calm,Yeah, that ~clothing~ didn't really do you justice.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:rainbow_mika,count-pit:0=tranquil,A shame Pit didn't wind up at our table. Otherwise, I'd have had him do the same for me!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=thinking,Those burns are pretty severe. If you like, I can take you to the Rewind Spring and get them patched up.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=calm,Ooh, aren't we excited? Okay, let's play, little oracle.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:evie,targetStage:2=calm,How <i>cold</i> of you!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:sola,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:please_dont_be_too_rough=teasing,At most, I'll question your decision to come here wearing such childish panties.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2=tranquil,That certainly <i>does</i> make this more interesting.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:sola,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:im_actually_doing_this=tranquil,Key word being "yourself". You must not hate this if you've gone this far...
-3-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:innuendo=thinking,Well, not every joke needs to be explained. But most jokes tend to have, you know, punchlines.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:winter,targetStage:1=thinking,Then again, those sleeves didn't seem even remotely functional.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:sola,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:i_hope_my_family_never_hears_about_this=annoyed,For something like this? It's their loss.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:jenetta,targetStage:3=teasing,Even you half-humans think the floor's cold! ALthough that may be my fault, for giving you all so much light...
-3-female_removed_minor,target:sola,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:down_they_go=glad,You're acting like you had any to begin with, Ms. In-A-Strip-Poker-Game.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:sola,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:dont_tease_me=teasing,Clearly you don't know me.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2loss=tranquil,Yeah, that's about what I expected. I knew you didn't have it in you.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=tranquil,Still, thanks for making this way more interesting!


#masturbating
-2-male_removing_minor=awkward,Oh for the love of...
-2-male_removing_minor=horny,I can read your thoughts, you know. Are you thinking anything... naughty?
-2-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:0,totalRounds:0-3,count-aggressive:1=glad,Yes, we can all see that. Believe me, I'm cold as ice right now.
-2-male_removing_minor,target:pit,targetStage:2=surprised,What, no good shoes, Pit? I thought you'd want to look your best for this.
-2-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:1,totalRounds:0-3,count-aggressive:1=annoyed,Well, it's not like we expect you to whip off your pants right away.
-2-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:0=calm,Ooh, how formal!
-2-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:1=glad,Everybody has shoes. Had to happen eventually.
-2-male_removed_minor=worried,Please, just take it all off already!
-2-male_removed_minor=heavy_a,Not enough, I'm afraid.
-2-male_removed_minor,target:pit,targetStage:3=teasing,Looks like you're out of small stuff now... unless you're hiding something in that tunic of yours.
-2-male_removed_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:2=teasing,Think you're safe? That's cute.
-2-male_removed_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:1=thinking,"Zomg"? I don't get it.
-2-female_removing_minor=masturbate_a,Hmm...can you say something dirty while you do it?
-2-female_removing_minor=calm,Hope you enjoyed the ~clothing~, ~name~!
-2-female_removing_minor,target:miko,targetStage:0=surprised,You're having a servant strip you? That seems... lazy.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2=thinking,How about you keep it simple?
-2-female_removing_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:1=horny,On the contrary, this is what we all came to see, Natsuki.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:raven,targetStage:0=tranquil,They're soon to be gone. Case in point: these boots.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:rainbow_mika,count-pit:0=surprised,Oh! Is Nadeshiko your servant?
-2-female_removing_minor,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:1=annoyed,We've all heard the joke a thousand times.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:nayru,targetStage:3=teasing,Trust me, Nayru. I know better than to doubt a follower of a friend.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:0=angry,I know what you really are. So all I'll say is: don't try anything.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:clover,targetStage:1=teasing,If only it were that easy to manipulate luck.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:juri,targetStage:1=teasing,Clothes are clothes, Juri. It'll all come off eventually.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:elaine,targetStage:2=thinking,One of those big, oversized ones, I'm guessing?
-2-female_removing_minor,target:jolyne,targetStage:1=glad,Boots. A cornerstone of any self-respecting adventurer. Am I wrong?
-2-female_removing_minor,target:moon,targetStage:4=glad,Ah, yes. The chicken hat. Sorry, Torchic hat.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:sola,targetStage:3=thinking,So much desperation in your voice... you really hate this, huh?
-2-female_removing_minor,target:winter,targetStage:2=glad,Wise pick. Although a bit forced.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:jenetta,targetStage:2=thinking,(Maybe you should invest in pants...)
-2-female_removing_minor,target:winter,targetStage:0=teasing,Hey now! Winter jackets are essential for you! Or so I hear.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:jenetta,targetStage:3=surprised,Really? Well, if you can sew an entirely new apron before you lose again, I'd let you wear it out of respect alone!
-2-female_removing_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=thinking,It's still amazing to me how controlled these burns are...
-2-female_removing_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:0=calm,A blazer's a bit cooler than the usual shoes or ribbons. I approve.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:2=teasing,Touching the floor is usually a feeling everyone knows.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:clover,targetStage:0=tranquil,Ah, that must be it. There's only three dots on your face.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3=teasing,Straight to the point. Good on you.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:juri,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:chun-li=tranquil,Yeah, I like to know the score, too.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3=teasing,Do you always talk with something in your mouth?
-2-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,Don't mind him. That's pretty much his natural state.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:sola,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:zizou=glad,Well, they're impressive, I admit. For an amateur.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:wiifitfemale=surprised,...How do you know that?
-2-female_removing_minor,target:winter,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:weiss=thinking,Coming to this game in the first place shows a lack of dignity and grace. <i>I</i> should know.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:uravity=teasing,Who, little Chiaki? She's harmless.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:winter,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:weiss=calm,She's a natural. Either that or a shark.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,That sounds fun! In fact, you two ought to just go home in each other's clothes!
-2-female_removing_minor,target:rainbow_mika,alsoPlaying:pit=calm,Do you see that, Pit? A wonderful servant-mistress relationship.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:socks=teasing,I know love fairy anatomy, Kyu. And I also know they tend to be pathological liars.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:sorg,alsoPlaying:pit=tranquil,Great! And you've saved us from Pit making a "gloves coming off" joke for another round!
-2-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=thinking,I wouldn't know about the softness, but I dig the motif of it.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:amalia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:faye,alsoPlayingStage:8-5=calm,Checking for cheaters? Not a bad plan.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:sorg=glad,Not that it'll matter in the end, but go on.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:nayru,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=teasing,Take your time. I know it'll be worth it...
-2-female_removing_minor,target:winter,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=calm,Probably. Tina's more of a performer, not a serious fighter.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:winter,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:2-4=glad,I really should get versed in other languages.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:jolyne,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:xander,alsoPlayingStage:0=tranquil,Careful. He might just be buttering you up.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:jolyne,targetStage:1,targetTimeInStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=glad,It's not like she's lying to her self. She's just not in a hurry to admit it.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:amalia,targetStage:2=glad,Boots aren't the first thing I'd call those.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2=horny,I <i>could</i> tell you what ~player~'s thinking, but where's the fun in that?
-2-female_removing_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:2loss=teasing,Alright, I'll call your bluff. I'll even walk you to the door.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:1=glad,Ah, a sweater. Very good.
-2-female_removed_minor=thinking,I'm still not that satisfied. I need more!
-2-female_removed_minor=annoyed,You mind picking up the pace? I want to see as many hands as possible...
-2-female_removed_minor,target:raven,targetStage:1=teasing,Then just stay in the air, pyschic girl.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:1=tranquil,Too late to worry about that now, I'm afraid. Playing the game might take your mind off it, though.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:jenetta,targetStage:4=awkward,Oh. Well, no one's tearing those tonight... I think.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:sola,targetStage:4=surprised,That thing on your panties. What is that? And where can I get one?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:jenetta,targetStage:3=teasing,Even you half-humans think the floor's cold! ALthough that may be my fault, for giving you all so much light...
-2-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:footfet=worried,Apparently you're more into it than ~player~ is, for that matter...
-2-female_removed_minor,target:sola,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:down_they_go=glad,You're acting like you had any to begin with, Ms. In-A-Strip-Poker-Game.

-2-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:socks=calm,Told you all.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:miko,targetStage:1=teasing,Are you just playing dumb? Because her timing was a little <i>too</i> perfect.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2,totalExposed:1-3=glad,So there are. Let's get you down to their level, okay?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:rainbow_mika,alsoPlaying:pit=horny,Maybe I <i>should</i> have you come help me... nah, just kidding.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:winter,targetStage:3=glad,Well, we can't even see your feet, so is that really important right now?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:elaine,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:chun-li=surprised,Hey! We aren't supposed to talk about that!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:winter,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:weiss=awkward,Keep trying. Although this might not end well for either of you...
-2-female_removed_minor,target:raven,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=awkward,Dungeons... aren't fun.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:sola,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:zizou=thinking,(That was probably more a jab at her panties, anyway.)

-2-female_removed_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:2=calm,Technicalities aside, it's very fitting. If I ever wore one, I'm sure I'd be sweating like crazy!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:sola,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:i_hope_my_family_never_hears_about_this=annoyed,For something like this? It's their loss.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:juri,targetStage:2=horny,Looking forward to it.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:clover,targetStage:2=glad,A shame. Such a warm-looking jacket.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:3=glad,That goes both ways. Now you're closer to bigger things.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:clover,targetStage:1=surprised,...Or maybe bad planning has a part in it.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:3=calm,Cardigan works. And is apparently synonymous with "on the floor".
-2-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2=calm,Relax, you're not even showing skin yet!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:4=thinking,Bit early for that. Or are the type to get off on this?

-1-female_removing_minor,target:jolyne,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:xander,alsoPlayingStage:0=tranquil,Careful. He might just be buttering you up.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:winter,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:2-4=glad,I really should get versed in other languages.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:winter,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=calm,Probably. Tina's more of a performer, not a serious fighter.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:amalia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:faye,alsoPlayingStage:9-5=calm,Checking for cheaters? Not a bad plan.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:sorg,alsoPlaying:pit=tranquil,Great! And you've saved us from Pit making a "gloves coming off" joke for another round!
-1-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,That sounds fun! In fact, you two ought to just go home in each other's clothes!
-1-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:uravity=teasing,Who, little Chiaki? She's harmless.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:wiifitfemale=surprised,...How do you know that?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=thinking,Still can't believe <i>this</i> is how you're choosing to strip.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,Don't mind him. That's pretty much his natural state.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:juri,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:chun-li=tranquil,Yeah, I like to know the score, too.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:nayru,targetStage:3=teasing,Trust me, Nayru. I know better than to doubt a follower of a friend.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:sola,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:zizou=glad,Well, they're impressive, I admit. For an amateur.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:amy_rose,targetStage:2=annoyed,For a species all about speed, you sure seem to be dragging this out.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:2loss=teasing,Alright, I'll call your bluff. I'll even walk you to the door.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:sorg=glad,Not that it'll matter in the end, but go on.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:lux,targetStage:2=thinking,(<i>Whenever I hear the name "Lux", all I can think of is the Chariot Master's horse.</i>)
-1-female_removing_minor,target:rainbow_mika,alsoPlaying:pit=calm,Do you see that, Pit? A wonderful servant-mistress relationship.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:winter,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:weiss=calm,She's a natural. Either that or a shark.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:winter,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:weiss=thinking,Coming to this game in the first place shows a lack of dignity and grace. <i>I</i> should know.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:socks=teasing,I know love fairy anatomy, Kyu. And I also know they tend to be pathological liars.
-1-female_removed_minor=tranquil,No wonder humans need gods watching over them.
-1-female_removed_minor=horny,You humans really are a fickle bunch, aren't you?
-1-female_removed_minor,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:1=teasing,Now, now. We all knew ~player~ was into that, but that's no reason to call them out.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:miko,targetStage:1=teasing,Are you just playing dumb? Because her timing was a little <i>too</i> perfect.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:rainbow_mika,count-pit:0=tranquil,A shame Pit didn't wind up at our table. Otherwise, maybe I'd make him do the same for me!
-1-female_removed_minor,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:2=worried,I'd rather not see the secrets behind that flower...
-1-female_removed_minor,target:zone-tan=glad,Good. We wouldn't want to cause any trouble, riiiiight?
-1-female_removed_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:2=calm,Technicalities aside, it's very fitting. If I ever wore one, I'm sure I'd be sweating like crazy!
-1-female_removed_minor,target:nayru,targetStage:4=tranquil,Glad to see you're not taking the coward's way out.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:1=tranquil,Too late to worry about that now, I'm afraid. Playing the game might take your mind off it, though.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:winter,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=calm,You're not doing bad so far, kid. You got a hit in on your sister with... minimal loss.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=thinking,Those burns are pretty severe. If you like, I can take you to the Rewind Spring and get them patched up.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:evie,targetStage:2=calm,How <i>cold</i> of you!
-1-female_removed_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2=tranquil,That certainly <i>does</i> make this more interesting.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:mei,targetStage:3=calm,Yeah, that ~clothing~ didn't really do you justice.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=tranquil,Still, thanks for making this way more interesting!
-1-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=calm,Oh yeah, you'd <i>definitely</i> be a Flintlock Staff main.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:amalia,targetStage:3=tranquil,If you insist.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3=thinking,As a love fairy? That's questionable.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4=glad,How lazy.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3=glad,I don't really plan on moving from this spot, so...
-1-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:4=thinking,Bit early for that. Or are the type to get off on this?
-1-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2=calm,Relax, you're not even showing skin yet!
-1-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:3=calm,Cardigan works. And is apparently synonymous with "on the floor".
-1-female_removed_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:3=glad,That goes both ways. Now you're closer to bigger things.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:clover,targetStage:1=surprised,...Or maybe bad planning has a part in it.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:clover,targetStage:2=glad,A shame. Such a warm-looking jacket.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:juri,targetStage:2=horny,Looking forward to it.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:jolyne,targetStage:2=tranquil,Well, it hardly matters. Although not wearing socks might come back to bite you.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:sola,targetStage:4=surprised,That thing on your panties. What is that? And where can I get one?
-1-female_removed_minor,target:jenetta,targetStage:4=awkward,Oh. Well, no one's tearing those tonight... I think.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:raven,targetStage:1=teasing,Then just stay in the air, pyschic girl.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:elaine,targetStage:3=glad,Pistols are still a little pirate-y anyway.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:jenetta,targetStage:3=teasing,Even you half-humans think the floor's cold! ALthough that may be my fault, for giving you all so much light...
-1-female_removed_minor,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=calm,Ooh, aren't we excited? Okay, let's play, little oracle.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:sola,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:please_dont_be_too_rough=teasing,At most, I'll question your decision to come here wearing such childish panties.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=calm,It defies all laws of nature! So, I'm guessing magic?
-1-female_removed_minor,target:sola,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:i_hope_my_family_never_hears_about_this=annoyed,For something like this? It's their loss.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:winter,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=horny,And then there's the fact Weiss here lost everything almost immediately...
-1-female_removed_minor,target:winter,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=teasing,Now <i>there's</i> an idea! Turning this into a passionate scene of torn clothes and body-to-body contact... Certainly beats boring old cards.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:moon,targetStage:5=worried,She hasn't responded at all. Maybe she's deaf?
-1-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:mei=loss,I think it's just the atmosphere here...
-1-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:kira=worried,(Glad I'm not the only one who thinks so.)
-1-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:saki=calm,She seems like the type who plays a lot of single-player. Show her a good co-op, maybe?
-1-female_removed_minor,target:sola,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:im_actually_doing_this=tranquil,Key word being "yourself". You must not hate this if you've gone this far...
-1-female_removed_minor,target:juri,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:chun-li=calm,Ah, unrequited love.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:pit=angry,The <i>better</i> goddess commands you to not do that.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:sola,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:zizou=thinking,(That was probably more a jab at her panties, anyway.)
-1-female_removed_minor,target:raven,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=awkward,Dungeons... aren't fun.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:winter,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:weiss=awkward,Keep trying. Although this might not end well for either of you...
-1-female_removed_minor,target:winter,targetStage:3=glad,Well, we can't even see your feet, so is that really important right now?
-1-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:uravity=calm,Good call.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:gogo=thinking,(<i>Should I be listening to this conversation?</i>)
-1-female_removed_minor,target:sola,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:down_they_go=glad,You're acting like you had any to begin with, Ms. In-A-Strip-Poker-Game.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:winter,targetStage:1=thinking,Then again, those sleeves didn't seem even remotely functional.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:sola,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:dont_tease_me=teasing,Clearly you don't know me.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:elaine,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:chun-li=surprised,Hey! We aren't supposed to talk about that!
-1-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:innuendo=thinking,Well, not every joke needs to be explained. But most jokes tend to have, you know, punchlines.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2loss=tranquil,Yeah, that's about what I expected. I knew you didn't have it in you.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:rainbow_mika,alsoPlaying:pit=horny,Maybe I <i>should</i> have you come clean me up... nah, just kidding.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2,totalExposed:1-3=glad,So there are. Let's get you down to their level, okay?
-1-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:footfet=worried,Apparently you're more into it than ~player~ is, for that matter...
-1-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:socks=calm,Told you all.




#OPPONENT REMOVING MAJOR CLOTHING
#Major clothing reveals a significant amount of skin and likely underwear.
#However, as we don't know if the opponent is taking off the top or the bottom, we can't presume that nice abs are showing; maybe she took of her skirt before her shirt.

#fully clothed
0-male_removing_major=annoyed,I can't properly enjoy this if there's no danger. A shame...
0-male_removing_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:5=calm,How nice are your legs compared to your abs, I wonder...
0-male_removing_major,target:human=horny,Let's see what you have under the hood, ~player~.
0-male_removing_major,target:9s,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:futaba=teasing,You wouldn't really want to turn to a life of crime, would you?
0-male_removing_major,target:9s,targetStage:3=thinking,Are shorts like those common with ordinary men? I know Pit has a similar pair.
0-male_removed_major=teasing,I must say, you're quite the looker, ~name~.
0-male_removed_major=teasing,I can't believe ~name~ took off his ~clothing~ this early. I must be a god at strip poker too!
0-male_removed_major=surprised,Wow ~name~! Your ~clothing~ is off already? You'll be naked anytime now at this rate!
0-male_removed_major,target:shaggy=worried,(<i>He just seems... greasy.</i>)
0-male_removed_major,target:link,targetStage:6=horny,I can see the appeal of the armorless run now...
0-male_removed_major,target:human=surprised,You're more toned than I thought...I'm impressed.
0-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:rinkah,count-futaba:1=glad,Surprisingly fun, right?
0-male_removed_major,filter:athletic=surprised,I must say, ~name~, you keep in <i>really</i> good shape. Even I'm impressed.
0-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:4=tranquil,How...specific.
0-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:pit,count-futaba:1=angry,Forget it, Pit. He protects humanity his way, we'll protect it ours.
0-male_removed_major,target:corrin_m,targetStage:5=horny,Your, ahem, little dragon is peeking out, Corrin.
0-male_removed_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:6=tranquil,Look at him, so bashful! Just like Pit, really.
0-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:futaba=awkward,I wouldn't know anything about stealing hearts...but I guess it's not as severe as the alternatives.
0-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,Yeah, that's about the response I expected from you.
0-female_removing_major=tranquil,You've gotta be throwing, right? There's no way I'm <i>this</i> good.
0-female_removing_major,target:jolyne,targetStage:2,targetTimeInStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=glad,It's not like she's lying to her self. She's just not in a hurry to admit it.
0-female_removing_major,target:winter,targetStage:3=teasing,Your composure's breaking. I thought you were supposed to be <i>the best</i>?
0-female_removing_major,target:juri,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:chun-li=thinking,Isn't it usually the criminal who does the admission?
0-female_removing_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:shantae=glad,Maybe ask before you take a catchphrase next time?
0-female_removing_major,target:winter,targetStage:4=surprised,You mean they're not separate? Great!
0-female_removing_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,Wings <i>do</i> help out in the coolness department.
0-female_removing_major,target:moon,targetStage:0=surprised,That's one strategy, although it might come back to bite you down the line.
0-female_removing_major,target:spooky,targetStage:1=teasing,Really, Ms. Hospital Gown? I hadn't noticed.
0-female_removing_major,target:elaine,targetStage:3=thinking,You know, I always wondered why he's named "Guybrush". It's like the epitome of naming him after whatever's in the room at the time.
0-female_removing_major,target:elaine,targetStage:4=horny,Oh! A twofer like that should really raise the stakes.
0-female_removing_major,target:elaine,targetStage:5=glad,I have experience with three-headed dragons. A monkey won't phase me.
0-female_removing_major,target:sola,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:zizou,count-elizabeth:1=glad,Not really. You're still only on your first console generation!
0-female_removing_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:7-8=teasing,You have more to worry about than Rinkah stripping her pants, right Hermione?
0-female_removing_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:3=glad,Not that I think a Hoshidan would worry too much over losing her pants, but this'll be interesting, to say the least.
0-female_removing_major,target:nayru,targetStage:4=thinking,...Veran? I swore it was someone else for a minute. Never mind.
0-female_removing_major,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:3=teasing,No. Because I already know the answer.
0-female_removing_major,target:miko,targetStage:4=horny,Now it's <i>really</i> getting intimate between you two.
0-female_removing_major,target:miko,targetStage:5=teasing,You almost did that automatically! Who's really controlling who here?
0-female_removing_major,target:sola,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:2-4=glad,So humans get it naturally, too. How wonderful.
0-female_removing_major,target:samus=surprised,Wait, Samus is a girl?
0-female_removing_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:florina,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=calm,Literally, with muscles like those.
0-female_removing_major,target:seven=glad,I take it you're the type who prefers utility over fashion.
0-female_removing_major,target:zone-tan=calm,So do you find those pants comfortable? I never really saw the appeal.
0-female_removing_major,target:aimee=angry,H-hey! Watch where you point that thing!
0-female_removing_major,target:winter,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:5-8=tranquil,Both Schnee sisters reduced to so little. It's almost funny, really.
0-female_removing_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5=thinking,(Is it really a "deck" when no one can stand on it?)
0-female_removing_major,target:miko,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:Undies01=horny,So you were mortal at some point?
0-female_removing_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4=thinking,(I'm confused why whoever's attacking her didn't target the big stuff from the start.)
0-female_removing_major,target:sayori,targetStage:3=calm,As I said, both ways.
0-female_removing_major,target:mercy,targetStage:2=glad,Aw, look at the humans, wanting to dress up like us. That's adorable.
0-female_removing_major,target:peach,targetStage:4=teasing,So is it going to be a black void, or something worth looking at?
0-female_removing_major,target:aella,targetStage:3=teasing,Really? How bold of you, Aella. Isn't it wiser for a human to have more protection?
0-female_removing_major,target:amalia,targetStage:1=surprised,I'm surprised. Going for the skirt? Bold move, wood girl.
0-female_removing_major,target:miko,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:Random01=tranquil,Indutiably, Miko.
0-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:2=thinking,Ah, so that's how that works.
0-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:3=glad,Hey, ~player~, take a guess what's in her pants. Three tries. Go!
0-female_removing_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:4=thinking,Is this one of those cases where you save the hairpin until the very end, or do you just not care?
0-female_removing_major,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=glad,So simple, yet so elegant.
0-female_removing_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4,targetTimeInStage:0,targetSaidMarker:dizzy=teasing,That ought to wake you up.
0-female_removing_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5=tranquil,This'll be just like the beach! I believe that's a familiar setting to you?
0-female_removing_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:4=teasing,Let me guess. Borrowed from a friend?
0-female_removing_major,target:sayori,targetStage:4=teasing,Try to imagine the competition in their underwear. Or less, perhaps?
0-female_removing_major,target:winter,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:weiss=calm,Well, it'll all be out in the open soon enough, right Weiss? Nothing hidden between sisters?
0-female_removing_major,target:clover,targetStage:2=thinking,You stopped. What is it?
0-female_removing_major,target:clover,targetStage:3=thinking,Yes, yes, we're all stupid. You've gotten that point across. Loudly, at that.
0-female_removing_major,target:clover,targetStage:4=worried,So you know Solid Snake? I hadn't met him in person until recently.
0-female_removing_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=glad,I think Tina's used to fighting in her underwear, so this works out great.
0-female_removing_major,target:juri,targetStage:0=glad,Pants already? Someone's bold.
0-female_removing_major,target:jolyne,targetStage:2=thinking,That outfit kind of makes no sense. So it covers as much as a bra, but it also has straps?
0-female_removing_major,target:sola,targetStage:2=surprised,Will that work? What about the hat... helmet... whatever?
0-female_removing_major,target:raven,targetStage:2=calm,So this counts as an unmasking, right?
0-female_removing_major,target:sola,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=thinking,(She had other options. Wonder why she didn't take them?)
0-female_removing_major,target:revy,targetStage:4=calm,Those pants were halfway off, anyway. It's not big in the slightest.
0-female_removing_major,target:jenetta,targetStage:4=glad,No, that looks a bit tricky.
0-female_removing_major,target:sola,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:zizou=surprised,I'm sorry, she did <i>what</i>?
0-female_removing_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:5=glad,Sure, sure. Whatever you say.
0-female_removing_major,target:raven,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:inventory_vibe2=glad,Still, you're not wrong, you know?
0-female_removing_major,target:winter,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:3-4=teasing,You think so? I didn't know eyes were so low...
0-female_removing_major,target:winter,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=teasing,Makes sense. I see Weiss doing a lot better than you, after all.
0-female_removed_major=teasing,I can't believe ~name~ took off her ~clothing~ this early. I must be a god at strip poker too!
0-female_removed_major=surprised,Oh...well...you did your best?
0-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=glad,No need to kick her while she's down, Winter. She's already lost hard.
0-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:jura=glad,I see space pirates have a rather... lax standard compared to humans.
0-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:6=tranquil,I appreciate your steward undressing with us as well.
0-female_removed_major,target:peach,targetStage:5=surprised,I remember your shorts being a lot... frillier.
0-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:weiss=calm,I think I'm in the mood for some chilled strawberries now. What about you two?
0-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:5=calm,Yes, yes. I've gone through this song and dance more times than I care to remember. Just play the game.
0-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:jura=angry,Frankly, you're starting to get on <i>my</i> nerves a little, too.
0-female_removed_major,target:chell,targetStage:4=worried,I was hoping you weren't wearing anything under your jumpsuit. Does that make me a bad person?
0-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:zizou=teasing,Pride isn't a good look for you, Zizou.
0-female_removed_major,target:jolyne,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:tina=worried,Thinking about your father <i>now</i>? I thought humans grew past that centuries ago.
0-female_removed_major,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:4=glad,Not much of a surprise, but that's how it goes, Alice.
0-female_removed_major,target:lilith,targetStage:6=calm,Your tattoo covers a lot more than I thought. It's pretty impressive, Lilith.
0-female_removed_major,target:juri,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:chun-li=glad,Really, don't do anything. those were just decoy pants anyway.
0-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:4=thinking,Now I'm curious. Does dango taste good?
0-female_removed_major,target:nayru,targetStage:5=worried,Still, this <i>may</i> be a problem. Should I intervene?
0-female_removed_major,target:misty,targetStage:3=calm,That's a nice bikini. Was the cerulean intentional?
0-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:wiifitfemale=thinking,Been a while since your last game, hasn't it, Trainer?
0-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2=surprised,...That was certainly different. I mean, I can transform others myself, but it's not often I see humans wielding that level of magic.
0-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=horny,Even smaller than I thought! Plus, since it's obvious what color your pubes are, it's almost like you're already bottomless!
0-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:mahiru=tranquil,What a... beautiful friendship you two have. Somehow pure, yet strong.
0-female_removed_major,target:elaine,targetStage:6=calm,Not at this stage, Elaine.
0-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=glad,Smooth.
0-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:pit=annoyed,Really, Pit. You need to expand your VG horizons.
0-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:pit=horny,Of course she didn't, Pit. You think someone who <i>planned</i> this would bring a back-up?
0-female_removed_major,target:jolyne,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:misato=calm,Really, who else would come to a game of strip poker dressed so... bizzarely?
0-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:weiss=worried,You have some weird priorities, Winter.
0-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:zoey=thinking,I don't see it. How so, Winter?
0-female_removed_major,target:mia=tranquil,Those are some nice words to live by.
0-female_removed_major,target:samus=teasing,I kid, I kid.
0-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:overcoat=glad,(She really could've just done the overcoat. And this girl's a mage?)
0-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:dress_off_now=thinking,But didn't you rush into stripping it without a second thought?
0-female_removed_major,target:rosalina=horny,Guess the galaxies were contained under that dress after all...
0-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:paying_you_some_tres=calm,I'm very particular about how I take my bribes. Sorry.
0-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:dress_is_next=calm,Taking it well, I see. Let's move on, then.
0-female_removed_major,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:aimee=teasing,Well, didn't you two get chummy quick.
0-female_removed_major,target:lyn=horny,Why don't you invite some of your sword lord friends next time, Lyn? With a body like that, imagine what Ike's packing...
0-female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:dizzylose=angry,Rise and shine, we got a game to play.
0-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:zoey=teasing,I don't think she'd be able to keep up with you, Rinkah.
0-female_removed_major,target:jasmine=glad,Oh yes. You had us all fooled. (<i>Did anyone really fall for it?</i>)
0-female_removed_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:5=tranquil,Is it already Nohrian Summer again?
0-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:pit=horny,What does Palutena think? I'll tell you what she thinks: she's just glad Pit's finally learning to appreciate the female body.
0-female_removed_major,target:daisy=surprised,I never took you for the "thong" type, Daisy. I imagine the sand must be irritating.
0-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:mahiru=worried,Is that photoworthy, Mahiru? Anyone could scrunch up their panties.
0-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:Undies02=calm,I get it. I'm rather old-fashioned in that regard, as well.
0-female_removed_major,target:d.va=horny,How many of your viewers would kill for this view, I wonder?
0-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:jura=teasing,Careful, Jura. You might get burned.
0-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=teasing,That's something a <i>cute</i> person would say.
0-female_removed_major,target:penny,targetStage:4=tranquil,It's cute, Penny! And it's comfortable? I should get a set for myself!
0-female_removed_major,target:alice=horny,Check out Little Miss Zebra over here! Clearly you were prepared to lose clothes tonight.
0-female_removed_major,target:elaine,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:jin=teasing,With a married woman? They were basically zero.
0-female_removed_major,target:spooky,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:chica=calm,Apparate schmapparate. You've got underwear, that's all that matters.
0-female_removed_major,target:chara,targetStage:5=tranquil,Well, nothing can stop <i>us</i> from getting it off of you.
0-female_removed_major,target:nayru,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=calm,Just shows off your natural beauty that much more...
0-female_removed_major,target:elaine,targetStage:5=teasing,I won't judge. But it <i>really</i> looks like you dressed up to take someone home...
0-female_removed_major,target:amalia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:mahiru=thinking,Your eye twitches when you look at Mahiru. Something the matter?
0-female_removed_major,target:aella,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,Is he wrong, Aella?
0-female_removed_major,target:clover,targetStage:3=teasing,Seems like our little plant here realized how to play the game.
0-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:2-3,totalMales:1-2=glad,Really? Maybe someone else will get lucky tonight, then.
0-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:buffy,alsoPlayingStage:2=glad,I guess you'd have to, seeing as it's your major strength.
0-female_removed_major,target:sayori,targetStage:4=glad,Just think of all the things you'll see when the rest of us lose!
0-female_removed_major,target:jolyne,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:4-7=glad,I know you kind of lost your costume and everything, but try and calm down a little.
0-female_removed_major,target:jolyne,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=calm,Ah, I know of Nirvana. One of those old stories the humans tried to use to explain the gods.
0-female_removed_major,target:jenetta,targetStage:5=thinking,Are beaches a natural environment for rabbits? Hmm. Viridi would probably know.
0-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:buffy,alsoPlayingStage:2=calm,You two keep on working out. The rest of us have a game to play.
0-female_removed_major,target:revy,targetStage:5=glad,That aside, let's finish this up.
0-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=angry,No wonder you're so... tightly wound. Remind me to take you to one once this is all over.
0-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:2-3=teasing,You say that, but I see you bending with each passing round.
0-female_removed_major,target:spooky,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:elaine,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=glad,Real beer's probably not much of an option for you, though. Maybe lite beer would work?
0-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3=teasing,Look at that! You're <i>not</i> just a pair of eyes and mouth in a void.
0-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meg,alsoPlayingStage:0-2=glad,Plus, you're almost the exact opposite of her, Meg.
0-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=teasing,On the other hand, you're perfectly content to stand here in your strawberry underwear? I see.
0-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3=awkward,You really could've gone with anything else.
0-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=teasing,You're really going to say this right now, Ms. Strawberry?
0-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=glad,Pirate ships aren't <i>that</i> bad.
0-female_removed_major,target:jolyne,targetStage:3=teasing,Conditioned to this, I take it? No wonder you dress so provocatively.
0-female_removed_major,target:clover,targetStage:4=glad,And yet here you are playing it. Ironic, isn't it?
0-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=calm,Have you seen some of the things in the Galactic Sea? Don't take her lightly.
0-female_removed_major,target:juri,targetStage:1=calm,A strong start, sure, but can you keep it up?
0-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=thinking,I admit, it's interesting to think about how her life would be different if she was born human.
0-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=calm,Does this workout include gratuitous use of a razor, too?
0-female_removed_major,target:clover,targetStage:5=calm,You don't have to worry about that. I'm bored already.
0-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:elena,alsoPlayingStage:6-7=calm,It says something that a goddess is more at ease than you, huh?
0-female_removed_major,target:sayori,targetStage:5=calm,You're looking a bit tense. Try not to overthink it. Just... go with the flow.
0-female_removed_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:6=teasing,Just keep digging that hole you're in.
0-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:elena,alsoPlayingStage:8=tranquil,Even <i>I'm</i> not exempt! What are you complaining about, Elena?
0-female_removed_major,target:elaine,targetStage:4=surprised,Garters <i>and</i> see-through? I suppose it makes sense for a formerly high class women.
0-female_removed_major,target:aella,targetStage:4=glad,Seems your confidence is starting to wane.
0-female_removed_major,target:sheena,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,Hey Pit, I finally found someone who can gush about hot springs with you!
0-female_removed_major,target:spooky,targetStage:2=thinking,Hmm... I hear chess is getting popular again.
0-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:marinette=tranquil,You know it, Marinette. You're more fashionable than you might think, Nagisa.
0-female_removed_major,target:amalia,targetStage:2=teasing,Although those panties are hardly natural...
0-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:yang,count-ruby:0=thinking,Who is this Qrow? Friend of yours? Lover, maybe?
0-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:ruby,count-yang:0=teasing,Are you really threatening a girl barely out of high school? That's just petty.
0-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:3=tranquil,It worked even better than I hoped!
0-female_removed_major,target:moon,targetStage:1=worried,Why are those nipple outlines so... crusty? It doesn't look even remotely healthy.
0-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:yang,count-ruby:1=calm,Qrow, huh? Didn't know these girls had a bird for an uncle.
0-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:shantae,alsoPlayingStage:8=glad,You've already given us a performance worthy of Azura. There's no need.
0-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=tranquil,But not all, of course.
0-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5=horny,A matching set? No wonder you were so adamant about hiding it.
0-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:shantae,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=thinking,Pretty sure the game's over if something happens to Azura anyway, but it's a good offer.
0-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5=teasing,So you mean you <i>don't</i> strip in front of your peers at class trials? Maybe you should try it. It'd certainly get you some more... influence.
0-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:4=tranquil,Strawberries, huh? Even the serious ones have a cute side!
0-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5-7=calm,I prefer an "in-between" look myself.
0-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=glad,It's not like Meia was trying to keep that hidden from us.
0-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:6=teasing,"Jugs" is putting it lightly.
0-female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:6=calm,But seriously, talk to whoever's in charge. That's probably the <i>last</i> set of underwear a battleship would wear... and that's a sentence that will probably never be muttered again.
0-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meg,alsoPlayingStage:0=tranquil,You two would make a <i>very</i> interesting team! The slow, heavy hitter and the quick guerilla fighter. Sounds a little familiar, though.
0-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:5-6=glad,All of you Fire Emblem characters stick together, I see.
0-female_removed_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:5=tranquil,I think you've overestimated the use of that shirt a little.
0-female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5=horny,Whoever built you must be really cheap to give you a bra like that, Shimakaze.
0-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:4-5=thinking,I don't get it either. Anyway, let's move on, shall we Rinkah?
0-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:4=calm,Did you guess that it really was a banana? You'd be right.
0-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:wiifitfemale=glad,I've burned through a few myself.
0-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:pay_you_to_keep_dress=tranquil,What's human money to a goddess?
0-female_removed_major,filter:athletic=calm,I must say, ~name~, you keep in pretty good shape. Do you use Wii Fit?
0-female_removed_major,target:spooky=glad,Yeaaahh... maybe this isn't such a good game for ghosts.
0-female_removed_major,target:weiss=horny,Sorry, Ice Queen. We're just getting started...
0-female_removed_major,target:sonya=teasing,I see you looking at Sonya, ~player~. Fan of a woman in uniform?
0-female_removed_major,target:aimee=surprised,Oh...good shot.
0-female_removed_major,target:zone-tan=glad,For someone so calm, you really have no shame, do you?


#lost armbands
1-male_removing_major=tranquil,I'm pleasantly surprised we've reached this stage already.
1-male_removing_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:5=calm,How nice are your legs compared to your abs, I wonder...
1-male_removing_major,target:9s,targetStage:3=thinking,Are shorts like those common with ordinary men? I know Pit has a similar pair.
1-male_removing_major,target:9s,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:futaba=teasing,You wouldn't really want to turn to a life of crime, would you?
1-male_removing_major,target:human=horny,Let's see what you have under the hood, ~player~.
1-male_removed_major=calm,Alright, let's keep the momentum going!
1-male_removed_major=teasing,I can't believe ~name~ took off his ~clothing~ this early. I must be a god at strip poker too!
1-male_removed_major=surprised,Wow ~name~! Your ~clothing~ is off already? You'll be naked anytime now at this rate!
1-male_removed_major,target:corrin_m,targetStage:5=horny,Your, ahem, little dragon is peeking out, Corrin.
1-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,Yeah, that's about the response I expected from you.
1-male_removed_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:6=tranquil,Look at him, so bashful! Just like Pit, really.
1-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:rinkah,count-futaba:1=glad,Surprisingly fun, right?
1-male_removed_major,target:link,targetStage:6=horny,I can see the appeal of the armorless run now...
1-male_removed_major,filter:athletic=surprised,I must say, ~name~, you keep in <i>really</i> good shape. Even I'm impressed.
1-male_removed_major,target:human=surprised,You're more toned than I thought...I'm impressed.
1-male_removed_major,target:shaggy=worried,(<i>He just seems... greasy.</i>)
1-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:pit,count-futaba:1=angry,Forget it, Pit. He protects humanity his way, we'll protect it ours.
1-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:4=tranquil,How...specific.
1-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:futaba=awkward,I wouldn't know anything about stealing hearts...but I guess it's not as severe as the alternatives.
1-female_removing_major=surprised,Already? Either I'm not getting something, or you're just bad at this.
1-female_removing_major,target:miko,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:Random01=tranquil,Indutiably, Miko.
1-female_removing_major,target:sola,targetStage:2=surprised,Will that work? What about the hat... helmet... whatever?
1-female_removing_major,target:sola,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:zizou=surprised,I'm sorry, she did <i>what</i>?
1-female_removing_major,target:raven,targetStage:2=calm,So this counts as an unmasking, right?
1-female_removing_major,target:revy,targetStage:4=calm,Those pants were halfway off, anyway. It's not big in the slightest.
1-female_removing_major,target:juri,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:chun-li=thinking,Isn't it usually the criminal who does the admission?
1-female_removing_major,target:jenetta,targetStage:4=glad,No, that looks a bit tricky.
1-female_removing_major,target:sayori,targetStage:3=calm,As I said, both ways.
1-female_removing_major,target:mercy,targetStage:2=glad,Aw, look at the humans, wanting to dress up like us. That's adorable.
1-female_removing_major,target:sayori,targetStage:4=teasing,Try to imagine the competition in their underwear. Or less, perhaps?
1-female_removing_major,target:jolyne,targetStage:2,targetTimeInStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=glad,It's not like she's lying to her self. She's just not in a hurry to admit it.
1-female_removing_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:shantae=glad,Maybe ask before you take a catchphrase next time?
1-female_removing_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4=thinking,(I'm confused why whoever's attacking her didn't target the big stuff from the start.)
1-female_removing_major,target:miko,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:Undies01=horny,So you were mortal at some point?
1-female_removing_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5=thinking,(Is it really a "deck" when no one can stand on it?)
1-female_removing_major,target:peach,targetStage:4=teasing,So is it going to be a black void, or something worth looking at?
1-female_removing_major,target:aella,targetStage:3=teasing,Really? How bold of you, Aella. Isn't it wiser for a human to have more protection?
1-female_removing_major,target:amalia,targetStage:1=surprised,I'm surprised. Going for the skirt? Bold move, wood girl.
1-female_removing_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=glad,I think Tina's used to fighting in her underwear, so this works out great.
1-female_removing_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:4=thinking,Is this one of those cases where you save the hairpin until the very end, or do you just not care?
1-female_removing_major,target:raven,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:inventory_vibe2=glad,Still, you're not wrong, you know?
1-female_removing_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5=tranquil,This'll be just like the beach! I believe that's a familiar setting to you?
1-female_removing_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:4=teasing,Let me guess. Borrowed from a friend?
1-female_removing_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4,targetTimeInStage:0,targetSaidMarker:dizzy=teasing,That ought to wake you up.
1-female_removing_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:5=glad,Sure, sure. Whatever you say.
1-female_removing_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,Wings <i>do</i> help out in the coolness department.
1-female_removing_major,target:clover,targetStage:3=thinking,Yes, yes, we're all stupid. You've gotten that point across. Loudly, at that.
1-female_removing_major,target:winter,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:weiss=calm,Well, it'll all be out in the open soon enough, right Weiss? Nothing hidden between sisters?
1-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:3=glad,Hey, ~player~, take a guess what's in her pants. Three tries. Go!
1-female_removing_major,target:clover,targetStage:4=worried,So you know Solid Snake? I hadn't met him in person until recently.
1-female_removing_major,target:juri,targetStage:0=glad,Pants already? Someone's bold.
1-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:2=thinking,Ah, so that's how that works.
1-female_removing_major,target:sola,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=thinking,(She had other options. Wonder why she didn't take them?)
1-female_removing_major,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=glad,So simple, yet so elegant.
1-female_removing_major,target:jolyne,targetStage:2=thinking,That outfit kind of makes no sense. So it covers as much as a bra, but it also has straps?
1-female_removing_major,target:clover,targetStage:2=thinking,You stopped. What is it?
1-female_removing_major,target:zone-tan=calm,So do you find those pants comfortable? I never really saw the appeal.
1-female_removing_major,target:miko,targetStage:5=teasing,You almost did that automatically! Who's really controlling who here?
1-female_removing_major,target:miko,targetStage:4=horny,Now it's <i>really</i> getting intimate between you two.
1-female_removing_major,target:winter,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=teasing,Makes sense. I see Weiss doing a lot better than you, after all.
1-female_removing_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:7-8=teasing,You have more to worry about than Rinkah stripping her pants, right Hermione?
1-female_removing_major,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:3=teasing,No. Because I already know the answer.
1-female_removing_major,target:sola,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:2-4=glad,So humans get it naturally, too. How wonderful.
1-female_removing_major,target:elaine,targetStage:3=thinking,You know, I always wondered why he's named "Guybrush". It's like the epitome of naming him after whatever's in the room at the time.
1-female_removing_major,target:winter,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:5-8=tranquil,Both Schnee sisters reduced to so little. It's almost funny, really.
1-female_removing_major,target:elaine,targetStage:5=glad,I have experience with three-headed dragons. A monkey won't phase me.
1-female_removing_major,target:nayru,targetStage:4=thinking,...Veran? I swore it was someone else for a minute. Never mind.
1-female_removing_major,target:elaine,targetStage:4=horny,Oh! A twofer like that should really raise the stakes.
1-female_removing_major,target:samus=surprised,Wait, Samus is a girl?
1-female_removing_major,target:aimee=angry,H-hey! Watch where you point that thing!
1-female_removing_major,target:spooky,targetStage:1=teasing,Really, Ms. Hospital Gown? I hadn't noticed.
1-female_removing_major,target:winter,targetStage:3=teasing,Your composure's breaking. I thought you were supposed to be <i>the best</i>?
1-female_removing_major,target:moon,targetStage:0=surprised,That's one strategy, although it might come back to bite you down the line.
1-female_removing_major,target:winter,targetStage:4=surprised,You mean they're not separate? Great!
1-female_removing_major,target:seven=glad,I take it you're the type who prefers utility over fashion.
1-female_removing_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:florina,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=calm,Literally, with muscles like those.
1-female_removing_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:3=glad,Not that I think a Hoshidan would worry too much over losing her pants, but this'll be interesting, to say the least.
1-female_removing_major,target:winter,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:3-4=teasing,You think so? I didn't know eyes were so low...
1-female_removing_major,target:sola,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:zizou,count-elizabeth:1=glad,Not really. You're still only on your first console generation!
1-female_removed_major=teasing,I can't believe ~name~ took off her ~clothing~ this early. I must be a god at strip poker too!
1-female_removed_major=teasing,Don't worry ~name~, I'll wrap this up before long.
1-female_removed_major,target:misty,targetStage:3=calm,That's a nice bikini. Was the cerulean intentional?
1-female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:6=calm,But seriously, talk to whoever's in charge. That's probably the <i>last</i> set of underwear a battleship would wear... and that's a sentence that will probably never be muttered again.
1-female_removed_major,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:4=glad,Not much of a surprise, but that's how it goes, Alice.
1-female_removed_major,target:clover,targetStage:5=calm,You don't have to worry about that. I'm bored already.
1-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:5=calm,Yes, yes. I've gone through this song and dance more times than I care to remember. Just play the game.
1-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:2-3,totalMales:1-2=glad,Really? Maybe someone else will get lucky tonight, then.
1-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=glad,No need to kick her while she's down, Winter. She's already lost hard.
1-female_removed_major,target:sayori,targetStage:4=glad,Just think of all the things you'll see when the rest of us lose!
1-female_removed_major,target:spooky,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:chica=calm,Apparate schmapparate. You've got underwear, that's all that matters.
1-female_removed_major,target:chara,targetStage:5=tranquil,Well, nothing can stop <i>us</i> from getting it off of you.
1-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:marinette=tranquil,You know it, Marinette. You're more fashionable than you might think, Nagisa.
1-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=angry,No wonder you're so... tightly wound. Remind me to take you to one once this is all over.
1-female_removed_major,target:elaine,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:jin=teasing,With a married woman? They were basically zero.
1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=glad,Smooth.
1-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:wiifitfemale=glad,I've burned through a few myself.
1-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:buffy,alsoPlayingStage:2=glad,I guess you'd have to, seeing as it's your major strength.
1-female_removed_major,target:mia=tranquil,Those are some nice words to live by.
1-female_removed_major,target:sayori,targetStage:5=calm,You're looking a bit tense. Try not to overthink it. Just... go with the flow.
1-female_removed_major,target:spooky=glad,Yeaaahh... maybe this isn't such a good game for ghosts.
1-female_removed_major,target:clover,targetStage:3=teasing,Seems like our little plant here realized how to play the game.
1-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=teasing,That's something a <i>cute</i> person would say.
1-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:pay_you_to_keep_dress=tranquil,What's human money to a goddess?
1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2=surprised,...That was certainly different. I mean, I can transform others myself, but it's not often I see humans wielding that level of magic.
1-female_removed_major,target:spooky,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:elaine,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=glad,Real beer's probably not much of an option for you, though. Maybe lite beer would work?
1-female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5=horny,Whoever built you must be really cheap to give you a bra like that, Shimakaze.
1-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:mahiru=tranquil,What a... beautiful friendship you two have. Somehow pure, yet strong.
1-female_removed_major,target:penny,targetStage:4=tranquil,It's cute, Penny! And it's comfortable? I should get a set for myself!
1-female_removed_major,target:clover,targetStage:4=glad,And yet here you are playing it. Ironic, isn't it?
1-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:6=tranquil,I appreciate your steward undressing with us as well.
1-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:pit=annoyed,Really, Pit. You need to expand your VG horizons.
1-female_removed_major,target:zone-tan=glad,For someone so calm, you really have no shame, do you?
1-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=tranquil,But not all, of course.
1-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:wiifitfemale=thinking,Been a while since your last game, hasn't it, Trainer?
1-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=calm,Does this workout include gratuitous use of a razor, too?
1-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:4=tranquil,Strawberries, huh? Even the serious ones have a cute side!
1-female_removed_major,target:jolyne,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:4-7=glad,I know you kind of lost your costume and everything, but try and calm down a little.
1-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3=awkward,You really could've gone with anything else.
1-female_removed_major,target:elaine,targetStage:5=teasing,I won't judge. But it <i>really</i> looks like you dressed up to take someone home...
1-female_removed_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:5=tranquil,Is it already Nohrian Summer again?
1-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:Undies02=calm,I get it. I'm rather old-fashioned in that regard, as well.
1-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:buffy,alsoPlayingStage:2=calm,You two keep on working out. The rest of us have a game to play.
1-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=teasing,On the other hand, you're perfectly content to stand here in your strawberry underwear? I see.
1-female_removed_major,target:lilith,targetStage:6=calm,Your tattoo covers a lot more than I thought. It's pretty impressive, Lilith.
1-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:jura=angry,Frankly, you're starting to get on <i>my</i> nerves a little, too.
1-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meg,alsoPlayingStage:0-2=glad,Plus, you're almost the exact opposite of her, Meg.
1-female_removed_major,target:chell,targetStage:4=worried,I was hoping you weren't wearing anything under your jumpsuit. Does that make me a bad person?
1-female_removed_major,target:elaine,targetStage:4=surprised,Garters <i>and</i> see-through? I suppose it makes sense for a formerly high class women.
1-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3=teasing,Look at that! You're <i>not</i> just a pair of eyes and mouth in a void.
1-female_removed_major,target:amalia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:mahiru=thinking,Your eye twitches when you look at Mahiru. Something the matter?
1-female_removed_major,target:moon,targetStage:1=worried,Why are those nipple outlines so... crusty? It doesn't look even remotely healthy.
1-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:zizou=teasing,Pride isn't a good look for you, Zizou.
1-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:2-3=teasing,You say that, but I see you bending with each passing round.
1-female_removed_major,target:revy,targetStage:5=glad,That aside, let's finish this up.
1-female_removed_major,target:jolyne,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:tina=worried,Thinking about your father <i>now</i>? I thought humans grew past that centuries ago.
1-female_removed_major,target:spooky,targetStage:2=thinking,Hmm... I hear chess is getting popular again.
1-female_removed_major,target:peach,targetStage:5=surprised,I remember your shorts being a lot... frillier.
1-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:zoey=thinking,I don't see it. How so, Winter?
1-female_removed_major,target:aella,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,Is he wrong, Aella?
1-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=teasing,You're really going to say this right now, Ms. Strawberry?
1-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=thinking,I admit, it's interesting to think about how her life would be different if she was born human.
1-female_removed_major,target:nayru,targetStage:5=worried,Still, this <i>may</i> be a problem. Should I intervene?
1-female_removed_major,target:juri,targetStage:1=calm,A strong start, sure, but can you keep it up?
1-female_removed_major,target:sheena,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,Hey Pit, I finally found someone who can gush about hot springs with you!
1-female_removed_major,target:juri,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:chun-li=glad,Really, don't do anything. those were just decoy pants anyway.
1-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:weiss=worried,You have some weird priorities, Winter.
1-female_removed_major,filter:athletic=calm,I must say, ~name~, you keep in pretty good shape. Do you use Wii Fit?
1-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=calm,Have you seen some of the things in the Galactic Sea? Don't take her lightly.
1-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:4=thinking,Now I'm curious. Does dango taste good?
1-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=horny,Even smaller than I thought! Plus, since it's obvious what color your pubes are, it's almost like you're already bottomless!
1-female_removed_major,target:jenetta,targetStage:5=thinking,Are beaches a natural environment for rabbits? Hmm. Viridi would probably know.
1-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:pit=horny,Of course she didn't, Pit. You think someone who <i>planned</i> this would bring a back-up?
1-female_removed_major,target:jolyne,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=calm,Ah, I know of Nirvana. One of those old stories the humans tried to use to explain the gods.
1-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:jura=glad,I see space pirates have a rather... lax standard compared to humans.
1-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=glad,Pirate ships aren't <i>that</i> bad.
1-female_removed_major,target:jolyne,targetStage:3=teasing,Conditioned to this, I take it? No wonder you dress so provocatively.
1-female_removed_major,target:elaine,targetStage:6=calm,Not at this stage, Elaine.
1-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5=horny,A matching set? No wonder you were so adamant about hiding it.
1-female_removed_major,target:jolyne,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:misato=calm,Really, who else would come to a game of strip poker dressed so... bizzarely?
1-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:weiss=calm,I think I'm in the mood for some chilled strawberries now. What about you two?
1-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:jura=teasing,Careful, Jura. You might get burned.
1-female_removed_major,target:aella,targetStage:4=glad,Seems your confidence is starting to wane.
1-female_removed_major,target:weiss=horny,Sorry, Ice Queen. We're just getting started...
1-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:dress_is_next=calm,Taking it well, I see. Let's move on, then.
1-female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:dizzylose=angry,Rise and shine, we got a game to play.
1-female_removed_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:6=teasing,Just keep digging that hole you're in.
1-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:mahiru=worried,Is that photoworthy, Mahiru? Anyone could scrunch up their panties.
1-female_removed_major,target:lyn=horny,Why don't you invite some of your sword lord friends next time, Lyn? With a body like that, imagine what Ike's packing...
1-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:elena,alsoPlayingStage:8=tranquil,Even <i>I'm</i> not exempt! What are you complaining about, Elena?
1-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:paying_you_some_tres=calm,I'm very particular about how I take my bribes. Sorry.
1-female_removed_major,target:rosalina=horny,Guess the galaxies were contained under that dress after all...
1-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:dress_off_now=thinking,But didn't you rush into stripping it without a second thought?
1-female_removed_major,target:d.va=horny,How many of your viewers would kill for this view, I wonder?
1-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:5-6=glad,All of you Fire Emblem characters stick together, I see.
1-female_removed_major,target:samus=teasing,I kid, I kid.
1-female_removed_major,target:nayru,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=calm,Just shows off your natural beauty that much more...
1-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:4=calm,Did you guess that it really was a banana? You'd be right.
1-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=glad,It's not like Meia was trying to keep that hidden from us.
1-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:pit=horny,What does Palutena think? I'll tell you what she thinks: she's just glad Pit's finally learning to appreciate the female body.
1-female_removed_major,target:jasmine=glad,Oh yes. You had us all fooled. (<i>Did anyone really fall for it?</i>)
1-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:overcoat=glad,(She really could've just done the overcoat. And this girl's a mage?)
1-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5-7=calm,I prefer an "in-between" look myself.
1-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:6=teasing,"Jugs" is putting it lightly.
1-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:3=tranquil,It worked even better than I hoped!
1-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:4-5=thinking,I don't get it either. Anyway, let's move on, shall we Rinkah?
1-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:shantae,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=thinking,Pretty sure the game's over if something happens to Azura anyway, but it's a good offer.
1-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:ruby,count-yang:0=teasing,Are you really threatening a girl barely out of high school? That's just petty.
1-female_removed_major,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:aimee=teasing,Well, didn't you two get chummy quick.
1-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:yang,count-ruby:0=thinking,Who is this Qrow? Friend of yours? Lover, maybe?
1-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:zoey=teasing,I don't think she'd be able to keep up with you, Rinkah.
1-female_removed_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:5=tranquil,I think you've overestimated the use of that shirt a little.
1-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meg,alsoPlayingStage:0=tranquil,You two would make a <i>very</i> interesting team! The slow, heavy hitter and the quick guerilla fighter. Sounds a little familiar, though.
1-female_removed_major,target:amalia,targetStage:2=teasing,Although those panties are hardly natural...
1-female_removed_major,target:daisy=surprised,I never took you for the "thong" type, Daisy. I imagine the sand must be irritating.
1-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:elena,alsoPlayingStage:6-7=calm,It says something that a goddess is more at ease than you, huh?
1-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:yang,count-ruby:1=calm,Qrow, huh? Didn't know these girls had a bird for an uncle.
1-female_removed_major,target:sonya=teasing,I see you looking at Sonya, ~player~. Fan of a woman in uniform?
1-female_removed_major,target:aimee=surprised,Oh...good shot.
1-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:shantae,alsoPlayingStage:8=glad,You've already given us a performance worthy of Azura. There's no need.
1-female_removed_major,target:alice=horny,Check out Little Miss Zebra over here! Clearly you were prepared to lose clothes tonight.
1-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5=teasing,So you mean you <i>don't</i> strip in front of your peers at class trials? Maybe you should try it. It'd certainly get you some more... influence.


#lost sandals
2-male_removing_major=teasing,The stakes have certainly been raised now!
2-male_removing_major,target:9s,targetStage:3=thinking,Are shorts like those common with ordinary men? I know Pit has a similar pair.
2-male_removing_major,target:human=horny,Let's see what you have under the hood, ~player~.
2-male_removing_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:5=calm,How nice are your legs compared to your abs, I wonder...
2-male_removing_major,target:9s,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:futaba=teasing,You wouldn't really want to turn to a life of crime, would you?
2-male_removed_major=tranquil,Can't wait to see this treasure fully opened!
2-male_removed_major=tranquil,I liked seeing you strip off your ~clothing~, ~name~!
2-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:rinkah,count-futaba:1=glad,Surprisingly fun, right?
2-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:futaba=awkward,I wouldn't know anything about stealing hearts...but I guess it's not as severe as the alternatives.
2-male_removed_major,target:corrin_m,targetStage:5=horny,Your, ahem, little dragon is peeking out, Corrin.
2-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:4=tranquil,How...specific.
2-male_removed_major,target:shaggy=worried,(<i>He just seems... greasy.</i>)
2-male_removed_major,filter:athletic=surprised,I must say, ~name~, you keep in <i>really</i> good shape. Even I'm impressed.
2-male_removed_major,target:human=surprised,You're more toned than I thought...I'm impressed.
2-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:pit,count-futaba:1=angry,Forget it, Pit. He protects humanity his way, we'll protect it ours.
2-male_removed_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:6=tranquil,Look at him, so bashful! Just like Pit, really.
2-male_removed_major,target:link,targetStage:6=horny,I can see the appeal of the armorless run now...
2-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,Yeah, that's about the response I expected from you.
2-female_removing_major=tranquil,Getting to the nitty-gritty, are we?
2-female_removing_major,target:mercy,targetStage:2=glad,Aw, look at the humans, wanting to dress up like us. That's adorable.
2-female_removing_major,target:zone-tan=calm,So do you find those pants comfortable? I never really saw the appeal.
2-female_removing_major,target:elaine,targetStage:5=glad,I have experience with three-headed dragons. A monkey won't phase me.
2-female_removing_major,target:aimee=angry,H-hey! Watch where you point that thing!
2-female_removing_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:shantae=glad,Maybe ask before you take a catchphrase next time?
2-female_removing_major,target:nayru,targetStage:4=thinking,...Veran? I swore it was someone else for a minute. Never mind.
2-female_removing_major,target:spooky,targetStage:1=teasing,Really, Ms. Hospital Gown? I hadn't noticed.
2-female_removing_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:5=glad,Sure, sure. Whatever you say.
2-female_removing_major,target:sola,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=thinking,(She had other options. Wonder why she didn't take them?)
2-female_removing_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4=thinking,(I'm confused why whoever's attacking her didn't target the big stuff from the start.)
2-female_removing_major,target:jenetta,targetStage:4=glad,No, that looks a bit tricky.
2-female_removing_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:7-8=teasing,You have more to worry about than Rinkah stripping her pants, right Hermione?
2-female_removing_major,target:clover,targetStage:2=thinking,You stopped. What is it?
2-female_removing_major,target:sayori,targetStage:4=teasing,Try to imagine the competition in their underwear. Or less, perhaps?
2-female_removing_major,target:clover,targetStage:4=worried,So you know Solid Snake? I hadn't met him in person until recently.
2-female_removing_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=glad,I think Tina's used to fighting in her underwear, so this works out great.
2-female_removing_major,target:winter,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:weiss=calm,Well, it'll all be out in the open soon enough, right Weiss? Nothing hidden between sisters?
2-female_removing_major,target:amalia,targetStage:1=surprised,I'm surprised. Going for the skirt? Bold move, wood girl.
2-female_removing_major,target:sayori,targetStage:3=calm,As I said, both ways.
2-female_removing_major,target:sola,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:2-4=glad,So humans get it naturally, too. How wonderful.
2-female_removing_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4,targetTimeInStage:0,targetSaidMarker:dizzy=teasing,That ought to wake you up.
2-female_removing_major,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:3=teasing,No. Because I already know the answer.
2-female_removing_major,target:elaine,targetStage:3=thinking,You know, I always wondered why he's named "Guybrush". It's like the epitome of naming him after whatever's in the room at the time.
2-female_removing_major,target:miko,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:Undies01=horny,So you were mortal at some point?
2-female_removing_major,target:juri,targetStage:0=glad,Pants already? Someone's bold.
2-female_removing_major,target:sola,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:zizou=surprised,I'm sorry, she did <i>what</i>?
2-female_removing_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:florina,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=calm,Literally, with muscles like those.
2-female_removing_major,target:miko,targetStage:4=horny,Now it's <i>really</i> getting intimate between you two.
2-female_removing_major,target:clover,targetStage:3=thinking,Yes, yes, we're all stupid. You've gotten that point across. Loudly, at that.
2-female_removing_major,target:aella,targetStage:3=teasing,Really? How bold of you, Aella. Isn't it wiser for a human to have more protection?
2-female_removing_major,target:raven,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:inventory_vibe2=glad,Still, you're not wrong, you know?
2-female_removing_major,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=glad,So simple, yet so elegant.
2-female_removing_major,target:winter,targetStage:3=teasing,Your composure's breaking. I thought you were supposed to be <i>the best</i>?
2-female_removing_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:3=glad,Not that I think a Hoshidan would worry too much over losing her pants, but this'll be interesting, to say the least.
2-female_removing_major,target:sola,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:zizou,count-elizabeth:1=glad,Not really. You're still only on your first console generation!
2-female_removing_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:4=thinking,Is this one of those cases where you save the hairpin until the very end, or do you just not care?
2-female_removing_major,target:revy,targetStage:4=calm,Those pants were halfway off, anyway. It's not big in the slightest.
2-female_removing_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,Wings <i>do</i> help out in the coolness department.
2-female_removing_major,target:seven=glad,I take it you're the type who prefers utility over fashion.
2-female_removing_major,target:winter,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=teasing,Makes sense. I see Weiss doing a lot better than you, after all.
2-female_removing_major,target:juri,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:chun-li=thinking,Isn't it usually the criminal who does the admission?
2-female_removing_major,target:jolyne,targetStage:2=thinking,That outfit kind of makes no sense. So it covers as much as a bra, but it also has straps?
2-female_removing_major,target:winter,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:3-4=teasing,You think so? I didn't know eyes were so low...
2-female_removing_major,target:miko,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:Random01=tranquil,Indutiably, Miko.
2-female_removing_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5=thinking,(Is it really a "deck" when no one can stand on it?)
2-female_removing_major,target:samus=surprised,Wait, Samus is a girl?
2-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:2=thinking,Ah, so that's how that works.
2-female_removing_major,target:winter,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:5-8=tranquil,Both Schnee sisters reduced to so little. It's almost funny, really.
2-female_removing_major,target:peach,targetStage:4=teasing,So is it going to be a black void, or something worth looking at?
2-female_removing_major,target:sola,targetStage:2=surprised,Will that work? What about the hat... helmet... whatever?
2-female_removing_major,target:moon,targetStage:0=surprised,That's one strategy, although it might come back to bite you down the line.
2-female_removing_major,target:winter,targetStage:4=surprised,You mean they're not separate? Great!
2-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:3=glad,Hey, ~player~, take a guess what's in her pants. Three tries. Go!
2-female_removing_major,target:raven,targetStage:2=calm,So this counts as an unmasking, right?
2-female_removing_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:4=teasing,Let me guess. Borrowed from a friend?
2-female_removing_major,target:miko,targetStage:5=teasing,You almost did that automatically! Who's really controlling who here?
2-female_removing_major,target:jolyne,targetStage:2,targetTimeInStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=glad,It's not like she's lying to her self. She's just not in a hurry to admit it.
2-female_removing_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5=tranquil,This'll be just like the beach! I believe that's a familiar setting to you?
2-female_removing_major,target:elaine,targetStage:4=horny,Oh! A twofer like that should really raise the stakes.
2-female_removed_major=teasing,Your weak points are really opening up now!
2-female_removed_major=tranquil,I liked seeing you strip off your ~clothing~, ~name~. Is this something you do often?
2-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:dress_off_now=thinking,But didn't you rush into stripping it without a second thought?
2-female_removed_major,target:rosalina=horny,Guess the galaxies were contained under that dress after all...
2-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:weiss=calm,I think I'm in the mood for some chilled strawberries now. What about you two?
2-female_removed_major,target:peach,targetStage:5=surprised,I remember your shorts being a lot... frillier.
2-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5-7=calm,I prefer an "in-between" look myself.
2-female_removed_major,target:elaine,targetStage:5=teasing,I won't judge. But it <i>really</i> looks like you dressed up to take someone home...
2-female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:dizzylose=angry,Rise and shine, we got a game to play.
2-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:6=teasing,"Jugs" is putting it lightly.
2-female_removed_major,target:aella,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,Is he wrong, Aella?
2-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:zizou=teasing,Pride isn't a good look for you, Zizou.
2-female_removed_major,target:jasmine=glad,Oh yes. You had us all fooled. (<i>Did anyone really fall for it?</i>)
2-female_removed_major,target:jolyne,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:tina=worried,Thinking about your father <i>now</i>? I thought humans grew past that centuries ago.
2-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:shantae,alsoPlayingStage:8=glad,You've already given us a performance worthy of Azura. There's no need.
2-female_removed_major,target:lyn=horny,Why don't you invite some of your sword lord friends next time, Lyn? With a body like that, imagine what Ike's packing...
2-female_removed_major,target:weiss=horny,Sorry, Ice Queen. We're just getting started...
2-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:dress_is_next=calm,Taking it well, I see. Let's move on, then.
2-female_removed_major,target:moon,targetStage:1=worried,Why are those nipple outlines so... crusty? It doesn't look even remotely healthy.
2-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=glad,It's not like Meia was trying to keep that hidden from us.
2-female_removed_major,target:revy,targetStage:5=glad,That aside, let's finish this up.
2-female_removed_major,target:jolyne,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=calm,Ah, I know of Nirvana. One of those old stories the humans tried to use to explain the gods.
2-female_removed_major,target:lilith,targetStage:6=calm,Your tattoo covers a lot more than I thought. It's pretty impressive, Lilith.
2-female_removed_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:5=tranquil,Is it already Nohrian Summer again?
2-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:buffy,alsoPlayingStage:2=calm,You two keep on working out. The rest of us have a game to play.
2-female_removed_major,target:jolyne,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:misato=calm,Really, who else would come to a game of strip poker dressed so... bizzarely?
2-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5=teasing,So you mean you <i>don't</i> strip in front of your peers at class trials? Maybe you should try it. It'd certainly get you some more... influence.
2-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5=horny,A matching set? No wonder you were so adamant about hiding it.
2-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=angry,No wonder you're so... tightly wound. Remind me to take you to one once this is all over.
2-female_removed_major,target:sonya=teasing,I see you looking at Sonya, ~player~. Fan of a woman in uniform?
2-female_removed_major,target:spooky,targetStage:2=thinking,Hmm... I hear chess is getting popular again.
2-female_removed_major,target:amalia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:mahiru=thinking,Your eye twitches when you look at Mahiru. Something the matter?
2-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3=awkward,You really could've gone with anything else.
2-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meg,alsoPlayingStage:0=tranquil,You two would make a <i>very</i> interesting team! The slow, heavy hitter and the quick guerilla fighter. Sounds a little familiar, though.
2-female_removed_major,target:jolyne,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:4-7=glad,I know you kind of lost your costume and everything, but try and calm down a little.
2-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:jura=angry,Frankly, you're starting to get on <i>my</i> nerves a little, too.
2-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:4=tranquil,Strawberries, huh? Even the serious ones have a cute side!
2-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meg,alsoPlayingStage:0-2=glad,Plus, you're almost the exact opposite of her, Meg.
2-female_removed_major,target:elaine,targetStage:4=surprised,Garters <i>and</i> see-through? I suppose it makes sense for a formerly high class women.
2-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=teasing,On the other hand, you're perfectly content to stand here in your strawberry underwear? I see.
2-female_removed_major,target:juri,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:chun-li=glad,Really, don't do anything. those were just decoy pants anyway.
2-female_removed_major,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:aimee=teasing,Well, didn't you two get chummy quick.
2-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3=teasing,Look at that! You're <i>not</i> just a pair of eyes and mouth in a void.
2-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:2-3=teasing,You say that, but I see you bending with each passing round.
2-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:3=tranquil,It worked even better than I hoped!
2-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:pit=horny,Of course she didn't, Pit. You think someone who <i>planned</i> this would bring a back-up?
2-female_removed_major,target:jenetta,targetStage:5=thinking,Are beaches a natural environment for rabbits? Hmm. Viridi would probably know.
2-female_removed_major,target:chell,targetStage:4=worried,I was hoping you weren't wearing anything under your jumpsuit. Does that make me a bad person?
2-female_removed_major,target:zone-tan=glad,For someone so calm, you really have no shame, do you?
2-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=teasing,You're really going to say this right now, Ms. Strawberry?
2-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:paying_you_some_tres=calm,I'm very particular about how I take my bribes. Sorry.
2-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=calm,Does this workout include gratuitous use of a razor, too?
2-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:overcoat=glad,(She really could've just done the overcoat. And this girl's a mage?)
2-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:marinette=tranquil,You know it, Marinette. You're more fashionable than you might think, Nagisa.
2-female_removed_major,target:samus=teasing,I kid, I kid.
2-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=glad,No need to kick her while she's down, Winter. She's already lost hard.
2-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:mahiru=tranquil,What a... beautiful friendship you two have. Somehow pure, yet strong.
2-female_removed_major,target:nayru,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=calm,Just shows off your natural beauty that much more...
2-female_removed_major,target:spooky=glad,Yeaaahh... maybe this isn't such a good game for ghosts.
2-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2=surprised,...That was certainly different. I mean, I can transform others myself, but it's not often I see humans wielding that level of magic.
2-female_removed_major,target:d.va=horny,How many of your viewers would kill for this view, I wonder?
2-female_removed_major,target:misty,targetStage:3=calm,That's a nice bikini. Was the cerulean intentional?
2-female_removed_major,target:amalia,targetStage:2=teasing,Although those panties are hardly natural...
2-female_removed_major,target:clover,targetStage:5=calm,You don't have to worry about that. I'm bored already.
2-female_removed_major,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:4=glad,Not much of a surprise, but that's how it goes, Alice.
2-female_removed_major,target:chara,targetStage:5=tranquil,Well, nothing can stop <i>us</i> from getting it off of you.
2-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:pit=horny,What does Palutena think? I'll tell you what she thinks: she's just glad Pit's finally learning to appreciate the female body.
2-female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5=horny,Whoever built you must be really cheap to give you a bra like that, Shimakaze.
2-female_removed_major,target:spooky,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:chica=calm,Apparate schmapparate. You've got underwear, that's all that matters.
2-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:zoey=thinking,I don't see it. How so, Winter?
2-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:5=calm,Yes, yes. I've gone through this song and dance more times than I care to remember. Just play the game.
2-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:pit=annoyed,Really, Pit. You need to expand your VG horizons.
2-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=teasing,That's something a <i>cute</i> person would say.
2-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:elena,alsoPlayingStage:6-7=calm,It says something that a goddess is more at ease than you, huh?
2-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:wiifitfemale=glad,I've burned through a few myself.
2-female_removed_major,target:alice=horny,Check out Little Miss Zebra over here! Clearly you were prepared to lose clothes tonight.
2-female_removed_major,target:spooky,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:elaine,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=glad,Real beer's probably not much of an option for you, though. Maybe lite beer would work?
2-female_removed_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:6=teasing,Just keep digging that hole you're in.
2-female_removed_major,target:aimee=surprised,Oh...good shot.
2-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:elena,alsoPlayingStage:8=tranquil,Even <i>I'm</i> not exempt! What are you complaining about, Elena?
2-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:6=tranquil,I appreciate your steward undressing with us as well.
2-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=tranquil,But not all, of course.
2-female_removed_major,target:elaine,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:jin=teasing,With a married woman? They were basically zero.
2-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:mahiru=worried,Is that photoworthy, Mahiru? Anyone could scrunch up their panties.
2-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:4=calm,Did you guess that it really was a banana? You'd be right.
2-female_removed_major,target:penny,targetStage:4=tranquil,It's cute, Penny! And it's comfortable? I should get a set for myself!
2-female_removed_major,target:clover,targetStage:4=glad,And yet here you are playing it. Ironic, isn't it?
2-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:buffy,alsoPlayingStage:2=glad,I guess you'd have to, seeing as it's your major strength.
2-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:Undies02=calm,I get it. I'm rather old-fashioned in that regard, as well.
2-female_removed_major,target:aella,targetStage:4=glad,Seems your confidence is starting to wane.
2-female_removed_major,target:clover,targetStage:3=teasing,Seems like our little plant here realized how to play the game.
2-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=calm,Have you seen some of the things in the Galactic Sea? Don't take her lightly.
2-female_removed_major,target:sayori,targetStage:4=glad,Just think of all the things you'll see when the rest of us lose!
2-female_removed_major,target:sayori,targetStage:5=calm,You're looking a bit tense. Try not to overthink it. Just... go with the flow.
2-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:ruby,count-yang:0=teasing,Are you really threatening a girl barely out of high school? That's just petty.
2-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:jura=teasing,Careful, Jura. You might get burned.
2-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=horny,Even smaller than I thought! Plus, since it's obvious what color your pubes are, it's almost like you're already bottomless!
2-female_removed_major,target:sheena,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,Hey Pit, I finally found someone who can gush about hot springs with you!
2-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:4=thinking,Now I'm curious. Does dango taste good?
2-female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:6=calm,But seriously, talk to whoever's in charge. That's probably the <i>last</i> set of underwear a battleship would wear... and that's a sentence that will probably never be muttered again.
2-female_removed_major,target:daisy=surprised,I never took you for the "thong" type, Daisy. I imagine the sand must be irritating.
2-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:2-3,totalMales:1-2=glad,Really? Maybe someone else will get lucky tonight, then.
2-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=glad,Pirate ships aren't <i>that</i> bad.
2-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:jura=glad,I see space pirates have a rather... lax standard compared to humans.
2-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:5-6=glad,All of you Fire Emblem characters stick together, I see.
2-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:zoey=teasing,I don't think she'd be able to keep up with you, Rinkah.
2-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:yang,count-ruby:0=thinking,Who is this Qrow? Friend of yours? Lover, maybe?
2-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:weiss=worried,You have some weird priorities, Winter.
2-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:wiifitfemale=thinking,Been a while since your last game, hasn't it, Trainer?
2-female_removed_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:5=tranquil,I think you've overestimated the use of that shirt a little.
2-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:shantae,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=thinking,Pretty sure the game's over if something happens to Azura anyway, but it's a good offer.
2-female_removed_major,target:mia=tranquil,Those are some nice words to live by.
2-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=thinking,I admit, it's interesting to think about how her life would be different if she was born human.
2-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:4-5=thinking,I don't get it either. Anyway, let's move on, shall we Rinkah?
2-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:yang,count-ruby:1=calm,Qrow, huh? Didn't know these girls had a bird for an uncle.
2-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:pay_you_to_keep_dress=tranquil,What's human money to a goddess?
2-female_removed_major,target:juri,targetStage:1=calm,A strong start, sure, but can you keep it up?
2-female_removed_major,target:nayru,targetStage:5=worried,Still, this <i>may</i> be a problem. Should I intervene?
2-female_removed_major,target:elaine,targetStage:6=calm,Not at this stage, Elaine.
2-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=glad,Smooth.
2-female_removed_major,filter:athletic=calm,I must say, ~name~, you keep in pretty good shape. Do you use Wii Fit?
2-female_removed_major,target:jolyne,targetStage:3=teasing,Conditioned to this, I take it? No wonder you dress so provocatively.


#lost brooch
3-male_removing_major=glad,Things certainly got interesting!
3-male_removing_major=calm,Don't mind if I do!
3-male_removing_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:5=calm,How nice are your legs compared to your abs, I wonder...
3-male_removing_major,target:9s,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:futaba=teasing,You wouldn't really want to turn to a life of crime, would you?
3-male_removing_major,target:9s,targetStage:3=thinking,Are shorts like those common with ordinary men? I know Pit has a similar pair.
3-male_removing_major,target:human=horny,Let's see what you have under the hood, ~player~.
3-male_removed_major=teasing,I'm looking forward to you taking the rest off as well.
3-male_removed_major=horny,I only showed you my neckline, but your little buddy's still uprising...
3-male_removed_major,target:corrin_m,targetStage:5=horny,Your, ahem, little dragon is peeking out, Corrin.
3-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,Yeah, that's about the response I expected from you.
3-male_removed_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:6=tranquil,Look at him, so bashful! Just like Pit, really.
3-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:pit,count-futaba:1=angry,Forget it, Pit. He protects humanity his way, we'll protect it ours.
3-male_removed_major,target:human=surprised,You're more toned than I thought...I'm impressed.
3-male_removed_major,target:shaggy=worried,(<i>He just seems... greasy.</i>)
3-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:4=tranquil,How...specific.
3-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:futaba=awkward,I wouldn't know anything about stealing hearts...but I guess it's not as severe as the alternatives.
3-male_removed_major,filter:athletic=surprised,I must say, ~name~, you keep in <i>really</i> good shape. Even I'm impressed.
3-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:rinkah,count-futaba:1=glad,Surprisingly fun, right?
3-male_removed_major,target:link,targetStage:6=horny,I can see the appeal of the armorless run now...
3-female_removing_major=surprised,Quite the bold move, wouldn't you say?
3-female_removing_major=glad,Looks like I'll be getting an early lead here.
3-female_removing_major,target:zone-tan=calm,So do you find those pants comfortable? I never really saw the appeal.
3-female_removing_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:7-8=teasing,You have more to worry about than Rinkah stripping her pants, right Hermione?
3-female_removing_major,target:elaine,targetStage:3=thinking,You know, I always wondered why he's named "Guybrush". It's like the epitome of naming him after whatever's in the room at the time.
3-female_removing_major,target:miko,targetStage:5=teasing,You almost did that automatically! Who's really controlling who here?
3-female_removing_major,target:winter,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:3-4=teasing,You think so? I didn't know eyes were so low...
3-female_removing_major,target:aimee=angry,H-hey! Watch where you point that thing!
3-female_removing_major,target:samus=surprised,Wait, Samus is a girl?
3-female_removing_major,target:elaine,targetStage:4=horny,Oh! A twofer like that should really raise the stakes.
3-female_removing_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:florina,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=calm,Literally, with muscles like those.
3-female_removing_major,target:winter,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=teasing,Makes sense. I see Weiss doing a lot better than you, after all.
3-female_removing_major,target:elaine,targetStage:5=glad,I have experience with three-headed dragons. A monkey won't phase me.
3-female_removing_major,target:miko,targetStage:4=horny,Now it's <i>really</i> getting intimate between you two.
3-female_removing_major,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:3=teasing,No. Because I already know the answer.
3-female_removing_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:3=glad,Not that I think a Hoshidan would worry too much over losing her pants, but this'll be interesting, to say the least.
3-female_removing_major,target:nayru,targetStage:4=thinking,...Veran? I swore it was someone else for a minute. Never mind.
3-female_removing_major,target:winter,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:5-8=tranquil,Both Schnee sisters reduced to so little. It's almost funny, really.
3-female_removing_major,target:seven=glad,I take it you're the type who prefers utility over fashion.
3-female_removing_major,target:sola,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:2-4=glad,So humans get it naturally, too. How wonderful.
3-female_removing_major,target:miko,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:Undies01=horny,So you were mortal at some point?
3-female_removing_major,target:spooky,targetStage:1=teasing,Really, Ms. Hospital Gown? I hadn't noticed.
3-female_removing_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=glad,I think Tina's used to fighting in her underwear, so this works out great.
3-female_removing_major,target:raven,targetStage:2=calm,So this counts as an unmasking, right?
3-female_removing_major,target:sola,targetStage:2=surprised,Will that work? What about the hat... helmet... whatever?
3-female_removing_major,target:sola,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:zizou=surprised,I'm sorry, she did <i>what</i>?
3-female_removing_major,target:jolyne,targetStage:2=thinking,That outfit kind of makes no sense. So it covers as much as a bra, but it also has straps?
3-female_removing_major,target:sola,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=thinking,(She had other options. Wonder why she didn't take them?)
3-female_removing_major,target:clover,targetStage:4=worried,So you know Solid Snake? I hadn't met him in person until recently.
3-female_removing_major,target:winter,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:weiss=calm,Well, it'll all be out in the open soon enough, right Weiss? Nothing hidden between sisters?
3-female_removing_major,target:clover,targetStage:3=thinking,Yes, yes, we're all stupid. You've gotten that point across. Loudly, at that.
3-female_removing_major,target:clover,targetStage:2=thinking,You stopped. What is it?
3-female_removing_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:5=glad,Sure, sure. Whatever you say.
3-female_removing_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4,targetTimeInStage:0,targetSaidMarker:dizzy=teasing,That ought to wake you up.
3-female_removing_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:4=teasing,Let me guess. Borrowed from a friend?
3-female_removing_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5=tranquil,This'll be just like the beach! I believe that's a familiar setting to you?
3-female_removing_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:4=thinking,Is this one of those cases where you save the hairpin until the very end, or do you just not care?
3-female_removing_major,target:raven,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:inventory_vibe2=glad,Still, you're not wrong, you know?
3-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:3=glad,Hey, ~player~, take a guess what's in her pants. Three tries. Go!
3-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:2=thinking,Ah, so that's how that works.
3-female_removing_major,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=glad,So simple, yet so elegant.
3-female_removing_major,target:amalia,targetStage:1=surprised,I'm surprised. Going for the skirt? Bold move, wood girl.
3-female_removing_major,target:aella,targetStage:3=teasing,Really? How bold of you, Aella. Isn't it wiser for a human to have more protection?
3-female_removing_major,target:jolyne,targetStage:2,targetTimeInStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=glad,It's not like she's lying to her self. She's just not in a hurry to admit it.
3-female_removing_major,target:miko,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:Random01=tranquil,Indutiably, Miko.
3-female_removing_major,target:peach,targetStage:4=teasing,So is it going to be a black void, or something worth looking at?
3-female_removing_major,target:mercy,targetStage:2=glad,Aw, look at the humans, wanting to dress up like us. That's adorable.
3-female_removing_major,target:revy,targetStage:4=calm,Those pants were halfway off, anyway. It's not big in the slightest.
3-female_removing_major,target:juri,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:chun-li=thinking,Isn't it usually the criminal who does the admission?
3-female_removing_major,target:juri,targetStage:0=glad,Pants already? Someone's bold.
3-female_removing_major,target:sayori,targetStage:4=teasing,Try to imagine the competition in their underwear. Or less, perhaps?
3-female_removing_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5=thinking,(Is it really a "deck" when no one can stand on it?)
3-female_removing_major,target:sola,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:zizou,count-elizabeth:1=glad,Not really. You're still only on your first console generation!
3-female_removing_major,target:winter,targetStage:3=teasing,Your composure's breaking. I thought you were supposed to be <i>the best</i>?
3-female_removing_major,target:moon,targetStage:0=surprised,That's one strategy, although it might come back to bite you down the line.
3-female_removing_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4=thinking,(I'm confused why whoever's attacking her didn't target the big stuff from the start.)
3-female_removing_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:shantae=glad,Maybe ask before you take a catchphrase next time?
3-female_removing_major,target:winter,targetStage:4=surprised,You mean they're not separate? Great!
3-female_removing_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,Wings <i>do</i> help out in the coolness department.
3-female_removing_major,target:jenetta,targetStage:4=glad,No, that looks a bit tricky.
3-female_removing_major,target:sayori,targetStage:3=calm,As I said, both ways.
3-female_removed_major=tranquil,And to think, my cost to get here was just a few accessories!
3-female_removed_major=tranquil,I think I've outdone myself this time.
3-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:elena,alsoPlayingStage:8=tranquil,Even <i>I'm</i> not exempt! What are you complaining about, Elena?
3-female_removed_major,target:clover,targetStage:4=glad,And yet here you are playing it. Ironic, isn't it?
3-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:marinette=tranquil,You know it, Marinette. You're more fashionable than you might think, Nagisa.
3-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:4=calm,Did you guess that it really was a banana? You'd be right.
3-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3=teasing,Look at that! You're <i>not</i> just a pair of eyes and mouth in a void.
3-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=calm,Does this workout include gratuitous use of a razor, too?
3-female_removed_major,target:amalia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:mahiru=thinking,Your eye twitches when you look at Mahiru. Something the matter?
3-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=glad,No need to kick her while she's down, Winter. She's already lost hard.
3-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=teasing,On the other hand, you're perfectly content to stand here in your strawberry underwear? I see.
3-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=tranquil,But not all, of course.
3-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:pit=annoyed,Really, Pit. You need to expand your VG horizons.
3-female_removed_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:6=teasing,Just keep digging that hole you're in.
3-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:elena,alsoPlayingStage:6-7=calm,It says something that a goddess is more at ease than you, huh?
3-female_removed_major,target:spooky,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:elaine,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=glad,Real beer's probably not much of an option for you, though. Maybe lite beer would work?
3-female_removed_major,target:revy,targetStage:5=glad,That aside, let's finish this up.
3-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=glad,It's not like Meia was trying to keep that hidden from us.
3-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:yang,count-ruby:0=thinking,Who is this Qrow? Friend of yours? Lover, maybe?
3-female_removed_major,target:clover,targetStage:3=teasing,Seems like our little plant here realized how to play the game.
3-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:buffy,alsoPlayingStage:2=calm,You two keep on working out. The rest of us have a game to play.
3-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:yang,count-ruby:1=calm,Qrow, huh? Didn't know these girls had a bird for an uncle.
3-female_removed_major,target:jolyne,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=calm,Ah, I know of Nirvana. One of those old stories the humans tried to use to explain the gods.
3-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:buffy,alsoPlayingStage:2=glad,I guess you'd have to, seeing as it's your major strength.
3-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=angry,No wonder you're so... tightly wound. Remind me to take you to one once this is all over.
3-female_removed_major,target:jenetta,targetStage:5=thinking,Are beaches a natural environment for rabbits? Hmm. Viridi would probably know.
3-female_removed_major,target:aella,targetStage:4=glad,Seems your confidence is starting to wane.
3-female_removed_major,target:clover,targetStage:5=calm,You don't have to worry about that. I'm bored already.
3-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3=awkward,You really could've gone with anything else.
3-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5-7=calm,I prefer an "in-between" look myself.
3-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:6=teasing,"Jugs" is putting it lightly.
3-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meg,alsoPlayingStage:0-2=glad,Plus, you're almost the exact opposite of her, Meg.
3-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:pit=horny,Of course she didn't, Pit. You think someone who <i>planned</i> this would bring a back-up?
3-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=teasing,You're really going to say this right now, Ms. Strawberry?
3-female_removed_major,target:jolyne,targetStage:3=teasing,Conditioned to this, I take it? No wonder you dress so provocatively.
3-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meg,alsoPlayingStage:0=tranquil,You two would make a <i>very</i> interesting team! The slow, heavy hitter and the quick guerilla fighter. Sounds a little familiar, though.
3-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:5-6=glad,All of you Fire Emblem characters stick together, I see.
3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=glad,Smooth.
3-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:2-3,totalMales:1-2=glad,Really? Maybe someone else will get lucky tonight, then.
3-female_removed_major,target:jolyne,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:4-7=glad,I know you kind of lost your costume and everything, but try and calm down a little.
3-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=glad,Pirate ships aren't <i>that</i> bad.
3-female_removed_major,target:amalia,targetStage:2=teasing,Although those panties are hardly natural...
3-female_removed_major,target:sheena,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,Hey Pit, I finally found someone who can gush about hot springs with you!
3-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5=teasing,So you mean you <i>don't</i> strip in front of your peers at class trials? Maybe you should try it. It'd certainly get you some more... influence.
3-female_removed_major,target:zone-tan=glad,For someone so calm, you really have no shame, do you?
3-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=calm,Have you seen some of the things in the Galactic Sea? Don't take her lightly.
3-female_removed_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:5=tranquil,Is it already Nohrian Summer again?
3-female_removed_major,target:juri,targetStage:1=calm,A strong start, sure, but can you keep it up?
3-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:2-3=teasing,You say that, but I see you bending with each passing round.
3-female_removed_major,target:sayori,targetStage:4=glad,Just think of all the things you'll see when the rest of us lose!
3-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:ruby,count-yang:0=teasing,Are you really threatening a girl barely out of high school? That's just petty.
3-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:4-5=thinking,I don't get it either. Anyway, let's move on, shall we Rinkah?
3-female_removed_major,target:aimee=surprised,Oh...good shot.
3-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=thinking,I admit, it's interesting to think about how her life would be different if she was born human.
3-female_removed_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:5=tranquil,I think you've overestimated the use of that shirt a little.
3-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:shantae,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=thinking,Pretty sure the game's over if something happens to Azura anyway, but it's a good offer.
3-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:3=tranquil,It worked even better than I hoped!
3-female_removed_major,target:aella,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,Is he wrong, Aella?
3-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:shantae,alsoPlayingStage:8=glad,You've already given us a performance worthy of Azura. There's no need.
3-female_removed_major,target:sayori,targetStage:5=calm,You're looking a bit tense. Try not to overthink it. Just... go with the flow.
3-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:zoey=teasing,I don't think she'd be able to keep up with you, Rinkah.
3-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:jura=angry,Frankly, you're starting to get on <i>my</i> nerves a little, too.
3-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:5=calm,Yes, yes. I've gone through this song and dance more times than I care to remember. Just play the game.
3-female_removed_major,target:elaine,targetStage:4=surprised,Garters <i>and</i> see-through? I suppose it makes sense for a formerly high class women.
3-female_removed_major,target:jasmine=glad,Oh yes. You had us all fooled. (<i>Did anyone really fall for it?</i>)
3-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:zizou=teasing,Pride isn't a good look for you, Zizou.
3-female_removed_major,target:spooky,targetStage:2=thinking,Hmm... I hear chess is getting popular again.
3-female_removed_major,target:chell,targetStage:4=worried,I was hoping you weren't wearing anything under your jumpsuit. Does that make me a bad person?
3-female_removed_major,target:penny,targetStage:4=tranquil,It's cute, Penny! And it's comfortable? I should get a set for myself!
3-female_removed_major,target:elaine,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:jin=teasing,With a married woman? They were basically zero.
3-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:paying_you_some_tres=calm,I'm very particular about how I take my bribes. Sorry.
3-female_removed_major,target:jolyne,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:tina=worried,Thinking about your father <i>now</i>? I thought humans grew past that centuries ago.
3-female_removed_major,target:moon,targetStage:1=worried,Why are those nipple outlines so... crusty? It doesn't look even remotely healthy.
3-female_removed_major,target:weiss=horny,Sorry, Ice Queen. We're just getting started...
3-female_removed_major,target:lyn=horny,Why don't you invite some of your sword lord friends next time, Lyn? With a body like that, imagine what Ike's packing...
3-female_removed_major,target:jolyne,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:misato=calm,Really, who else would come to a game of strip poker dressed so... bizzarely?
3-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:jura=teasing,Careful, Jura. You might get burned.
3-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5=horny,A matching set? No wonder you were so adamant about hiding it.
3-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:dress_is_next=calm,Taking it well, I see. Let's move on, then.
3-female_removed_major,target:peach,targetStage:5=surprised,I remember your shorts being a lot... frillier.
3-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:6=tranquil,I appreciate your steward undressing with us as well.
3-female_removed_major,filter:athletic=calm,I must say, ~name~, you keep in pretty good shape. Do you use Wii Fit?
3-female_removed_major,target:daisy=surprised,I never took you for the "thong" type, Daisy. I imagine the sand must be irritating.
3-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:zoey=thinking,I don't see it. How so, Winter?
3-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:mahiru=worried,Is that photoworthy, Mahiru? Anyone could scrunch up their panties.
3-female_removed_major,target:chara,targetStage:5=tranquil,Well, nothing can stop <i>us</i> from getting it off of you.
3-female_removed_major,target:nayru,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=calm,Just shows off your natural beauty that much more...
3-female_removed_major,target:nayru,targetStage:5=worried,Still, this <i>may</i> be a problem. Should I intervene?
3-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:weiss=worried,You have some weird priorities, Winter.
3-female_removed_major,target:d.va=horny,How many of your viewers would kill for this view, I wonder?
3-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=horny,Even smaller than I thought! Plus, since it's obvious what color your pubes are, it's almost like you're already bottomless!
3-female_removed_major,target:spooky=glad,Yeaaahh... maybe this isn't such a good game for ghosts.
3-female_removed_major,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:4=glad,Not much of a surprise, but that's how it goes, Alice.
3-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:4=thinking,Now I'm curious. Does dango taste good?
3-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:pit=horny,What does Palutena think? I'll tell you what she thinks: she's just glad Pit's finally learning to appreciate the female body.
3-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:jura=glad,I see space pirates have a rather... lax standard compared to humans.
3-female_removed_major,target:spooky,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:chica=calm,Apparate schmapparate. You've got underwear, that's all that matters.
3-female_removed_major,target:elaine,targetStage:6=calm,Not at this stage, Elaine.
3-female_removed_major,target:alice=horny,Check out Little Miss Zebra over here! Clearly you were prepared to lose clothes tonight.
3-female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:dizzylose=angry,Rise and shine, we got a game to play.
3-female_removed_major,target:sonya=teasing,I see you looking at Sonya, ~player~. Fan of a woman in uniform?
3-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:weiss=calm,I think I'm in the mood for some chilled strawberries now. What about you two?
3-female_removed_major,target:elaine,targetStage:5=teasing,I won't judge. But it <i>really</i> looks like you dressed up to take someone home...
3-female_removed_major,target:lilith,targetStage:6=calm,Your tattoo covers a lot more than I thought. It's pretty impressive, Lilith.
3-female_removed_major,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:aimee=teasing,Well, didn't you two get chummy quick.
3-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:overcoat=glad,(She really could've just done the overcoat. And this girl's a mage?)
3-female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5=horny,Whoever built you must be really cheap to give you a bra like that, Shimakaze.
3-female_removed_major,target:mia=tranquil,Those are some nice words to live by.
3-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:wiifitfemale=thinking,Been a while since your last game, hasn't it, Trainer?
3-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:wiifitfemale=glad,I've burned through a few myself.
3-female_removed_major,target:samus=teasing,I kid, I kid.
3-female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:6=calm,But seriously, talk to whoever's in charge. That's probably the <i>last</i> set of underwear a battleship would wear... and that's a sentence that will probably never be muttered again.
3-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:dress_off_now=thinking,But didn't you rush into stripping it without a second thought?
3-female_removed_major,target:misty,targetStage:3=calm,That's a nice bikini. Was the cerulean intentional?
3-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:mahiru=tranquil,What a... beautiful friendship you two have. Somehow pure, yet strong.
3-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:Undies02=calm,I get it. I'm rather old-fashioned in that regard, as well.
3-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:pay_you_to_keep_dress=tranquil,What's human money to a goddess?
3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2=surprised,...That was certainly different. I mean, I can transform others myself, but it's not often I see humans wielding that level of magic.
3-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=teasing,That's something a <i>cute</i> person would say.
3-female_removed_major,target:juri,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:chun-li=glad,Really, don't do anything. those were just decoy pants anyway.
3-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:4=tranquil,Strawberries, huh? Even the serious ones have a cute side!
3-female_removed_major,target:rosalina=horny,Guess the galaxies were contained under that dress after all...


#lost belts
4-male_removing_major=teasing,Want to keep going? Gotta pay the toll!
4-male_removing_major=tranquil,The prize is nearly in sight!
4-male_removing_major,target:human=horny,Let's see what you have under the hood, ~player~.
4-male_removing_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:5=calm,How nice are your legs compared to your abs, I wonder...
4-male_removing_major,target:9s,targetStage:3=thinking,Are shorts like those common with ordinary men? I know Pit has a similar pair.
4-male_removing_major,target:9s,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:futaba=teasing,You wouldn't really want to turn to a life of crime, would you?
4-male_removed_major=horny,Not a bad view, all things considered... Yes, I am staring...
4-male_removed_major=calm,Things are lookiing up!
4-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:futaba=awkward,I wouldn't know anything about stealing hearts...but I guess it's not as severe as the alternatives.
4-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,Yeah, that's about the response I expected from you.
4-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:4=tranquil,How...specific.
4-male_removed_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:6=tranquil,Look at him, so bashful! Just like Pit, really.
4-male_removed_major,target:shaggy=worried,(<i>He just seems... greasy.</i>)
4-male_removed_major,filter:athletic=surprised,I must say, ~name~, you keep in <i>really</i> good shape. Even I'm impressed.
4-male_removed_major,target:human=surprised,You're more toned than I thought...I'm impressed.
4-male_removed_major,target:link,targetStage:6=horny,I can see the appeal of the armorless run now...
4-male_removed_major,target:corrin_m,targetStage:5=horny,Your, ahem, little dragon is peeking out, Corrin.
4-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:rinkah,count-futaba:1=glad,Surprisingly fun, right?
4-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:pit,count-futaba:1=angry,Forget it, Pit. He protects humanity his way, we'll protect it ours.
4-female_removing_major=glad,Oh, well, can't complain about that!
4-female_removing_major=tranquil,Look out everyone: ~name~'s about to lose a big one!
4-female_removing_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5=tranquil,This'll be just like the beach! I believe that's a familiar setting to you?
4-female_removing_major,target:sola,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=thinking,(She had other options. Wonder why she didn't take them?)
4-female_removing_major,target:jolyne,targetStage:2,targetTimeInStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=glad,It's not like she's lying to her self. She's just not in a hurry to admit it.
4-female_removing_major,target:raven,targetStage:2=calm,So this counts as an unmasking, right?
4-female_removing_major,target:zone-tan=calm,So do you find those pants comfortable? I never really saw the appeal.
4-female_removing_major,target:clover,targetStage:2=thinking,You stopped. What is it?
4-female_removing_major,target:miko,targetStage:4=horny,Now it's <i>really</i> getting intimate between you two.
4-female_removing_major,target:mercy,targetStage:2=glad,Aw, look at the humans, wanting to dress up like us. That's adorable.
4-female_removing_major,target:miko,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:Random01=tranquil,Indutiably, Miko.
4-female_removing_major,target:winter,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:weiss=calm,Well, it'll all be out in the open soon enough, right Weiss? Nothing hidden between sisters?
4-female_removing_major,target:raven,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:inventory_vibe2=glad,Still, you're not wrong, you know?
4-female_removing_major,target:samus=surprised,Wait, Samus is a girl?
4-female_removing_major,target:sola,targetStage:2=surprised,Will that work? What about the hat... helmet... whatever?
4-female_removing_major,target:clover,targetStage:3=thinking,Yes, yes, we're all stupid. You've gotten that point across. Loudly, at that.
4-female_removing_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4,targetTimeInStage:0,targetSaidMarker:dizzy=teasing,That ought to wake you up.
4-female_removing_major,target:aella,targetStage:3=teasing,Really? How bold of you, Aella. Isn't it wiser for a human to have more protection?
4-female_removing_major,target:clover,targetStage:4=worried,So you know Solid Snake? I hadn't met him in person until recently.
4-female_removing_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:4=teasing,Let me guess. Borrowed from a friend?
4-female_removing_major,target:winter,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:3-4=teasing,You think so? I didn't know eyes were so low...
4-female_removing_major,target:aimee=angry,H-hey! Watch where you point that thing!
4-female_removing_major,target:juri,targetStage:0=glad,Pants already? Someone's bold.
4-female_removing_major,target:jolyne,targetStage:2=thinking,That outfit kind of makes no sense. So it covers as much as a bra, but it also has straps?
4-female_removing_major,target:miko,targetStage:5=teasing,You almost did that automatically! Who's really controlling who here?
4-female_removing_major,target:seven=glad,I take it you're the type who prefers utility over fashion.
4-female_removing_major,target:elaine,targetStage:4=horny,Oh! A twofer like that should really raise the stakes.
4-female_removing_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:4=thinking,Is this one of those cases where you save the hairpin until the very end, or do you just not care?
4-female_removing_major,target:winter,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=teasing,Makes sense. I see Weiss doing a lot better than you, after all.
4-female_removing_major,target:revy,targetStage:4=calm,Those pants were halfway off, anyway. It's not big in the slightest.
4-female_removing_major,target:winter,targetStage:3=teasing,Your composure's breaking. I thought you were supposed to be <i>the best</i>?
4-female_removing_major,target:winter,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:5-8=tranquil,Both Schnee sisters reduced to so little. It's almost funny, really.
4-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:3=glad,Hey, ~player~, take a guess what's in her pants. Three tries. Go!
4-female_removing_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,Wings <i>do</i> help out in the coolness department.
4-female_removing_major,target:winter,targetStage:4=surprised,You mean they're not separate? Great!
4-female_removing_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:3=glad,Not that I think a Hoshidan would worry too much over losing her pants, but this'll be interesting, to say the least.
4-female_removing_major,target:moon,targetStage:0=surprised,That's one strategy, although it might come back to bite you down the line.
4-female_removing_major,target:sola,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:zizou,count-elizabeth:1=glad,Not really. You're still only on your first console generation!
4-female_removing_major,target:elaine,targetStage:5=glad,I have experience with three-headed dragons. A monkey won't phase me.
4-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:2=thinking,Ah, so that's how that works.
4-female_removing_major,target:spooky,targetStage:1=teasing,Really, Ms. Hospital Gown? I hadn't noticed.
4-female_removing_major,target:miko,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:Undies01=horny,So you were mortal at some point?
4-female_removing_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:florina,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=calm,Literally, with muscles like those.
4-female_removing_major,target:elaine,targetStage:3=thinking,You know, I always wondered why he's named "Guybrush". It's like the epitome of naming him after whatever's in the room at the time.
4-female_removing_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5=thinking,(Is it really a "deck" when no one can stand on it?)
4-female_removing_major,target:amalia,targetStage:1=surprised,I'm surprised. Going for the skirt? Bold move, wood girl.
4-female_removing_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:5=glad,Sure, sure. Whatever you say.
4-female_removing_major,target:nayru,targetStage:4=thinking,...Veran? I swore it was someone else for a minute. Never mind.
4-female_removing_major,target:jenetta,targetStage:4=glad,No, that looks a bit tricky.
4-female_removing_major,target:sola,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:2-4=glad,So humans get it naturally, too. How wonderful.
4-female_removing_major,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:3=teasing,No. Because I already know the answer.
4-female_removing_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:7-8=teasing,You have more to worry about than Rinkah stripping her pants, right Hermione?
4-female_removing_major,target:sola,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:zizou=surprised,I'm sorry, she did <i>what</i>?
4-female_removing_major,target:sayori,targetStage:3=calm,As I said, both ways.
4-female_removing_major,target:peach,targetStage:4=teasing,So is it going to be a black void, or something worth looking at?
4-female_removing_major,target:sayori,targetStage:4=teasing,Try to imagine the competition in their underwear. Or less, perhaps?
4-female_removing_major,target:juri,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:chun-li=thinking,Isn't it usually the criminal who does the admission?
4-female_removing_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:shantae=glad,Maybe ask before you take a catchphrase next time?
4-female_removing_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4=thinking,(I'm confused why whoever's attacking her didn't target the big stuff from the start.)
4-female_removing_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=glad,I think Tina's used to fighting in her underwear, so this works out great.
4-female_removing_major,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=glad,So simple, yet so elegant.
4-female_removed_major=teasing,I doubt any of us would mind if you went around like that normally.
4-female_removed_major=surprised,You certainly took it well. Or at least, better than I thought you would.
4-female_removed_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:6=teasing,Just keep digging that hole you're in.
4-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:buffy,alsoPlayingStage:2=glad,I guess you'd have to, seeing as it's your major strength.
4-female_removed_major,target:nayru,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=calm,Just shows off your natural beauty that much more...
4-female_removed_major,filter:athletic=calm,I must say, ~name~, you keep in pretty good shape. Do you use Wii Fit?
4-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:jura=teasing,Careful, Jura. You might get burned.
4-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:elena,alsoPlayingStage:6-7=calm,It says something that a goddess is more at ease than you, huh?
4-female_removed_major,target:mia=tranquil,Those are some nice words to live by.
4-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:6=teasing,"Jugs" is putting it lightly.
4-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:mahiru=worried,Is that photoworthy, Mahiru? Anyone could scrunch up their panties.
4-female_removed_major,target:samus=teasing,I kid, I kid.
4-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:shantae,alsoPlayingStage:8=glad,You've already given us a performance worthy of Azura. There's no need.
4-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:overcoat=glad,(She really could've just done the overcoat. And this girl's a mage?)
4-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:3=tranquil,It worked even better than I hoped!
4-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:shantae,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=thinking,Pretty sure the game's over if something happens to Azura anyway, but it's a good offer.
4-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:pay_you_to_keep_dress=tranquil,What's human money to a goddess?
4-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:4=calm,Did you guess that it really was a banana? You'd be right.
4-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:dress_off_now=thinking,But didn't you rush into stripping it without a second thought?
4-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5-7=calm,I prefer an "in-between" look myself.
4-female_removed_major,target:rosalina=horny,Guess the galaxies were contained under that dress after all...
4-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:dress_is_next=calm,Taking it well, I see. Let's move on, then.
4-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5=teasing,So you mean you <i>don't</i> strip in front of your peers at class trials? Maybe you should try it. It'd certainly get you some more... influence.
4-female_removed_major,target:lyn=horny,Why don't you invite some of your sword lord friends next time, Lyn? With a body like that, imagine what Ike's packing...
4-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=glad,It's not like Meia was trying to keep that hidden from us.
4-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:yang,count-ruby:1=calm,Qrow, huh? Didn't know these girls had a bird for an uncle.
4-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:paying_you_some_tres=calm,I'm very particular about how I take my bribes. Sorry.
4-female_removed_major,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:aimee=teasing,Well, didn't you two get chummy quick.
4-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:elena,alsoPlayingStage:8=tranquil,Even <i>I'm</i> not exempt! What are you complaining about, Elena?
4-female_removed_major,target:amalia,targetStage:2=teasing,Although those panties are hardly natural...
4-female_removed_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:5=tranquil,I think you've overestimated the use of that shirt a little.
4-female_removed_major,target:d.va=horny,How many of your viewers would kill for this view, I wonder?
4-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:ruby,count-yang:0=teasing,Are you really threatening a girl barely out of high school? That's just petty.
4-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:pit=horny,What does Palutena think? I'll tell you what she thinks: she's just glad Pit's finally learning to appreciate the female body.
4-female_removed_major,target:alice=horny,Check out Little Miss Zebra over here! Clearly you were prepared to lose clothes tonight.
4-female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:dizzylose=angry,Rise and shine, we got a game to play.
4-female_removed_major,target:sonya=teasing,I see you looking at Sonya, ~player~. Fan of a woman in uniform?
4-female_removed_major,target:daisy=surprised,I never took you for the "thong" type, Daisy. I imagine the sand must be irritating.
4-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:5-6=glad,All of you Fire Emblem characters stick together, I see.
4-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:zoey=teasing,I don't think she'd be able to keep up with you, Rinkah.
4-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meg,alsoPlayingStage:0=tranquil,You two would make a <i>very</i> interesting team! The slow, heavy hitter and the quick guerilla fighter. Sounds a little familiar, though.
4-female_removed_major,target:jasmine=glad,Oh yes. You had us all fooled. (<i>Did anyone really fall for it?</i>)
4-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:4-5=thinking,I don't get it either. Anyway, let's move on, shall we Rinkah?
4-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:Undies02=calm,I get it. I'm rather old-fashioned in that regard, as well.
4-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=thinking,I admit, it's interesting to think about how her life would be different if she was born human.
4-female_removed_major,target:clover,targetStage:3=teasing,Seems like our little plant here realized how to play the game.
4-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:buffy,alsoPlayingStage:2=calm,You two keep on working out. The rest of us have a game to play.
4-female_removed_major,target:jolyne,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:misato=calm,Really, who else would come to a game of strip poker dressed so... bizzarely?
4-female_removed_major,target:moon,targetStage:1=worried,Why are those nipple outlines so... crusty? It doesn't look even remotely healthy.
4-female_removed_major,target:jolyne,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:tina=worried,Thinking about your father <i>now</i>? I thought humans grew past that centuries ago.
4-female_removed_major,target:chell,targetStage:4=worried,I was hoping you weren't wearing anything under your jumpsuit. Does that make me a bad person?
4-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=angry,No wonder you're so... tightly wound. Remind me to take you to one once this is all over.
4-female_removed_major,target:amalia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:mahiru=thinking,Your eye twitches when you look at Mahiru. Something the matter?
4-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3=teasing,Look at that! You're <i>not</i> just a pair of eyes and mouth in a void.
4-female_removed_major,target:spooky,targetStage:2=thinking,Hmm... I hear chess is getting popular again.
4-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:2-3=teasing,You say that, but I see you bending with each passing round.
4-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:zizou=teasing,Pride isn't a good look for you, Zizou.
4-female_removed_major,target:elaine,targetStage:4=surprised,Garters <i>and</i> see-through? I suppose it makes sense for a formerly high class women.
4-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meg,alsoPlayingStage:0-2=glad,Plus, you're almost the exact opposite of her, Meg.
4-female_removed_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:5=tranquil,Is it already Nohrian Summer again?
4-female_removed_major,target:aella,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,Is he wrong, Aella?
4-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=teasing,That's something a <i>cute</i> person would say.
4-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:jura=angry,Frankly, you're starting to get on <i>my</i> nerves a little, too.
4-female_removed_major,target:revy,targetStage:5=glad,That aside, let's finish this up.
4-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5=horny,A matching set? No wonder you were so adamant about hiding it.
4-female_removed_major,target:jolyne,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=calm,Ah, I know of Nirvana. One of those old stories the humans tried to use to explain the gods.
4-female_removed_major,target:lilith,targetStage:6=calm,Your tattoo covers a lot more than I thought. It's pretty impressive, Lilith.
4-female_removed_major,target:aimee=surprised,Oh...good shot.
4-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:pit=annoyed,Really, Pit. You need to expand your VG horizons.
4-female_removed_major,target:sayori,targetStage:5=calm,You're looking a bit tense. Try not to overthink it. Just... go with the flow.
4-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:wiifitfemale=glad,I've burned through a few myself.
4-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2=surprised,...That was certainly different. I mean, I can transform others myself, but it's not often I see humans wielding that level of magic.
4-female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5=horny,Whoever built you must be really cheap to give you a bra like that, Shimakaze.
4-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:mahiru=tranquil,What a... beautiful friendship you two have. Somehow pure, yet strong.
4-female_removed_major,target:misty,targetStage:3=calm,That's a nice bikini. Was the cerulean intentional?
4-female_removed_major,target:peach,targetStage:5=surprised,I remember your shorts being a lot... frillier.
4-female_removed_major,target:sayori,targetStage:4=glad,Just think of all the things you'll see when the rest of us lose!
4-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=glad,Smooth.
4-female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:6=calm,But seriously, talk to whoever's in charge. That's probably the <i>last</i> set of underwear a battleship would wear... and that's a sentence that will probably never be muttered again.
4-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:pit=horny,Of course she didn't, Pit. You think someone who <i>planned</i> this would bring a back-up?
4-female_removed_major,target:weiss=horny,Sorry, Ice Queen. We're just getting started...
4-female_removed_major,target:jolyne,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:4-7=glad,I know you kind of lost your costume and everything, but try and calm down a little.
4-female_removed_major,target:jenetta,targetStage:5=thinking,Are beaches a natural environment for rabbits? Hmm. Viridi would probably know.
4-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:4=tranquil,Strawberries, huh? Even the serious ones have a cute side!
4-female_removed_major,target:juri,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:chun-li=glad,Really, don't do anything. those were just decoy pants anyway.
4-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:wiifitfemale=thinking,Been a while since your last game, hasn't it, Trainer?
4-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=teasing,On the other hand, you're perfectly content to stand here in your strawberry underwear? I see.
4-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3=awkward,You really could've gone with anything else.
4-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:2-3,totalMales:1-2=glad,Really? Maybe someone else will get lucky tonight, then.
4-female_removed_major,target:aella,targetStage:4=glad,Seems your confidence is starting to wane.
4-female_removed_major,target:nayru,targetStage:5=worried,Still, this <i>may</i> be a problem. Should I intervene?
4-female_removed_major,target:elaine,targetStage:5=teasing,I won't judge. But it <i>really</i> looks like you dressed up to take someone home...
4-female_removed_major,target:clover,targetStage:5=calm,You don't have to worry about that. I'm bored already.
4-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:zoey=thinking,I don't see it. How so, Winter?
4-female_removed_major,target:zone-tan=glad,For someone so calm, you really have no shame, do you?
4-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=calm,Does this workout include gratuitous use of a razor, too?
4-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:marinette=tranquil,You know it, Marinette. You're more fashionable than you might think, Nagisa.
4-female_removed_major,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:4=glad,Not much of a surprise, but that's how it goes, Alice.
4-female_removed_major,target:spooky,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:chica=calm,Apparate schmapparate. You've got underwear, that's all that matters.
4-female_removed_major,target:penny,targetStage:4=tranquil,It's cute, Penny! And it's comfortable? I should get a set for myself!
4-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=glad,No need to kick her while she's down, Winter. She's already lost hard.
4-female_removed_major,target:elaine,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:jin=teasing,With a married woman? They were basically zero.
4-female_removed_major,target:clover,targetStage:4=glad,And yet here you are playing it. Ironic, isn't it?
4-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:5=calm,Yes, yes. I've gone through this song and dance more times than I care to remember. Just play the game.
4-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:yang,count-ruby:0=thinking,Who is this Qrow? Friend of yours? Lover, maybe?
4-female_removed_major,target:chara,targetStage:5=tranquil,Well, nothing can stop <i>us</i> from getting it off of you.
4-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=tranquil,But not all, of course.
4-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=calm,Have you seen some of the things in the Galactic Sea? Don't take her lightly.
4-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:weiss=calm,I think I'm in the mood for some chilled strawberries now. What about you two?
4-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=teasing,You're really going to say this right now, Ms. Strawberry?
4-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=horny,Even smaller than I thought! Plus, since it's obvious what color your pubes are, it's almost like you're already bottomless!
4-female_removed_major,target:spooky=glad,Yeaaahh... maybe this isn't such a good game for ghosts.
4-female_removed_major,target:juri,targetStage:1=calm,A strong start, sure, but can you keep it up?
4-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:jura=glad,I see space pirates have a rather... lax standard compared to humans.
4-female_removed_major,target:sheena,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,Hey Pit, I finally found someone who can gush about hot springs with you!
4-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=glad,Pirate ships aren't <i>that</i> bad.
4-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:6=tranquil,I appreciate your steward undressing with us as well.
4-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:weiss=worried,You have some weird priorities, Winter.
4-female_removed_major,target:elaine,targetStage:6=calm,Not at this stage, Elaine.
4-female_removed_major,target:spooky,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:elaine,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=glad,Real beer's probably not much of an option for you, though. Maybe lite beer would work?
4-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:4=thinking,Now I'm curious. Does dango taste good?
4-female_removed_major,target:jolyne,targetStage:3=teasing,Conditioned to this, I take it? No wonder you dress so provocatively.


#lost stocking
5-male_removing_major=surprised,I never thought I could get so...tense!
5-male_removing_major=horny,This is getting good...
5-male_removing_major,target:9s,targetStage:3=thinking,Are shorts like those common with ordinary men? I know Pit has a similar pair.
5-male_removing_major,target:9s,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:futaba=teasing,You wouldn't really want to turn to a life of crime, would you?
5-male_removing_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:5=calm,How nice are your legs compared to your abs, I wonder...
5-male_removing_major,target:human=horny,Let's see what you have under the hood, ~player~.
5-male_removed_major=awkward,Great, now I'm imagining the undercarriage...
5-male_removed_major=calm,Not too shabby, ~name~.
5-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:pit,count-futaba:1=angry,Forget it, Pit. He protects humanity his way, we'll protect it ours.
5-male_removed_major,target:link,targetStage:6=horny,I can see the appeal of the armorless run now...
5-male_removed_major,filter:athletic=surprised,I must say, ~name~, you keep in <i>really</i> good shape. Even I'm impressed.
5-male_removed_major,target:corrin_m,targetStage:5=horny,Your, ahem, little dragon is peeking out, Corrin.
5-male_removed_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:6=tranquil,Look at him, so bashful! Just like Pit, really.
5-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:futaba=awkward,I wouldn't know anything about stealing hearts...but I guess it's not as severe as the alternatives.
5-male_removed_major,target:shaggy=worried,(<i>He just seems... greasy.</i>)
5-male_removed_major,target:human=surprised,You're more toned than I thought...I'm impressed.
5-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,Yeah, that's about the response I expected from you.
5-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:4=tranquil,How...specific.
5-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:rinkah,count-futaba:1=glad,Surprisingly fun, right?
5-female_removing_major=annoyed,I'm cutting it a lot closer than I'd like.
5-female_removing_major=glad,At least you'll be showing skin before me.
5-female_removing_major,target:winter,targetStage:4=surprised,You mean they're not separate? Great!
5-female_removing_major,target:sayori,targetStage:4=teasing,Try to imagine the competition in their underwear. Or less, perhaps?
5-female_removing_major,target:jolyne,targetStage:2=thinking,That outfit kind of makes no sense. So it covers as much as a bra, but it also has straps?
5-female_removing_major,target:juri,targetStage:0=glad,Pants already? Someone's bold.
5-female_removing_major,target:clover,targetStage:4=worried,So you know Solid Snake? I hadn't met him in person until recently.
5-female_removing_major,target:clover,targetStage:3=thinking,Yes, yes, we're all stupid. You've gotten that point across. Loudly, at that.
5-female_removing_major,target:clover,targetStage:2=thinking,You stopped. What is it?
5-female_removing_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:5=glad,Sure, sure. Whatever you say.
5-female_removing_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:4=teasing,Let me guess. Borrowed from a friend?
5-female_removing_major,target:sola,targetStage:2=surprised,Will that work? What about the hat... helmet... whatever?
5-female_removing_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5=tranquil,This'll be just like the beach! I believe that's a familiar setting to you?
5-female_removing_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:4=thinking,Is this one of those cases where you save the hairpin until the very end, or do you just not care?
5-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:3=glad,Hey, ~player~, take a guess what's in her pants. Three tries. Go!
5-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:2=thinking,Ah, so that's how that works.
5-female_removing_major,target:amalia,targetStage:1=surprised,I'm surprised. Going for the skirt? Bold move, wood girl.
5-female_removing_major,target:aella,targetStage:3=teasing,Really? How bold of you, Aella. Isn't it wiser for a human to have more protection?
5-female_removing_major,target:peach,targetStage:4=teasing,So is it going to be a black void, or something worth looking at?
5-female_removing_major,target:mercy,targetStage:2=glad,Aw, look at the humans, wanting to dress up like us. That's adorable.
5-female_removing_major,target:nayru,targetStage:4=thinking,...Veran? I swore it was someone else for a minute. Never mind.
5-female_removing_major,target:miko,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:Undies01=horny,So you were mortal at some point?
5-female_removing_major,target:raven,targetStage:2=calm,So this counts as an unmasking, right?
5-female_removing_major,target:jenetta,targetStage:4=glad,No, that looks a bit tricky.
5-female_removing_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:3=glad,Not that I think a Hoshidan would worry too much over losing her pants, but this'll be interesting, to say the least.
5-female_removing_major,target:elaine,targetStage:5=glad,I have experience with three-headed dragons. A monkey won't phase me.
5-female_removing_major,target:miko,targetStage:4=horny,Now it's <i>really</i> getting intimate between you two.
5-female_removing_major,target:miko,targetStage:5=teasing,You almost did that automatically! Who's really controlling who here?
5-female_removing_major,target:elaine,targetStage:4=horny,Oh! A twofer like that should really raise the stakes.
5-female_removing_major,target:elaine,targetStage:3=thinking,You know, I always wondered why he's named "Guybrush". It's like the epitome of naming him after whatever's in the room at the time.
5-female_removing_major,target:spooky,targetStage:1=teasing,Really, Ms. Hospital Gown? I hadn't noticed.
5-female_removing_major,target:revy,targetStage:4=calm,Those pants were halfway off, anyway. It's not big in the slightest.
5-female_removing_major,target:samus=surprised,Wait, Samus is a girl?
5-female_removing_major,target:seven=glad,I take it you're the type who prefers utility over fashion.
5-female_removing_major,target:winter,targetStage:3=teasing,Your composure's breaking. I thought you were supposed to be <i>the best</i>?
5-female_removing_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5=thinking,(Is it really a "deck" when no one can stand on it?)
5-female_removing_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4=thinking,(I'm confused why whoever's attacking her didn't target the big stuff from the start.)
5-female_removing_major,target:zone-tan=calm,So do you find those pants comfortable? I never really saw the appeal.
5-female_removing_major,target:aimee=angry,H-hey! Watch where you point that thing!
5-female_removing_major,target:sayori,targetStage:3=calm,As I said, both ways.
5-female_removing_major,target:moon,targetStage:0=surprised,That's one strategy, although it might come back to bite you down the line.
5-female_removing_major,target:miko,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:Random01=tranquil,Indutiably, Miko.
5-female_removing_major,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:3=teasing,No. Because I already know the answer.
5-female_removing_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:florina,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=calm,Literally, with muscles like those.
5-female_removing_major,target:winter,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:weiss=calm,Well, it'll all be out in the open soon enough, right Weiss? Nothing hidden between sisters?
5-female_removing_major,target:winter,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:5-8=tranquil,Both Schnee sisters reduced to so little. It's almost funny, really.
5-female_removing_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:7-8=teasing,You have more to worry about than Rinkah stripping her pants, right Hermione?
5-female_removing_major,target:juri,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:chun-li=thinking,Isn't it usually the criminal who does the admission?
5-female_removing_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4,targetTimeInStage:0,targetSaidMarker:dizzy=teasing,That ought to wake you up.
5-female_removing_major,target:sola,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=thinking,(She had other options. Wonder why she didn't take them?)
5-female_removing_major,target:sola,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:zizou,count-elizabeth:1=glad,Not really. You're still only on your first console generation!
5-female_removing_major,target:sola,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:2-4=glad,So humans get it naturally, too. How wonderful.
5-female_removing_major,target:winter,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=teasing,Makes sense. I see Weiss doing a lot better than you, after all.
5-female_removing_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:shantae=glad,Maybe ask before you take a catchphrase next time?
5-female_removing_major,target:winter,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:3-4=teasing,You think so? I didn't know eyes were so low...
5-female_removing_major,target:raven,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:inventory_vibe2=glad,Still, you're not wrong, you know?
5-female_removing_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=glad,I think Tina's used to fighting in her underwear, so this works out great.
5-female_removing_major,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=glad,So simple, yet so elegant.
5-female_removing_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,Wings <i>do</i> help out in the coolness department.
5-female_removing_major,target:jolyne,targetStage:2,targetTimeInStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=glad,It's not like she's lying to her self. She's just not in a hurry to admit it.
5-female_removing_major,target:sola,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:zizou=surprised,I'm sorry, she did <i>what</i>?
5-female_removed_major=tranquil,The satisfaction of seeing you <i>this</i> close to defeat makes it worth it.
5-female_removed_major=calm,(<i>Just a little bit more to go.</i>)
5-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:zizou=teasing,Pride isn't a good look for you, Zizou.
5-female_removed_major,target:peach,targetStage:5=surprised,I remember your shorts being a lot... frillier.
5-female_removed_major,target:lyn=horny,Why don't you invite some of your sword lord friends next time, Lyn? With a body like that, imagine what Ike's packing...
5-female_removed_major,target:spooky,targetStage:2=thinking,Hmm... I hear chess is getting popular again.
5-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:dress_is_next=calm,Taking it well, I see. Let's move on, then.
5-female_removed_major,target:chell,targetStage:4=worried,I was hoping you weren't wearing anything under your jumpsuit. Does that make me a bad person?
5-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:jura=teasing,Careful, Jura. You might get burned.
5-female_removed_major,target:moon,targetStage:1=worried,Why are those nipple outlines so... crusty? It doesn't look even remotely healthy.
5-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:paying_you_some_tres=calm,I'm very particular about how I take my bribes. Sorry.
5-female_removed_major,target:jolyne,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:misato=calm,Really, who else would come to a game of strip poker dressed so... bizzarely?
5-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5=horny,A matching set? No wonder you were so adamant about hiding it.
5-female_removed_major,target:rosalina=horny,Guess the galaxies were contained under that dress after all...
5-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:dress_off_now=thinking,But didn't you rush into stripping it without a second thought?
5-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:pay_you_to_keep_dress=tranquil,What's human money to a goddess?
5-female_removed_major,target:lilith,targetStage:6=calm,Your tattoo covers a lot more than I thought. It's pretty impressive, Lilith.
5-female_removed_major,target:juri,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:chun-li=glad,Really, don't do anything. those were just decoy pants anyway.
5-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:4=tranquil,Strawberries, huh? Even the serious ones have a cute side!
5-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:overcoat=glad,(She really could've just done the overcoat. And this girl's a mage?)
5-female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:6=calm,But seriously, talk to whoever's in charge. That's probably the <i>last</i> set of underwear a battleship would wear... and that's a sentence that will probably never be muttered again.
5-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:wiifitfemale=thinking,Been a while since your last game, hasn't it, Trainer?
5-female_removed_major,target:jolyne,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:tina=worried,Thinking about your father <i>now</i>? I thought humans grew past that centuries ago.
5-female_removed_major,target:elaine,targetStage:4=surprised,Garters <i>and</i> see-through? I suppose it makes sense for a formerly high class women.
5-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:weiss=calm,I think I'm in the mood for some chilled strawberries now. What about you two?
5-female_removed_major,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:aimee=teasing,Well, didn't you two get chummy quick.
5-female_removed_major,target:mia=tranquil,Those are some nice words to live by.
5-female_removed_major,target:alice=horny,Check out Little Miss Zebra over here! Clearly you were prepared to lose clothes tonight.
5-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=teasing,That's something a <i>cute</i> person would say.
5-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:6=tranquil,I appreciate your steward undressing with us as well.
5-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:mahiru=worried,Is that photoworthy, Mahiru? Anyone could scrunch up their panties.
5-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:Undies02=calm,I get it. I'm rather old-fashioned in that regard, as well.
5-female_removed_major,target:elaine,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:jin=teasing,With a married woman? They were basically zero.
5-female_removed_major,filter:athletic=calm,I must say, ~name~, you keep in pretty good shape. Do you use Wii Fit?
5-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:5=calm,Yes, yes. I've gone through this song and dance more times than I care to remember. Just play the game.
5-female_removed_major,target:sonya=teasing,I see you looking at Sonya, ~player~. Fan of a woman in uniform?
5-female_removed_major,target:penny,targetStage:4=tranquil,It's cute, Penny! And it's comfortable? I should get a set for myself!
5-female_removed_major,target:d.va=horny,How many of your viewers would kill for this view, I wonder?
5-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:pit=horny,What does Palutena think? I'll tell you what she thinks: she's just glad Pit's finally learning to appreciate the female body.
5-female_removed_major,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:4=glad,Not much of a surprise, but that's how it goes, Alice.
5-female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:dizzylose=angry,Rise and shine, we got a game to play.
5-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:zoey=thinking,I don't see it. How so, Winter?
5-female_removed_major,target:nayru,targetStage:5=worried,Still, this <i>may</i> be a problem. Should I intervene?
5-female_removed_major,target:chara,targetStage:5=tranquil,Well, nothing can stop <i>us</i> from getting it off of you.
5-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:weiss=worried,You have some weird priorities, Winter.
5-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=horny,Even smaller than I thought! Plus, since it's obvious what color your pubes are, it's almost like you're already bottomless!
5-female_removed_major,target:daisy=surprised,I never took you for the "thong" type, Daisy. I imagine the sand must be irritating.
5-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:zoey=teasing,I don't think she'd be able to keep up with you, Rinkah.
5-female_removed_major,target:spooky=glad,Yeaaahh... maybe this isn't such a good game for ghosts.
5-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:jura=glad,I see space pirates have a rather... lax standard compared to humans.
5-female_removed_major,target:elaine,targetStage:6=calm,Not at this stage, Elaine.
5-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:4=thinking,Now I'm curious. Does dango taste good?
5-female_removed_major,target:nayru,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=calm,Just shows off your natural beauty that much more...
5-female_removed_major,target:elaine,targetStage:5=teasing,I won't judge. But it <i>really</i> looks like you dressed up to take someone home...
5-female_removed_major,target:jasmine=glad,Oh yes. You had us all fooled. (<i>Did anyone really fall for it?</i>)
5-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:jura=angry,Frankly, you're starting to get on <i>my</i> nerves a little, too.
5-female_removed_major,target:spooky,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:chica=calm,Apparate schmapparate. You've got underwear, that's all that matters.
5-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:shantae,alsoPlayingStage:8=glad,You've already given us a performance worthy of Azura. There's no need.
5-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=teasing,On the other hand, you're perfectly content to stand here in your strawberry underwear? I see.
5-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:marinette=tranquil,You know it, Marinette. You're more fashionable than you might think, Nagisa.
5-female_removed_major,target:clover,targetStage:5=calm,You don't have to worry about that. I'm bored already.
5-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=thinking,I admit, it's interesting to think about how her life would be different if she was born human.
5-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=calm,Have you seen some of the things in the Galactic Sea? Don't take her lightly.
5-female_removed_major,target:juri,targetStage:1=calm,A strong start, sure, but can you keep it up?
5-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=glad,Pirate ships aren't <i>that</i> bad.
5-female_removed_major,target:sheena,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,Hey Pit, I finally found someone who can gush about hot springs with you!
5-female_removed_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:5=tranquil,Is it already Nohrian Summer again?
5-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=teasing,You're really going to say this right now, Ms. Strawberry?
5-female_removed_major,target:jolyne,targetStage:3=teasing,Conditioned to this, I take it? No wonder you dress so provocatively.
5-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3=awkward,You really could've gone with anything else.
5-female_removed_major,target:aella,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,Is he wrong, Aella?
5-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meg,alsoPlayingStage:0-2=glad,Plus, you're almost the exact opposite of her, Meg.
5-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:2-3=teasing,You say that, but I see you bending with each passing round.
5-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3=teasing,Look at that! You're <i>not</i> just a pair of eyes and mouth in a void.
5-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=angry,No wonder you're so... tightly wound. Remind me to take you to one once this is all over.
5-female_removed_major,target:amalia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:mahiru=thinking,Your eye twitches when you look at Mahiru. Something the matter?
5-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:buffy,alsoPlayingStage:2=calm,You two keep on working out. The rest of us have a game to play.
5-female_removed_major,target:revy,targetStage:5=glad,That aside, let's finish this up.
5-female_removed_major,target:jolyne,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=calm,Ah, I know of Nirvana. One of those old stories the humans tried to use to explain the gods.
5-female_removed_major,target:jolyne,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:4-7=glad,I know you kind of lost your costume and everything, but try and calm down a little.
5-female_removed_major,target:jenetta,targetStage:5=thinking,Are beaches a natural environment for rabbits? Hmm. Viridi would probably know.
5-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:pit=horny,Of course she didn't, Pit. You think someone who <i>planned</i> this would bring a back-up?
5-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=calm,Does this workout include gratuitous use of a razor, too?
5-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=glad,Smooth.
5-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=glad,No need to kick her while she's down, Winter. She's already lost hard.
5-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=tranquil,But not all, of course.
5-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:3=tranquil,It worked even better than I hoped!
5-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:shantae,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=thinking,Pretty sure the game's over if something happens to Azura anyway, but it's a good offer.
5-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:4=calm,Did you guess that it really was a banana? You'd be right.
5-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5-7=calm,I prefer an "in-between" look myself.
5-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=glad,It's not like Meia was trying to keep that hidden from us.
5-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5=teasing,So you mean you <i>don't</i> strip in front of your peers at class trials? Maybe you should try it. It'd certainly get you some more... influence.
5-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:yang,count-ruby:1=calm,Qrow, huh? Didn't know these girls had a bird for an uncle.
5-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meg,alsoPlayingStage:0=tranquil,You two would make a <i>very</i> interesting team! The slow, heavy hitter and the quick guerilla fighter. Sounds a little familiar, though.
5-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:6=teasing,"Jugs" is putting it lightly.
5-female_removed_major,target:amalia,targetStage:2=teasing,Although those panties are hardly natural...
5-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:5-6=glad,All of you Fire Emblem characters stick together, I see.
5-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:4-5=thinking,I don't get it either. Anyway, let's move on, shall we Rinkah?
5-female_removed_major,target:zone-tan=glad,For someone so calm, you really have no shame, do you?
5-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:ruby,count-yang:0=teasing,Are you really threatening a girl barely out of high school? That's just petty.
5-female_removed_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:5=tranquil,I think you've overestimated the use of that shirt a little.
5-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:elena,alsoPlayingStage:8=tranquil,Even <i>I'm</i> not exempt! What are you complaining about, Elena?
5-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:elena,alsoPlayingStage:6-7=calm,It says something that a goddess is more at ease than you, huh?
5-female_removed_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:6=teasing,Just keep digging that hole you're in.
5-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:buffy,alsoPlayingStage:2=glad,I guess you'd have to, seeing as it's your major strength.
5-female_removed_major,target:spooky,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:elaine,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=glad,Real beer's probably not much of an option for you, though. Maybe lite beer would work?
5-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:yang,count-ruby:0=thinking,Who is this Qrow? Friend of yours? Lover, maybe?
5-female_removed_major,target:clover,targetStage:3=teasing,Seems like our little plant here realized how to play the game.
5-female_removed_major,target:aella,targetStage:4=glad,Seems your confidence is starting to wane.
5-female_removed_major,target:clover,targetStage:4=glad,And yet here you are playing it. Ironic, isn't it?
5-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:2-3,totalMales:1-2=glad,Really? Maybe someone else will get lucky tonight, then.
5-female_removed_major,target:samus=teasing,I kid, I kid.
5-female_removed_major,target:aimee=surprised,Oh...good shot.
5-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:pit=annoyed,Really, Pit. You need to expand your VG horizons.
5-female_removed_major,target:weiss=horny,Sorry, Ice Queen. We're just getting started...
5-female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5=horny,Whoever built you must be really cheap to give you a bra like that, Shimakaze.
5-female_removed_major,target:sayori,targetStage:5=calm,You're looking a bit tense. Try not to overthink it. Just... go with the flow.
5-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:mahiru=tranquil,What a... beautiful friendship you two have. Somehow pure, yet strong.
5-female_removed_major,target:sayori,targetStage:4=glad,Just think of all the things you'll see when the rest of us lose!
5-female_removed_major,target:misty,targetStage:3=calm,That's a nice bikini. Was the cerulean intentional?
5-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2=surprised,...That was certainly different. I mean, I can transform others myself, but it's not often I see humans wielding that level of magic.
5-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:wiifitfemale=glad,I've burned through a few myself.


#lost dress
6-male_removing_major=glad,Ahahaha... I can't wait to see...
6-male_removing_major=calm,Let's see what you're packing.
6-male_removing_major,target:human=horny,Let's see what you have under the hood, ~player~.
6-male_removing_major,target:9s,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:futaba=teasing,You wouldn't really want to turn to a life of crime, would you?
6-male_removing_major,target:9s,targetStage:3=thinking,Are shorts like those common with ordinary men? I know Pit has a similar pair.
6-male_removing_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:5=calm,How nice are your legs compared to your abs, I wonder...
6-male_removed_major=annoyed,These dirty thoughts need to go away. At least while I'm like this!
6-male_removed_major=horny,You don't look half bad.
6-male_removed_major=surprised,~name~, is that a bulge? You must really like my breasts. They are goddess breasts after all.
6-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:4=tranquil,How...specific.
6-male_removed_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:6=tranquil,Look at him, so bashful! Just like Pit, really.
6-male_removed_major,target:link,targetStage:6=horny,I can see the appeal of the armorless run now...
6-male_removed_major,target:human=surprised,You're more toned than I thought...I'm impressed.
6-male_removed_major,filter:athletic=surprised,I must say, ~name~, you keep in <i>really</i> good shape. Even I'm impressed.
6-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,Yeah, that's about the response I expected from you.
6-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:pit,count-futaba:1=angry,Forget it, Pit. He protects humanity his way, we'll protect it ours.
6-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:futaba=awkward,I wouldn't know anything about stealing hearts...but I guess it's not as severe as the alternatives.
6-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:rinkah,count-futaba:1=glad,Surprisingly fun, right?
6-male_removed_major,target:shaggy=worried,(<i>He just seems... greasy.</i>)
6-male_removed_major,target:corrin_m,targetStage:5=horny,Your, ahem, little dragon is peeking out, Corrin.
6-female_removing_major=surprised,Another one bites the dust...can't say I feel pity, though.
6-female_removing_major=glad,One step closer to matching me!
6-female_removing_major,target:elaine,targetStage:3=thinking,You know, I always wondered why he's named "Guybrush". It's like the epitome of naming him after whatever's in the room at the time.
6-female_removing_major,target:sola,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:2-4=glad,So humans get it naturally, too. How wonderful.
6-female_removing_major,target:peach,targetStage:4=teasing,So is it going to be a black void, or something worth looking at?
6-female_removing_major,target:winter,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:3-4=teasing,You think so? I didn't know eyes were so low...
6-female_removing_major,target:winter,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=teasing,Makes sense. I see Weiss doing a lot better than you, after all.
6-female_removing_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:3=glad,Not that I think a Hoshidan would worry too much over losing her pants, but this'll be interesting, to say the least.
6-female_removing_major,target:mercy,targetStage:2=glad,Aw, look at the humans, wanting to dress up like us. That's adorable.
6-female_removing_major,target:winter,targetStage:3=teasing,Your composure's breaking. I thought you were supposed to be <i>the best</i>?
6-female_removing_major,target:winter,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:5-8=tranquil,Both Schnee sisters reduced to so little. It's almost funny, really.
6-female_removing_major,target:elaine,targetStage:5=glad,I have experience with three-headed dragons. A monkey won't phase me.
6-female_removing_major,target:miko,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:Undies01=horny,So you were mortal at some point?
6-female_removing_major,target:jenetta,targetStage:4=glad,No, that looks a bit tricky.
6-female_removing_major,target:miko,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:Random01=tranquil,Indutiably, Miko.
6-female_removing_major,target:samus=surprised,Wait, Samus is a girl?
6-female_removing_major,target:winter,targetStage:4=surprised,You mean they're not separate? Great!
6-female_removing_major,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=glad,So simple, yet so elegant.
6-female_removing_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:florina,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=calm,Literally, with muscles like those.
6-female_removing_major,target:raven,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:inventory_vibe2=glad,Still, you're not wrong, you know?
6-female_removing_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:shantae=glad,Maybe ask before you take a catchphrase next time?
6-female_removing_major,target:miko,targetStage:5=teasing,You almost did that automatically! Who's really controlling who here?
6-female_removing_major,target:spooky,targetStage:1=teasing,Really, Ms. Hospital Gown? I hadn't noticed.
6-female_removing_major,target:sola,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=thinking,(She had other options. Wonder why she didn't take them?)
6-female_removing_major,target:miko,targetStage:4=horny,Now it's <i>really</i> getting intimate between you two.
6-female_removing_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,Wings <i>do</i> help out in the coolness department.
6-female_removing_major,target:juri,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:chun-li=thinking,Isn't it usually the criminal who does the admission?
6-female_removing_major,target:winter,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:weiss=calm,Well, it'll all be out in the open soon enough, right Weiss? Nothing hidden between sisters?
6-female_removing_major,target:sola,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:zizou,count-elizabeth:1=glad,Not really. You're still only on your first console generation!
6-female_removing_major,target:elaine,targetStage:4=horny,Oh! A twofer like that should really raise the stakes.
6-female_removing_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4,targetTimeInStage:0,targetSaidMarker:dizzy=teasing,That ought to wake you up.
6-female_removing_major,target:jolyne,targetStage:2,targetTimeInStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=glad,It's not like she's lying to her self. She's just not in a hurry to admit it.
6-female_removing_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:7-8=teasing,You have more to worry about than Rinkah stripping her pants, right Hermione?
6-female_removing_major,target:moon,targetStage:0=surprised,That's one strategy, although it might come back to bite you down the line.
6-female_removing_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=glad,I think Tina's used to fighting in her underwear, so this works out great.
6-female_removing_major,target:sola,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:zizou=surprised,I'm sorry, she did <i>what</i>?
6-female_removing_major,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:3=teasing,No. Because I already know the answer.
6-female_removing_major,target:sola,targetStage:2=surprised,Will that work? What about the hat... helmet... whatever?
6-female_removing_major,target:zone-tan=calm,So do you find those pants comfortable? I never really saw the appeal.
6-female_removing_major,target:clover,targetStage:4=worried,So you know Solid Snake? I hadn't met him in person until recently.
6-female_removing_major,target:juri,targetStage:0=glad,Pants already? Someone's bold.
6-female_removing_major,target:clover,targetStage:2=thinking,You stopped. What is it?
6-female_removing_major,target:sayori,targetStage:4=teasing,Try to imagine the competition in their underwear. Or less, perhaps?
6-female_removing_major,target:sayori,targetStage:3=calm,As I said, both ways.
6-female_removing_major,target:jolyne,targetStage:2=thinking,That outfit kind of makes no sense. So it covers as much as a bra, but it also has straps?
6-female_removing_major,target:aimee=angry,H-hey! Watch where you point that thing!
6-female_removing_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:5=glad,Sure, sure. Whatever you say.
6-female_removing_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:4=teasing,Let me guess. Borrowed from a friend?
6-female_removing_major,target:seven=glad,I take it you're the type who prefers utility over fashion.
6-female_removing_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5=tranquil,This'll be just like the beach! I believe that's a familiar setting to you?
6-female_removing_major,target:raven,targetStage:2=calm,So this counts as an unmasking, right?
6-female_removing_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4=thinking,(I'm confused why whoever's attacking her didn't target the big stuff from the start.)
6-female_removing_major,target:clover,targetStage:3=thinking,Yes, yes, we're all stupid. You've gotten that point across. Loudly, at that.
6-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:3=glad,Hey, ~player~, take a guess what's in her pants. Three tries. Go!
6-female_removing_major,target:aella,targetStage:3=teasing,Really? How bold of you, Aella. Isn't it wiser for a human to have more protection?
6-female_removing_major,target:nayru,targetStage:4=thinking,...Veran? I swore it was someone else for a minute. Never mind.
6-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:2=thinking,Ah, so that's how that works.
6-female_removing_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:4=thinking,Is this one of those cases where you save the hairpin until the very end, or do you just not care?
6-female_removing_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5=thinking,(Is it really a "deck" when no one can stand on it?)
6-female_removing_major,target:amalia,targetStage:1=surprised,I'm surprised. Going for the skirt? Bold move, wood girl.
6-female_removing_major,target:revy,targetStage:4=calm,Those pants were halfway off, anyway. It's not big in the slightest.
6-female_removed_major=calm,I appreciate you taking the stares for a little while.
6-female_removed_major=worried,Things are certainly getting heated now.
6-female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5=horny,Whoever built you must be really cheap to give you a bra like that, Shimakaze.
6-female_removed_major,target:elaine,targetStage:6=calm,Not at this stage, Elaine.
6-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=glad,Smooth.
6-female_removed_major,target:revy,targetStage:5=glad,That aside, let's finish this up.
6-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:3=tranquil,It worked even better than I hoped!
6-female_removed_major,target:jasmine=glad,Oh yes. You had us all fooled. (<i>Did anyone really fall for it?</i>)
6-female_removed_major,target:lilith,targetStage:6=calm,Your tattoo covers a lot more than I thought. It's pretty impressive, Lilith.
6-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:6=teasing,"Jugs" is putting it lightly.
6-female_removed_major,target:rosalina=horny,Guess the galaxies were contained under that dress after all...
6-female_removed_major,target:misty,targetStage:3=calm,That's a nice bikini. Was the cerulean intentional?
6-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5=teasing,So you mean you <i>don't</i> strip in front of your peers at class trials? Maybe you should try it. It'd certainly get you some more... influence.
6-female_removed_major,target:lyn=horny,Why don't you invite some of your sword lord friends next time, Lyn? With a body like that, imagine what Ike's packing...
6-female_removed_major,target:sayori,targetStage:4=glad,Just think of all the things you'll see when the rest of us lose!
6-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:pay_you_to_keep_dress=tranquil,What's human money to a goddess?
6-female_removed_major,target:spooky=glad,Yeaaahh... maybe this isn't such a good game for ghosts.
6-female_removed_major,target:jenetta,targetStage:5=thinking,Are beaches a natural environment for rabbits? Hmm. Viridi would probably know.
6-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:4=thinking,Now I'm curious. Does dango taste good?
6-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=horny,Even smaller than I thought! Plus, since it's obvious what color your pubes are, it's almost like you're already bottomless!
6-female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:6=calm,But seriously, talk to whoever's in charge. That's probably the <i>last</i> set of underwear a battleship would wear... and that's a sentence that will probably never be muttered again.
6-female_removed_major,target:elaine,targetStage:4=surprised,Garters <i>and</i> see-through? I suppose it makes sense for a formerly high class women.
6-female_removed_major,target:elaine,targetStage:5=teasing,I won't judge. But it <i>really</i> looks like you dressed up to take someone home...
6-female_removed_major,target:zone-tan=glad,For someone so calm, you really have no shame, do you?
6-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:4=calm,Did you guess that it really was a banana? You'd be right.
6-female_removed_major,target:samus=teasing,I kid, I kid.
6-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:Undies02=calm,I get it. I'm rather old-fashioned in that regard, as well.
6-female_removed_major,target:aimee=surprised,Oh...good shot.
6-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:4=tranquil,Strawberries, huh? Even the serious ones have a cute side!
6-female_removed_major,target:clover,targetStage:3=teasing,Seems like our little plant here realized how to play the game.
6-female_removed_major,target:alice=horny,Check out Little Miss Zebra over here! Clearly you were prepared to lose clothes tonight.
6-female_removed_major,target:chell,targetStage:4=worried,I was hoping you weren't wearing anything under your jumpsuit. Does that make me a bad person?
6-female_removed_major,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:4=glad,Not much of a surprise, but that's how it goes, Alice.
6-female_removed_major,target:clover,targetStage:4=glad,And yet here you are playing it. Ironic, isn't it?
6-female_removed_major,target:nayru,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=calm,Just shows off your natural beauty that much more...
6-female_removed_major,target:penny,targetStage:4=tranquil,It's cute, Penny! And it's comfortable? I should get a set for myself!
6-female_removed_major,target:jolyne,targetStage:3=teasing,Conditioned to this, I take it? No wonder you dress so provocatively.
6-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2=surprised,...That was certainly different. I mean, I can transform others myself, but it's not often I see humans wielding that level of magic.
6-female_removed_major,target:clover,targetStage:5=calm,You don't have to worry about that. I'm bored already.
6-female_removed_major,target:sonya=teasing,I see you looking at Sonya, ~player~. Fan of a woman in uniform?
6-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:5=calm,Yes, yes. I've gone through this song and dance more times than I care to remember. Just play the game.
6-female_removed_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:5=tranquil,Is it already Nohrian Summer again?
6-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:6=tranquil,I appreciate your steward undressing with us as well.
6-female_removed_major,target:mia=tranquil,Those are some nice words to live by.
6-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:paying_you_some_tres=calm,I'm very particular about how I take my bribes. Sorry.
6-female_removed_major,target:spooky,targetStage:2=thinking,Hmm... I hear chess is getting popular again.
6-female_removed_major,filter:athletic=calm,I must say, ~name~, you keep in pretty good shape. Do you use Wii Fit?
6-female_removed_major,target:peach,targetStage:5=surprised,I remember your shorts being a lot... frillier.
6-female_removed_major,target:daisy=surprised,I never took you for the "thong" type, Daisy. I imagine the sand must be irritating.
6-female_removed_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:5=tranquil,I think you've overestimated the use of that shirt a little.
6-female_removed_major,target:chara,targetStage:5=tranquil,Well, nothing can stop <i>us</i> from getting it off of you.
6-female_removed_major,target:juri,targetStage:1=calm,A strong start, sure, but can you keep it up?
6-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3=teasing,Look at that! You're <i>not</i> just a pair of eyes and mouth in a void.
6-female_removed_major,target:aella,targetStage:4=glad,Seems your confidence is starting to wane.
6-female_removed_major,target:d.va=horny,How many of your viewers would kill for this view, I wonder?
6-female_removed_major,target:nayru,targetStage:5=worried,Still, this <i>may</i> be a problem. Should I intervene?
6-female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:dizzylose=angry,Rise and shine, we got a game to play.
6-female_removed_major,target:sayori,targetStage:5=calm,You're looking a bit tense. Try not to overthink it. Just... go with the flow.
6-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3=awkward,You really could've gone with anything else.
6-female_removed_major,target:weiss=horny,Sorry, Ice Queen. We're just getting started...
6-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5=horny,A matching set? No wonder you were so adamant about hiding it.
6-female_removed_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:6=teasing,Just keep digging that hole you're in.
6-female_removed_major,target:moon,targetStage:1=worried,Why are those nipple outlines so... crusty? It doesn't look even remotely healthy.
6-female_removed_major,target:amalia,targetStage:2=teasing,Although those panties are hardly natural...
6-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:zizou=teasing,Pride isn't a good look for you, Zizou.
6-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:wiifitfemale=thinking,Been a while since your last game, hasn't it, Trainer?
6-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:buffy,alsoPlayingStage:2=glad,I guess you'd have to, seeing as it's your major strength.
6-female_removed_major,target:juri,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:chun-li=glad,Really, don't do anything. those were just decoy pants anyway.
6-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=angry,No wonder you're so... tightly wound. Remind me to take you to one once this is all over.
6-female_removed_major,target:jolyne,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:misato=calm,Really, who else would come to a game of strip poker dressed so... bizzarely?
6-female_removed_major,target:spooky,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:elaine,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=glad,Real beer's probably not much of an option for you, though. Maybe lite beer would work?
6-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:2-3,totalMales:1-2=glad,Really? Maybe someone else will get lucky tonight, then.
6-female_removed_major,target:jolyne,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:tina=worried,Thinking about your father <i>now</i>? I thought humans grew past that centuries ago.
6-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=tranquil,But not all, of course.
6-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:jura=angry,Frankly, you're starting to get on <i>my</i> nerves a little, too.
6-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:2-3=teasing,You say that, but I see you bending with each passing round.
6-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:weiss=calm,I think I'm in the mood for some chilled strawberries now. What about you two?
6-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=glad,No need to kick her while she's down, Winter. She's already lost hard.
6-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:jura=glad,I see space pirates have a rather... lax standard compared to humans.
6-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:weiss=worried,You have some weird priorities, Winter.
6-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:zoey=thinking,I don't see it. How so, Winter?
6-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=calm,Does this workout include gratuitous use of a razor, too?
6-female_removed_major,target:spooky,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:chica=calm,Apparate schmapparate. You've got underwear, that's all that matters.
6-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=thinking,I admit, it's interesting to think about how her life would be different if she was born human.
6-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:mahiru=tranquil,What a... beautiful friendship you two have. Somehow pure, yet strong.
6-female_removed_major,target:elaine,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:jin=teasing,With a married woman? They were basically zero.
6-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:elena,alsoPlayingStage:6-7=calm,It says something that a goddess is more at ease than you, huh?
6-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:pit=annoyed,Really, Pit. You need to expand your VG horizons.
6-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:shantae,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=thinking,Pretty sure the game's over if something happens to Azura anyway, but it's a good offer.
6-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=glad,It's not like Meia was trying to keep that hidden from us.
6-female_removed_major,target:jolyne,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=calm,Ah, I know of Nirvana. One of those old stories the humans tried to use to explain the gods.
6-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:shantae,alsoPlayingStage:8=glad,You've already given us a performance worthy of Azura. There's no need.
6-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:yang,count-ruby:1=calm,Qrow, huh? Didn't know these girls had a bird for an uncle.
6-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meg,alsoPlayingStage:0=tranquil,You two would make a <i>very</i> interesting team! The slow, heavy hitter and the quick guerilla fighter. Sounds a little familiar, though.
6-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:ruby,count-yang:0=teasing,Are you really threatening a girl barely out of high school? That's just petty.
6-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:5-6=glad,All of you Fire Emblem characters stick together, I see.
6-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:buffy,alsoPlayingStage:2=calm,You two keep on working out. The rest of us have a game to play.
6-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:yang,count-ruby:0=thinking,Who is this Qrow? Friend of yours? Lover, maybe?
6-female_removed_major,target:jolyne,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:4-7=glad,I know you kind of lost your costume and everything, but try and calm down a little.
6-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:marinette=tranquil,You know it, Marinette. You're more fashionable than you might think, Nagisa.
6-female_removed_major,target:sheena,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,Hey Pit, I finally found someone who can gush about hot springs with you!
6-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:4-5=thinking,I don't get it either. Anyway, let's move on, shall we Rinkah?
6-female_removed_major,target:aella,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,Is he wrong, Aella?
6-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=teasing,On the other hand, you're perfectly content to stand here in your strawberry underwear? I see.
6-female_removed_major,target:amalia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:mahiru=thinking,Your eye twitches when you look at Mahiru. Something the matter?
6-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:elena,alsoPlayingStage:8=tranquil,Even <i>I'm</i> not exempt! What are you complaining about, Elena?
6-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:pit=horny,Of course she didn't, Pit. You think someone who <i>planned</i> this would bring a back-up?
6-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:wiifitfemale=glad,I've burned through a few myself.
6-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=teasing,That's something a <i>cute</i> person would say.
6-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5-7=calm,I prefer an "in-between" look myself.
6-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:dress_is_next=calm,Taking it well, I see. Let's move on, then.
6-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:zoey=teasing,I don't think she'd be able to keep up with you, Rinkah.
6-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:overcoat=glad,(She really could've just done the overcoat. And this girl's a mage?)
6-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=glad,Pirate ships aren't <i>that</i> bad.
6-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:pit=horny,What does Palutena think? I'll tell you what she thinks: she's just glad Pit's finally learning to appreciate the female body.
6-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meg,alsoPlayingStage:0-2=glad,Plus, you're almost the exact opposite of her, Meg.
6-female_removed_major,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:aimee=teasing,Well, didn't you two get chummy quick.
6-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=teasing,You're really going to say this right now, Ms. Strawberry?
6-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:mahiru=worried,Is that photoworthy, Mahiru? Anyone could scrunch up their panties.
6-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:jura=teasing,Careful, Jura. You might get burned.
6-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=calm,Have you seen some of the things in the Galactic Sea? Don't take her lightly.
6-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:dress_off_now=thinking,But didn't you rush into stripping it without a second thought?


#naked
-3-male_removing_major=thinking,I'll take what I can get at this point.
-3-male_removing_major=calm,To be honest, this'll make me feel better.
-3-male_removing_major,target:9s,targetStage:3=thinking,Are shorts like those common with ordinary men? I know Pit has a similar pair.
-3-male_removing_major,target:9s,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:futaba=teasing,You wouldn't really want to turn to a life of crime, would you?
-3-male_removing_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:5=calm,How nice are your legs compared to your abs, I wonder...
-3-male_removing_major,target:human=horny,Let's see what you have under the hood, ~player~.
-3-male_removed_major=glad,I don't plan on forfeiting, but if I do, this will make a decent consolation prize.
-3-male_removed_major=horny,You're getting excited, ~name~.
-3-male_removed_major=surprised,~name~, is that a bulge? You must really like my body. I am a goddess after all.
-3-male_removed_major,target:human=surprised,You're more toned than I thought...I'm impressed.
-3-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:4=tranquil,How...specific.
-3-male_removed_major,target:link,targetStage:6=horny,I can see the appeal of the armorless run now...
-3-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,Yeah, that's about the response I expected from you.
-3-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:futaba=awkward,I wouldn't know anything about stealing hearts...but I guess it's not as severe as the alternatives.
-3-male_removed_major,target:corrin_m,targetStage:5=horny,Your, ahem, little dragon is peeking out, Corrin.
-3-male_removed_major,filter:athletic=surprised,I must say, ~name~, you keep in <i>really</i> good shape. Even I'm impressed.
-3-male_removed_major,target:shaggy=worried,(<i>He just seems... greasy.</i>)
-3-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:pit,count-futaba:1=angry,Forget it, Pit. He protects humanity his way, we'll protect it ours.
-3-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:rinkah,count-futaba:1=glad,Surprisingly fun, right?
-3-male_removed_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:6=tranquil,Look at him, so bashful! Just like Pit, really.
-3-female_removing_major=tranquil,Wonderful! I was wondering when you'd step up your indecency game, ~name~.
-3-female_removing_major=calm,Glad you finally decided to show some skin.
-3-female_removing_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:shantae=glad,Maybe ask before you take a catchphrase next time?
-3-female_removing_major,target:clover,targetStage:2=thinking,You stopped. What is it?
-3-female_removing_major,target:miko,targetStage:4=horny,Now it's <i>really</i> getting intimate between you two.
-3-female_removing_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:3=glad,Not that I think a Hoshidan would worry too much over losing her pants, but this'll be interesting, to say the least.
-3-female_removing_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:7-8=teasing,You have more to worry about than Rinkah stripping her pants, right Hermione?
-3-female_removing_major,target:raven,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:inventory_vibe2=glad,Still, you're not wrong, you know?
-3-female_removing_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,Wings <i>do</i> help out in the coolness department.
-3-female_removing_major,target:winter,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=teasing,Makes sense. I see Weiss doing a lot better than you, after all.
-3-female_removing_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:5=glad,Sure, sure. Whatever you say.
-3-female_removing_major,target:clover,targetStage:3=thinking,Yes, yes, we're all stupid. You've gotten that point across. Loudly, at that.
-3-female_removing_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=glad,I think Tina's used to fighting in her underwear, so this works out great.
-3-female_removing_major,target:sayori,targetStage:4=teasing,Try to imagine the competition in their underwear. Or less, perhaps?
-3-female_removing_major,target:elaine,targetStage:3=thinking,You know, I always wondered why he's named "Guybrush". It's like the epitome of naming him after whatever's in the room at the time.
-3-female_removing_major,target:sola,targetStage:2=surprised,Will that work? What about the hat... helmet... whatever?
-3-female_removing_major,target:sayori,targetStage:3=calm,As I said, both ways.
-3-female_removing_major,target:jolyne,targetStage:2=thinking,That outfit kind of makes no sense. So it covers as much as a bra, but it also has straps?
-3-female_removing_major,target:jolyne,targetStage:2,targetTimeInStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=glad,It's not like she's lying to her self. She's just not in a hurry to admit it.
-3-female_removing_major,target:sola,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:2-4=glad,So humans get it naturally, too. How wonderful.
-3-female_removing_major,target:sola,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=thinking,(She had other options. Wonder why she didn't take them?)
-3-female_removing_major,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=glad,So simple, yet so elegant.
-3-female_removing_major,target:juri,targetStage:0=glad,Pants already? Someone's bold.
-3-female_removing_major,target:samus=surprised,Wait, Samus is a girl?
-3-female_removing_major,target:spooky,targetStage:1=teasing,Really, Ms. Hospital Gown? I hadn't noticed.
-3-female_removing_major,target:miko,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:Random01=tranquil,Indutiably, Miko.
-3-female_removing_major,target:jenetta,targetStage:4=glad,No, that looks a bit tricky.
-3-female_removing_major,target:clover,targetStage:4=worried,So you know Solid Snake? I hadn't met him in person until recently.
-3-female_removing_major,target:miko,targetStage:5=teasing,You almost did that automatically! Who's really controlling who here?
-3-female_removing_major,target:winter,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:3-4=teasing,You think so? I didn't know eyes were so low...
-3-female_removing_major,target:revy,targetStage:4=calm,Those pants were halfway off, anyway. It's not big in the slightest.
-3-female_removing_major,target:seven=glad,I take it you're the type who prefers utility over fashion.
-3-female_removing_major,target:nayru,targetStage:4=thinking,...Veran? I swore it was someone else for a minute. Never mind.
-3-female_removing_major,target:aella,targetStage:3=teasing,Really? How bold of you, Aella. Isn't it wiser for a human to have more protection?
-3-female_removing_major,target:sola,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:zizou,count-elizabeth:1=glad,Not really. You're still only on your first console generation!
-3-female_removing_major,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:3=teasing,No. Because I already know the answer.
-3-female_removing_major,target:moon,targetStage:0=surprised,That's one strategy, although it might come back to bite you down the line.
-3-female_removing_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4,targetTimeInStage:0,targetSaidMarker:dizzy=teasing,That ought to wake you up.
-3-female_removing_major,target:sola,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:zizou=surprised,I'm sorry, she did <i>what</i>?
-3-female_removing_major,target:elaine,targetStage:5=glad,I have experience with three-headed dragons. A monkey won't phase me.
-3-female_removing_major,target:elaine,targetStage:4=horny,Oh! A twofer like that should really raise the stakes.
-3-female_removing_major,target:raven,targetStage:2=calm,So this counts as an unmasking, right?
-3-female_removing_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:florina,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=calm,Literally, with muscles like those.
-3-female_removing_major,target:aimee=angry,H-hey! Watch where you point that thing!
-3-female_removing_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5=tranquil,This'll be just like the beach! I believe that's a familiar setting to you?
-3-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:3=glad,Hey, ~player~, take a guess what's in her pants. Three tries. Go!
-3-female_removing_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5=thinking,(Is it really a "deck" when no one can stand on it?)
-3-female_removing_major,target:mercy,targetStage:2=glad,Aw, look at the humans, wanting to dress up like us. That's adorable.
-3-female_removing_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4=thinking,(I'm confused why whoever's attacking her didn't target the big stuff from the start.)
-3-female_removing_major,target:winter,targetStage:3=teasing,Your composure's breaking. I thought you were supposed to be <i>the best</i>?
-3-female_removing_major,target:zone-tan=calm,So do you find those pants comfortable? I never really saw the appeal.
-3-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:2=thinking,Ah, so that's how that works.
-3-female_removing_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:4=teasing,Let me guess. Borrowed from a friend?
-3-female_removing_major,target:peach,targetStage:4=teasing,So is it going to be a black void, or something worth looking at?
-3-female_removing_major,target:juri,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:chun-li=thinking,Isn't it usually the criminal who does the admission?
-3-female_removing_major,target:winter,targetStage:4=surprised,You mean they're not separate? Great!
-3-female_removing_major,target:miko,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:Undies01=horny,So you were mortal at some point?
-3-female_removing_major,target:winter,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:weiss=calm,Well, it'll all be out in the open soon enough, right Weiss? Nothing hidden between sisters?
-3-female_removing_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:4=thinking,Is this one of those cases where you save the hairpin until the very end, or do you just not care?
-3-female_removing_major,target:amalia,targetStage:1=surprised,I'm surprised. Going for the skirt? Bold move, wood girl.
-3-female_removing_major,target:winter,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:5-8=tranquil,Both Schnee sisters reduced to so little. It's almost funny, really.
-3-female_removed_major=angry,I've made it this far. I <i>will</i> see this through!
-3-female_removed_major=glad,Don't count me out just yet!
-3-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:5-6=glad,All of you Fire Emblem characters stick together, I see.
-3-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=calm,Have you seen some of the things in the Galactic Sea? Don't take her lightly.
-3-female_removed_major,target:jolyne,targetStage:3=teasing,Conditioned to this, I take it? No wonder you dress so provocatively.
-3-female_removed_major,target:alice=horny,Check out Little Miss Zebra over here! Clearly you were prepared to lose clothes tonight.
-3-female_removed_major,target:samus=teasing,I kid, I kid.
-3-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=calm,Does this workout include gratuitous use of a razor, too?
-3-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5=teasing,So you mean you <i>don't</i> strip in front of your peers at class trials? Maybe you should try it. It'd certainly get you some more... influence.
-3-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=thinking,I admit, it's interesting to think about how her life would be different if she was born human.
-3-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3=awkward,You really could've gone with anything else.
-3-female_removed_major,target:clover,targetStage:5=calm,You don't have to worry about that. I'm bored already.
-3-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=teasing,On the other hand, you're perfectly content to stand here in your strawberry underwear? I see.
-3-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=glad,It's not like Meia was trying to keep that hidden from us.
-3-female_removed_major,target:jolyne,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=calm,Ah, I know of Nirvana. One of those old stories the humans tried to use to explain the gods.
-3-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meg,alsoPlayingStage:0=tranquil,You two would make a <i>very</i> interesting team! The slow, heavy hitter and the quick guerilla fighter. Sounds a little familiar, though.
-3-female_removed_major,target:moon,targetStage:1=worried,Why are those nipple outlines so... crusty? It doesn't look even remotely healthy.
-3-female_removed_major,target:elaine,targetStage:4=surprised,Garters <i>and</i> see-through? I suppose it makes sense for a formerly high class women.
-3-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:6=teasing,"Jugs" is putting it lightly.
-3-female_removed_major,target:spooky,targetStage:2=thinking,Hmm... I hear chess is getting popular again.
-3-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:4=tranquil,Strawberries, huh? Even the serious ones have a cute side!
-3-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:buffy,alsoPlayingStage:2=glad,I guess you'd have to, seeing as it's your major strength.
-3-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3=teasing,Look at that! You're <i>not</i> just a pair of eyes and mouth in a void.
-3-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5=horny,A matching set? No wonder you were so adamant about hiding it.
-3-female_removed_major,target:rosalina=horny,Guess the galaxies were contained under that dress after all...
-3-female_removed_major,target:juri,targetStage:1=calm,A strong start, sure, but can you keep it up?
-3-female_removed_major,target:spooky,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:elaine,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=glad,Real beer's probably not much of an option for you, though. Maybe lite beer would work?
-3-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:elena,alsoPlayingStage:6-7=calm,It says something that a goddess is more at ease than you, huh?
-3-female_removed_major,target:jasmine=glad,Oh yes. You had us all fooled. (<i>Did anyone really fall for it?</i>)
-3-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=angry,No wonder you're so... tightly wound. Remind me to take you to one once this is all over.
-3-female_removed_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:5=tranquil,I think you've overestimated the use of that shirt a little.
-3-female_removed_major,target:clover,targetStage:3=teasing,Seems like our little plant here realized how to play the game.
-3-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=teasing,You're really going to say this right now, Ms. Strawberry?
-3-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:elena,alsoPlayingStage:8=tranquil,Even <i>I'm</i> not exempt! What are you complaining about, Elena?
-3-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=tranquil,But not all, of course.
-3-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=glad,Pirate ships aren't <i>that</i> bad.
-3-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:4-5=thinking,I don't get it either. Anyway, let's move on, shall we Rinkah?
-3-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=glad,No need to kick her while she's down, Winter. She's already lost hard.
-3-female_removed_major,target:lyn=horny,Why don't you invite some of your sword lord friends next time, Lyn? With a body like that, imagine what Ike's packing...
-3-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meg,alsoPlayingStage:0-2=glad,Plus, you're almost the exact opposite of her, Meg.
-3-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:2-3=teasing,You say that, but I see you bending with each passing round.
-3-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:buffy,alsoPlayingStage:2=calm,You two keep on working out. The rest of us have a game to play.
-3-female_removed_major,target:clover,targetStage:4=glad,And yet here you are playing it. Ironic, isn't it?
-3-female_removed_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:6=teasing,Just keep digging that hole you're in.
-3-female_removed_major,target:aella,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,Is he wrong, Aella?
-3-female_removed_major,target:elaine,targetStage:5=teasing,I won't judge. But it <i>really</i> looks like you dressed up to take someone home...
-3-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:5=calm,Yes, yes. I've gone through this song and dance more times than I care to remember. Just play the game.
-3-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:zoey=thinking,I don't see it. How so, Winter?
-3-female_removed_major,target:sayori,targetStage:4=glad,Just think of all the things you'll see when the rest of us lose!
-3-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:weiss=worried,You have some weird priorities, Winter.
-3-female_removed_major,target:chara,targetStage:5=tranquil,Well, nothing can stop <i>us</i> from getting it off of you.
-3-female_removed_major,target:zone-tan=glad,For someone so calm, you really have no shame, do you?
-3-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:jura=glad,I see space pirates have a rather... lax standard compared to humans.
-3-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:weiss=calm,I think I'm in the mood for some chilled strawberries now. What about you two?
-3-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:4=thinking,Now I'm curious. Does dango taste good?
-3-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:jura=angry,Frankly, you're starting to get on <i>my</i> nerves a little, too.
-3-female_removed_major,target:daisy=surprised,I never took you for the "thong" type, Daisy. I imagine the sand must be irritating.
-3-female_removed_major,target:peach,targetStage:5=surprised,I remember your shorts being a lot... frillier.
-3-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:zizou=teasing,Pride isn't a good look for you, Zizou.
-3-female_removed_major,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:4=glad,Not much of a surprise, but that's how it goes, Alice.
-3-female_removed_major,target:revy,targetStage:5=glad,That aside, let's finish this up.
-3-female_removed_major,target:chell,targetStage:4=worried,I was hoping you weren't wearing anything under your jumpsuit. Does that make me a bad person?
-3-female_removed_major,target:weiss=horny,Sorry, Ice Queen. We're just getting started...
-3-female_removed_major,target:penny,targetStage:4=tranquil,It's cute, Penny! And it's comfortable? I should get a set for myself!
-3-female_removed_major,target:spooky,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:chica=calm,Apparate schmapparate. You've got underwear, that's all that matters.
-3-female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5=horny,Whoever built you must be really cheap to give you a bra like that, Shimakaze.
-3-female_removed_major,target:elaine,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:jin=teasing,With a married woman? They were basically zero.
-3-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:overcoat=glad,(She really could've just done the overcoat. And this girl's a mage?)
-3-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:dress_off_now=thinking,But didn't you rush into stripping it without a second thought?
-3-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:pay_you_to_keep_dress=tranquil,What's human money to a goddess?
-3-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:dress_is_next=calm,Taking it well, I see. Let's move on, then.
-3-female_removed_major,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:aimee=teasing,Well, didn't you two get chummy quick.
-3-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:paying_you_some_tres=calm,I'm very particular about how I take my bribes. Sorry.
-3-female_removed_major,target:mia=tranquil,Those are some nice words to live by.
-3-female_removed_major,filter:athletic=calm,I must say, ~name~, you keep in pretty good shape. Do you use Wii Fit?
-3-female_removed_major,target:jolyne,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:misato=calm,Really, who else would come to a game of strip poker dressed so... bizzarely?
-3-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:zoey=teasing,I don't think she'd be able to keep up with you, Rinkah.
-3-female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:dizzylose=angry,Rise and shine, we got a game to play.
-3-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:mahiru=worried,Is that photoworthy, Mahiru? Anyone could scrunch up their panties.
-3-female_removed_major,target:aimee=surprised,Oh...good shot.
-3-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:jura=teasing,Careful, Jura. You might get burned.
-3-female_removed_major,target:nayru,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=calm,Just shows off your natural beauty that much more...
-3-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:6=tranquil,I appreciate your steward undressing with us as well.
-3-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=teasing,That's something a <i>cute</i> person would say.
-3-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:Undies02=calm,I get it. I'm rather old-fashioned in that regard, as well.
-3-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:pit=horny,What does Palutena think? I'll tell you what she thinks: she's just glad Pit's finally learning to appreciate the female body.
-3-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:2-3,totalMales:1-2=glad,Really? Maybe someone else will get lucky tonight, then.
-3-female_removed_major,target:jolyne,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:tina=worried,Thinking about your father <i>now</i>? I thought humans grew past that centuries ago.
-3-female_removed_major,target:lilith,targetStage:6=calm,Your tattoo covers a lot more than I thought. It's pretty impressive, Lilith.
-3-female_removed_major,target:juri,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:chun-li=glad,Really, don't do anything. those were just decoy pants anyway.
-3-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:yang,count-ruby:0=thinking,Who is this Qrow? Friend of yours? Lover, maybe?
-3-female_removed_major,target:aella,targetStage:4=glad,Seems your confidence is starting to wane.
-3-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:ruby,count-yang:0=teasing,Are you really threatening a girl barely out of high school? That's just petty.
-3-female_removed_major,target:jolyne,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:4-7=glad,I know you kind of lost your costume and everything, but try and calm down a little.
-3-female_removed_major,target:sonya=teasing,I see you looking at Sonya, ~player~. Fan of a woman in uniform?
-3-female_removed_major,target:amalia,targetStage:2=teasing,Although those panties are hardly natural...
-3-female_removed_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:5=tranquil,Is it already Nohrian Summer again?
-3-female_removed_major,target:elaine,targetStage:6=calm,Not at this stage, Elaine.
-3-female_removed_major,target:sayori,targetStage:5=calm,You're looking a bit tense. Try not to overthink it. Just... go with the flow.
-3-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:shantae,alsoPlayingStage:8=glad,You've already given us a performance worthy of Azura. There's no need.
-3-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:3=tranquil,It worked even better than I hoped!
-3-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:shantae,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=thinking,Pretty sure the game's over if something happens to Azura anyway, but it's a good offer.
-3-female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:6=calm,But seriously, talk to whoever's in charge. That's probably the <i>last</i> set of underwear a battleship would wear... and that's a sentence that will probably never be muttered again.
-3-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5-7=calm,I prefer an "in-between" look myself.
-3-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:4=calm,Did you guess that it really was a banana? You'd be right.
-3-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:yang,count-ruby:1=calm,Qrow, huh? Didn't know these girls had a bird for an uncle.
-3-female_removed_major,target:sheena,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,Hey Pit, I finally found someone who can gush about hot springs with you!
-3-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:marinette=tranquil,You know it, Marinette. You're more fashionable than you might think, Nagisa.
-3-female_removed_major,target:d.va=horny,How many of your viewers would kill for this view, I wonder?
-3-female_removed_major,target:amalia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:mahiru=thinking,Your eye twitches when you look at Mahiru. Something the matter?
-3-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=horny,Even smaller than I thought! Plus, since it's obvious what color your pubes are, it's almost like you're already bottomless!
-3-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:wiifitfemale=thinking,Been a while since your last game, hasn't it, Trainer?
-3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=glad,Smooth.
-3-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:pit=horny,Of course she didn't, Pit. You think someone who <i>planned</i> this would bring a back-up?
-3-female_removed_major,target:spooky=glad,Yeaaahh... maybe this isn't such a good game for ghosts.
-3-female_removed_major,target:nayru,targetStage:5=worried,Still, this <i>may</i> be a problem. Should I intervene?
-3-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:mahiru=tranquil,What a... beautiful friendship you two have. Somehow pure, yet strong.
-3-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:pit=annoyed,Really, Pit. You need to expand your VG horizons.
-3-female_removed_major,target:jenetta,targetStage:5=thinking,Are beaches a natural environment for rabbits? Hmm. Viridi would probably know.
-3-female_removed_major,target:misty,targetStage:3=calm,That's a nice bikini. Was the cerulean intentional?
-3-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:wiifitfemale=glad,I've burned through a few myself.
-3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2=surprised,...That was certainly different. I mean, I can transform others myself, but it's not often I see humans wielding that level of magic.

-2-female_removing_major=calm,Your ~clothing~? Good pick...
-2-female_removing_major,target:sola,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:zizou,count-elizabeth:1=glad,Not really. You're still only on your first console generation!

-2-female_removing_major,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:3=teasing,No. Because I already know the answer.
-2-female_removing_major,target:miko,targetStage:4=horny,Now it's <i>really</i> getting intimate between you two.
-2-female_removing_major,target:elaine,targetStage:3=thinking,You know, I always wondered why he's named "Guybrush". It's like the epitome of naming him after whatever's in the room at the time.

-2-female_removing_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:shantae=glad,Maybe ask before you take a catchphrase next time?
-2-female_removing_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:3=glad,Not that I think a Hoshidan would worry too much over losing her pants, but this'll be interesting, to say the least.
-2-female_removing_major,target:jolyne,targetStage:2=thinking,That outfit kind of makes no sense. So it covers as much as a bra, but it also has straps?
-2-female_removing_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:7-8=teasing,You have more to worry about than Rinkah stripping her pants, right Hermione?
-2-female_removing_major,target:sola,targetStage:2=surprised,Will that work? What about the hat... helmet... whatever?
-2-female_removing_major,target:spooky,targetStage:1=teasing,Really, Ms. Hospital Gown? I hadn't noticed.

-2-female_removing_major,target:clover,targetStage:3=thinking,Yes, yes, we're all stupid. You've gotten that point across. Loudly, at that.
-2-female_removing_major,target:clover,targetStage:2=thinking,You stopped. What is it?
-2-female_removing_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:5=glad,Sure, sure. Whatever you say.
-2-female_removing_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:4=teasing,Let me guess. Borrowed from a friend?

-2-female_removing_major,target:miko,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:Undies01=horny,So you were mortal at some point?

-2-female_removing_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=glad,I think Tina's used to fighting in her underwear, so this works out great.
-2-female_removing_major,target:jolyne,targetStage:2,targetTimeInStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=glad,It's not like she's lying to her self. She's just not in a hurry to admit it.
-2-female_removing_major,target:miko,targetStage:5=teasing,You almost did that automatically! Who's really controlling who here?
-2-female_removing_major,target:sola,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:zizou=surprised,I'm sorry, she did <i>what</i>?
-2-female_removing_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5=thinking,(Is it really a "deck" when no one can stand on it?)
-2-female_removing_major,target:raven,targetStage:2=calm,So this counts as an unmasking, right?
-2-female_removing_major,target:winter,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=teasing,Makes sense. I see Weiss doing a lot better than you, after all.
-2-female_removing_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4=thinking,(I'm confused why whoever's attacking her didn't target the big stuff from the start.)
-2-female_removing_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:florina,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=calm,Literally, with muscles like those.
-2-female_removing_major,target:winter,targetStage:3=teasing,Your composure's breaking. I thought you were supposed to be <i>the best</i>?
-2-female_removing_major,target:winter,targetStage:4=surprised,You mean they're not separate? Great!
-2-female_removing_major,target:sayori,targetStage:4=teasing,Try to imagine the competition in their underwear. Or less, perhaps?
-2-female_removing_major,target:sayori,targetStage:3=calm,As I said, both ways.
-2-female_removing_major,target:jenetta,targetStage:4=glad,No, that looks a bit tricky.
-2-female_removing_major,target:sola,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:2-4=glad,So humans get it naturally, too. How wonderful.
-2-female_removing_major,target:revy,targetStage:4=calm,Those pants were halfway off, anyway. It's not big in the slightest.
-2-female_removing_major,target:moon,targetStage:0=surprised,That's one strategy, although it might come back to bite you down the line.
-2-female_removing_major,target:winter,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:3-4=teasing,You think so? I didn't know eyes were so low...
-2-female_removing_major,target:winter,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:5-8=tranquil,Both Schnee sisters reduced to so little. It's almost funny, really.
-2-female_removed_major=glad,Ah...I like it...
-2-female_removed_major=tranquil,Can you tell I'm enjoying this?
-2-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:4=tranquil,Strawberries, huh? Even the serious ones have a cute side!
-2-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5=horny,A matching set? No wonder you were so adamant about hiding it.
-2-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:6=tranquil,I appreciate your steward undressing with us as well.
-2-female_removed_major,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:4=glad,Not much of a surprise, but that's how it goes, Alice.
-2-female_removed_major,target:moon,targetStage:1=worried,Why are those nipple outlines so... crusty? It doesn't look even remotely healthy.
-2-female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5=horny,Whoever built you must be really cheap to give you a bra like that, Shimakaze.
-2-female_removed_major,target:nayru,targetStage:5=worried,Still, this <i>may</i> be a problem. Should I intervene?
-2-female_removed_major,target:spooky,targetStage:2=thinking,Hmm... I hear chess is getting popular again.
-2-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=horny,Even smaller than I thought! Plus, since it's obvious what color your pubes are, it's almost like you're already bottomless!
-2-female_removed_major,target:elaine,targetStage:6=calm,Not at this stage, Elaine.
-2-female_removed_major,target:elaine,targetStage:4=surprised,Garters <i>and</i> see-through? I suppose it makes sense for a formerly high class women.
-2-female_removed_major,target:elaine,targetStage:5=teasing,I won't judge. But it <i>really</i> looks like you dressed up to take someone home...
-2-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:5=calm,Yes, yes. I've gone through this song and dance more times than I care to remember. Just play the game.
-2-female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:6=calm,But seriously, talk to whoever's in charge. That's probably the <i>last</i> set of underwear a battleship would wear... and that's a sentence that will probably never be muttered again.
-2-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=thinking,I admit, it's interesting to think about how her life would be different if she was born human.
-2-female_removed_major,target:sayori,targetStage:5=calm,You're looking a bit tense. Try not to overthink it. Just... go with the flow.
-2-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:pit=annoyed,Really, Pit. You need to expand your VG horizons.
-2-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:pit=horny,Of course she didn't, Pit. You think someone who <i>planned</i> this would bring a back-up?
-2-female_removed_major,target:amalia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:mahiru=thinking,Your eye twitches when you look at Mahiru. Something the matter?
-2-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:yang,count-ruby:0=thinking,Who is this Qrow? Friend of yours? Lover, maybe?
-2-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:ruby,count-yang:0=teasing,Are you really threatening a girl barely out of high school? That's just petty.
-2-female_removed_major,target:amalia,targetStage:2=teasing,Although those panties are hardly natural...
-2-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:yang,count-ruby:1=calm,Qrow, huh? Didn't know these girls had a bird for an uncle.
-2-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:shantae,alsoPlayingStage:8=glad,You've already given us a performance worthy of Azura. There's no need.
-2-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:3=tranquil,It worked even better than I hoped!
-2-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:shantae,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=thinking,Pretty sure the game's over if something happens to Azura anyway, but it's a good offer.
-2-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:wiifitfemale=glad,I've burned through a few myself.
-2-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:4=calm,Did you guess that it really was a banana? You'd be right.
-2-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meg,alsoPlayingStage:0=tranquil,You two would make a <i>very</i> interesting team! The slow, heavy hitter and the quick guerilla fighter. Sounds a little familiar, though.
-2-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5=teasing,So you mean you <i>don't</i> strip in front of your peers at class trials? Maybe you should try it. It'd certainly get you some more... influence.
-2-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:5-6=glad,All of you Fire Emblem characters stick together, I see.
-2-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:6=teasing,"Jugs" is putting it lightly.
-2-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:4-5=thinking,I don't get it either. Anyway, let's move on, shall we Rinkah?
-2-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:elena,alsoPlayingStage:8=tranquil,Even <i>I'm</i> not exempt! What are you complaining about, Elena?
-2-female_removed_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:5=tranquil,I think you've overestimated the use of that shirt a little.
-2-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:elena,alsoPlayingStage:6-7=calm,It says something that a goddess is more at ease than you, huh?
-2-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:buffy,alsoPlayingStage:2=glad,I guess you'd have to, seeing as it's your major strength.
-2-female_removed_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:6=teasing,Just keep digging that hole you're in.
-2-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=glad,It's not like Meia was trying to keep that hidden from us.
-2-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:mahiru=tranquil,What a... beautiful friendship you two have. Somehow pure, yet strong.
-2-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:wiifitfemale=thinking,Been a while since your last game, hasn't it, Trainer?
-2-female_removed_major,target:juri,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:chun-li=glad,Really, don't do anything. those were just decoy pants anyway.
-2-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:overcoat=glad,(She really could've just done the overcoat. And this girl's a mage?)
-2-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:dress_off_now=thinking,But didn't you rush into stripping it without a second thought?
-2-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:pay_you_to_keep_dress=tranquil,What's human money to a goddess?
-2-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:dress_is_next=calm,Taking it well, I see. Let's move on, then.
-2-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:paying_you_some_tres=calm,I'm very particular about how I take my bribes. Sorry.
-2-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:zoey=teasing,I don't think she'd be able to keep up with you, Rinkah.
-2-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:pit=horny,What does Palutena think? I'll tell you what she thinks: she's just glad Pit's finally learning to appreciate the female body.
-2-female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:dizzylose=angry,Rise and shine, we got a game to play.
-2-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:mahiru=worried,Is that photoworthy, Mahiru? Anyone could scrunch up their panties.
-2-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:jura=teasing,Careful, Jura. You might get burned.
-2-female_removed_major,target:nayru,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=calm,Just shows off your natural beauty that much more...
-2-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=teasing,That's something a <i>cute</i> person would say.
-2-female_removed_major,target:elaine,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:jin=teasing,With a married woman? They were basically zero.
-2-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:Undies02=calm,I get it. I'm rather old-fashioned in that regard, as well.
-2-female_removed_major,target:spooky,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:chica=calm,Apparate schmapparate. You've got underwear, that's all that matters.
-2-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:zoey=thinking,I don't see it. How so, Winter?
-2-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:weiss=worried,You have some weird priorities, Winter.
-2-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:jura=glad,I see space pirates have a rather... lax standard compared to humans.
-2-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:weiss=calm,I think I'm in the mood for some chilled strawberries now. What about you two?
-2-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:jura=angry,Frankly, you're starting to get on <i>my</i> nerves a little, too.
-2-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:zizou=teasing,Pride isn't a good look for you, Zizou.
-2-female_removed_major,target:jolyne,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:tina=worried,Thinking about your father <i>now</i>? I thought humans grew past that centuries ago.
-2-female_removed_major,target:jolyne,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:misato=calm,Really, who else would come to a game of strip poker dressed so... bizzarely?
-2-female_removed_major,target:spooky,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:elaine,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=glad,Real beer's probably not much of an option for you, though. Maybe lite beer would work?
-2-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=tranquil,But not all, of course.
-2-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5-7=calm,I prefer an "in-between" look myself.
-2-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=teasing,You're really going to say this right now, Ms. Strawberry?
-2-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=angry,No wonder you're so... tightly wound. Remind me to take you to one once this is all over.
-2-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:2-3,totalMales:1-2=glad,Really? Maybe someone else will get lucky tonight, then.
-2-female_removed_major,target:revy,targetStage:5=glad,That aside, let's finish this up.
-2-female_removed_major,target:juri,targetStage:1=calm,A strong start, sure, but can you keep it up?
-2-female_removed_major,target:jenetta,targetStage:5=thinking,Are beaches a natural environment for rabbits? Hmm. Viridi would probably know.
-2-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=glad,Pirate ships aren't <i>that</i> bad.
-2-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meg,alsoPlayingStage:0-2=glad,Plus, you're almost the exact opposite of her, Meg.
-2-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=calm,Have you seen some of the things in the Galactic Sea? Don't take her lightly.
-2-female_removed_major,target:jolyne,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:4-7=glad,I know you kind of lost your costume and everything, but try and calm down a little.
-2-female_removed_major,target:clover,targetStage:5=calm,You don't have to worry about that. I'm bored already.
-2-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:buffy,alsoPlayingStage:2=calm,You two keep on working out. The rest of us have a game to play.
-2-female_removed_major,target:sayori,targetStage:4=glad,Just think of all the things you'll see when the rest of us lose!
-2-female_removed_major,target:jolyne,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=calm,Ah, I know of Nirvana. One of those old stories the humans tried to use to explain the gods.
-2-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=calm,Does this workout include gratuitous use of a razor, too?
-2-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:2-3=teasing,You say that, but I see you bending with each passing round.
-2-female_removed_major,target:jolyne,targetStage:3=teasing,Conditioned to this, I take it? No wonder you dress so provocatively.
-2-female_removed_major,target:clover,targetStage:3=teasing,Seems like our little plant here realized how to play the game.
-2-female_removed_major,target:clover,targetStage:4=glad,And yet here you are playing it. Ironic, isn't it?
-2-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=glad,No need to kick her while she's down, Winter. She's already lost hard.
-2-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3=awkward,You really could've gone with anything else.
-2-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3=teasing,Look at that! You're <i>not</i> just a pair of eyes and mouth in a void.
-2-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=teasing,On the other hand, you're perfectly content to stand here in your strawberry underwear? I see.


#finished
-1-male_removing_major=glad,Yeeeeaaahh, you were a bit slow there, buddy.
-1-male_removing_major=awkward,Too little, too late. But I appreciate the thought.
-1-male_removing_major,target:human=horny,Let's see what you have under the hood, ~player~.
-1-male_removing_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:5=calm,How nice are your legs compared to your abs, I wonder...
-1-male_removed_major=thinking,Looking good! Hopefully the rest comes off before the game ends...
-1-male_removed_major=annoyed,Come on, ~name~! Just get naked already! Please?
-1-male_removed_major,target:human=surprised,You're more toned than I thought...I'm impressed.
-1-male_removed_major,target:shaggy=worried,(<i>He just seems... greasy.</i>)
-1-male_removed_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:6=tranquil,Look at him, so bashful! Just like Pit, really.
-1-male_removed_major,filter:athletic=surprised,I must say, ~name~, you keep in <i>really</i> good shape. Even I'm impressed.
-1-male_removed_major,target:corrin_m,targetStage:5=horny,Your, ahem, little dragon is peeking out, Corrin.
-1-male_removed_major,target:link,targetStage:6=horny,I can see the appeal of the armorless run now...
-1-female_removing_major=annoyed,Listen, I'm not trying to nitpick, but you <i>really</i> couldn't have ditched it sooner?
-1-female_removing_major=tranquil,Took you all long enough. I nearly lost hope!
-1-female_removing_major,target:elaine,targetStage:5=glad,I have experience with three-headed dragons. A monkey won't phase me.
-1-female_removing_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:4=thinking,Is this one of those cases where you save the hairpin until the very end, or do you just not care?
-1-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:3=glad,Hey, ~player~, take a guess what's in her pants. Three tries. Go!
-1-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:2=thinking,Ah, so that's how that works.
-1-female_removing_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4=thinking,(I'm confused why whoever's attacking her didn't target the big stuff from the start.)
-1-female_removing_major,target:winter,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:weiss=calm,Well, it'll all be out in the open soon enough, right Weiss? Nothing hidden between sisters?
-1-female_removing_major,target:miko,targetStage:5=teasing,You almost did that automatically! Who's really controlling who here?
-1-female_removing_major,target:miko,targetStage:4=horny,Now it's <i>really</i> getting intimate between you two.
-1-female_removing_major,target:raven,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:inventory_vibe2=glad,Still, you're not wrong, you know?
-1-female_removing_major,target:samus=surprised,Wait, Samus is a girl?
-1-female_removing_major,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=glad,So simple, yet so elegant.
-1-female_removing_major,target:seven=glad,I take it you're the type who prefers utility over fashion.
-1-female_removing_major,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:3=teasing,No. Because I already know the answer.
-1-female_removing_major,target:zone-tan=calm,So do you find those pants comfortable? I never really saw the appeal.
-1-female_removing_major,target:miko,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:Random01=tranquil,Indutiably, Miko.
-1-female_removing_major,target:aimee=angry,H-hey! Watch where you point that thing!
-1-female_removing_major,target:miko,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:Undies01=horny,So you were mortal at some point?
-1-female_removing_major,target:mercy,targetStage:2=glad,Aw, look at the humans, wanting to dress up like us. That's adorable.
-1-female_removing_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:shantae=glad,Maybe ask before you take a catchphrase next time?
-1-female_removing_major,target:nayru,targetStage:4=thinking,...Veran? I swore it was someone else for a minute. Never mind.
-1-female_removing_major,target:peach,targetStage:4=teasing,So is it going to be a black void, or something worth looking at?
-1-female_removing_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:3=glad,Not that I think a Hoshidan would worry too much over losing her pants, but this'll be interesting, to say the least.
-1-female_removing_major,target:amalia,targetStage:1=surprised,I'm surprised. Going for the skirt? Bold move, wood girl.
-1-female_removing_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,Wings <i>do</i> help out in the coolness department.
-1-female_removing_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5=tranquil,This'll be just like the beach! I believe that's a familiar setting to you?
-1-female_removing_major,target:sola,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:zizou,count-elizabeth:1=glad,Not really. You're still only on your first console generation!
-1-female_removing_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4,targetTimeInStage:0,targetSaidMarker:dizzy=teasing,That ought to wake you up.
-1-female_removing_major,target:jenetta,targetStage:4=glad,No, that looks a bit tricky.
-1-female_removing_major,target:winter,targetStage:3=teasing,Your composure's breaking. I thought you were supposed to be <i>the best</i>?
-1-female_removing_major,target:sola,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:2-4=glad,So humans get it naturally, too. How wonderful.
-1-female_removing_major,target:winter,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:3-4=teasing,You think so? I didn't know eyes were so low...
-1-female_removing_major,target:winter,targetStage:4=surprised,You mean they're not separate? Great!
-1-female_removing_major,target:revy,targetStage:4=calm,Those pants were halfway off, anyway. It's not big in the slightest.
-1-female_removing_major,target:sola,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:zizou=surprised,I'm sorry, she did <i>what</i>?
-1-female_removing_major,target:raven,targetStage:2=calm,So this counts as an unmasking, right?
-1-female_removing_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=glad,I think Tina's used to fighting in her underwear, so this works out great.
-1-female_removing_major,target:elaine,targetStage:4=horny,Oh! A twofer like that should really raise the stakes.
-1-female_removing_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:florina,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=calm,Literally, with muscles like those.
-1-female_removing_major,target:sola,targetStage:2=surprised,Will that work? What about the hat... helmet... whatever?
-1-female_removing_major,target:jolyne,targetStage:2,targetTimeInStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=glad,It's not like she's lying to her self. She's just not in a hurry to admit it.
-1-female_removing_major,target:jolyne,targetStage:2=thinking,That outfit kind of makes no sense. So it covers as much as a bra, but it also has straps?
-1-female_removing_major,target:winter,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:5-8=tranquil,Both Schnee sisters reduced to so little. It's almost funny, really.
-1-female_removing_major,target:moon,targetStage:0=surprised,That's one strategy, although it might come back to bite you down the line.
-1-female_removing_major,target:winter,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=teasing,Makes sense. I see Weiss doing a lot better than you, after all.
-1-female_removing_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5=thinking,(Is it really a "deck" when no one can stand on it?)
-1-female_removing_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:4=teasing,Let me guess. Borrowed from a friend?
-1-female_removing_major,target:elaine,targetStage:3=thinking,You know, I always wondered why he's named "Guybrush". It's like the epitome of naming him after whatever's in the room at the time.
-1-female_removing_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:5=glad,Sure, sure. Whatever you say.
-1-female_removing_major,target:clover,targetStage:2=thinking,You stopped. What is it?
-1-female_removing_major,target:juri,targetStage:0=glad,Pants already? Someone's bold.
-1-female_removing_major,target:juri,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:chun-li=thinking,Isn't it usually the criminal who does the admission?
-1-female_removing_major,target:clover,targetStage:3=thinking,Yes, yes, we're all stupid. You've gotten that point across. Loudly, at that.
-1-female_removing_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:7-8=teasing,You have more to worry about than Rinkah stripping her pants, right Hermione?
-1-female_removing_major,target:clover,targetStage:4=worried,So you know Solid Snake? I hadn't met him in person until recently.
-1-female_removing_major,target:spooky,targetStage:1=teasing,Really, Ms. Hospital Gown? I hadn't noticed.
-1-female_removing_major,target:sayori,targetStage:4=teasing,Try to imagine the competition in their underwear. Or less, perhaps?
-1-female_removing_major,target:sola,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=thinking,(She had other options. Wonder why she didn't take them?)
-1-female_removing_major,target:sayori,targetStage:3=calm,As I said, both ways.
-1-female_removed_major=calm,Cute bod, ~name~. On that note, more poker!
-1-female_removed_major=teasing,That's one way to light up the room.
-1-female_removed_major,target:rosalina=horny,Guess the galaxies were contained under that dress after all...
-1-female_removed_major,filter:athletic=calm,I must say, ~name~, you keep in pretty good shape. Do you use Wii Fit?
-1-female_removed_major,target:daisy=surprised,I never took you for the "thong" type, Daisy. I imagine the sand must be irritating.
-1-female_removed_major,target:aimee=surprised,Oh...good shot.
-1-female_removed_major,target:samus=teasing,I kid, I kid.
-1-female_removed_major,target:d.va=horny,How many of your viewers would kill for this view, I wonder?
-1-female_removed_major,target:sonya=teasing,I see you looking at Sonya, ~player~. Fan of a woman in uniform?
-1-female_removed_major,target:zone-tan=glad,For someone so calm, you really have no shame, do you?
-1-female_removed_major,target:spooky=glad,Yeaaahh... maybe this isn't such a good game for ghosts.
-1-female_removed_major,target:weiss=horny,Sorry, Ice Queen. We're just getting started...
-1-female_removed_major,target:lyn=horny,Why don't you invite some of your sword lord friends next time, Lyn? With a body like that, imagine what Ike's packing...
-1-female_removed_major,target:jasmine=glad,Oh yes. You had us all fooled. (<i>Did anyone really fall for it?</i>)
-1-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:overcoat=glad,(She really could've just done the overcoat. And this girl's a mage?)
-1-female_removed_major,target:mia=tranquil,Those are some nice words to live by.
-1-female_removed_major,target:jolyne,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:misato=calm,Really, who else would come to a game of strip poker dressed so... bizzarely?
-1-female_removed_major,target:chell,targetStage:4=worried,I was hoping you weren't wearing anything under your jumpsuit. Does that make me a bad person?
-1-female_removed_major,target:juri,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:chun-li=glad,Really, don't do anything. those were just decoy pants anyway.
-1-female_removed_major,target:lilith,targetStage:6=calm,Your tattoo covers a lot more than I thought. It's pretty impressive, Lilith.
-1-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:wiifitfemale=thinking,Been a while since your last game, hasn't it, Trainer?
-1-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:mahiru=tranquil,What a... beautiful friendship you two have. Somehow pure, yet strong.
-1-female_removed_major,target:misty,targetStage:3=calm,That's a nice bikini. Was the cerulean intentional?
-1-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:wiifitfemale=glad,I've burned through a few myself.
-1-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:pit=annoyed,Really, Pit. You need to expand your VG horizons.
-1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2=surprised,...That was certainly different. I mean, I can transform others myself, but it's not often I see humans wielding that level of magic.
-1-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:pit=horny,Of course she didn't, Pit. You think someone who <i>planned</i> this would bring a back-up?
-1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=glad,Smooth.
-1-female_removed_major,target:sheena,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,Hey Pit, I finally found someone who can gush about hot springs with you!
-1-female_removed_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:5=tranquil,Is it already Nohrian Summer again?
-1-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:marinette=tranquil,You know it, Marinette. You're more fashionable than you might think, Nagisa.
-1-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:yang,count-ruby:0=thinking,Who is this Qrow? Friend of yours? Lover, maybe?
-1-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:ruby,count-yang:0=teasing,Are you really threatening a girl barely out of high school? That's just petty.
-1-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:yang,count-ruby:1=calm,Qrow, huh? Didn't know these girls had a bird for an uncle.
-1-female_removed_major,target:amalia,targetStage:2=teasing,Although those panties are hardly natural...
-1-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:shantae,alsoPlayingStage:8=glad,You've already given us a performance worthy of Azura. There's no need.
-1-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:3=tranquil,It worked even better than I hoped!
-1-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:shantae,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=thinking,Pretty sure the game's over if something happens to Azura anyway, but it's a good offer.
-1-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5-7=calm,I prefer an "in-between" look myself.
-1-female_removed_major,target:jolyne,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:tina=worried,Thinking about your father <i>now</i>? I thought humans grew past that centuries ago.
-1-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:4=calm,Did you guess that it really was a banana? You'd be right.
-1-female_removed_major,target:peach,targetStage:5=surprised,I remember your shorts being a lot... frillier.
-1-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:jura=angry,Frankly, you're starting to get on <i>my</i> nerves a little, too.
-1-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:dress_off_now=thinking,But didn't you rush into stripping it without a second thought?
-1-female_removed_major,target:alice=horny,Check out Little Miss Zebra over here! Clearly you were prepared to lose clothes tonight.
-1-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:dress_is_next=calm,Taking it well, I see. Let's move on, then.
-1-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:pay_you_to_keep_dress=tranquil,What's human money to a goddess?
-1-female_removed_major,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:aimee=teasing,Well, didn't you two get chummy quick.
-1-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:zoey=teasing,I don't think she'd be able to keep up with you, Rinkah.
-1-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:paying_you_some_tres=calm,I'm very particular about how I take my bribes. Sorry.
-1-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:pit=horny,What does Palutena think? I'll tell you what she thinks: she's just glad Pit's finally learning to appreciate the female body.
-1-female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:dizzylose=angry,Rise and shine, we got a game to play.
-1-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:mahiru=worried,Is that photoworthy, Mahiru? Anyone could scrunch up their panties.
-1-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:jura=teasing,Careful, Jura. You might get burned.
-1-female_removed_major,target:nayru,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=calm,Just shows off your natural beauty that much more...
-1-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=teasing,That's something a <i>cute</i> person would say.
-1-female_removed_major,target:elaine,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:jin=teasing,With a married woman? They were basically zero.
-1-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:Undies02=calm,I get it. I'm rather old-fashioned in that regard, as well.
-1-female_removed_major,target:spooky,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:chica=calm,Apparate schmapparate. You've got underwear, that's all that matters.
-1-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:zoey=thinking,I don't see it. How so, Winter?
-1-female_removed_major,target:penny,targetStage:4=tranquil,It's cute, Penny! And it's comfortable? I should get a set for myself!
-1-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:weiss=worried,You have some weird priorities, Winter.
-1-female_removed_major,target:chara,targetStage:5=tranquil,Well, nothing can stop <i>us</i> from getting it off of you.
-1-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:jura=glad,I see space pirates have a rather... lax standard compared to humans.
-1-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:weiss=calm,I think I'm in the mood for some chilled strawberries now. What about you two?
-1-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:4=thinking,Now I'm curious. Does dango taste good?
-1-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:zizou=teasing,Pride isn't a good look for you, Zizou.
-1-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=glad,It's not like Meia was trying to keep that hidden from us.
-1-female_removed_major,target:amalia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:mahiru=thinking,Your eye twitches when you look at Mahiru. Something the matter?
-1-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5=teasing,So you mean you <i>don't</i> strip in front of your peers at class trials? Maybe you should try it. It'd certainly get you some more... influence.
-1-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3=teasing,Look at that! You're <i>not</i> just a pair of eyes and mouth in a void.
-1-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:buffy,alsoPlayingStage:2=calm,You two keep on working out. The rest of us have a game to play.
-1-female_removed_major,target:jolyne,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=calm,Ah, I know of Nirvana. One of those old stories the humans tried to use to explain the gods.
-1-female_removed_major,target:revy,targetStage:5=glad,That aside, let's finish this up.
-1-female_removed_major,target:jolyne,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:4-7=glad,I know you kind of lost your costume and everything, but try and calm down a little.
-1-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:2-3,totalMales:1-2=glad,Really? Maybe someone else will get lucky tonight, then.
-1-female_removed_major,target:jenetta,targetStage:5=thinking,Are beaches a natural environment for rabbits? Hmm. Viridi would probably know.
-1-female_removed_major,target:sayori,targetStage:4=glad,Just think of all the things you'll see when the rest of us lose!
-1-female_removed_major,target:sayori,targetStage:5=calm,You're looking a bit tense. Try not to overthink it. Just... go with the flow.
-1-female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5=horny,Whoever built you must be really cheap to give you a bra like that, Shimakaze.
-1-female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:6=calm,But seriously, talk to whoever's in charge. That's probably the <i>last</i> set of underwear a battleship would wear... and that's a sentence that will probably never be muttered again.
-1-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:4=tranquil,Strawberries, huh? Even the serious ones have a cute side!
-1-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meg,alsoPlayingStage:0=tranquil,You two would make a <i>very</i> interesting team! The slow, heavy hitter and the quick guerilla fighter. Sounds a little familiar, though.
-1-female_removed_major,target:moon,targetStage:1=worried,Why are those nipple outlines so... crusty? It doesn't look even remotely healthy.
-1-female_removed_major,target:spooky,targetStage:2=thinking,Hmm... I hear chess is getting popular again.
-1-female_removed_major,target:elaine,targetStage:4=surprised,Garters <i>and</i> see-through? I suppose it makes sense for a formerly high class women.
-1-female_removed_major,target:elaine,targetStage:5=teasing,I won't judge. But it <i>really</i> looks like you dressed up to take someone home...
-1-female_removed_major,target:elaine,targetStage:6=calm,Not at this stage, Elaine.
-1-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=horny,Even smaller than I thought! Plus, since it's obvious what color your pubes are, it's almost like you're already bottomless!
-1-female_removed_major,target:nayru,targetStage:5=worried,Still, this <i>may</i> be a problem. Should I intervene?
-1-female_removed_major,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:4=glad,Not much of a surprise, but that's how it goes, Alice.
-1-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:5=calm,Yes, yes. I've gone through this song and dance more times than I care to remember. Just play the game.
-1-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:6=tranquil,I appreciate your steward undressing with us as well.
-1-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=angry,No wonder you're so... tightly wound. Remind me to take you to one once this is all over.
-1-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3=awkward,You really could've gone with anything else.
-1-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5=horny,A matching set? No wonder you were so adamant about hiding it.
-1-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meg,alsoPlayingStage:0-2=glad,Plus, you're almost the exact opposite of her, Meg.
-1-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:2-3=teasing,You say that, but I see you bending with each passing round.
-1-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:6=teasing,"Jugs" is putting it lightly.
-1-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:4-5=thinking,I don't get it either. Anyway, let's move on, shall we Rinkah?
-1-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:5-6=glad,All of you Fire Emblem characters stick together, I see.
-1-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:elena,alsoPlayingStage:6-7=calm,It says something that a goddess is more at ease than you, huh?
-1-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:buffy,alsoPlayingStage:2=glad,I guess you'd have to, seeing as it's your major strength.
-1-female_removed_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:6=teasing,Just keep digging that hole you're in.
-1-female_removed_major,target:spooky,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:elaine,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=glad,Real beer's probably not much of an option for you, though. Maybe lite beer would work?
-1-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:elena,alsoPlayingStage:8=tranquil,Even <i>I'm</i> not exempt! What are you complaining about, Elena?
-1-female_removed_major,target:clover,targetStage:3=teasing,Seems like our little plant here realized how to play the game.
-1-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=glad,No need to kick her while she's down, Winter. She's already lost hard.
-1-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:7=tranquil,But not all, of course.
-1-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=calm,Does this workout include gratuitous use of a razor, too?
-1-female_removed_major,target:jolyne,targetStage:3=teasing,Conditioned to this, I take it? No wonder you dress so provocatively.
-1-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=teasing,On the other hand, you're perfectly content to stand here in your strawberry underwear? I see.
-1-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1=teasing,You're really going to say this right now, Ms. Strawberry?
-1-female_removed_major,target:juri,targetStage:1=calm,A strong start, sure, but can you keep it up?
-1-female_removed_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:5=tranquil,I think you've overestimated the use of that shirt a little.
-1-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:3=calm,Have you seen some of the things in the Galactic Sea? Don't take her lightly.
-1-female_removed_major,target:clover,targetStage:5=calm,You don't have to worry about that. I'm bored already.
-1-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:4=thinking,I admit, it's interesting to think about how her life would be different if she was born human.
-1-female_removed_major,target:clover,targetStage:4=glad,And yet here you are playing it. Ironic, isn't it?
-1-female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:2=glad,Pirate ships aren't <i>that</i> bad.




#OPPONENT REVEALING CHEST OR CROTCH
#Characters have different sizes, allowing your character to have different responses for each. Males have a small, medium, or large crotch. Females have small, medium, or large breasts.

#fully clothed
0-male_chest_will_be_visible=teasing,The ~clothing~ already? You aren't just trying to show off, right?
0-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=calm,That coat's pretty impressive. I wouldn't mind having one made for me. Know a good tailor?
0-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:ryuji=teasing,Let's see what's behind the "zomg".
0-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=surprised,Are you talking about at the Rewind Spring? I was more focused on keeping you alive at the time, you know.
0-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,Oh, no need. Pit already has a black tunic from his time at the Smash tourney.
0-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:futaba=tranquil,I wouldn't get your hopes up if I were you, Futaba.
0-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:link,targetStage:4=teasing,I always knew it was just an act.
0-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit,alsoPlaying:kyu=teasing,Absolutely. You should have seen his face after the Rewind Spring incident. He was red for days!
0-male_chest_is_visible=tranquil,The best things in life are those that come free.
0-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=thinking,So is that chest of yours a cold metal case or warm like a human's?
0-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=horny,Not bad, Pit. As expected of my finest warrior.
0-male_chest_is_visible,target:human=teasing,They say humans are the closest to the gods. Even you're good evidence for that claim, ~name~.
0-male_chest_is_visible,target:link=teasing,Hylia chooses her champions well, I see.
0-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=glad,He gets way too worked up when it comes to anything robotic in nature. Ignore him.
0-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=thinking,Is there any real purpose for robot nipples? I'm impressed your maker got the details as accurate as they did, though.
0-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:4-7=horny,What's the matter, Pit? Don't you finally want to touch an android?
0-male_chest_is_visible,target:ryuji,totalFemales:2-4=awkward,You're selling yourself short. How sad...
0-male_chest_is_visible,target:link,targetStage:5=calm,Good. Those "hyups" were starting to get on my nerve.
0-male_chest_is_visible,target:ryuji=horny,Putting the "muscle" in "musclehead", I see.
0-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit,alsoPlaying:kyu=awkward,You <i>have</i> been really interested in him. Hmm, maybe...
0-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=annoyed,Really, you might as well have gone all the way if you had a penis installed.
0-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:futaba=teasing,What robots do you know that have nipples?
0-male_crotch_will_be_visible=worried,I kind of feel bad. You're already showing your little soldier and I haven't even lost...
0-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=horny,Guess we get to check and see if your mechanic knew what they were doing...
0-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pit=glad,What can I say? A goddess has to have her fun.
0-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:futaba=glad,If you could even call it a trick.
0-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ryuji=horny,C'mon, Ryuji. Let's see your "dragon". That's what your name means, right?
0-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:human=horny,I'm actually really excited to see what the average human's thing looks like...
0-male_small_crotch_is_visible=teasing,Okay, now I <i>actually</i> feel bad.
0-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:human=awkward,I'm sorry for your loss.
0-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:fred=teasing,I figured you were compensating for something, but this is worse than I thought.
0-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_m=tranquil,Hahaha! Sorry Corrin, but I'm <i>loving</i> this.
0-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=glad,Well, if it makes you feel better, I think that's a respectable size.
0-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:futaba=teasing,You're <i>both</i> strange. That's not really a bad thing, though. It's charming.
0-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=tranquil,It's natural. As natural as androids get, anyway.
0-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:pit=horny,So it seems. Apologize, Pit.
0-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=tranquil,Don't worry, Pit. You may not like it now, but I'm sure you'll look back on this day fondly.
0-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:human=calm,Yep, that's a nice looking member right there.
0-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9,count-halloween_pit:0=surprised,Oh my! Pit, are you alright? She's not hurting you, is she?
0-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit,alsoPlaying:kyu=horny,Perhaps. As long as I can have him back within twenty-four hours.
0-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:pit,count-futaba:1=teasing,Sure, why not? You have my permission to... "get to know them."
0-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s=surprised,Oh! Seems pretty accurate, as far as I know. Kudos.
0-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7,count-halloween_pit:0=surprised,Oh my! Pit, are you alright? She's not hurting you, is she?
0-male_large_crotch_is_visible=calm,Bigger than I thought. And I'm not the cause, I'm sure..
0-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=worried,Whoa, whoa! I'm pretty sure <i>most</i> penises shouldn't be the length of a blade, Mettaton.
0-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryuji=surprised,Oh! That's much bigger than my average soldier. Might even outperform a few gods...
0-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:human=surprised,Wow, you're not average at all, are you?
0-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=awkward,Wow... I bet it shoots farther than the arm of Dhalsim...
0-female_chest_will_be_visible=surprised,Wow, ~name~ <i>again</i>! If I were you, I would be really upset right now!
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:natsuki=awkward,I think you forgot a period in there... or five.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:chiaki=thinking,What type of games, exactly?
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:felicia=surprised,Oh... you were serious?
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jolyne=calm,On the other hand, there's no better time to get back on your feet!
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aella=teasing,Not according to plan, Ms. Tactician?
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=surprised,Oh! You're really using magic... for that. Well.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola=glad,I'm not expecting much. So you really can't let me down!
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=surprised,Oh...That's good to hear.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan=tranquil,I'm not particularly interested, but go ahead.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:gogo=horny,Are you finally putting your money where your mouth is? Now I'm a little excited.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=horny,The whole leotard? You really aren't holding anything back, are you Mika?
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=awkward,Why? What made you into such a perverted woman?
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:shimakaze=teasing,I'm curious; how sensitive are they?
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:revy=teasing,What's the matter? Only able to afford half a set?
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jenetta=tranquil,I bet a few people here have... although they were probably obscured by fur.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sayori=glad,Can't be helped. The rules are absolute, even to me.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:winter=calm,Hey, anything's better than such childish underwear to me.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:spooky=teasing,<i>Come on</i>. Would I laugh?
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:elaine=glad,...For that exact reason.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah=horny,Do it! Release them from their binds!
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:nayru=worried,You have hands, you know...
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:alice_mgq=annoyed,...Well. Go on, then.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:miko=teasing,Sounds like a bunch of excuses to me, Ms. Hermit.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,filter:shy=calm,I believe in you, ~name~. I shall grant you the power to get through this.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,filter:exhibitionist=surprised,Wow. You... really have no shame, do you?
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:raven=tranquil,We've already had the big reveal. What's one more pair of breasts to the lot?
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mileena=teasing,Does that even qualify as clothing In the first place?
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:juri=teasing,Let's see if you can match my expectations.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aella,targetNotSaidMarker:AellaStalling=annoyed,Okay, enough stalling. Onto the real thing.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:9,count-zizou:1=horny,You'll have to be more specific, because I see two girls at work here. Which part?
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:10,count-zizou:1=thinking,It's not like they're watching this live, though...
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=worried,If you're going to fight, you should leave those bound, right?
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:aimee,alsoPlayingStage:1-5=angry,While you're at it, don't go shooting my clothes either!
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=glad,Don't knock it 'til you try it. She might even make some more fitting underwear for you!
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=calm,You knew all the right plays, didn't you Weiss? Apparently you're much better than you let on...
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:5-8=tranquil,Now <i>this</i> is interesting! How similar will they be to Weiss's, I wonder...
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=tranquil,Don't worry, Rinkah. I already have been!
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:6=calm,Not everyone can be a Princess Peach. Rinkah's much more of a Magnus, but that's beside the point.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=glad,There's many reserved princesses out there, but Rinkah's about as far as you can get from them.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:0-6,count-zizou:1=angry,I'm fairly certain at least one person in this room can see the future. How does no one know?
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:6=thinking,I think that's the wrong game, Rinkah...
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=glad,Rinkah's from a tribe, but I'm pretty sure it's not an <i>island</i> tribe.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:zoey,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=glad,Someone like Rinkah doesn't understand the meaning of the word modesty.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:7-8,count-zizou:1=calm,Humans can be so modest. Granted, you two are exceptionally so.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=awkward,Zone-tan here is even blunter than you, Rinkah!
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=tranquil,I sense a leak in the near future.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=annoyed,She does get rather grating after a while.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:zizou=glad,Being scared is natural, I suppose. But your friend will get you through it.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=teasing,Really, you think I'm here to make enemies? That's just not worth my time. So yeah, call me a friend.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jolyne,targetTimeInStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=glad,It's not like she's lying to her self. She's just not in a hurry to admit it.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:raven,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=thinking,You're contradicting yourself. Although I have little doubt they really are monsters.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:marinette=annoyed,You're right, but you didn't have to be so blunt.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:sheva=glad,I don't think Sheva herself is a zombie.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:3=surprised,I thought nudity was taboo for humans?
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=glad,Easy come, easy go.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:joey,targetStage:4=glad,Tata, bra! Let's see some tatas.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=thinking,I'd like to see what trick could possibly save you from this.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:clover,targetStage:5=teasing,Like I said before. Three dots.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:not_1st,totalExposed:0=glad,There you go.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,alsoPlayingStage:5=thinking,Aren't we in one right now? Or am I overthinking it?
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:nayru,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=tranquil,I wonder how the other oracles would react to this. Or even my oracles?
0-female_small_chest_is_visible=thinking,Well, those <i>do</i> qualify as breasts.
0-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:spooky=thinking,Okay, great. Can we go back to the game now?
0-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:shimakaze=calm,You must either really be enjoying this or feel nothing at all to take so many in a row.
0-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:sayori=teasing,Really though, what is there to see?
0-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:natsuki=teasing,I <i>could</i> say a lot... but I won't.
0-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:raven=calm,Not like I care about seeing naked demon girls anyway. I used to be close with Medusa, after all.
0-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:miko=awkward,I thought humans were past showing off their spouses like trophies...
0-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:meg=calm,I don't know what you were so upset about. There's more to life than breast size, you know. For example, maybe ~player~ is a leg person.
0-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:spooky,alsoPlaying:elaine,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=teasing,You can't seem to keep ghosts out your hair, Elaine! You should call an exorcist or something.
0-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:not_1st,totalExposed:1=thinking,Think of it like... you're blazing a trail. Wait, you lost your blazer, didn't you...
0-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:spooky,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,Good luck with that. Pit's been finished more times than I can count, but he always comes back.
0-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:raven,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=tranquil,Ooh, a grizzly revenge story! How <i>edgy.</i>
0-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:zizou,alsoPlaying:pit=thinking,Are there even showers here?
0-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:spooky,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=annoyed,Stop being cliche, Spooky.
0-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:spooky,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=calm,Because humans would fear the name <i>Spooky</i>.
0-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:hairy1,targetNotSaidMarker:shave1=teasing,What, your chest size? We knew it was tiny all along, honey.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible=calm,If it makes you feel any better, I think those look pretty good.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,marker:pit_girlfriend=horny,I've been looking to find Pit a girlfriend... interested, ~name~?
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=thinking,I suppose it doesn't matter for someone raised in a jungle anyway.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=teasing,You know, I didn't do that because you can't bring it back after the game. Hope you don't mind streaking.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=thinking,Quite the underreaction. Or are you just flustered?
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:felicia=calm,She'd <i>have</i> to be good to not even try to hide 'em.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:nayru=surprised,Was this planned? I didn't think you were so conniving!
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rinkah=calm,I can see why you're the princess now.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=teasing,Maybe someone here just has that effect on you, Joetta.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:elaine=annoyed,Maybe don't brandish a knife next time?
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=thinking,You've been hyping them all game, but I don't see the appeal.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:winter=teasing,Topless and... is that a wet spot?
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jenetta=surprised,You could see the whole time? That's awkward...
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola=calm,Sure, I've had my fun. I don't need to stare.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne=thinking,(Yep. No shame anymore now that she's had a chance to get over the shock.)
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:juri=thinking,I might have underestimated you, at this rate.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=glad,I think you have the wrong idea about this game... you want to <i>keep</i> your underwear on...
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aella=horny,Sloppy sloppy. Even Magnus wouldn't have been so careless.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:ruby=surprised,Wait, hold on. Neo's a mimic?
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=worried,You sure it didn't hurt you? That one looked awful close.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=glad,I'm pretty sure this Corrin's a married man, but I know what you're getting at.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:about_to_see_my_breasts=horny,They're probably just your type, ~player~.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:alright_here_i_go=thinking,Good enough. We still have a hat and some panties to go, though!
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:isnt_too_bad=teasing,You're lucky I don't care enough to tell them.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:not_the_best_but=calm,Obviously. But humans probably go wild for them, right?
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:nayru,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=thinking,Perhaps. I hope my presence doesn't make you... uncomfortable.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:mercy=calm,Those are easily an eight. Maybe even better.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:pauling=horny,(<i>Considering how much she puts out, I'm surprised she never got with the Scout.</i>)
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:clover,targetStage:6=annoyed,And just when things were getting interesting with you.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:piper=worried,What a harsh environment to not even be able to get the clothes you need... you have my condolences.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:revy=teasing,I'm going to enjoy putting you in your place, you crude girl.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:zelda=surprised,So unashamed... guess you've got Farore's courage in you.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:zone-tan=teasing,Zone-tan's a real party girl, huh?...Close your mouth, ~player~.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sayla=annoyed,In my opinion, this shouldn't be allowed... but I'll let it slide, just so I can rub it in when I win later.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_f=teasing,Maybe someday you'll reach Robin's level of tactical prowess. But today is not that day.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:6=glad,I think your act could use some work.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=glad,It's very reminiscint of a hot spring, right?
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:sf=glad,Compared to what I've seen? Not really.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:zizou=horny,Funny how one word from the goddess turns you into an exhibitionist.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss=teasing,Did you wet yourself out of embarrassment? Amazing. I've never seen a sorrier soldier. Weiss would probably be a better one, at this rate.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=tranquil,I can neither confirm nor deny this.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:zoey=glad,Maybe pay attention to things right in front of your face next time. Or below.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=glad,Never that simple, is it?
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:321=thinking,Eh. Underwhelming, really. Not worth a countdown.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:shego=teasing,Yes, clearly.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:raven=tranquil,Methinks the Azarathian is conflicted.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:sayla,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=glad,What happened to theocracy? Or is that not in style in your worlds?
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingStage:9=teasing,Then you're just not trying hard enough.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=teasing,Then you're just not trying hard enough.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=thinking,Curious...
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=teasing,Miss Morose has a sexual side after all. Congrats, Jolyne.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:yang=surprised,Wait, hold on. Neo's a mimic?
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:meg,alsoPlayingStage:0=glad,Sounds about as nice as the Lunar Sanctum.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=thinking,Only took you this long, huh? Slow for a space pirate.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:jin,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=tranquil,That's probably the best compliment you'll ever get, Jin.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:mahiru=horny,Don't listen to her, Mahiru. A photographer should be able to take as many pictures as she wants.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:aella=teasing,Of course it was an accident. Do you think she'd blow a chance to stay in the game longer?
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:aella,alsoPlayingStage:5-6=awkward,The humiliation of defeat stings far worse than losing these clothes, I agree.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:aimee=annoyed,Both this "darlin'" and this Laslow just sound like perverts.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=teasing,What? The toned abs? She hardly seems like the type.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=tranquil,She's just being honest to a fault. I'm sure it's not personal.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:2-3=glad,Most woman who come here are... transparent with their motives.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:5-6=awkward,Must not get compliments very often. Poor thing...
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:4-7=thinking,Little confused by what you mean, Marinette. Jolyne is too, by the looks of it.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:buffy,alsoPlayingStage:2=glad,Take solace in the fact you have each other.
0-female_large_chest_is_visible=tranquil,Impressive...although I forsee back problems in your future.
0-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:april=thinking,(<i>Why do I suddenly have a craving for pizza?</i>)
0-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:alice_mgq=glad,It's fine. We all know they're fake, anyway.
0-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika,alsoPlaying:chun-li=annoyed,(What is it with Street Fighters wanting a big butt? Small or normal ones are fine!)
0-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:seven=surprised,You're certainly attractive for a space-goer, Seven. Certainly moreso than a space pirate.
0-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:chara=tranquil,Guess what they say about drinking milk is true after all!
0-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:korra=horny,Sorry to stare, but that's the way this game goes...
0-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:chiaki=glad,Sorry, but that's below me. Ask Pit if you want a rubdown. Nice mole, by the way.
0-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=glad,What a showwoman! I can respect that.
0-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia=thinking,(Surprisingly human-like anatomy...)
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible=glad,Do you, uh, need help or something? I'm new, but even I seem to have a better grasp of this.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:miko=calm,Danger! Danger! Not good!
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=thinking,You really love tossing that camera of yours around, don't you?
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki,targetSaidMarker:mahirucheck3,alsoPlaying:saki,alsoPlayingStage:9=surprised,The three of you certainly became fast friends.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki,targetSaidMarker:mahirucheck3,alsoPlaying:saki,alsoPlayingStage:7=surprised,The three of you certainly became fast friends.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:spooky=glad,I'm almost surprised you're following them, to be honest.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki,targetSaidMarker:mahirucheck,targetNotSaidMarker:mahirucheck2,alsoPlaying:saki,alsoPlayingStage:7=surprised,The three of you certainly became fast friends.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:creepy=horny,Not so tough now that you're about to lose, huh?
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,totalRounds:1-10=surprised,Didn't we just begin?!
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:elaine=surprised,Elaine, is that a...?
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki,targetSaidMarker:mahirucheck,targetNotSaidMarker:mahirucheck2,alsoPlaying:saki,alsoPlayingStage:9=surprised,The three of you certainly became fast friends.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:natsuki,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=awkward,...It's a bit late for that. For both of you.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=thinking,You really love tossing that camera of yours around, don't you?
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=glad,Poor Weiss here's about to be scarred for life.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette=calm,Come now, have a little more faith in us... no pun intended.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aella=glad,I bet you wish you weren't so tall now, huh?
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mahiru,marker:mahirucheck=surprised,Oh! I expected you to be hairier. Or be completely shaved. Just not in between.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kyu=glad,The old fashioned-way, huh? At least you'll go home <i>somewhat</i> clothed.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=teasing,Her too? <i>That's</i> dedication.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=thinking,Is the curtain necessary? I'm sure at least <i>someone</i> would be into this.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki=teasing,Out of "armor" already, Chiaki? I really expected you to clean house.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:natsuki=annoyed,Any time now.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:clover=teasing,Better start believing.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=thinking,And now's not the time to fling hexes...
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rinkah=tranquil,Time to see you in your full, mangy glory!
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jolyne=surprised,Not a very elegant location to write that...
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sola=surprised,Getting it over with? Fair enough.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=calm,Such a skimpy little costume! I have no idea why you heroes think walking around in leotards is a good idea.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:revy=tranquil,Finally! I was getting sick of  your bellyaching, to be honest.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jenetta=glad,Speedrun time!
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sayori=calm,Going, going...
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:shimakaze=awkward,How... gruesome.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:winter=glad,You'll catch a cold if you stay in soaked panties too long. You probably should have removed them sooner.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=worried,...I have no words for what I'm seeing. And smelling.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:juri=worried,(She's treating this less like a competition and more like a modeling gig.)
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan=glad,I don't care either way, but I think ~player~ might wet themselves.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nayru=annoyed,I almost just wasted a magic spell on you. You could have let us know from the start, at least.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:miko,targetSaidMarker:LastWordW=horny,Cheating isn't very becoming of a saint, you know.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=glad,Now we'll see for sure how close you two are in body type.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:raven=glad,I don't care either way, but I think Raven might wet herself.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki,alsoPlaying:pit=angry,She can fight her own fights, Pit. Let her be.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki,alsoPlaying:wiifitfemale=glad,I thought that was obvious from the start.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=glad,Consider it a small victory. For you and you alone.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:zizou=teasing,Every part of that sentence was wrong, Sola.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=horny,I think I can take a good guess as to what it is...
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:futaba=glad,It's about as effective as censor bars in the East.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:daphne=teasing,Gather round, gang. Let's see- I mean get to, the bottom of this mystery.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=glad,Just couldn't wait to drop your panties for us, huh?
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,Maybe I ought to have <i>you</i> wear that, just so you can learn to appreciate it! How about that, Pit?
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,targetSaidMarker:bodysuit,targetNotSaidMarker:bodysuitsolomarinette=teasing,Oh, I see. I don't mind teaching you, but I'd have to teach all of you for the sake of fairness.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:shave1,targetNotSaidMarker:hairy1=glad,Why yes, Natsuki, we <i>do</i> have the same equipment down there. Even you and I.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:sarcasm=teasing,Yes, Kyu. We're all so sorry to put you through this.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:alice_mgq=glad,Not really much to gain from this. We can see the pubic hair situation and more already.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon,targetSaidMarker:moon_doesnt_wear_panties=awkward,Well, seeing how you said earlier that you don't wear panties, this can only end one way.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nayru,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=calm,As did everyone else.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:miko,targetSaidMarker:LastWordL=tranquil,The best leaders know no fear, it's true.

0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=worried,Is it really in your best interests to fight naked?
0-female_crotch_is_visible=teasing,Don't feel too bad. <i>Everyone</i> is as good as naked to a goddess.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:shimakaze=worried,Maybe I should contact Poseidon to make sure no one's <i>actually</i> dying from this.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sayori=tranquil,Gone.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jenetta=horny,Fastest crotch reveal yet! Impressive, Jenetta. But also a little sad.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:pauling=teasing,That body just screams 'Seduce me!', very nice.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola=awkward,In other words, cheating.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:nagisa=worried,Nagisa, you do what you want. Don't let Winter here try and shave you.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:mahiru=tranquil,And there's the icing on the proverbial cake. You should spread that around, Mahiru.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:faye=thinking,I had no idea shaving was so common with both the lawful <i>and</i> lawless...
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=worried,How? Through deception or brute force? It seems like a bad time either way...
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven,alsoPlaying:felicia=glad,Let's just say your both bad at thinking things through.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:miko=calm,I thought you already were, but sure, I'll try my best to defeat you.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:zizou=calm,From what I've seen from Zizou so far, that was a more tame response than I expected.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:april=horny,Not very private when you're showing it off publicly.

0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:revy=annoyed,Makes sense. You two are like peas in a pod.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:blake,alsoPlaying:caleb=thinking,So Caleb, how much does a catgirl excite you compared to a human?
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,targetSaidMarker:spacebush,alsoPlaying:meia=calm,I mean, everyone grows 'em. It's just a matter of keeping them.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki,alsoPlaying:florina,count-lyn:1=teasing,Then tell us: who's the lucky recipient?

0-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:shaved=surprised,It actually looks pretty nice with no hair like that...
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:shego,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=glad,No offense, Shego, but you probably can't take Rinkah in a fair fight.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:revy,alsoPlayingStage:3=annoyed,That's pretty much my thoughts exactly. <i>Don't</i>.

0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:morrigan,alsoPlayingStage:5=glad,To be honest, I prefer it like this. Better than going on a murderous rampage.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=calm,Enough of that, Misato. You <i>and</i> Rinkah are doing just fine.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:9-10=thinking,Mar? ...Oh! You mean Marinette.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:may=teasing,Yes, we can definitely tell.

0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:9s=glad,Maybe he meant the insides?
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dawn=surprised,I was unaware humans could get natural hair that colorful! Thought it was a god-only thing...
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dawn=horny,Now I'm no expert in house design, but know that yours is very pleasing to the eyes, Dawn.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:elaine=tranquil,They should call you Elaine Marley, Mighty Fine Lady (tm)!

0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:nayru,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=surprised,...Aren't you going to finish that?
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven,targetNotSaidMarker:strategic_decision=teasing,With what your wearing? Please. I have my suspicions this was all-too intentional.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:step_it_up=thinking,(Sounds like a step back to me.)
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:get_serious_now=thinking,That just sounds silly.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:down_they_go=horny,You mean you still had it? You were standing here with nothing but that goofy-print underwear.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:do_or_die=awkward,I see.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:do_better=surprised,Maybe focus on the game and not some silly spell and you'll do better.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=calm,Every style has its merits. I encourage you to try them all!
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:nayru=calm,Does demonic possession turn you on? Not kink-shaming, just curious.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:shave1,targetNotSaidMarker:hairy1=calm,No, it's not. It's probably just a little less common than going natural.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:hairy1,targetNotSaidMarker:shave1=thinking,I really don't think that matters, Natsuki.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=horny,I think we've earned our prize, wouldn't you agree?
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=horny,Ooh! You got something up your non-existant sleeve there, wood girl?
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=surprised,I'm shocked you actually went for it... and then flashed us to boot...
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:zoey=horny,Obviously. Who else would fight a war and then play strip poker?
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:wiifitfemale=glad,There's such a thing as too much pride, you know.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:shantae=glad,She's right, though. Dancing requires a very disciplined physique. One you have already!

0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lara=horny,Guess the "nude code" exists after all!

0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=teasing,What happened to not making things awkward, hmm?
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:arwen=horny,Now I know why they call elves "the fairer folk".

0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=glad,You show that to any mortal man, and I'm sure you'd have him eating out of the palm of your hand.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:april,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=surprised,I'm pretty sure news teams don't get that close, April!
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:april,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=teasing,Now here's a newscast I'd want to watch.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=annoyed,Ah, paparazzi. I imagine this must be hard for someone so young like you.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=teasing,I dunno, Ochako. This might give you a popularity boost.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aella=teasing,With how much you're complaining, you'd think you'd never been naked before.

0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zizou,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:7=surprised,Don't do it, Pit. She means that <i>very</i> literally.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:8=surprised,I think she said something about mugging you?

1-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=thinking,Is there any real purpose for robot nipples? I'm impressed your maker got the details as accurate as they did, though.
1-male_chest_is_visible,target:link=teasing,Hylia chooses her champions well, I see.

1-male_large_crotch_is_visible=glad,<i>Someone's</i> packing a solid club there.
1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=worried,Whoa, whoa! I'm pretty sure <i>most</i> penises shouldn't be the length of a blade, Mettaton.
1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:human=surprised,Wow, you're not average at all, are you?
1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryuji=surprised,Oh! That's much bigger than my average soldier. Might even outperform a few gods...
1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=awkward,Wow... I bet it shoots farther than the arm of Dhalsim...
1-female_chest_will_be_visible=tranquil,Is it that time? I didn't notice on account of how little I've lost.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jolyne=calm,On the other hand, there's no better time to get back on your feet!
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:shimakaze=teasing,I'm curious; how sensitive are they?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=surprised,Oh! You're really using magic... for that. Well.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aella=teasing,Not according to plan, Ms. Tactician?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:winter=calm,Hey, anything's better than such childish underwear to me.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:10,count-zizou:1=thinking,It's not like they're watching this live, though...
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=surprised,Oh...That's good to hear.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:6=thinking,I think that's the wrong game, Rinkah...
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:juri=teasing,Let's see if you can match my expectations.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=glad,Rinkah's from a tribe, but I'm pretty sure it's not an <i>island</i> tribe.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=awkward,Why? What made you into such a perverted woman?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:gogo=horny,Are you finally putting your money where your mouth is? Now I'm a little excited.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:sheva=glad,I don't think Sheva herself is a zombie.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mileena=teasing,Does that even qualify as clothing In the first place?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:zizou=glad,Being scared is natural, I suppose. But your friend will get you through it.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:9,count-zizou:1=horny,You'll have to be more specific, because I see two girls at work here. Which part?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=glad,There's many reserved princesses out there, but Rinkah's about as far as you can get from them.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=worried,If you're going to fight, you should leave those bound, right?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sayori=glad,Can't be helped. The rules are absolute, even to me.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=horny,The whole leotard? You really aren't holding anything back, are you Mika?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:5-8=tranquil,Now <i>this</i> is interesting! How similar will they be to Weiss's, I wonder...
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:joey,targetStage:4=glad,Tata, bra! Let's see some tatas.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:natsuki=awkward,I think you forgot a period in there... or five.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=tranquil,Don't worry, Rinkah. I already have been!
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola=glad,I'm not expecting much. So you really can't let me down!
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=calm,You knew all the right plays, didn't you Weiss? Apparently you're much better than you let on...
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:chiaki=thinking,What type of games, exactly?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:zoey,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=glad,Someone like Rinkah doesn't understand the meaning of the word modesty.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:raven=tranquil,We've already had the big reveal. What's one more pair of breasts to the lot?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:felicia=surprised,Oh... you were serious?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=glad,Don't knock it 'til you try it. She might even make some more fitting underwear for you!
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:6=calm,Not everyone can be a Princess Peach. Rinkah's much more of a Magnus, but that's beside the point.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:aimee,alsoPlayingStage:1-5=angry,While you're at it, don't go shooting my clothes either!
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:raven,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=thinking,You're contradicting yourself. Although I have little doubt they really are monsters.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jenetta=tranquil,I bet a few people here have... although they were probably obscured by fur.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=teasing,Really, you think I'm here to make enemies? That's just not worth my time. So yeah, call me a friend.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:revy=teasing,What's the matter? Only able to afford half a set?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:spooky=teasing,<i>Come on</i>. Would I laugh?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan=tranquil,I'm not particularly interested, but go ahead.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aella,targetNotSaidMarker:AellaStalling=annoyed,Okay, enough stalling. Onto the real thing.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,filter:exhibitionist=surprised,Wow. You... really have no shame, do you?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,filter:shy=calm,I believe in you, ~name~. I shall grant you the power to get through this.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=thinking,I'd like to see what trick could possibly save you from this.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jolyne,targetTimeInStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=glad,It's not like she's lying to her self. She's just not in a hurry to admit it.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:miko=teasing,Sounds like a bunch of excuses to me, Ms. Hermit.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:nayru,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=tranquil,I wonder how the other oracles would react to this. Or even my oracles?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:alice_mgq=annoyed,...Well. Go on, then.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:0-6,count-zizou:1=angry,I'm fairly certain at least one person in this room can see the future. How does no one know?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:nayru=worried,You have hands, you know...
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=tranquil,I sense a leak in the near future.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:marinette=annoyed,You're right, but you didn't have to be so blunt.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=awkward,Zone-tan here is even blunter than you, Rinkah!
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=glad,Easy come, easy go.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=annoyed,She does get rather grating after a while.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:elaine=glad,...For that exact reason.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:3=surprised,I thought nudity was taboo for humans?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,alsoPlayingStage:5=thinking,Aren't we in one right now? Or am I overthinking it?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah=horny,Do it! Release them from their binds!
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:not_1st,totalExposed:0=glad,There you go.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:7-8,count-zizou:1=calm,Humans can be so modest. Granted, you two are exceptionally so.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:clover,targetStage:5=teasing,Like I said before. Three dots.
1-female_small_chest_is_visible=thinking,Hmmm. Maybe you'll grow into them?
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:sayori=teasing,Really though, what is there to see?
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:spooky,alsoPlaying:elaine,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=teasing,You can't seem to keep ghosts out your hair, Elaine! You should call an exorcist or something.
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:spooky,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=calm,Because humans would fear the name <i>Spooky</i>.
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:spooky,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=annoyed,Stop being cliche, Spooky.
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:zizou,alsoPlaying:pit=thinking,Are there even showers here?
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:miko=awkward,I thought humans were past showing off their spouses like trophies...
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:spooky,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,Good luck with that. Pit's been finished more times than I can count, but he always comes back.
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:spooky=thinking,Okay, great. Can we go back to the game now?
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:not_1st,totalExposed:1=thinking,Think of it like... you're blazing a trail. Wait, you lost your blazer, didn't you...
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:raven,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=tranquil,Ooh, a grizzly revenge story! How <i>edgy.</i>
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:hairy1,targetNotSaidMarker:shave1=teasing,What, your chest size? We knew it was tiny all along, honey.
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:shimakaze=calm,You must either really be enjoying this or feel nothing at all to take so many in a row.
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:raven=calm,Not like I care about seeing naked demon girls anyway. I used to be close with Medusa, after all.
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:natsuki=teasing,I <i>could</i> say a lot... but I won't.
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:meg=calm,I don't know what you were so upset about. There's more to life than breast size, you know. For example, maybe ~player~ is a leg person.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible=calm,Hey, you look pretty good, ~name~.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible=horny,I must admit, ~name~, your chest blew my expectations away.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=teasing,You know, I didn't do that because you can't bring it back after the game. Hope you don't mind streaking.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:pauling=horny,(<i>Considering how much she puts out, I'm surprised she never got with the Scout.</i>)
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:piper=worried,What a harsh environment to not even be able to get the clothes you need... you have my condolences.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:revy=teasing,I'm going to enjoy putting you in your place, you crude girl.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:zelda=surprised,So unashamed... guess you've got Farore's courage in you.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:winter=teasing,Topless and... is that a wet spot?
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola=calm,Sure, I've had my fun. I don't need to stare.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jenetta=surprised,You could see the whole time? That's awkward...
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:zone-tan=teasing,Zone-tan's a real party girl, huh?...Close your mouth, ~player~.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rinkah=calm,I can see why you're the princess now.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:nayru=surprised,Was this planned? I didn't think you were so conniving!
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_f=teasing,Maybe someday you'll reach Robin's level of tactical prowess. But today is not that day.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:elaine=annoyed,Maybe don't brandish a knife next time?
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=worried,You sure it didn't hurt you? That one looked awful close.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=thinking,You've been hyping them all game, but I don't see the appeal.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aella=horny,Sloppy sloppy. Even Magnus wouldn't have been so careless.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:juri=thinking,I might have underestimated you, at this rate.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sayla=annoyed,In my opinion, this shouldn't be allowed... but I'll let it slide, just so I can rub it in when I win later.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne=thinking,(Yep. No shame anymore now that she's had a chance to get over the shock.)
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:nayru,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=thinking,Perhaps. I hope my presence doesn't make you... uncomfortable.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=glad,Never that simple, is it?
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:yang=surprised,Wait, hold on. Neo's a mimic?
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:ruby=surprised,Wait, hold on. Neo's a mimic?
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:aella,alsoPlayingStage:5-6=awkward,The humiliation of defeat stings far worse than losing these clothes, I agree.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:shego=teasing,Yes, clearly.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:buffy,alsoPlayingStage:2=glad,Take solace in the fact you have each other.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=teasing,What? The toned abs? She hardly seems like the type.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:raven=tranquil,Methinks the Azarathian is conflicted.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:zoey=glad,Maybe pay attention to things right in front of your face next time. Or below.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=tranquil,She's just being honest to a fault. I'm sure it's not personal.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:sayla,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=glad,What happened to theocracy? Or is that not in style in your worlds?
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingStage:9=teasing,Then you're just not trying hard enough.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:5-6=awkward,Must not get compliments very often. Poor thing...
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:4-7=thinking,Little confused by what you mean, Marinette. Jolyne is too, by the looks of it.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:meg,alsoPlayingStage:0=glad,Sounds about as nice as the Lunar Sanctum.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=thinking,Only took you this long, huh? Slow for a space pirate.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=teasing,Then you're just not trying hard enough.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=thinking,Curious...
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=teasing,Miss Morose has a sexual side after all. Congrats, Jolyne.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:2-3=glad,Most woman who come here are... transparent with their motives.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:aella=teasing,Of course it was an accident. Do you think she'd blow a chance to stay in the game longer?
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:zizou=horny,Funny how one word from the goddess turns you into an exhibitionist.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=tranquil,I can neither confirm nor deny this.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:not_the_best_but=calm,Obviously. But humans probably go wild for them, right?
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:isnt_too_bad=teasing,You're lucky I don't care enough to tell them.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:alright_here_i_go=thinking,Good enough. We still have a hat and some panties to go, though!
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:about_to_see_my_breasts=horny,They're probably just your type, ~player~.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:jin,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=tranquil,That's probably the best compliment you'll ever get, Jin.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:321=thinking,Eh. Underwhelming, really. Not worth a countdown.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:sf=glad,Compared to what I've seen? Not really.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:clover,targetStage:6=annoyed,And just when things were getting interesting with you.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:mahiru=horny,Don't listen to her, Mahiru. A photographer should be able to take as many pictures as she wants.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:6=glad,I think your act could use some work.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=teasing,Maybe someone here just has that effect on you, Joetta.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=thinking,Quite the underreaction. Or are you just flustered?
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=thinking,I suppose it doesn't matter for someone raised in a jungle anyway.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=glad,I think you have the wrong idea about this game... you want to <i>keep</i> your underwear on...
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:felicia=calm,She'd <i>have</i> to be good to not even try to hide 'em.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=glad,I'm pretty sure this Corrin's a married man, but I know what you're getting at.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=glad,It's very reminiscint of a hot spring, right?
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:aimee=annoyed,Both this "darlin'" and this Laslow just sound like perverts.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss=teasing,Did you wet yourself out of embarrassment? Amazing. I've never seen a sorrier soldier. Weiss would probably be a better one, at this rate.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:mercy=calm,Those are easily an eight. Maybe even better.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible=surprised,Wow, I didn't think those were real at first...
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:chiaki=glad,Sorry, but that's below me. Ask Pit if you want a rubdown. Nice mole, by the way.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:chara=tranquil,Guess what they say about drinking milk is true after all!
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia=thinking,(Surprisingly human-like anatomy...)
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:alice_mgq=glad,It's fine. We all know they're fake, anyway.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=glad,What a showwoman! I can respect that.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:korra=horny,Sorry to stare, but that's the way this game goes...
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika,alsoPlaying:chun-li=annoyed,(What is it with Street Fighters wanting a big butt? Small or normal ones are fine!)
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:seven=surprised,You're certainly attractive for a space-goer, Seven. Certainly moreso than a space pirate.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:april=thinking,(<i>Why do I suddenly have a craving for pizza?</i>)
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible=worried,As your goddess, I sympathize with how tough this must be on you. But as your opponent, I'm not sorry.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nayru=annoyed,I almost just wasted a magic spell on you. You could have let us know from the start, at least.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jenetta=glad,Speedrun time!
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:miko,targetSaidMarker:LastWordN=glad,It's not so bad, right?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki=teasing,Out of "armor" already, Chiaki? I really expected you to clean house.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=calm,Such a skimpy little costume! I have no idea why you heroes think walking around in leotards is a good idea.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:revy=tranquil,Finally! I was getting sick of  your bellyaching, to be honest.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:miko,targetSaidMarker:LastWordW=horny,Cheating isn't very becoming of a saint, you know.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:miko,targetSaidMarker:LastWordL=tranquil,The best leaders know no fear, it's true.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jolyne=surprised,Not a very elegant location to write that...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:alice_mgq=glad,Not really much to gain from this. We can see the pubic hair situation and more already.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nayru,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=calm,As did everyone else.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon,targetSaidMarker:moon_doesnt_wear_panties=awkward,Well, seeing how you said earlier that you don't wear panties, this can only end one way.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:miko=calm,Danger! Danger! Not good!
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:clover=teasing,Better start believing.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rinkah=tranquil,Time to see you in your full, mangy glory!
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:natsuki=annoyed,Any time now.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=thinking,Is the curtain necessary? I'm sure at least <i>someone</i> would be into this.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:elaine=surprised,Elaine, is that a...?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:spooky=glad,I'm almost surprised you're following them, to be honest.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan=glad,I don't care either way, but I think ~player~ might wet themselves.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=worried,...I have no words for what I'm seeing. And smelling.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette=calm,Come now, have a little more faith in us... no pun intended.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:winter=glad,You'll catch a cold if you stay in soaked panties too long. You probably should have removed them sooner.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sola=surprised,Getting it over with? Fair enough.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aella=glad,I bet you wish you weren't so tall now, huh?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:shimakaze=awkward,How... gruesome.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mahiru,marker:mahirucheck=surprised,Oh! I expected you to be hairier. Or be completely shaved. Just not in between.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=teasing,Her too? <i>That's</i> dedication.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kyu=glad,The old fashioned-way, huh? At least you'll go home <i>somewhat</i> clothed.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sayori=calm,Going, going...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:daphne=teasing,Gather round, gang. Let's see- I mean get to, the bottom of this mystery.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:sarcasm=teasing,Yes, Kyu. We're all so sorry to put you through this.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=glad,Consider it a small victory. For you and you alone.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:shave1,targetNotSaidMarker:hairy1=glad,Why yes, Natsuki, we <i>do</i> have the same equipment down there. Even you and I.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki,targetSaidMarker:mahirucheck,targetNotSaidMarker:mahirucheck2,alsoPlaying:saki,alsoPlayingStage:7=surprised,The three of you certainly became fast friends.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki,targetSaidMarker:mahirucheck,targetNotSaidMarker:mahirucheck2,alsoPlaying:saki,alsoPlayingStage:9=surprised,The three of you certainly became fast friends.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki,targetSaidMarker:mahirucheck3,alsoPlaying:saki,alsoPlayingStage:7=surprised,The three of you certainly became fast friends.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki,targetSaidMarker:mahirucheck3,alsoPlaying:saki,alsoPlayingStage:9=surprised,The three of you certainly became fast friends.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=worried,Is it really in your best interests to fight naked?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:creepy=horny,Not so tough now that you're about to lose, huh?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=thinking,You really love tossing that camera of yours around, don't you?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:natsuki,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=awkward,...It's a bit late for that. For both of you.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=thinking,And now's not the time to fling hexes...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=glad,Poor Weiss here's about to be scarred for life.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=glad,Now we'll see for sure how close you two are in body type.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:raven=glad,I don't care either way, but I think Raven might wet herself.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=thinking,You really love tossing that camera of yours around, don't you?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki,alsoPlaying:wiifitfemale=glad,I thought that was obvious from the start.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki,alsoPlaying:pit=angry,She can fight her own fights, Pit. Let her be.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,totalRounds:1-10=surprised,Didn't we just begin?!
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,targetSaidMarker:bodysuit,targetNotSaidMarker:bodysuitsolomarinette=teasing,Oh, I see. I don't mind teaching you, but I'd have to teach all of you for the sake of fairness.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=teasing,You just can't keep your modesty, can you Amalia?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=glad,Just couldn't wait to drop your panties for us, huh?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,Maybe I ought to have <i>you</i> wear that, just so you can learn to appreciate it! How about that, Pit?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:juri=worried,(She's treating this less like a competition and more like a modeling gig.)
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=horny,I think I can take a good guess as to what it is...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:zizou=teasing,Every part of that sentence was wrong, Sola.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:futaba=glad,It's about as effective as censor bars in the East.
1-female_crotch_is_visible=tranquil,There! See? Not as bad once it's over and done!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:shimakaze=worried,Maybe I should contact Poseidon to make sure no one's <i>actually</i> dying from this.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter=thinking,Is that so? Maybe someday.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sayori=tranquil,Gone.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kyu=calm,Hmm. Yep, exactly as shameless as I've heard.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jenetta=horny,Fastest crotch reveal yet! Impressive, Jenetta. But also a little sad.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:revy=teasing,Well, you still have the personality of a toilet, but at least you followed through.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola=awkward,In other words, cheating.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mercy=horny,See? You're no angel. Just a human with a god complex.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:juri=surprised,Hairy? That's the first time my intuition's been wrong about you.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:clover=calm,Aw, how cute. You think a wooden axe can harm a goddess.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=glad,There we are. Just like I thought. Just gotta get that mask now...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=teasing,I hope you're proud of your plan. Because I sincerely doubt you can grow back fur instantaneously...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chiaki=horny,I imagine you're the type to... admire my character model. So it's nice to turn the tide.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=angry,Listen, Moon. You may be beyond redemption, but I can still try and help. Let me take you in under my light!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zelda=teasing,So how's that Triforce of Wisdom working out for you?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jolyne=glad,...Or a helpful one.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki=teasing,And here I thought you hated cute stuff.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:arwen=horny,Now I know why they call elves "the fairer folk".
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:zoey=horny,Obviously. Who else would fight a war and then play strip poker?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:wiifitfemale=glad,There's such a thing as too much pride, you know.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:8=calm,That's fine. I'll just take in yours for a bit.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_f=thinking,I never took you for the type to shave, Corrin. Did your husband make you do it?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:2-3=glad,Some girls are secretive about this stuff. And it's not like you were willing to share your grooming habits until two minutes ago.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:shantae=glad,She's right, though. Dancing requires a very disciplined physique. One you have already!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:mei,alsoPlayingStage:7=teasing,You both have wonderful names to joke with. It's a conversation starter. Be thankful.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingStage:7=glad,Being able to summon in general is a wonderful thing.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=horny,So this is what total humiliation looks like.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:florina,alsoPlayingStage:8=surprised,Did you have this lotion on you?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=calm,You Schnee sisters really have no shame, huh?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,Ooh, get her, Pit!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:aella,alsoPlayingStage:6-7=glad,This is the one place where we <i>shouldn't</i> be ashamed. Well, apart from hot springs.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette=thinking,I wouldn't say it's surprising, more... intriguing.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:angie,alsoPlayingStage:9-10=teasing,Poor Angie. She's even jealous of the B-listers.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:lilith=glad,I'd like to meet whoever came up with <i>that</i> name.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:asuna,alsoPlayingStage:9-10=glad,That's not something any of us should concern ourselves with. Just shave as much as you want.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven=teasing,A bra but no bottoms? How risque!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:0-2=calm,It's a nice philosophy. My warriors could use some of that, really.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:mean=teasing,Bullies will get no sympathy from me.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:felicia,alsoPlayingStage:2-4=tranquil,Make sure you don't scratch it!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:miko=calm,I thought you already were, but sure, I'll try my best to defeat you.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:felicia,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=glad,I think the idea's a little different for someone like Felicia, though...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=glad,You show that to any mortal man, and I'm sure you'd have him eating out of the palm of your hand.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:princess=teasing,Remember, ~name~: a princess is always inferior to a goddess.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:nayru=calm,Does demonic possession turn you on? Not kink-shaming, just curious.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:pearl=calm,I always knew my gift of light could be used to make wonderful things!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:hairy1,targetNotSaidMarker:shave1=thinking,I really don't think that matters, Natsuki.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=tranquil,You were looking for a man, right Jura? A lewd picture like that ought to do wonders on the search.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=thinking,Maybe I should get a cat.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=surprised,(Doesn't even care that she just shaved. She really is a cat.)
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zizou,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=glad,I grant you permission to admire it, but don't even think about worshipping it.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=horny,I think we've earned our prize, wouldn't you agree?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zizou,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:5=horny,He hasn't, but I would be curious to see how he did.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zizou,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:6=teasing,I'm sure Pit would rather have a blessing from a beautiful goddess.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zizou,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:7=surprised,Don't do it, Pit. She means that <i>very</i> literally.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=horny,Ooh! You got something up your non-existant sleeve there, wood girl?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=tranquil,After a blunder like that, who wouldn't be?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:2-6=worried,I think you <i>both</i> need your ears checked out.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=surprised,I'm shocked you actually went for it... and then flashed us to boot...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:exhibitionist=horny,I think I see why you'd want to show off like you do...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=tranquil,I think you two'd be cute together! And you're already dressed for the occasion.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:5=annoyed,Okay, but did you have to spoil it for the rest of us?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:may=teasing,Yes, we can definitely tell.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:6=glad,Well, laziness has it's value at times.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:5=thinking,Isn't that the point of this? We all come from different eras?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:shego,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=glad,No offense, Shego, but you probably can't take Rinkah in a fair fight.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:shego,alsoPlayingStage:8=thinking,Do the tabloids even care about the Flame Tribe?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=teasing,Is that an open invitation?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki,alsoPlaying:florina,count-lyn:1=teasing,Then tell us: who's the lucky recipient?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:spooky=calm,Yep, <i>very</i> interesting. Aside from the deathly palor, your body isn't that different from a living human's.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,targetSaidMarker:spacebush,alsoPlaying:meia=calm,I mean, everyone grows 'em. It's just a matter of keeping them.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:blake,alsoPlaying:caleb=thinking,So Caleb, how much does a catgirl excite you compared to a human?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:mahiru=tranquil,And there's the icing on the proverbial cake. You should spread that around, Mahiru.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:shaved=surprised,It actually looks pretty nice with no hair like that...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:revy=annoyed,Makes sense. You two are like peas in a pod.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:ruby=angry,You stop that right now. It's in bad taste.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:yang=angry,You stop that right now. It's in bad taste.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:shantae=awkward,The way you swing your hips is... mesmerizing...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=worried,How? Through deception or brute force? It seems like a bad time either way...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki,alsoPlaying:yuri=glad,Oh my. So you two've seen each other's, then?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=calm,Just be thankful this ordeal's almost over.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven,alsoPlaying:felicia=glad,Let's just say your both bad at thinking things through.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:april=horny,Not very private when you're showing it off publicly.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:faye=thinking,I had no idea shaving was so common with both the lawful <i>and</i> lawless...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:revy,alsoPlayingStage:3=annoyed,That's pretty much my thoughts exactly. <i>Don't</i>.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:orendi,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=calm,Watching Rinkah fight a monster <i>could</i> be fun...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=teasing,Someone with a questionable origin, that's who.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=calm,Corrin won't talk. For his own sake most of all.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zone-tan=tranquil,Don't get too excited. You still have Zone-tan's forfeit to look forward to!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=surprised,So you're saying the rest of your tribe doesn't shave either?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:alice_mgq=calm,I'm not impressed. No class at all.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:7=calm,This whole night's been pretty wild, huh?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=surprised,That's a lot of hair down there, ~name~! Have you ever considered shaving some of it? I have a spell I use for that.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=teasing,What happened to not making things awkward, hmm?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:8=surprised,I think she said something about mugging you?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:9s=glad,Maybe he meant the insides?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:kyoko,alsoPlayingStage:0-2=teasing,Really, even a rock could figure <i>that</i> out.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=tranquil,Glad we're all in agreement that we look pretty cool!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=calm,Every style has its merits. I encourage you to try them all!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:9-10=thinking,Mar? ...Oh! You mean Marinette.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:spooky,alsoPlaying:chica=tranquil,Hey now, there aren't that many of us "alive" to begin with here!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=calm,Enough of that, Misato. You <i>and</i> Rinkah are doing just fine.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:xander=horny,I didn't know you were into the average Joes, Winter.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:morrigan,alsoPlayingStage:5=glad,To be honest, I prefer it like this. Better than going on a murderous rampage.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:tracer=horny,Ah, <i>there's</i> the butt that broke the Internet.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:nagisa=worried,Nagisa, you do what you want. Don't let Winter here try and shave you.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=surprised,That might be a little <i>too</i> personal for here, Spider-Woman.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:april,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=surprised,I'm pretty sure news teams don't get that close, April!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:zizou=calm,From what I've seen from Zizou so far, that was a more tame response than I expected.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:daisy=calm,Oh! Daisy! ...guess you're the genuine article, then.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lara=horny,Guess the "nude code" exists after all!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:april,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=teasing,Now here's a newscast I'd want to watch.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven,targetNotSaidMarker:strategic_decision=teasing,With what your wearing? Please. I have my suspicions this was all-too intentional.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:nayru,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=surprised,...Aren't you going to finish that?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lux=angry,It's not even natural? ...how can you call yourself a warrior of light?!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:saki,targetSaidMarker:mahirucheck3,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingStage:7=surprised,You're taking naked pictures together? Is that an initiation of some sort?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:saki,targetSaidMarker:mahirucheck,targetNotSaidMarker:mahirucheck2,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingStage:7=surprised,You're taking naked pictures together? Is that an initiation of some sort?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah=teasing,Getting worried yet, warrior? You should be.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:saki,targetSaidMarker:mahirucheck3,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingStage:9=surprised,Are all Hope's Peak students this perverted?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chiaki,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=tranquil,Don't even mind taking nude pics together. What nice friends you two are.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mia=surprised,Ooh, a power play! Well, I won't lose to you, attorney.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:elaine=tranquil,They should call you Elaine Marley, Mighty Fine Lady (tm)!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=surprised,...Did you really just do that?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chiaki,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=tranquil,Don't even mind taking nude pics together. What nice friends you two are.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aella=teasing,With how much you're complaining, you'd think you'd never been naked before.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:ginger=horny,Look at you! You're almost as red as your hair!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7,alsoPlaying:mahiru=tranquil,Excellent, Mahiru. She wants lots of pictures, so don't hold back anymore.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rosalina=worried,Seeing a fellow goddess exposed hits a lot closer to home than the others.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=annoyed,Ah, paparazzi. I imagine this must be hard for someone so young like you.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:down_they_go=horny,You mean you still had it? You were standing here with nothing but that goofy-print underwear.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=teasing,I dunno, Ochako. This might give you a popularity boost.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:step_it_up=thinking,(Sounds like a step back to me.)
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:shave1,targetNotSaidMarker:hairy1=calm,No, it's not. It's probably just a little less common than going natural.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:pauling=teasing,That body just screams 'Seduce me!', very nice.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:saki,targetSaidMarker:mahirucheck,targetNotSaidMarker:mahirucheck2,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingStage:9=surprised,Are all Hope's Peak students this perverted?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dawn=surprised,I was unaware humans could get natural hair that colorful! Thought it was a god-only thing...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dawn=horny,Now I'm no expert in house design, but know that yours is very pleasing to the eyes, Dawn.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:do_or_die=awkward,I see.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:get_serious_now=thinking,That just sounds silly.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:do_better=surprised,Maybe focus on the game and not some silly spell and you'll do better.

2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=surprised,Are you talking about at the Rewind Spring? I was more focused on keeping you alive at the time, you know.
2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,Oh, no need. Pit already has a black tunic from his time at the Smash tourney.
2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:ryuji=teasing,Let's see what's behind the "zomg".
2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit,alsoPlaying:kyu=teasing,Absolutely. You should have seen his face after the Rewind Spring incident. He was red for days!

2-male_chest_is_visible,target:link=teasing,Hylia chooses her champions well, I see.

2-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=annoyed,Really, you might as well have gone all the way if you had a penis installed.
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:ryuji=horny,Putting the "muscle" in "musclehead", I see.
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:4-7=horny,What's the matter, Pit? Don't you finally want to touch an android?
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:human=teasing,They say humans are the closest to the gods. Even you're good evidence for that claim, ~name~.
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=horny,Not bad, Pit. As expected of my finest warrior.
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:futaba=teasing,What robots do you know that have nipples?
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit,alsoPlaying:kyu=awkward,You <i>have</i> been really interested in him. Hmm, maybe...
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:ryuji,totalFemales:2-4=awkward,You're selling yourself short. How sad...
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=thinking,Is there any real purpose for robot nipples? I'm impressed your maker got the details as accurate as they did, though.
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:link,targetStage:5=calm,Good. Those "hyups" were starting to get on my nerve.
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible=teasing,And now to have a close study of the human penis. I hear they vary a lot in size....
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:futaba=glad,If you could even call it a trick.
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:human=horny,I'm actually really excited to see what the average human's thing looks like...
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pit=glad,What can I say? A goddess has to have her fun.
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ryuji=horny,C'mon, Ryuji. Let's see your "dragon". That's what your name means, right?
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=horny,Guess we get to check and see if your mechanic knew what they were doing...
2-male_small_crotch_is_visible=awkward,Never thought a human could be smaller than a centurion, so...congrats?
2-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:fred=teasing,I figured you were compensating for something, but this is worse than I thought.
2-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_m=tranquil,Hahaha! Sorry Corrin, but I'm <i>loving</i> this.
2-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:human=awkward,I'm sorry for your loss.
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=tranquil,About what I expected. Looks like it'd make any human girl happy.
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:pit=horny,So it seems. Apologize, Pit.
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=tranquil,Don't worry, Pit. You may not like it now, but I'm sure you'll look back on this day fondly.
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:futaba=teasing,You're <i>both</i> strange. That's not really a bad thing, though. It's charming.
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s=surprised,Oh! Seems pretty accurate, as far as I know. Kudos.
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9,count-halloween_pit:0=surprised,Oh my! Pit, are you alright? She's not hurting you, is she?
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:pit,count-futaba:1=teasing,Sure, why not? You have my permission to... "get to know them."
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=tranquil,It's natural. As natural as androids get, anyway.
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:human=calm,Yep, that's a nice looking member right there.
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit,alsoPlaying:kyu=horny,Perhaps. As long as I can have him back within twenty-four hours.
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7,count-halloween_pit:0=surprised,Oh my! Pit, are you alright? She's not hurting you, is she?
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible=surprised,I've never seen one that big! Looks rather inefficient, though...
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=awkward,Wow... I bet it shoots farther than the arm of Dhalsim...
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=worried,Whoa, whoa! I'm pretty sure <i>most</i> penises shouldn't be the length of a blade, Mettaton.
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:human=surprised,Wow, you're not average at all, are you?
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryuji=surprised,Oh! That's much bigger than my average soldier. Might even outperform a few gods...
2-female_chest_will_be_visible=calm,Tough luck, ~name~. I won't stare, but I can't make promises for the others.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:winter=calm,Hey, anything's better than such childish underwear to me.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:zizou=glad,Being scared is natural, I suppose. But your friend will get you through it.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mileena=teasing,Does that even qualify as clothing In the first place?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:5-8=tranquil,Now <i>this</i> is interesting! How similar will they be to Weiss's, I wonder...
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=annoyed,She does get rather grating after a while.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola=glad,I'm not expecting much. So you really can't let me down!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:sheva=glad,I don't think Sheva herself is a zombie.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jolyne=calm,On the other hand, there's no better time to get back on your feet!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:0-6,count-zizou:1=angry,I'm fairly certain at least one person in this room can see the future. How does no one know?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=calm,You knew all the right plays, didn't you Weiss? Apparently you're much better than you let on...
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=worried,If you're going to fight, you should leave those bound, right?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sayori=glad,Can't be helped. The rules are absolute, even to me.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:raven,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=thinking,You're contradicting yourself. Although I have little doubt they really are monsters.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,filter:exhibitionist=surprised,Wow. You... really have no shame, do you?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=teasing,Really, you think I'm here to make enemies? That's just not worth my time. So yeah, call me a friend.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aella,targetNotSaidMarker:AellaStalling=annoyed,Okay, enough stalling. Onto the real thing.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jenetta=tranquil,I bet a few people here have... although they were probably obscured by fur.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:shimakaze=teasing,I'm curious; how sensitive are they?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:zoey,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=glad,Someone like Rinkah doesn't understand the meaning of the word modesty.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=glad,Don't knock it 'til you try it. She might even make some more fitting underwear for you!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:revy=teasing,What's the matter? Only able to afford half a set?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:marinette=annoyed,You're right, but you didn't have to be so blunt.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:nayru,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=tranquil,I wonder how the other oracles would react to this. Or even my oracles?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=awkward,Zone-tan here is even blunter than you, Rinkah!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,alsoPlayingStage:5=thinking,Aren't we in one right now? Or am I overthinking it?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:raven=tranquil,We've already had the big reveal. What's one more pair of breasts to the lot?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah=horny,Do it! Release them from their binds!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,filter:shy=calm,I believe in you, ~name~. I shall grant you the power to get through this.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:10,count-zizou:1=thinking,It's not like they're watching this live, though...
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:not_1st,totalExposed:0=glad,There you go.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:3=surprised,I thought nudity was taboo for humans?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:juri=teasing,Let's see if you can match my expectations.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jolyne,targetTimeInStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=glad,It's not like she's lying to her self. She's just not in a hurry to admit it.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:9,count-zizou:1=horny,You'll have to be more specific, because I see two girls at work here. Which part?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:felicia=surprised,Oh... you were serious?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:clover,targetStage:5=teasing,Like I said before. Three dots.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:6=calm,Not everyone can be a Princess Peach. Rinkah's much more of a Magnus, but that's beside the point.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:aimee,alsoPlayingStage:2-5=angry,While you're at it, don't go shooting my clothes either!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:spooky=teasing,<i>Come on</i>. Would I laugh?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:joey,targetStage:4=glad,Tata, bra! Let's see some tatas.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=horny,The whole leotard? You really aren't holding anything back, are you Mika?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:alice_mgq=annoyed,...Well. Go on, then.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:nayru=worried,You have hands, you know...
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:elaine=glad,...For that exact reason.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:6=thinking,I think that's the wrong game, Rinkah...
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=surprised,Oh! You're really using magic... for that. Well.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=glad,There's many reserved princesses out there, but Rinkah's about as far as you can get from them.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=surprised,Oh...That's good to hear.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=thinking,I'd like to see what trick could possibly save you from this.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aella=teasing,Not according to plan, Ms. Tactician?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:gogo=horny,Are you finally putting your money where your mouth is? Now I'm a little excited.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:chiaki=thinking,What type of games, exactly?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan=tranquil,I'm not particularly interested, but go ahead.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:natsuki=awkward,I think you forgot a period in there... or five.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=awkward,Why? What made you into such a perverted woman?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:7-8,count-zizou:1=calm,Humans can be so modest. Granted, you two are exceptionally so.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=glad,Easy come, easy go.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=tranquil,I sense a leak in the near future.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=tranquil,Don't worry, Rinkah. I already have been!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:miko=teasing,Sounds like a bunch of excuses to me, Ms. Hermit.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=glad,Rinkah's from a tribe, but I'm pretty sure it's not an <i>island</i> tribe.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible=glad,Feeling a little inadequate, ~name~?
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:raven=calm,Not like I care about seeing naked demon girls anyway. I used to be close with Medusa, after all.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:sayori=teasing,Really though, what is there to see?
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:spooky=thinking,Okay, great. Can we go back to the game now?
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:spooky,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=calm,Because humans would fear the name <i>Spooky</i>.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:shimakaze=calm,You must either really be enjoying this or feel nothing at all to take so many in a row.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:spooky,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=annoyed,Stop being cliche, Spooky.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:hairy1,targetNotSaidMarker:shave1=teasing,What, your chest size? We knew it was tiny all along, honey.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:natsuki=teasing,I <i>could</i> say a lot... but I won't.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:spooky,alsoPlaying:elaine,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=teasing,You can't seem to keep ghosts out your hair, Elaine! You should call an exorcist or something.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:zizou,alsoPlaying:pit=thinking,Are there even showers here?
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:miko=awkward,I thought humans were past showing off their spouses like trophies...
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:not_1st,totalExposed:1=thinking,Think of it like... you're blazing a trail. Wait, you lost your blazer, didn't you...
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:spooky,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,Good luck with that. Pit's been finished more times than I can count, but he always comes back.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:meg=calm,I don't know what you were so upset about. There's more to life than breast size, you know. For example, maybe ~player~ is a leg person.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:raven,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=tranquil,Ooh, a grizzly revenge story! How <i>edgy.</i>
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible=tranquil,What a lovely pair! Why'd you wear a top again?
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible=horny,How enticing...
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:ruby=surprised,Wait, hold on. Neo's a mimic?
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=tranquil,She's just being honest to a fault. I'm sure it's not personal.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=teasing,What? The toned abs? She hardly seems like the type.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:yang=surprised,Wait, hold on. Neo's a mimic?
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:jin,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=tranquil,That's probably the best compliment you'll ever get, Jin.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:sayla,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=glad,What happened to theocracy? Or is that not in style in your worlds?
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:shego=teasing,Yes, clearly.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=teasing,Then you're just not trying hard enough.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=thinking,Curious...
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:aella=teasing,Of course it was an accident. Do you think she'd blow a chance to stay in the game longer?
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:5-6=awkward,Must not get compliments very often. Poor thing...
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:raven=tranquil,Methinks the Azarathian is conflicted.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=thinking,Only took you this long, huh? Slow for a space pirate.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=teasing,Miss Morose has a sexual side after all. Congrats, Jolyne.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingStage:9=teasing,Then you're just not trying hard enough.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:mahiru=horny,Don't listen to her, Mahiru. A photographer should be able to take as many pictures as she wants.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:buffy,alsoPlayingStage:2=glad,Take solace in the fact you have each other.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:4-7=thinking,Little confused by what you mean, Marinette. Jolyne is too, by the looks of it.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:aella,alsoPlayingStage:5-6=awkward,The humiliation of defeat stings far worse than losing these clothes, I agree.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:meg,alsoPlayingStage:0=glad,Sounds about as nice as the Lunar Sanctum.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:2-3=glad,Most woman who come here are... transparent with their motives.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sayla=annoyed,In my opinion, this shouldn't be allowed... but I'll let it slide, just so I can rub it in when I win later.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:sf=glad,Compared to what I've seen? Not really.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:zoey=glad,Maybe pay attention to things right in front of your face next time. Or below.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:piper=worried,What a harsh environment to not even be able to get the clothes you need... you have my condolences.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:revy=teasing,I'm going to enjoy putting you in your place, you crude girl.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:zelda=surprised,So unashamed... guess you've got Farore's courage in you.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:zone-tan=teasing,Zone-tan's a real party girl, huh?...Close your mouth, ~player~.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_f=teasing,Maybe someday you'll reach Robin's level of tactical prowess. But today is not that day.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=worried,You sure it didn't hurt you? That one looked awful close.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aella=horny,Sloppy sloppy. Even Magnus wouldn't have been so careless.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=teasing,You know, I didn't do that because you can't bring it back after the game. Hope you don't mind streaking.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:juri=thinking,I might have underestimated you, at this rate.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne=thinking,(Yep. No shame anymore now that she's had a chance to get over the shock.)
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola=calm,Sure, I've had my fun. I don't need to stare.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jenetta=surprised,You could see the whole time? That's awkward...
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:winter=teasing,Topless and... is that a wet spot?
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=thinking,You've been hyping them all game, but I don't see the appeal.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:elaine=annoyed,Maybe don't brandish a knife next time?
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:nayru=surprised,Was this planned? I didn't think you were so conniving!
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=glad,Never that simple, is it?
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:pauling=horny,(<i>Considering how much she puts out, I'm surprised she never got with the Scout.</i>)
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:mercy=calm,Those are easily an eight. Maybe even better.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rinkah=calm,I can see why you're the princess now.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:not_the_best_but=calm,Obviously. But humans probably go wild for them, right?
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss=teasing,Did you wet yourself out of embarrassment? Amazing. I've never seen a sorrier soldier. Weiss would probably be a better one, at this rate.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:aimee=annoyed,Both this "darlin'" and this Laslow just sound like perverts.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=glad,It's very reminiscint of a hot spring, right?
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=glad,I'm pretty sure this Corrin's a married man, but I know what you're getting at.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:felicia=calm,She'd <i>have</i> to be good to not even try to hide 'em.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=glad,I think you have the wrong idea about this game... you want to <i>keep</i> your underwear on...
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=thinking,I suppose it doesn't matter for someone raised in a jungle anyway.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:nayru,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=thinking,Perhaps. I hope my presence doesn't make you... uncomfortable.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=thinking,Quite the underreaction. Or are you just flustered?
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:6=glad,I think your act could use some work.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:clover,targetStage:6=annoyed,And just when things were getting interesting with you.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:zizou=horny,Funny how one word from the goddess turns you into an exhibitionist.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:321=thinking,Eh. Underwhelming, really. Not worth a countdown.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:about_to_see_my_breasts=horny,They're probably just your type, ~player~.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:alright_here_i_go=thinking,Good enough. We still have a hat and some panties to go, though!
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:isnt_too_bad=teasing,You're lucky I don't care enough to tell them.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=teasing,Maybe someone here just has that effect on you, Joetta.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=tranquil,I can neither confirm nor deny this.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible=surprised,You're more shapely than I expected!
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:seven=surprised,You're certainly attractive for a space-goer, Seven. Certainly moreso than a space pirate.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:april=thinking,(<i>Why do I suddenly have a craving for pizza?</i>)
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:chara=tranquil,Guess what they say about drinking milk is true after all!
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:korra=horny,Sorry to stare, but that's the way this game goes...
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=glad,What a showwoman! I can respect that.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia=thinking,(Surprisingly human-like anatomy...)
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:chiaki=glad,Sorry, but that's below me. Ask Pit if you want a rubdown. Nice mole, by the way.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:alice_mgq=glad,It's fine. We all know they're fake, anyway.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika,alsoPlaying:chun-li=annoyed,(What is it with Street Fighters wanting a big butt? Small or normal ones are fine!)
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible=tranquil,And for you, my dear ~name~, you've earned a one-way ticket to public exposure!
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:winter=glad,You'll catch a cold if you stay in soaked panties too long. You probably should have removed them sooner.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan=glad,I don't care either way, but I think ~player~ might wet themselves.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=worried,...I have no words for what I'm seeing. And smelling.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:spooky=glad,I'm almost surprised you're following them, to be honest.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rinkah=tranquil,Time to see you in your full, mangy glory!
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:elaine=surprised,Elaine, is that a...?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:miko,targetSaidMarker:LastWordW=horny,Cheating isn't very becoming of a saint, you know.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette=calm,Come now, have a little more faith in us... no pun intended.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:miko,targetSaidMarker:LastWordN=glad,It's not so bad, right?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nayru=annoyed,I almost just wasted a magic spell on you. You could have let us know from the start, at least.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:daphne=teasing,Gather round, gang. Let's see- I mean get to, the bottom of this mystery.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:shimakaze=awkward,How... gruesome.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kyu=glad,The old fashioned-way, huh? At least you'll go home <i>somewhat</i> clothed.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mahiru,marker:mahirucheck=surprised,Oh! I expected you to be hairier. Or be completely shaved. Just not in between.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sayori=calm,Going, going...
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=teasing,Her too? <i>That's</i> dedication.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jenetta=glad,Speedrun time!
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=thinking,Is the curtain necessary? I'm sure at least <i>someone</i> would be into this.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:revy=tranquil,Finally! I was getting sick of  your bellyaching, to be honest.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=calm,Such a skimpy little costume! I have no idea why you heroes think walking around in leotards is a good idea.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jolyne=surprised,Not a very elegant location to write that...
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki=teasing,Out of "armor" already, Chiaki? I really expected you to clean house.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:natsuki=annoyed,Any time now.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sola=surprised,Getting it over with? Fair enough.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:miko,targetSaidMarker:LastWordL=tranquil,The best leaders know no fear, it's true.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aella=glad,I bet you wish you weren't so tall now, huh?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nayru,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=calm,As did everyone else.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki,targetSaidMarker:mahirucheck3,alsoPlaying:saki,alsoPlayingStage:9=surprised,The three of you certainly became fast friends.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon,targetSaidMarker:moon_doesnt_wear_panties=awkward,Well, seeing how you said earlier that you don't wear panties, this can only end one way.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:clover=teasing,Better start believing.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki,targetSaidMarker:mahirucheck,targetNotSaidMarker:mahirucheck2,alsoPlaying:saki,alsoPlayingStage:7=surprised,The three of you certainly became fast friends.

2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki,targetSaidMarker:mahirucheck3,alsoPlaying:saki,alsoPlayingStage:7=surprised,The three of you certainly became fast friends.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=worried,Is it really in your best interests to fight naked?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=thinking,You really love tossing that camera of yours around, don't you?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=thinking,You really love tossing that camera of yours around, don't you?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:natsuki,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=awkward,...It's a bit late for that. For both of you.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=thinking,And now's not the time to fling hexes...
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=glad,Poor Weiss here's about to be scarred for life.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=glad,Now we'll see for sure how close you two are in body type.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:raven=glad,I don't care either way, but I think Raven might wet herself.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:alice_mgq=glad,Not really much to gain from this. We can see the pubic hair situation and more already.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki,alsoPlaying:pit=angry,She can fight her own fights, Pit. Let her be.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:zizou=teasing,Every part of that sentence was wrong, Sola.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=horny,I think I can take a good guess as to what it is...
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:futaba=glad,It's about as effective as censor bars in the East.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,Maybe I ought to have <i>you</i> wear that, just so you can learn to appreciate it! How about that, Pit?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=glad,Just couldn't wait to drop your panties for us, huh?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=teasing,You just can't keep your modesty, can you Amalia?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,totalRounds:1-10=surprised,Didn't we just begin?!
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,targetSaidMarker:bodysuit,targetNotSaidMarker:bodysuitsolomarinette=teasing,Oh, I see. I don't mind teaching you, but I'd have to teach all of you for the sake of fairness.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:creepy=horny,Not so tough now that you're about to lose, huh?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:shave1,targetNotSaidMarker:hairy1=glad,Why yes, Natsuki, we <i>do</i> have the same equipment down there. Even you and I.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:miko=calm,Danger! Danger! Not good!
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:sarcasm=teasing,Yes, Kyu. We're all so sorry to put you through this.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=glad,Consider it a small victory. For you and you alone.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:juri=worried,(She's treating this less like a competition and more like a modeling gig.)
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki,alsoPlaying:wiifitfemale=glad,I thought that was obvious from the start.
2-female_crotch_is_visible=calm,You know, I almost feel bad, then I remember my decency's on the line too.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki,alsoPlaying:yuri=glad,Oh my. So you two've seen each other's, then?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:do_or_die=awkward,I see.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:shego,alsoPlayingStage:8=thinking,Do the tabloids even care about the Flame Tribe?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=calm,Corrin won't talk. For his own sake most of all.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:felicia,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=glad,I think the idea's a little different for someone like Felicia, though...
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki=teasing,And here I thought you hated cute stuff.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:lilith=glad,I'd like to meet whoever came up with <i>that</i> name.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:shantae=awkward,The way you swing your hips is... mesmerizing...
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lux=angry,It's not even natural? ...how can you call yourself a warrior of light?!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=teasing,What happened to not making things awkward, hmm?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:shego,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=glad,No offense, Shego, but you probably can't take Rinkah in a fair fight.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,Ooh, get her, Pit!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7,alsoPlaying:mahiru=tranquil,Excellent, Mahiru. She wants lots of pictures, so don't hold back anymore.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:princess=teasing,Remember, ~name~: a princess is always inferior to a goddess.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chiaki=horny,I imagine you're the type to... admire my character model. So it's nice to turn the tide.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:0-2=calm,It's a nice philosophy. My warriors could use some of that, really.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:revy,alsoPlayingStage:3=annoyed,That's pretty much my thoughts exactly. <i>Don't</i>.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=tranquil,Glad we're all in agreement that we look pretty cool!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:shantae=glad,She's right, though. Dancing requires a very disciplined physique. One you have already!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=calm,You Schnee sisters really have no shame, huh?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=tranquil,I think you two'd be cute together! And you're already dressed for the occasion.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:clover=calm,Aw, how cute. You think a wooden axe can harm a goddess.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:daisy=calm,Oh! Daisy! ...guess you're the genuine article, then.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:alice_mgq=calm,I'm not impressed. No class at all.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jolyne=glad,...Or a helpful one.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:elaine=tranquil,They should call you Elaine Marley, Mighty Fine Lady (tm)!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,targetSaidMarker:spacebush,alsoPlaying:meia=calm,I mean, everyone grows 'em. It's just a matter of keeping them.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:xander=horny,I didn't know you were into the average Joes, Winter.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:saki,targetSaidMarker:mahirucheck,targetNotSaidMarker:mahirucheck2,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingStage:9=surprised,Are all Hope's Peak students this perverted?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:ginger=horny,Look at you! You're almost as red as your hair!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:florina,alsoPlayingStage:8=surprised,Did you have this lotion on you?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mercy=horny,See? You're no angel. Just a human with a god complex.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:asuna,alsoPlayingStage:9-10=glad,That's not something any of us should concern ourselves with. Just shave as much as you want.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=glad,You show that to any mortal man, and I'm sure you'd have him eating out of the palm of your hand.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:spooky,alsoPlaying:chica=tranquil,Hey now, there aren't that many of us "alive" to begin with here!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mia=surprised,Ooh, a power play! Well, I won't lose to you, attorney.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:juri=surprised,Hairy? That's the first time my intuition's been wrong about you.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki,alsoPlaying:florina,count-lyn:1=teasing,Then tell us: who's the lucky recipient?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven=teasing,A bra but no bottoms? How risque!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:felicia,alsoPlayingStage:2-4=tranquil,Make sure you don't scratch it!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:april,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=surprised,I'm pretty sure news teams don't get that close, April!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:saki,targetSaidMarker:mahirucheck,targetNotSaidMarker:mahirucheck2,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingStage:7=surprised,You're taking naked pictures together? Is that an initiation of some sort?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:9s=glad,Maybe he meant the insides?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=teasing,Is that an open invitation?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:spooky=calm,Yep, <i>very</i> interesting. Aside from the deathly palor, your body isn't that different from a living human's.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:angie,alsoPlayingStage:9-10=teasing,Poor Angie. She's even jealous of the B-listers.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=teasing,I hope you're proud of your plan. Because I sincerely doubt you can grow back fur instantaneously...
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:5=thinking,Isn't that the point of this? We all come from different eras?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=horny,I think we've earned our prize, wouldn't you agree?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zizou,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:6=teasing,I'm sure Pit would rather have a blessing from a beautiful goddess.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:get_serious_now=thinking,That just sounds silly.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette=thinking,I wouldn't say it's surprising, more... intriguing.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:nayru=calm,Does demonic possession turn you on? Not kink-shaming, just curious.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=surprised,...Did you really just do that?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=surprised,That might be a little <i>too</i> personal for here, Spider-Woman.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:hairy1,targetNotSaidMarker:shave1=thinking,I really don't think that matters, Natsuki.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zizou,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:5=horny,He hasn't, but I would be curious to see how he did.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aella=teasing,With how much you're complaining, you'd think you'd never been naked before.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:morrigan,alsoPlayingStage:5=glad,To be honest, I prefer it like this. Better than going on a murderous rampage.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:shave1,targetNotSaidMarker:hairy1=calm,No, it's not. It's probably just a little less common than going natural.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=surprised,(Doesn't even care that she just shaved. She really is a cat.)
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:6=glad,Well, laziness has it's value at times.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:down_they_go=horny,You mean you still had it? You were standing here with nothing but that goofy-print underwear.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:pearl=calm,I always knew my gift of light could be used to make wonderful things!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:do_better=surprised,Maybe focus on the game and not some silly spell and you'll do better.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zizou,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=glad,I grant you permission to admire it, but don't even think about worshipping it.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=calm,Enough of that, Misato. You <i>and</i> Rinkah are doing just fine.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_f=thinking,I never took you for the type to shave, Corrin. Did your husband make you do it?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:9-10=thinking,Mar? ...Oh! You mean Marinette.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:2-6=worried,I think you <i>both</i> need your ears checked out.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=thinking,Maybe I should get a cat.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=horny,Ooh! You got something up your non-existant sleeve there, wood girl?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=angry,Listen, Moon. You may be beyond redemption, but I can still try and help. Let me take you in under my light!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:exhibitionist=horny,I think I see why you'd want to show off like you do...
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:tracer=horny,Ah, <i>there's</i> the butt that broke the Internet.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:wiifitfemale=glad,There's such a thing as too much pride, you know.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:nayru,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=surprised,...Aren't you going to finish that?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=tranquil,After a blunder like that, who wouldn't be?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:shaved=surprised,It actually looks pretty nice with no hair like that...
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:zoey=horny,Obviously. Who else would fight a war and then play strip poker?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=glad,There we are. Just like I thought. Just gotta get that mask now...
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:step_it_up=thinking,(Sounds like a step back to me.)
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=tranquil,You were looking for a man, right Jura? A lewd picture like that ought to do wonders on the search.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:orendi,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=calm,Watching Rinkah fight a monster <i>could</i> be fun...
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:5=annoyed,Okay, but did you have to spoil it for the rest of us?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=surprised,I'm shocked you actually went for it... and then flashed us to boot...
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chiaki,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=tranquil,Don't even mind taking nude pics together. What nice friends you two are.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zone-tan=tranquil,Don't get too excited. You still have Zone-tan's forfeit to look forward to!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kyu=calm,Hmm. Yep, exactly as shameless as I've heard.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=calm,Every style has its merits. I encourage you to try them all!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zizou,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:7=surprised,Don't do it, Pit. She means that <i>very</i> literally.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=teasing,Someone with a questionable origin, that's who.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven,targetNotSaidMarker:strategic_decision=teasing,With what your wearing? Please. I have my suspicions this was all-too intentional.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:kyoko,alsoPlayingStage:0-2=teasing,Really, even a rock could figure <i>that</i> out.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah=teasing,Getting worried yet, warrior? You should be.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:pauling=teasing,That body just screams 'Seduce me!', very nice.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:arwen=horny,Now I know why they call elves "the fairer folk".
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:aella,alsoPlayingStage:6-7=glad,This is the one place where we <i>shouldn't</i> be ashamed. Well, apart from hot springs.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=calm,Just be thankful this ordeal's almost over.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:mean=teasing,Bullies will get no sympathy from me.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:shimakaze=worried,Maybe I should contact Poseidon to make sure no one's <i>actually</i> dying from this.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:2-3=glad,Some girls are secretive about this stuff. And it's not like you were willing to share your grooming habits until two minutes ago.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola=awkward,In other words, cheating.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=annoyed,Ah, paparazzi. I imagine this must be hard for someone so young like you.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:april,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=teasing,Now here's a newscast I'd want to watch.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:blake,alsoPlaying:caleb=thinking,So Caleb, how much does a catgirl excite you compared to a human?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:mei,alsoPlayingStage:7=teasing,You both have wonderful names to joke with. It's a conversation starter. Be thankful.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:mahiru=tranquil,And there's the icing on the proverbial cake. You should spread that around, Mahiru.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:8=surprised,I think she said something about mugging you?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dawn=surprised,I was unaware humans could get natural hair that colorful! Thought it was a god-only thing...
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dawn=horny,Now I'm no expert in house design, but know that yours is very pleasing to the eyes, Dawn.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:faye=thinking,I had no idea shaving was so common with both the lawful <i>and</i> lawless...
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:7=calm,This whole night's been pretty wild, huh?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=horny,So this is what total humiliation looks like.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:miko=calm,I thought you already were, but sure, I'll try my best to defeat you.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:revy=teasing,Well, you still have the personality of a toilet, but at least you followed through.

2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zelda=teasing,So how's that Triforce of Wisdom working out for you?

2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chiaki,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=tranquil,Don't even mind taking nude pics together. What nice friends you two are.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:8=calm,That's fine. I'll just take in yours for a bit.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=surprised,So you're saying the rest of your tribe doesn't shave either?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:saki,targetSaidMarker:mahirucheck3,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingStage:7=surprised,You're taking naked pictures together? Is that an initiation of some sort?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven,alsoPlaying:felicia=glad,Let's just say your both bad at thinking things through.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=surprised,That's a lot of hair down there, ~name~! Have you ever considered shaving some of it? I have a spell I use for that.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sayori=tranquil,Gone.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=teasing,I dunno, Ochako. This might give you a popularity boost.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:may=teasing,Yes, we can definitely tell.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:april=horny,Not very private when you're showing it off publicly.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lara=horny,Guess the "nude code" exists after all!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter=thinking,Is that so? Maybe someday.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:yang=angry,You stop that right now. It's in bad taste.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:revy=annoyed,Makes sense. You two are like peas in a pod.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingStage:7=glad,Being able to summon in general is a wonderful thing.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:zizou=calm,From what I've seen from Zizou so far, that was a more tame response than I expected.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=worried,How? Through deception or brute force? It seems like a bad time either way...
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rosalina=worried,Seeing a fellow goddess exposed hits a lot closer to home than the others.


#lost brooch
3-male_chest_will_be_visible=teasing,You got to see a fair bit, but it looks like my investment's paid off!
3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:futaba=tranquil,I wouldn't get your hopes up if I were you, Futaba.
3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,Oh, no need. Pit already has a black tunic from his time at the Smash tourney.
3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=calm,That coat's pretty impressive. I wouldn't mind having one made for me. Know a good tailor?
3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=surprised,Are you talking about at the Rewind Spring? I was more focused on keeping you alive at the time, you know.
3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit,alsoPlaying:kyu=teasing,Absolutely. You should have seen his face after the Rewind Spring incident. He was red for days!
3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:ryuji=teasing,Let's see what's behind the "zomg".
3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:link,targetStage:4=teasing,I always knew it was just an act.
3-male_chest_is_visible=tranquil,A rather dashing look for you, ~name~.
3-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=horny,Not bad, Pit. As expected of my finest warrior.
3-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=thinking,So is that chest of yours a cold metal case or warm like a human's?
3-male_chest_is_visible,target:link=teasing,Hylia chooses her champions well, I see.
3-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:3-3=glad,He gets way too worked up when it comes to anything robotic in nature. Ignore him.
3-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=thinking,Is there any real purpose for robot nipples? I'm impressed your maker got the details as accurate as they did, though.
3-male_chest_is_visible,target:ryuji=horny,Putting the "muscle" in "musclehead", I see.
3-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=annoyed,Really, you might as well have gone all the way if you had a penis installed.
3-male_chest_is_visible,target:ryuji,totalFemales:2-4=awkward,You're selling yourself short. How sad...
3-male_chest_is_visible,target:link,targetStage:5=calm,Good. Those "hyups" were starting to get on my nerve.
3-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit,alsoPlaying:kyu=awkward,You <i>have</i> been really interested in him. Hmm, maybe...
3-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:futaba=teasing,What robots do you know that have nipples?
3-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:4-7=horny,What's the matter, Pit? Don't you finally want to touch an android?
3-male_chest_is_visible,target:human=teasing,They say humans are the closest to the gods. Even you're good evidence for that claim, ~name~.
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible=teasing,Cover your eyes, children. Things are about to get <i>erotic</i>.
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pit=glad,What can I say? A goddess has to have her fun.
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ryuji=horny,C'mon, Ryuji. Let's see your "dragon". That's what your name means, right?
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:futaba=glad,If you could even call it a trick.
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=horny,Guess we get to check and see if your mechanic knew what they were doing...
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:human=horny,I'm actually really excited to see what the average human's thing looks like...
3-male_small_crotch_is_visible=annoyed,This feels insulting in a way.
3-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:human=awkward,I'm sorry for your loss.
3-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_m=tranquil,Hahaha! Sorry Corrin, but I'm <i>loving</i> this.
3-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:fred=teasing,I figured you were compensating for something, but this is worse than I thought.
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=calm,Quite impressive indeed...for a mere mortal.
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=tranquil,It's natural. As natural as androids get, anyway.
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9,count-halloween_pit:0=surprised,Oh my! Pit, are you alright? She's not hurting you, is she?
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7,count-halloween_pit:0=surprised,Oh my! Pit, are you alright? She's not hurting you, is she?
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=tranquil,Don't worry, Pit. You may not like it now, but I'm sure you'll look back on this day fondly.
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:human=calm,Yep, that's a nice looking member right there.
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s=surprised,Oh! Seems pretty accurate, as far as I know. Kudos.
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:pit=horny,So it seems. Apologize, Pit.
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:futaba=teasing,You're <i>both</i> strange. That's not really a bad thing, though. It's charming.
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit,alsoPlaying:kyu=horny,Perhaps. As long as I can have him back within twenty-four hours.
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:pit,count-futaba:1=teasing,Sure, why not? You have my permission to... "get to know them."
3-male_large_crotch_is_visible=worried,That's...a bit intimidating, actually.
3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:human=surprised,Wow, you're not average at all, are you?
3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=awkward,Wow... I bet it shoots farther than the arm of Dhalsim...
3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryuji=surprised,Oh! That's much bigger than my average soldier. Might even outperform a few gods...
3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=worried,Whoa, whoa! I'm pretty sure <i>most</i> penises shouldn't be the length of a blade, Mettaton.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible=calm,Are you fond of your ~clothing~? Well, I have bad news...
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan=tranquil,I'm not particularly interested, but go ahead.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:elaine=glad,...For that exact reason.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:zoey,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=glad,Someone like Rinkah doesn't understand the meaning of the word modesty.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:revy=teasing,What's the matter? Only able to afford half a set?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=surprised,Oh...That's good to hear.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:5-8=tranquil,Now <i>this</i> is interesting! How similar will they be to Weiss's, I wonder...
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=tranquil,I sense a leak in the near future.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=horny,The whole leotard? You really aren't holding anything back, are you Mika?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=awkward,Why? What made you into such a perverted woman?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=awkward,Zone-tan here is even blunter than you, Rinkah!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:felicia=surprised,Oh... you were serious?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=glad,Easy come, easy go.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:3=surprised,I thought nudity was taboo for humans?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:winter=calm,Hey, anything's better than such childish underwear to me.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,filter:exhibitionist=surprised,Wow. You... really have no shame, do you?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=surprised,Oh! You're really using magic... for that. Well.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=annoyed,She does get rather grating after a while.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=worried,If you're going to fight, you should leave those bound, right?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:chiaki=thinking,What type of games, exactly?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aella=teasing,Not according to plan, Ms. Tactician?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:spooky=teasing,<i>Come on</i>. Would I laugh?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:7-8,count-zizou:1=calm,Humans can be so modest. Granted, you two are exceptionally so.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=glad,Rinkah's from a tribe, but I'm pretty sure it's not an <i>island</i> tribe.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:aimee,alsoPlayingStage:3-5=angry,While you're at it, don't go shooting my clothes either!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:shimakaze=teasing,I'm curious; how sensitive are they?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:natsuki=awkward,I think you forgot a period in there... or five.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:0-6,count-zizou:1=angry,I'm fairly certain at least one person in this room can see the future. How does no one know?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:juri=teasing,Let's see if you can match my expectations.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aella,targetNotSaidMarker:AellaStalling=annoyed,Okay, enough stalling. Onto the real thing.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:6=calm,Not everyone can be a Princess Peach. Rinkah's much more of a Magnus, but that's beside the point.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=thinking,I'd like to see what trick could possibly save you from this.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:raven,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=thinking,You're contradicting yourself. Although I have little doubt they really are monsters.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:zizou=glad,Being scared is natural, I suppose. But your friend will get you through it.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=glad,Don't knock it 'til you try it. She might even make some more fitting underwear for you!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=calm,You knew all the right plays, didn't you Weiss? Apparently you're much better than you let on...
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=glad,There's many reserved princesses out there, but Rinkah's about as far as you can get from them.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah=horny,Do it! Release them from their binds!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:9,count-zizou:1=horny,You'll have to be more specific, because I see two girls at work here. Which part?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:nayru=worried,You have hands, you know...
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sayori=glad,Can't be helped. The rules are absolute, even to me.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola=glad,I'm not expecting much. So you really can't let me down!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:alice_mgq=annoyed,...Well. Go on, then.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mileena=teasing,Does that even qualify as clothing In the first place?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:nayru,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=tranquil,I wonder how the other oracles would react to this. Or even my oracles?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:clover,targetStage:5=teasing,Like I said before. Three dots.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:miko=teasing,Sounds like a bunch of excuses to me, Ms. Hermit.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:10,count-zizou:1=thinking,It's not like they're watching this live, though...
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jenetta=tranquil,I bet a few people here have... although they were probably obscured by fur.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:raven=tranquil,We've already had the big reveal. What's one more pair of breasts to the lot?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:joey,targetStage:4=glad,Tata, bra! Let's see some tatas.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:gogo=horny,Are you finally putting your money where your mouth is? Now I'm a little excited.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jolyne,targetTimeInStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=glad,It's not like she's lying to her self. She's just not in a hurry to admit it.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,filter:shy=calm,I believe in you, ~name~. I shall grant you the power to get through this.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:6=thinking,I think that's the wrong game, Rinkah...
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,alsoPlayingStage:5=thinking,Aren't we in one right now? Or am I overthinking it?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jolyne=calm,On the other hand, there's no better time to get back on your feet!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:not_1st,totalExposed:0=glad,There you go.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:marinette=annoyed,You're right, but you didn't have to be so blunt.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:sheva=glad,I don't think Sheva herself is a zombie.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=teasing,Really, you think I'm here to make enemies? That's just not worth my time. So yeah, call me a friend.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=tranquil,Don't worry, Rinkah. I already have been!
3-female_small_chest_is_visible=teasing,I didn't hit a sore spot, did I?
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:spooky=thinking,Okay, great. Can we go back to the game now?
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:shimakaze=calm,You must either really be enjoying this or feel nothing at all to take so many in a row.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:sayori=teasing,Really though, what is there to see?
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:spooky,alsoPlaying:elaine,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=teasing,You can't seem to keep ghosts out your hair, Elaine! You should call an exorcist or something.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:miko=awkward,I thought humans were past showing off their spouses like trophies...
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:meg=calm,I don't know what you were so upset about. There's more to life than breast size, you know. For example, maybe ~player~ is a leg person.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:not_1st,totalExposed:1=thinking,Think of it like... you're blazing a trail. Wait, you lost your blazer, didn't you...
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:spooky,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,Good luck with that. Pit's been finished more times than I can count, but he always comes back.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:spooky,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=annoyed,Stop being cliche, Spooky.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:zizou,alsoPlaying:pit=thinking,Are there even showers here?
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:natsuki=teasing,I <i>could</i> say a lot... but I won't.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:hairy1,targetNotSaidMarker:shave1=teasing,What, your chest size? We knew it was tiny all along, honey.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:raven=calm,Not like I care about seeing naked demon girls anyway. I used to be close with Medusa, after all.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:raven,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=tranquil,Ooh, a grizzly revenge story! How <i>edgy.</i>
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:spooky,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=calm,Because humans would fear the name <i>Spooky</i>.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible=thinking,Is it just me, or are ~name~'s nipples getting hard?
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible=horny,That shade of red complements your breasts beautifully.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne=thinking,(Yep. No shame anymore now that she's had a chance to get over the shock.)
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:321=thinking,Eh. Underwhelming, really. Not worth a countdown.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:alright_here_i_go=thinking,Good enough. We still have a hat and some panties to go, though!
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss=teasing,Did you wet yourself out of embarrassment? Amazing. I've never seen a sorrier soldier. Weiss would probably be a better one, at this rate.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:about_to_see_my_breasts=horny,They're probably just your type, ~player~.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingStage:9=teasing,Then you're just not trying hard enough.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=glad,It's very reminiscint of a hot spring, right?
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:sf=glad,Compared to what I've seen? Not really.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=glad,I think you have the wrong idea about this game... you want to <i>keep</i> your underwear on...
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:aimee=annoyed,Both this "darlin'" and this Laslow just sound like perverts.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:isnt_too_bad=teasing,You're lucky I don't care enough to tell them.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:juri=thinking,I might have underestimated you, at this rate.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:zizou=horny,Funny how one word from the goddess turns you into an exhibitionist.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=teasing,You know, I didn't do that because you can't bring it back after the game. Hope you don't mind streaking.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:zelda=surprised,So unashamed... guess you've got Farore's courage in you.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:yang=surprised,Wait, hold on. Neo's a mimic?
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:piper=worried,What a harsh environment to not even be able to get the clothes you need... you have my condolences.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:zone-tan=teasing,Zone-tan's a real party girl, huh?...Close your mouth, ~player~.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:6=glad,I think your act could use some work.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=glad,Never that simple, is it?
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:ruby=surprised,Wait, hold on. Neo's a mimic?
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:pauling=horny,(<i>Considering how much she puts out, I'm surprised she never got with the Scout.</i>)
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:clover,targetStage:6=annoyed,And just when things were getting interesting with you.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:felicia=calm,She'd <i>have</i> to be good to not even try to hide 'em.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=glad,I'm pretty sure this Corrin's a married man, but I know what you're getting at.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:sayla,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=glad,What happened to theocracy? Or is that not in style in your worlds?
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:mercy=calm,Those are easily an eight. Maybe even better.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:zoey=glad,Maybe pay attention to things right in front of your face next time. Or below.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sayla=annoyed,In my opinion, this shouldn't be allowed... but I'll let it slide, just so I can rub it in when I win later.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:shego=teasing,Yes, clearly.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_f=teasing,Maybe someday you'll reach Robin's level of tactical prowess. But today is not that day.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:nayru,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=thinking,Perhaps. I hope my presence doesn't make you... uncomfortable.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=worried,You sure it didn't hurt you? That one looked awful close.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:raven=tranquil,Methinks the Azarathian is conflicted.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aella=horny,Sloppy sloppy. Even Magnus wouldn't have been so careless.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:not_the_best_but=calm,Obviously. But humans probably go wild for them, right?
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=thinking,Quite the underreaction. Or are you just flustered?
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=tranquil,I can neither confirm nor deny this.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=teasing,Maybe someone here just has that effect on you, Joetta.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:revy=teasing,I'm going to enjoy putting you in your place, you crude girl.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=tranquil,She's just being honest to a fault. I'm sure it's not personal.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=teasing,Then you're just not trying hard enough.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=thinking,Curious...
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola=calm,Sure, I've had my fun. I don't need to stare.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:jin,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=tranquil,That's probably the best compliment you'll ever get, Jin.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:mahiru=horny,Don't listen to her, Mahiru. A photographer should be able to take as many pictures as she wants.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:aella=teasing,Of course it was an accident. Do you think she'd blow a chance to stay in the game longer?
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:aella,alsoPlayingStage:5-6=awkward,The humiliation of defeat stings far worse than losing these clothes, I agree.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:buffy,alsoPlayingStage:2=glad,Take solace in the fact you have each other.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=teasing,What? The toned abs? She hardly seems like the type.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:2-3=glad,Most woman who come here are... transparent with their motives.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:5-6=awkward,Must not get compliments very often. Poor thing...
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:4-7=thinking,Little confused by what you mean, Marinette. Jolyne is too, by the looks of it.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:nayru=surprised,Was this planned? I didn't think you were so conniving!
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:meg,alsoPlayingStage:0=glad,Sounds about as nice as the Lunar Sanctum.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rinkah=calm,I can see why you're the princess now.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=thinking,I suppose it doesn't matter for someone raised in a jungle anyway.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=teasing,Miss Morose has a sexual side after all. Congrats, Jolyne.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jenetta=surprised,You could see the whole time? That's awkward...
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=thinking,Only took you this long, huh? Slow for a space pirate.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=thinking,You've been hyping them all game, but I don't see the appeal.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:elaine=annoyed,Maybe don't brandish a knife next time?
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:winter=teasing,Topless and... is that a wet spot?
3-female_large_chest_is_visible=tranquil,Delightful! I bet men give you a lot of stares, right?
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:korra=horny,Sorry to stare, but that's the way this game goes...
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:april=thinking,(<i>Why do I suddenly have a craving for pizza?</i>)
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=glad,What a showwoman! I can respect that.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:seven=surprised,You're certainly attractive for a space-goer, Seven. Certainly moreso than a space pirate.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika,alsoPlaying:chun-li=annoyed,(What is it with Street Fighters wanting a big butt? Small or normal ones are fine!)
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:chara=tranquil,Guess what they say about drinking milk is true after all!
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia=thinking,(Surprisingly human-like anatomy...)
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:chiaki=glad,Sorry, but that's below me. Ask Pit if you want a rubdown. Nice mole, by the way.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:alice_mgq=glad,It's fine. We all know they're fake, anyway.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible=glad,I won't hold it against you if you back out now. You still wanna go through with it?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=glad,Just couldn't wait to drop your panties for us, huh?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki,targetSaidMarker:mahirucheck3,alsoPlaying:saki,alsoPlayingStage:9=surprised,The three of you certainly became fast friends.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=calm,Such a skimpy little costume! I have no idea why you heroes think walking around in leotards is a good idea.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,Maybe I ought to have <i>you</i> wear that, just so you can learn to appreciate it! How about that, Pit?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki,targetSaidMarker:mahirucheck3,alsoPlaying:saki,alsoPlayingStage:7=surprised,The three of you certainly became fast friends.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=teasing,You just can't keep your modesty, can you Amalia?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:revy=tranquil,Finally! I was getting sick of  your bellyaching, to be honest.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki,targetSaidMarker:mahirucheck,targetNotSaidMarker:mahirucheck2,alsoPlaying:saki,alsoPlayingStage:9=surprised,The three of you certainly became fast friends.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mahiru,marker:mahirucheck=surprised,Oh! I expected you to be hairier. Or be completely shaved. Just not in between.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=worried,Is it really in your best interests to fight naked?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kyu=glad,The old fashioned-way, huh? At least you'll go home <i>somewhat</i> clothed.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sola=surprised,Getting it over with? Fair enough.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki,alsoPlaying:pit=angry,She can fight her own fights, Pit. Let her be.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=glad,Consider it a small victory. For you and you alone.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:natsuki=annoyed,Any time now.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:raven=glad,I don't care either way, but I think Raven might wet herself.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=thinking,Is the curtain necessary? I'm sure at least <i>someone</i> would be into this.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=glad,Now we'll see for sure how close you two are in body type.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:zizou=teasing,Every part of that sentence was wrong, Sola.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:clover=teasing,Better start believing.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=glad,Poor Weiss here's about to be scarred for life.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:juri=worried,(She's treating this less like a competition and more like a modeling gig.)
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=horny,I think I can take a good guess as to what it is...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=thinking,And now's not the time to fling hexes...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=teasing,Her too? <i>That's</i> dedication.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:natsuki,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=awkward,...It's a bit late for that. For both of you.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jolyne=surprised,Not a very elegant location to write that...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:futaba=glad,It's about as effective as censor bars in the East.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aella=glad,I bet you wish you weren't so tall now, huh?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=thinking,You really love tossing that camera of yours around, don't you?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki,targetSaidMarker:mahirucheck,targetNotSaidMarker:mahirucheck2,alsoPlaying:saki,alsoPlayingStage:7=surprised,The three of you certainly became fast friends.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=thinking,You really love tossing that camera of yours around, don't you?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,targetSaidMarker:bodysuit,targetNotSaidMarker:bodysuitsolomarinette=teasing,Oh, I see. I don't mind teaching you, but I'd have to teach all of you for the sake of fairness.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:elaine=surprised,Elaine, is that a...?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:alice_mgq=glad,Not really much to gain from this. We can see the pubic hair situation and more already.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:miko,targetSaidMarker:LastWordN=glad,It's not so bad, right?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:spooky=glad,I'm almost surprised you're following them, to be honest.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:miko,targetSaidMarker:LastWordW=horny,Cheating isn't very becoming of a saint, you know.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:miko=calm,Danger! Danger! Not good!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:miko,targetSaidMarker:LastWordL=tranquil,The best leaders know no fear, it's true.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=worried,...I have no words for what I'm seeing. And smelling.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:daphne=teasing,Gather round, gang. Let's see- I mean get to, the bottom of this mystery.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nayru,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=calm,As did everyone else.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki=teasing,Out of "armor" already, Chiaki? I really expected you to clean house.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:winter=glad,You'll catch a cold if you stay in soaked panties too long. You probably should have removed them sooner.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan=glad,I don't care either way, but I think ~player~ might wet themselves.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:creepy=horny,Not so tough now that you're about to lose, huh?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:shimakaze=awkward,How... gruesome.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon,targetSaidMarker:moon_doesnt_wear_panties=awkward,Well, seeing how you said earlier that you don't wear panties, this can only end one way.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki,alsoPlaying:wiifitfemale=glad,I thought that was obvious from the start.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:sarcasm=teasing,Yes, Kyu. We're all so sorry to put you through this.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jenetta=glad,Speedrun time!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette=calm,Come now, have a little more faith in us... no pun intended.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sayori=calm,Going, going...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:shave1,targetNotSaidMarker:hairy1=glad,Why yes, Natsuki, we <i>do</i> have the same equipment down there. Even you and I.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rinkah=tranquil,Time to see you in your full, mangy glory!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nayru=annoyed,I almost just wasted a magic spell on you. You could have let us know from the start, at least.
3-female_crotch_is_visible=surprised,Oh, you actually did it? Guess I'll give you credit for that.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:mahiru=tranquil,And there's the icing on the proverbial cake. You should spread that around, Mahiru.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:pauling=teasing,That body just screams 'Seduce me!', very nice.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:zizou=calm,From what I've seen from Zizou so far, that was a more tame response than I expected.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:saki,targetSaidMarker:mahirucheck3,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingStage:7=surprised,You're taking naked pictures together? Is that an initiation of some sort?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zelda=teasing,So how's that Triforce of Wisdom working out for you?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:elaine=tranquil,They should call you Elaine Marley, Mighty Fine Lady (tm)!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:miko=calm,I thought you already were, but sure, I'll try my best to defeat you.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:saki,targetSaidMarker:mahirucheck3,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingStage:9=surprised,Are all Hope's Peak students this perverted?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:blake,alsoPlaying:caleb=thinking,So Caleb, how much does a catgirl excite you compared to a human?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=calm,Just be thankful this ordeal's almost over.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:ruby=angry,You stop that right now. It's in bad taste.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:8=surprised,I think she said something about mugging you?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:yang=angry,You stop that right now. It's in bad taste.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:7=calm,This whole night's been pretty wild, huh?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:faye=thinking,I had no idea shaving was so common with both the lawful <i>and</i> lawless...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=worried,How? Through deception or brute force? It seems like a bad time either way...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dawn=surprised,I was unaware humans could get natural hair that colorful! Thought it was a god-only thing...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dawn=horny,Now I'm no expert in house design, but know that yours is very pleasing to the eyes, Dawn.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chiaki,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=tranquil,Don't even mind taking nude pics together. What nice friends you two are.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:revy=annoyed,Makes sense. You two are like peas in a pod.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rosalina=worried,Seeing a fellow goddess exposed hits a lot closer to home than the others.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven,alsoPlaying:felicia=glad,Let's just say your both bad at thinking things through.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:april=horny,Not very private when you're showing it off publicly.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:hairy1,targetNotSaidMarker:shave1=thinking,I really don't think that matters, Natsuki.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,targetSaidMarker:spacebush,alsoPlaying:meia=calm,I mean, everyone grows 'em. It's just a matter of keeping them.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:nayru,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=surprised,...Aren't you going to finish that?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=tranquil,Glad we're all in agreement that we look pretty cool!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:wiifitfemale=glad,There's such a thing as too much pride, you know.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:orendi,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=calm,Watching Rinkah fight a monster <i>could</i> be fun...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:zoey=horny,Obviously. Who else would fight a war and then play strip poker?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven,targetNotSaidMarker:strategic_decision=teasing,With what your wearing? Please. I have my suspicions this was all-too intentional.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:shaved=surprised,It actually looks pretty nice with no hair like that...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=surprised,I'm shocked you actually went for it... and then flashed us to boot...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:9-10=thinking,Mar? ...Oh! You mean Marinette.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:shantae=glad,She's right, though. Dancing requires a very disciplined physique. One you have already!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=teasing,Someone with a questionable origin, that's who.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:step_it_up=thinking,(Sounds like a step back to me.)
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=horny,Ooh! You got something up your non-existant sleeve there, wood girl?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=calm,Enough of that, Misato. You <i>and</i> Rinkah are doing just fine.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:nayru=calm,Does demonic possession turn you on? Not kink-shaming, just curious.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:shave1,targetNotSaidMarker:hairy1=calm,No, it's not. It's probably just a little less common than going natural.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:get_serious_now=thinking,That just sounds silly.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=horny,I think we've earned our prize, wouldn't you agree?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:morrigan,alsoPlayingStage:5=glad,To be honest, I prefer it like this. Better than going on a murderous rampage.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:down_they_go=horny,You mean you still had it? You were standing here with nothing but that goofy-print underwear.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=calm,Every style has its merits. I encourage you to try them all!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:revy,alsoPlayingStage:3=annoyed,That's pretty much my thoughts exactly. <i>Don't</i>.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah=teasing,Getting worried yet, warrior? You should be.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:do_better=surprised,Maybe focus on the game and not some silly spell and you'll do better.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:saki,targetSaidMarker:mahirucheck,targetNotSaidMarker:mahirucheck2,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingStage:9=surprised,Are all Hope's Peak students this perverted?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:xander=horny,I didn't know you were into the average Joes, Winter.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:kyoko,alsoPlayingStage:0-2=teasing,Really, even a rock could figure <i>that</i> out.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki,alsoPlaying:florina,count-lyn:1=teasing,Then tell us: who's the lucky recipient?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mia=surprised,Ooh, a power play! Well, I won't lose to you, attorney.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:spooky,alsoPlaying:chica=tranquil,Hey now, there aren't that many of us "alive" to begin with here!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:alice_mgq=calm,I'm not impressed. No class at all.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:saki,targetSaidMarker:mahirucheck,targetNotSaidMarker:mahirucheck2,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingStage:7=surprised,You're taking naked pictures together? Is that an initiation of some sort?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:9s=glad,Maybe he meant the insides?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=teasing,Is that an open invitation?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:daisy=calm,Oh! Daisy! ...guess you're the genuine article, then.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:shego,alsoPlayingStage:8=thinking,Do the tabloids even care about the Flame Tribe?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=teasing,What happened to not making things awkward, hmm?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:ginger=horny,Look at you! You're almost as red as your hair!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki,alsoPlaying:yuri=glad,Oh my. So you two've seen each other's, then?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:do_or_die=awkward,I see.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lux=angry,It's not even natural? ...how can you call yourself a warrior of light?!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:lilith=glad,I'd like to meet whoever came up with <i>that</i> name.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:shego,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=glad,No offense, Shego, but you probably can't take Rinkah in a fair fight.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7,alsoPlaying:mahiru=tranquil,Excellent, Mahiru. She wants lots of pictures, so don't hold back anymore.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,Ooh, get her, Pit!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:nagisa=worried,Nagisa, you do what you want. Don't let Winter here try and shave you.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=calm,Corrin won't talk. For his own sake most of all.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=calm,You Schnee sisters really have no shame, huh?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zizou,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:7=surprised,Don't do it, Pit. She means that <i>very</i> literally.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=glad,There we are. Just like I thought. Just gotta get that mask now...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jolyne=glad,...Or a helpful one.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:exhibitionist=horny,I think I see why you'd want to show off like you do...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=angry,Listen, Moon. You may be beyond redemption, but I can still try and help. Let me take you in under my light!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:april,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=teasing,Now here's a newscast I'd want to watch.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:may=teasing,Yes, we can definitely tell.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:8=calm,That's fine. I'll just take in yours for a bit.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=glad,You show that to any mortal man, and I'm sure you'd have him eating out of the palm of your hand.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:tracer=horny,Ah, <i>there's</i> the butt that broke the Internet.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:5=annoyed,Okay, but did you have to spoil it for the rest of us?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chiaki,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=tranquil,Don't even mind taking nude pics together. What nice friends you two are.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kyu=calm,Hmm. Yep, exactly as shameless as I've heard.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola=awkward,In other words, cheating.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:felicia,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=glad,I think the idea's a little different for someone like Felicia, though...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=tranquil,You were looking for a man, right Jura? A lewd picture like that ought to do wonders on the search.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:mei,alsoPlayingStage:7=teasing,You both have wonderful names to joke with. It's a conversation starter. Be thankful.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:spooky=calm,Yep, <i>very</i> interesting. Aside from the deathly palor, your body isn't that different from a living human's.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:angie,alsoPlayingStage:9-10=teasing,Poor Angie. She's even jealous of the B-listers.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:florina,alsoPlayingStage:8=surprised,Did you have this lotion on you?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=tranquil,After a blunder like that, who wouldn't be?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:april,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=surprised,I'm pretty sure news teams don't get that close, April!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven=teasing,A bra but no bottoms? How risque!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:clover=calm,Aw, how cute. You think a wooden axe can harm a goddess.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:asuna,alsoPlayingStage:9-10=glad,That's not something any of us should concern ourselves with. Just shave as much as you want.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki=teasing,And here I thought you hated cute stuff.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:5=thinking,Isn't that the point of this? We all come from different eras?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=tranquil,I think you two'd be cute together! And you're already dressed for the occasion.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chiaki=horny,I imagine you're the type to... admire my character model. So it's nice to turn the tide.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:shantae=awkward,The way you swing your hips is... mesmerizing...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:felicia,alsoPlayingStage:2-4=tranquil,Make sure you don't scratch it!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:juri=surprised,Hairy? That's the first time my intuition's been wrong about you.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:2-6=worried,I think you <i>both</i> need your ears checked out.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mercy=horny,See? You're no angel. Just a human with a god complex.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=teasing,I hope you're proud of your plan. Because I sincerely doubt you can grow back fur instantaneously...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:0-2=calm,It's a nice philosophy. My warriors could use some of that, really.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:princess=teasing,Remember, ~name~: a princess is always inferior to a goddess.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=surprised,That's a lot of hair down there, ~name~! Have you ever considered shaving some of it? I have a spell I use for that.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lara=horny,Guess the "nude code" exists after all!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aella=teasing,With how much you're complaining, you'd think you'd never been naked before.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:2-3=glad,Some girls are secretive about this stuff. And it's not like you were willing to share your grooming habits until two minutes ago.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zizou,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:5=horny,He hasn't, but I would be curious to see how he did.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=surprised,That might be a little <i>too</i> personal for here, Spider-Woman.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zizou,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=glad,I grant you permission to admire it, but don't even think about worshipping it.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:mean=teasing,Bullies will get no sympathy from me.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=thinking,Maybe I should get a cat.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sayori=tranquil,Gone.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:revy=teasing,Well, you still have the personality of a toilet, but at least you followed through.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_f=thinking,I never took you for the type to shave, Corrin. Did your husband make you do it?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:6=glad,Well, laziness has it's value at times.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:pearl=calm,I always knew my gift of light could be used to make wonderful things!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zone-tan=tranquil,Don't get too excited. You still have Zone-tan's forfeit to look forward to!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=surprised,So you're saying the rest of your tribe doesn't shave either?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:arwen=horny,Now I know why they call elves "the fairer folk".
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=annoyed,Ah, paparazzi. I imagine this must be hard for someone so young like you.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette=thinking,I wouldn't say it's surprising, more... intriguing.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingStage:7=glad,Being able to summon in general is a wonderful thing.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:shimakaze=worried,Maybe I should contact Poseidon to make sure no one's <i>actually</i> dying from this.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=teasing,I dunno, Ochako. This might give you a popularity boost.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jenetta=horny,Fastest crotch reveal yet! Impressive, Jenetta. But also a little sad.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:aella,alsoPlayingStage:6-7=glad,This is the one place where we <i>shouldn't</i> be ashamed. Well, apart from hot springs.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter=thinking,Is that so? Maybe someday.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=surprised,...Did you really just do that?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zizou,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:6=teasing,I'm sure Pit would rather have a blessing from a beautiful goddess.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=surprised,(Doesn't even care that she just shaved. She really is a cat.)
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=horny,So this is what total humiliation looks like.


#lost belts
4-male_chest_will_be_visible=glad,I must admit, my curiosity is causing my mind to run wild...
4-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit,alsoPlaying:kyu=teasing,Absolutely. You should have seen his face after the Rewind Spring incident. He was red for days!
4-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:ryuji=teasing,Let's see what's behind the "zomg".
4-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=surprised,Are you talking about at the Rewind Spring? I was more focused on keeping you alive at the time, you know.
4-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=calm,That coat's pretty impressive. I wouldn't mind having one made for me. Know a good tailor?
4-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:link,targetStage:4=teasing,I always knew it was just an act.
4-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,Oh, no need. Pit already has a black tunic from his time at the Smash tourney.
4-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:futaba=tranquil,I wouldn't get your hopes up if I were you, Futaba.
4-male_chest_is_visible=surprised,Chiseled like the champion of a god!
4-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=thinking,So is that chest of yours a cold metal case or warm like a human's?
4-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=annoyed,Really, you might as well have gone all the way if you had a penis installed.
4-male_chest_is_visible,target:human=teasing,They say humans are the closest to the gods. Even you're good evidence for that claim, ~name~.
4-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit,alsoPlaying:kyu=awkward,You <i>have</i> been really interested in him. Hmm, maybe...
4-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:4-3=glad,He gets way too worked up when it comes to anything robotic in nature. Ignore him.
4-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=thinking,Is there any real purpose for robot nipples? I'm impressed your maker got the details as accurate as they did, though.
4-male_chest_is_visible,target:link=teasing,Hylia chooses her champions well, I see.
4-male_chest_is_visible,target:link,targetStage:5=calm,Good. Those "hyups" were starting to get on my nerve.
4-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:4-7=horny,What's the matter, Pit? Don't you finally want to touch an android?
4-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:futaba=teasing,What robots do you know that have nipples?
4-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=horny,Not bad, Pit. As expected of my finest warrior.
4-male_chest_is_visible,target:ryuji=horny,Putting the "muscle" in "musclehead", I see.
4-male_chest_is_visible,target:ryuji,totalFemales:2-4=awkward,You're selling yourself short. How sad...
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible=tranquil,Ooh, this'll be a treat! Any bets on how big he'll be?
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:futaba=glad,If you could even call it a trick.
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=horny,Guess we get to check and see if your mechanic knew what they were doing...
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ryuji=horny,C'mon, Ryuji. Let's see your "dragon". That's what your name means, right?
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pit=glad,What can I say? A goddess has to have her fun.
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:human=horny,I'm actually really excited to see what the average human's thing looks like...
4-male_small_crotch_is_visible=teasing,Pfffft! ...I'm sorry, that just caught me off-guard.
4-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_m=tranquil,Hahaha! Sorry Corrin, but I'm <i>loving</i> this.
4-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:human=awkward,I'm sorry for your loss.
4-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:fred=teasing,I figured you were compensating for something, but this is worse than I thought.
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=awkward,Is it bad that I'm wondering what that tastes like? Maybe you'll let me find out?
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:pit,count-futaba:1=teasing,Sure, why not? You have my permission to... "get to know them."
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=tranquil,It's natural. As natural as androids get, anyway.
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:futaba=teasing,You're <i>both</i> strange. That's not really a bad thing, though. It's charming.
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit,alsoPlaying:kyu=horny,Perhaps. As long as I can have him back within twenty-four hours.
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=tranquil,Don't worry, Pit. You may not like it now, but I'm sure you'll look back on this day fondly.
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:pit=horny,So it seems. Apologize, Pit.
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s=surprised,Oh! Seems pretty accurate, as far as I know. Kudos.
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:human=calm,Yep, that's a nice looking member right there.
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9,count-halloween_pit:0=surprised,Oh my! Pit, are you alright? She's not hurting you, is she?
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7,count-halloween_pit:0=surprised,Oh my! Pit, are you alright? She's not hurting you, is she?
4-male_large_crotch_is_visible=worried,My goodness, you could pull that thing like a lever!
4-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=awkward,Wow... I bet it shoots farther than the arm of Dhalsim...
4-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=worried,Whoa, whoa! I'm pretty sure <i>most</i> penises shouldn't be the length of a blade, Mettaton.
4-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:human=surprised,Wow, you're not average at all, are you?
4-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryuji=surprised,Oh! That's much bigger than my average soldier. Might even outperform a few gods...
4-female_chest_will_be_visible=calm,Alright ~name~, let's see 'em!
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,filter:exhibitionist=surprised,Wow. You... really have no shame, do you?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=glad,Don't knock it 'til you try it. She might even make some more fitting underwear for you!
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:natsuki=awkward,I think you forgot a period in there... or five.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=worried,If you're going to fight, you should leave those bound, right?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:zoey,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=glad,Someone like Rinkah doesn't understand the meaning of the word modesty.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=surprised,Oh...That's good to hear.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:10,count-zizou:1=thinking,It's not like they're watching this live, though...
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=tranquil,I sense a leak in the near future.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:miko=teasing,Sounds like a bunch of excuses to me, Ms. Hermit.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=thinking,I'd like to see what trick could possibly save you from this.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:spooky=teasing,<i>Come on</i>. Would I laugh?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=annoyed,She does get rather grating after a while.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aella=teasing,Not according to plan, Ms. Tactician?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:3=surprised,I thought nudity was taboo for humans?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=glad,Easy come, easy go.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=glad,Rinkah's from a tribe, but I'm pretty sure it's not an <i>island</i> tribe.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:shimakaze=teasing,I'm curious; how sensitive are they?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=surprised,Oh! You're really using magic... for that. Well.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=awkward,Zone-tan here is even blunter than you, Rinkah!
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:chiaki=thinking,What type of games, exactly?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=tranquil,Don't worry, Rinkah. I already have been!
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:5-8=tranquil,Now <i>this</i> is interesting! How similar will they be to Weiss's, I wonder...
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=awkward,Why? What made you into such a perverted woman?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:revy=teasing,What's the matter? Only able to afford half a set?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:0-6,count-zizou:1=angry,I'm fairly certain at least one person in this room can see the future. How does no one know?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,filter:shy=calm,I believe in you, ~name~. I shall grant you the power to get through this.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:joey,targetStage:4=glad,Tata, bra! Let's see some tatas.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=horny,The whole leotard? You really aren't holding anything back, are you Mika?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:raven=tranquil,We've already had the big reveal. What's one more pair of breasts to the lot?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:aimee,alsoPlayingStage:4-5=angry,While you're at it, don't go shooting my clothes either!
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:sheva=glad,I don't think Sheva herself is a zombie.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:7-8,count-zizou:1=calm,Humans can be so modest. Granted, you two are exceptionally so.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=glad,There's many reserved princesses out there, but Rinkah's about as far as you can get from them.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,alsoPlayingStage:5=thinking,Aren't we in one right now? Or am I overthinking it?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:raven,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=thinking,You're contradicting yourself. Although I have little doubt they really are monsters.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mileena=teasing,Does that even qualify as clothing In the first place?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola=glad,I'm not expecting much. So you really can't let me down!
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:6=thinking,I think that's the wrong game, Rinkah...
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah=horny,Do it! Release them from their binds!
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=calm,You knew all the right plays, didn't you Weiss? Apparently you're much better than you let on...
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:juri=teasing,Let's see if you can match my expectations.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sayori=glad,Can't be helped. The rules are absolute, even to me.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aella,targetNotSaidMarker:AellaStalling=annoyed,Okay, enough stalling. Onto the real thing.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jolyne=calm,On the other hand, there's no better time to get back on your feet!
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:nayru=worried,You have hands, you know...
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:winter=calm,Hey, anything's better than such childish underwear to me.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=teasing,Really, you think I'm here to make enemies? That's just not worth my time. So yeah, call me a friend.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:9,count-zizou:1=horny,You'll have to be more specific, because I see two girls at work here. Which part?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:nayru,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=tranquil,I wonder how the other oracles would react to this. Or even my oracles?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:not_1st,totalExposed:0=glad,There you go.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:gogo=horny,Are you finally putting your money where your mouth is? Now I'm a little excited.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:felicia=surprised,Oh... you were serious?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:marinette=annoyed,You're right, but you didn't have to be so blunt.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:clover,targetStage:5=teasing,Like I said before. Three dots.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan=tranquil,I'm not particularly interested, but go ahead.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:zizou=glad,Being scared is natural, I suppose. But your friend will get you through it.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:alice_mgq=annoyed,...Well. Go on, then.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jenetta=tranquil,I bet a few people here have... although they were probably obscured by fur.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:6=calm,Not everyone can be a Princess Peach. Rinkah's much more of a Magnus, but that's beside the point.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:elaine=glad,...For that exact reason.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jolyne,targetTimeInStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=glad,It's not like she's lying to her self. She's just not in a hurry to admit it.
4-female_small_chest_is_visible=thinking,A bit underdeveloped. I recommend doubling your milk intake going forward.
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:hairy1,targetNotSaidMarker:shave1=teasing,What, your chest size? We knew it was tiny all along, honey.
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:shimakaze=calm,You must either really be enjoying this or feel nothing at all to take so many in a row.
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:zizou,alsoPlaying:pit=thinking,Are there even showers here?
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:meg=calm,I don't know what you were so upset about. There's more to life than breast size, you know. For example, maybe ~player~ is a leg person.
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:spooky,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=calm,Because humans would fear the name <i>Spooky</i>.
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:not_1st,totalExposed:1=thinking,Think of it like... you're blazing a trail. Wait, you lost your blazer, didn't you...
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:spooky=thinking,Okay, great. Can we go back to the game now?
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:sayori=teasing,Really though, what is there to see?
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:spooky,alsoPlaying:elaine,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=teasing,You can't seem to keep ghosts out your hair, Elaine! You should call an exorcist or something.
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:miko=awkward,I thought humans were past showing off their spouses like trophies...
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:raven=calm,Not like I care about seeing naked demon girls anyway. I used to be close with Medusa, after all.
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:raven,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=tranquil,Ooh, a grizzly revenge story! How <i>edgy.</i>
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:natsuki=teasing,I <i>could</i> say a lot... but I won't.
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:spooky,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=annoyed,Stop being cliche, Spooky.
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:spooky,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,Good luck with that. Pit's been finished more times than I can count, but he always comes back.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible=tranquil,Well done! Those are lovely, by the way.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible=horny,Toplessness is a good look on you.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:buffy,alsoPlayingStage:2=glad,Take solace in the fact you have each other.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:5-6=awkward,Must not get compliments very often. Poor thing...
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:juri=thinking,I might have underestimated you, at this rate.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingStage:9=teasing,Then you're just not trying hard enough.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne=thinking,(Yep. No shame anymore now that she's had a chance to get over the shock.)
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=tranquil,She's just being honest to a fault. I'm sure it's not personal.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:4-7=thinking,Little confused by what you mean, Marinette. Jolyne is too, by the looks of it.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:nayru=surprised,Was this planned? I didn't think you were so conniving!
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=teasing,Then you're just not trying hard enough.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=thinking,Curious...
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola=calm,Sure, I've had my fun. I don't need to stare.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:aella,alsoPlayingStage:5-6=awkward,The humiliation of defeat stings far worse than losing these clothes, I agree.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rinkah=calm,I can see why you're the princess now.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:meg,alsoPlayingStage:0=glad,Sounds about as nice as the Lunar Sanctum.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:aella=teasing,Of course it was an accident. Do you think she'd blow a chance to stay in the game longer?
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:jin,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=tranquil,That's probably the best compliment you'll ever get, Jin.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=teasing,What? The toned abs? She hardly seems like the type.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:elaine=annoyed,Maybe don't brandish a knife next time?
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=thinking,You've been hyping them all game, but I don't see the appeal.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jenetta=surprised,You could see the whole time? That's awkward...
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=teasing,Miss Morose has a sexual side after all. Congrats, Jolyne.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=thinking,Only took you this long, huh? Slow for a space pirate.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:mahiru=horny,Don't listen to her, Mahiru. A photographer should be able to take as many pictures as she wants.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:winter=teasing,Topless and... is that a wet spot?
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:2-3=glad,Most woman who come here are... transparent with their motives.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=thinking,I suppose it doesn't matter for someone raised in a jungle anyway.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:sayla,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=glad,What happened to theocracy? Or is that not in style in your worlds?
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_f=teasing,Maybe someday you'll reach Robin's level of tactical prowess. But today is not that day.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sayla=annoyed,In my opinion, this shouldn't be allowed... but I'll let it slide, just so I can rub it in when I win later.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:shego=teasing,Yes, clearly.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:zone-tan=teasing,Zone-tan's a real party girl, huh?...Close your mouth, ~player~.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:ruby=surprised,Wait, hold on. Neo's a mimic?
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:zelda=surprised,So unashamed... guess you've got Farore's courage in you.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:revy=teasing,I'm going to enjoy putting you in your place, you crude girl.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:yang=surprised,Wait, hold on. Neo's a mimic?
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:piper=worried,What a harsh environment to not even be able to get the clothes you need... you have my condolences.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=glad,Never that simple, is it?
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:pauling=horny,(<i>Considering how much she puts out, I'm surprised she never got with the Scout.</i>)
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:mercy=calm,Those are easily an eight. Maybe even better.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:zoey=glad,Maybe pay attention to things right in front of your face next time. Or below.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:zizou=horny,Funny how one word from the goddess turns you into an exhibitionist.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:not_the_best_but=calm,Obviously. But humans probably go wild for them, right?
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=tranquil,I can neither confirm nor deny this.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:isnt_too_bad=teasing,You're lucky I don't care enough to tell them.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=glad,I think you have the wrong idea about this game... you want to <i>keep</i> your underwear on...
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=thinking,Quite the underreaction. Or are you just flustered?
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=teasing,Maybe someone here just has that effect on you, Joetta.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:felicia=calm,She'd <i>have</i> to be good to not even try to hide 'em.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:6=glad,I think your act could use some work.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=glad,I'm pretty sure this Corrin's a married man, but I know what you're getting at.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:raven=tranquil,Methinks the Azarathian is conflicted.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:clover,targetStage:6=annoyed,And just when things were getting interesting with you.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=glad,It's very reminiscint of a hot spring, right?
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:321=thinking,Eh. Underwhelming, really. Not worth a countdown.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:aimee=annoyed,Both this "darlin'" and this Laslow just sound like perverts.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:about_to_see_my_breasts=horny,They're probably just your type, ~player~.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss=teasing,Did you wet yourself out of embarrassment? Amazing. I've never seen a sorrier soldier. Weiss would probably be a better one, at this rate.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:alright_here_i_go=thinking,Good enough. We still have a hat and some panties to go, though!
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:sf=glad,Compared to what I've seen? Not really.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=worried,You sure it didn't hurt you? That one looked awful close.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:nayru,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=thinking,Perhaps. I hope my presence doesn't make you... uncomfortable.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=teasing,You know, I didn't do that because you can't bring it back after the game. Hope you don't mind streaking.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aella=horny,Sloppy sloppy. Even Magnus wouldn't have been so careless.
4-female_large_chest_is_visible=teasing,The men must <i>loooove</i> you, don't they?
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika,alsoPlaying:chun-li=annoyed,(What is it with Street Fighters wanting a big butt? Small or normal ones are fine!)
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:korra=horny,Sorry to stare, but that's the way this game goes...
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:chiaki=glad,Sorry, but that's below me. Ask Pit if you want a rubdown. Nice mole, by the way.
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:chara=tranquil,Guess what they say about drinking milk is true after all!
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:alice_mgq=glad,It's fine. We all know they're fake, anyway.
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:seven=surprised,You're certainly attractive for a space-goer, Seven. Certainly moreso than a space pirate.
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia=thinking,(Surprisingly human-like anatomy...)
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:april=thinking,(<i>Why do I suddenly have a craving for pizza?</i>)
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=glad,What a showwoman! I can respect that.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible=glad,Your most intimate spot will now be shown to the world! No pressure.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=teasing,Her too? <i>That's</i> dedication.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:natsuki,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=awkward,...It's a bit late for that. For both of you.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kyu=glad,The old fashioned-way, huh? At least you'll go home <i>somewhat</i> clothed.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:futaba=glad,It's about as effective as censor bars in the East.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:creepy=horny,Not so tough now that you're about to lose, huh?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sayori=calm,Going, going...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,Maybe I ought to have <i>you</i> wear that, just so you can learn to appreciate it! How about that, Pit?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=worried,...I have no words for what I'm seeing. And smelling.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=thinking,You really love tossing that camera of yours around, don't you?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=glad,Just couldn't wait to drop your panties for us, huh?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jolyne=surprised,Not a very elegant location to write that...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki,targetSaidMarker:mahirucheck,targetNotSaidMarker:mahirucheck2,alsoPlaying:saki,alsoPlayingStage:7=surprised,The three of you certainly became fast friends.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:zizou=teasing,Every part of that sentence was wrong, Sola.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:juri=worried,(She's treating this less like a competition and more like a modeling gig.)
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=glad,Now we'll see for sure how close you two are in body type.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:raven=glad,I don't care either way, but I think Raven might wet herself.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:shimakaze=awkward,How... gruesome.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki,alsoPlaying:pit=angry,She can fight her own fights, Pit. Let her be.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki=teasing,Out of "armor" already, Chiaki? I really expected you to clean house.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:winter=glad,You'll catch a cold if you stay in soaked panties too long. You probably should have removed them sooner.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=horny,I think I can take a good guess as to what it is...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki,alsoPlaying:wiifitfemale=glad,I thought that was obvious from the start.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=glad,Poor Weiss here's about to be scarred for life.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=glad,Consider it a small victory. For you and you alone.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=thinking,Is the curtain necessary? I'm sure at least <i>someone</i> would be into this.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:clover=teasing,Better start believing.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=thinking,And now's not the time to fling hexes...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nayru=annoyed,I almost just wasted a magic spell on you. You could have let us know from the start, at least.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:alice_mgq=glad,Not really much to gain from this. We can see the pubic hair situation and more already.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mahiru,marker:mahirucheck=surprised,Oh! I expected you to be hairier. Or be completely shaved. Just not in between.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:natsuki=annoyed,Any time now.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki,targetSaidMarker:mahirucheck3,alsoPlaying:saki,alsoPlayingStage:9=surprised,The three of you certainly became fast friends.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=calm,Such a skimpy little costume! I have no idea why you heroes think walking around in leotards is a good idea.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon,targetSaidMarker:moon_doesnt_wear_panties=awkward,Well, seeing how you said earlier that you don't wear panties, this can only end one way.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nayru,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=calm,As did everyone else.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki,targetSaidMarker:mahirucheck3,alsoPlaying:saki,alsoPlayingStage:7=surprised,The three of you certainly became fast friends.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=thinking,You really love tossing that camera of yours around, don't you?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:elaine=surprised,Elaine, is that a...?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jenetta=glad,Speedrun time!
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan=glad,I don't care either way, but I think ~player~ might wet themselves.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:miko,targetSaidMarker:LastWordL=tranquil,The best leaders know no fear, it's true.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:sarcasm=teasing,Yes, Kyu. We're all so sorry to put you through this.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette=calm,Come now, have a little more faith in us... no pun intended.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:shave1,targetNotSaidMarker:hairy1=glad,Why yes, Natsuki, we <i>do</i> have the same equipment down there. Even you and I.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:revy=tranquil,Finally! I was getting sick of  your bellyaching, to be honest.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=worried,Is it really in your best interests to fight naked?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:daphne=teasing,Gather round, gang. Let's see- I mean get to, the bottom of this mystery.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki,targetSaidMarker:mahirucheck,targetNotSaidMarker:mahirucheck2,alsoPlaying:saki,alsoPlayingStage:9=surprised,The three of you certainly became fast friends.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:spooky=glad,I'm almost surprised you're following them, to be honest.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:miko,targetSaidMarker:LastWordN=glad,It's not so bad, right?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:miko=calm,Danger! Danger! Not good!
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rinkah=tranquil,Time to see you in your full, mangy glory!
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aella=glad,I bet you wish you weren't so tall now, huh?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sola=surprised,Getting it over with? Fair enough.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=teasing,You just can't keep your modesty, can you Amalia?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:miko,targetSaidMarker:LastWordW=horny,Cheating isn't very becoming of a saint, you know.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,targetSaidMarker:bodysuit,targetNotSaidMarker:bodysuitsolomarinette=teasing,Oh, I see. I don't mind teaching you, but I'd have to teach all of you for the sake of fairness.
4-female_crotch_is_visible=tranquil,It's glistening like blades of grass in the morning. How cute!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:lilith=glad,I'd like to meet whoever came up with <i>that</i> name.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:felicia,alsoPlayingStage:2-4=tranquil,Make sure you don't scratch it!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:alice_mgq=calm,I'm not impressed. No class at all.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7,alsoPlaying:mahiru=tranquil,Excellent, Mahiru. She wants lots of pictures, so don't hold back anymore.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:shantae=awkward,The way you swing your hips is... mesmerizing...
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:spooky,alsoPlaying:chica=tranquil,Hey now, there aren't that many of us "alive" to begin with here!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,Ooh, get her, Pit!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chiaki=horny,I imagine you're the type to... admire my character model. So it's nice to turn the tide.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:juri=surprised,Hairy? That's the first time my intuition's been wrong about you.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:april,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=surprised,I'm pretty sure news teams don't get that close, April!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:kyoko,alsoPlayingStage:0-2=teasing,Really, even a rock could figure <i>that</i> out.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:asuna,alsoPlayingStage:9-10=glad,That's not something any of us should concern ourselves with. Just shave as much as you want.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:do_better=surprised,Maybe focus on the game and not some silly spell and you'll do better.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:5=thinking,Isn't that the point of this? We all come from different eras?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven=teasing,A bra but no bottoms? How risque!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mia=surprised,Ooh, a power play! Well, I won't lose to you, attorney.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:clover=calm,Aw, how cute. You think a wooden axe can harm a goddess.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:felicia,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=glad,I think the idea's a little different for someone like Felicia, though...
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:shego,alsoPlayingStage:8=thinking,Do the tabloids even care about the Flame Tribe?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=tranquil,I think you two'd be cute together! And you're already dressed for the occasion.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:shego,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=glad,No offense, Shego, but you probably can't take Rinkah in a fair fight.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:do_or_die=awkward,I see.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:9s=glad,Maybe he meant the insides?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette=thinking,I wouldn't say it's surprising, more... intriguing.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki=teasing,And here I thought you hated cute stuff.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=calm,Corrin won't talk. For his own sake most of all.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lux=angry,It's not even natural? ...how can you call yourself a warrior of light?!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:saki,targetSaidMarker:mahirucheck,targetNotSaidMarker:mahirucheck2,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingStage:7=surprised,You're taking naked pictures together? Is that an initiation of some sort?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=teasing,Is that an open invitation?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:6=glad,Well, laziness has it's value at times.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:daisy=calm,Oh! Daisy! ...guess you're the genuine article, then.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jolyne=glad,...Or a helpful one.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:xander=horny,I didn't know you were into the average Joes, Winter.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven,alsoPlaying:felicia=glad,Let's just say your both bad at thinking things through.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:pauling=teasing,That body just screams 'Seduce me!', very nice.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:saki,targetSaidMarker:mahirucheck3,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingStage:9=surprised,Are all Hope's Peak students this perverted?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:7=calm,This whole night's been pretty wild, huh?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jenetta=horny,Fastest crotch reveal yet! Impressive, Jenetta. But also a little sad.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:9-10=thinking,Mar? ...Oh! You mean Marinette.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:zizou=calm,From what I've seen from Zizou so far, that was a more tame response than I expected.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingStage:7=glad,Being able to summon in general is a wonderful thing.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sayori=tranquil,Gone.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:ruby=angry,You stop that right now. It's in bad taste.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:april=horny,Not very private when you're showing it off publicly.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:arwen=horny,Now I know why they call elves "the fairer folk".
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:spooky=calm,Yep, <i>very</i> interesting. Aside from the deathly palor, your body isn't that different from a living human's.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rosalina=worried,Seeing a fellow goddess exposed hits a lot closer to home than the others.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:yang=angry,You stop that right now. It's in bad taste.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=surprised,So you're saying the rest of your tribe doesn't shave either?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=teasing,I dunno, Ochako. This might give you a popularity boost.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:down_they_go=horny,You mean you still had it? You were standing here with nothing but that goofy-print underwear.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=calm,Just be thankful this ordeal's almost over.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:shimakaze=worried,Maybe I should contact Poseidon to make sure no one's <i>actually</i> dying from this.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=horny,So this is what total humiliation looks like.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:miko=calm,I thought you already were, but sure, I'll try my best to defeat you.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zelda=teasing,So how's that Triforce of Wisdom working out for you?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chiaki,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=tranquil,Don't even mind taking nude pics together. What nice friends you two are.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=calm,You Schnee sisters really have no shame, huh?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki,alsoPlaying:yuri=glad,Oh my. So you two've seen each other's, then?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chiaki,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=tranquil,Don't even mind taking nude pics together. What nice friends you two are.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=annoyed,Ah, paparazzi. I imagine this must be hard for someone so young like you.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:revy=annoyed,Makes sense. You two are like peas in a pod.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:mean=teasing,Bullies will get no sympathy from me.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:april,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=teasing,Now here's a newscast I'd want to watch.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:may=teasing,Yes, we can definitely tell.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mercy=horny,See? You're no angel. Just a human with a god complex.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:saki,targetSaidMarker:mahirucheck,targetNotSaidMarker:mahirucheck2,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingStage:9=surprised,Are all Hope's Peak students this perverted?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:florina,alsoPlayingStage:8=surprised,Did you have this lotion on you?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:angie,alsoPlayingStage:9-10=teasing,Poor Angie. She's even jealous of the B-listers.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:nagisa=worried,Nagisa, you do what you want. Don't let Winter here try and shave you.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,targetSaidMarker:spacebush,alsoPlaying:meia=calm,I mean, everyone grows 'em. It's just a matter of keeping them.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:elaine=tranquil,They should call you Elaine Marley, Mighty Fine Lady (tm)!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:revy,alsoPlayingStage:3=annoyed,That's pretty much my thoughts exactly. <i>Don't</i>.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=surprised,(Doesn't even care that she just shaved. She really is a cat.)
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:8=calm,That's fine. I'll just take in yours for a bit.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:saki,targetSaidMarker:mahirucheck3,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingStage:7=surprised,You're taking naked pictures together? Is that an initiation of some sort?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:mahiru=tranquil,And there's the icing on the proverbial cake. You should spread that around, Mahiru.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:8=surprised,I think she said something about mugging you?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola=awkward,In other words, cheating.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:2-3=glad,Some girls are secretive about this stuff. And it's not like you were willing to share your grooming habits until two minutes ago.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:faye=thinking,I had no idea shaving was so common with both the lawful <i>and</i> lawless...
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dawn=surprised,I was unaware humans could get natural hair that colorful! Thought it was a god-only thing...
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dawn=horny,Now I'm no expert in house design, but know that yours is very pleasing to the eyes, Dawn.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:princess=teasing,Remember, ~name~: a princess is always inferior to a goddess.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:blake,alsoPlaying:caleb=thinking,So Caleb, how much does a catgirl excite you compared to a human?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter=thinking,Is that so? Maybe someday.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:mei,alsoPlayingStage:7=teasing,You both have wonderful names to joke with. It's a conversation starter. Be thankful.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lara=horny,Guess the "nude code" exists after all!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:aella,alsoPlayingStage:6-7=glad,This is the one place where we <i>shouldn't</i> be ashamed. Well, apart from hot springs.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=worried,How? Through deception or brute force? It seems like a bad time either way...
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:revy=teasing,Well, you still have the personality of a toilet, but at least you followed through.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki,alsoPlaying:florina,count-lyn:1=teasing,Then tell us: who's the lucky recipient?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zizou,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=glad,I grant you permission to admire it, but don't even think about worshipping it.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=teasing,What happened to not making things awkward, hmm?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=teasing,Someone with a questionable origin, that's who.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=horny,I think we've earned our prize, wouldn't you agree?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=surprised,That's a lot of hair down there, ~name~! Have you ever considered shaving some of it? I have a spell I use for that.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:morrigan,alsoPlayingStage:5=glad,To be honest, I prefer it like this. Better than going on a murderous rampage.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:tracer=horny,Ah, <i>there's</i> the butt that broke the Internet.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=angry,Listen, Moon. You may be beyond redemption, but I can still try and help. Let me take you in under my light!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:0-2=calm,It's a nice philosophy. My warriors could use some of that, really.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kyu=calm,Hmm. Yep, exactly as shameless as I've heard.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=tranquil,After a blunder like that, who wouldn't be?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=tranquil,You were looking for a man, right Jura? A lewd picture like that ought to do wonders on the search.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zizou,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:6=teasing,I'm sure Pit would rather have a blessing from a beautiful goddess.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:nayru,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=surprised,...Aren't you going to finish that?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=horny,Ooh! You got something up your non-existant sleeve there, wood girl?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=glad,You show that to any mortal man, and I'm sure you'd have him eating out of the palm of your hand.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:shaved=surprised,It actually looks pretty nice with no hair like that...
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=glad,There we are. Just like I thought. Just gotta get that mask now...
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:wiifitfemale=glad,There's such a thing as too much pride, you know.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aella=teasing,With how much you're complaining, you'd think you'd never been naked before.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven,targetNotSaidMarker:strategic_decision=teasing,With what your wearing? Please. I have my suspicions this was all-too intentional.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:exhibitionist=horny,I think I see why you'd want to show off like you do...
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:5=annoyed,Okay, but did you have to spoil it for the rest of us?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:nayru=calm,Does demonic possession turn you on? Not kink-shaming, just curious.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:2-6=worried,I think you <i>both</i> need your ears checked out.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=thinking,Maybe I should get a cat.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=surprised,...Did you really just do that?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:step_it_up=thinking,(Sounds like a step back to me.)
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:orendi,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=calm,Watching Rinkah fight a monster <i>could</i> be fun...
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah=teasing,Getting worried yet, warrior? You should be.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:pearl=calm,I always knew my gift of light could be used to make wonderful things!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:ginger=horny,Look at you! You're almost as red as your hair!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=calm,Enough of that, Misato. You <i>and</i> Rinkah are doing just fine.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:get_serious_now=thinking,That just sounds silly.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zone-tan=tranquil,Don't get too excited. You still have Zone-tan's forfeit to look forward to!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=tranquil,Glad we're all in agreement that we look pretty cool!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=surprised,I'm shocked you actually went for it... and then flashed us to boot...
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=surprised,That might be a little <i>too</i> personal for here, Spider-Woman.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=teasing,I hope you're proud of your plan. Because I sincerely doubt you can grow back fur instantaneously...
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zizou,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:7=surprised,Don't do it, Pit. She means that <i>very</i> literally.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_f=thinking,I never took you for the type to shave, Corrin. Did your husband make you do it?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:hairy1,targetNotSaidMarker:shave1=thinking,I really don't think that matters, Natsuki.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=calm,Every style has its merits. I encourage you to try them all!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zizou,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:5=horny,He hasn't, but I would be curious to see how he did.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:zoey=horny,Obviously. Who else would fight a war and then play strip poker?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:shantae=glad,She's right, though. Dancing requires a very disciplined physique. One you have already!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:shave1,targetNotSaidMarker:hairy1=calm,No, it's not. It's probably just a little less common than going natural.


#lost stocking
5-male_chest_will_be_visible=tranquil,Take it off at your own pace. The result will be the same in the end, so no need to rush!
5-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:ryuji=teasing,Let's see what's behind the "zomg".
5-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:link,targetStage:4=teasing,I always knew it was just an act.
5-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit,alsoPlaying:kyu=teasing,Absolutely. You should have seen his face after the Rewind Spring incident. He was red for days!
5-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,Oh, no need. Pit already has a black tunic from his time at the Smash tourney.
5-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:futaba=tranquil,I wouldn't get your hopes up if I were you, Futaba.
5-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=calm,That coat's pretty impressive. I wouldn't mind having one made for me. Know a good tailor?
5-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=surprised,Are you talking about at the Rewind Spring? I was more focused on keeping you alive at the time, you know.
5-male_chest_is_visible=surprised,I'm impressed at how fit you are! Your demeanor totally threw me off.
5-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:5-3=glad,He gets way too worked up when it comes to anything robotic in nature. Ignore him.
5-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:futaba=teasing,What robots do you know that have nipples?
5-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:5-7=horny,What's the matter, Pit? Don't you finally want to touch an android?
5-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit,alsoPlaying:kyu=awkward,You <i>have</i> been really interested in him. Hmm, maybe...
5-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=horny,Not bad, Pit. As expected of my finest warrior.
5-male_chest_is_visible,target:ryuji=horny,Putting the "muscle" in "musclehead", I see.
5-male_chest_is_visible,target:ryuji,totalFemales:2-4=awkward,You're selling yourself short. How sad...
5-male_chest_is_visible,target:link=teasing,Hylia chooses her champions well, I see.
5-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=annoyed,Really, you might as well have gone all the way if you had a penis installed.
5-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=thinking,Is there any real purpose for robot nipples? I'm impressed your maker got the details as accurate as they did, though.
5-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=thinking,So is that chest of yours a cold metal case or warm like a human's?
5-male_chest_is_visible,target:link,targetStage:5=calm,Good. Those "hyups" were starting to get on my nerve.
5-male_chest_is_visible,target:human=teasing,They say humans are the closest to the gods. Even you're good evidence for that claim, ~name~.
5-male_crotch_will_be_visible=calm,It's been a long journey, but now let's deal the killer blow!
5-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ryuji=horny,C'mon, Ryuji. Let's see your "dragon". That's what your name means, right?
5-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:human=horny,I'm actually really excited to see what the average human's thing looks like...
5-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:futaba=glad,If you could even call it a trick.
5-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pit=glad,What can I say? A goddess has to have her fun.
5-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=horny,Guess we get to check and see if your mechanic knew what they were doing...
5-male_small_crotch_is_visible=glad,My mind must be playing tricks on me.
5-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_m=tranquil,Hahaha! Sorry Corrin, but I'm <i>loving</i> this.
5-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:human=awkward,I'm sorry for your loss.
5-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:fred=teasing,I figured you were compensating for something, but this is worse than I thought.
5-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=teasing,Well, there it is. And you're <i>very</i> eager, by the look of it.
5-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:pit,count-futaba:1=teasing,Sure, why not? You have my permission to... "get to know them."
5-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:pit=horny,So it seems. Apologize, Pit.
5-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s=surprised,Oh! Seems pretty accurate, as far as I know. Kudos.
5-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7,count-halloween_pit:0=surprised,Oh my! Pit, are you alright? She's not hurting you, is she?
5-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:futaba=teasing,You're <i>both</i> strange. That's not really a bad thing, though. It's charming.
5-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit,alsoPlaying:kyu=horny,Perhaps. As long as I can have him back within twenty-four hours.
5-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:human=calm,Yep, that's a nice looking member right there.
5-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=tranquil,Don't worry, Pit. You may not like it now, but I'm sure you'll look back on this day fondly.
5-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=tranquil,It's natural. As natural as androids get, anyway.
5-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9,count-halloween_pit:0=surprised,Oh my! Pit, are you alright? She's not hurting you, is she?
5-male_large_crotch_is_visible=worried,Doesn't that hurt you?
5-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryuji=surprised,Oh! That's much bigger than my average soldier. Might even outperform a few gods...
5-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:human=surprised,Wow, you're not average at all, are you?
5-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=worried,Whoa, whoa! I'm pretty sure <i>most</i> penises shouldn't be the length of a blade, Mettaton.
5-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=awkward,Wow... I bet it shoots farther than the arm of Dhalsim...
5-female_chest_will_be_visible=tranquil,There's something immensely satisfying about beating the clothes off your backs. Or chest, in this case.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:chiaki=thinking,What type of games, exactly?
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:spooky=teasing,<i>Come on</i>. Would I laugh?
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:winter=calm,Hey, anything's better than such childish underwear to me.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:juri=teasing,Let's see if you can match my expectations.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:elaine=glad,...For that exact reason.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=glad,There's many reserved princesses out there, but Rinkah's about as far as you can get from them.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=horny,The whole leotard? You really aren't holding anything back, are you Mika?
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:10,count-zizou:1=thinking,It's not like they're watching this live, though...
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:6=calm,Not everyone can be a Princess Peach. Rinkah's much more of a Magnus, but that's beside the point.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=teasing,Really, you think I'm here to make enemies? That's just not worth my time. So yeah, call me a friend.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=surprised,Oh! You're really using magic... for that. Well.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=awkward,Why? What made you into such a perverted woman?
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:0-6,count-zizou:1=angry,I'm fairly certain at least one person in this room can see the future. How does no one know?
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=tranquil,Don't worry, Rinkah. I already have been!
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:clover,targetStage:5=teasing,Like I said before. Three dots.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sayori=glad,Can't be helped. The rules are absolute, even to me.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:zizou=glad,Being scared is natural, I suppose. But your friend will get you through it.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:9,count-zizou:1=horny,You'll have to be more specific, because I see two girls at work here. Which part?
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=glad,Rinkah's from a tribe, but I'm pretty sure it's not an <i>island</i> tribe.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:raven=tranquil,We've already had the big reveal. What's one more pair of breasts to the lot?
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:revy=teasing,What's the matter? Only able to afford half a set?
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=calm,You knew all the right plays, didn't you Weiss? Apparently you're much better than you let on...
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:shimakaze=teasing,I'm curious; how sensitive are they?
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:joey,targetStage:4=glad,Tata, bra! Let's see some tatas.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:5-8=tranquil,Now <i>this</i> is interesting! How similar will they be to Weiss's, I wonder...
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:miko=teasing,Sounds like a bunch of excuses to me, Ms. Hermit.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jenetta=tranquil,I bet a few people here have... although they were probably obscured by fur.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola=glad,I'm not expecting much. So you really can't let me down!
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,filter:shy=calm,I believe in you, ~name~. I shall grant you the power to get through this.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:nayru,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=tranquil,I wonder how the other oracles would react to this. Or even my oracles?
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=awkward,Zone-tan here is even blunter than you, Rinkah!
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:gogo=horny,Are you finally putting your money where your mouth is? Now I'm a little excited.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:marinette=annoyed,You're right, but you didn't have to be so blunt.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=annoyed,She does get rather grating after a while.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:felicia=surprised,Oh... you were serious?
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah=horny,Do it! Release them from their binds!
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=thinking,I'd like to see what trick could possibly save you from this.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:sheva=glad,I don't think Sheva herself is a zombie.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aella=teasing,Not according to plan, Ms. Tactician?
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:natsuki=awkward,I think you forgot a period in there... or five.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aella,targetNotSaidMarker:AellaStalling=annoyed,Okay, enough stalling. Onto the real thing.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:raven,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=thinking,You're contradicting yourself. Although I have little doubt they really are monsters.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,filter:exhibitionist=surprised,Wow. You... really have no shame, do you?
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:3=surprised,I thought nudity was taboo for humans?
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=worried,If you're going to fight, you should leave those bound, right?
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:aimee,alsoPlayingStage:5-5=angry,While you're at it, don't go shooting my clothes either!
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mileena=teasing,Does that even qualify as clothing In the first place?
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:nayru=worried,You have hands, you know...
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=glad,Don't knock it 'til you try it. She might even make some more fitting underwear for you!
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:not_1st,totalExposed:0=glad,There you go.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,alsoPlayingStage:5=thinking,Aren't we in one right now? Or am I overthinking it?
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:zoey,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=glad,Someone like Rinkah doesn't understand the meaning of the word modesty.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jolyne=calm,On the other hand, there's no better time to get back on your feet!
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=tranquil,I sense a leak in the near future.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan=tranquil,I'm not particularly interested, but go ahead.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:alice_mgq=annoyed,...Well. Go on, then.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jolyne,targetTimeInStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=glad,It's not like she's lying to her self. She's just not in a hurry to admit it.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:6=thinking,I think that's the wrong game, Rinkah...
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:7-8,count-zizou:1=calm,Humans can be so modest. Granted, you two are exceptionally so.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=glad,Easy come, easy go.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=surprised,Oh...That's good to hear.
5-female_small_chest_is_visible=glad,Well, not everyone is blessed to have an amazing chest.
5-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:spooky,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=annoyed,Stop being cliche, Spooky.
5-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:spooky,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,Good luck with that. Pit's been finished more times than I can count, but he always comes back.
5-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:raven=calm,Not like I care about seeing naked demon girls anyway. I used to be close with Medusa, after all.
5-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:sayori=teasing,Really though, what is there to see?
5-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:spooky,alsoPlaying:elaine,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=teasing,You can't seem to keep ghosts out your hair, Elaine! You should call an exorcist or something.
5-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:shimakaze=calm,You must either really be enjoying this or feel nothing at all to take so many in a row.
5-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:natsuki=teasing,I <i>could</i> say a lot... but I won't.
5-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:meg=calm,I don't know what you were so upset about. There's more to life than breast size, you know. For example, maybe ~player~ is a leg person.
5-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:raven,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=tranquil,Ooh, a grizzly revenge story! How <i>edgy.</i>
5-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:not_1st,totalExposed:1=thinking,Think of it like... you're blazing a trail. Wait, you lost your blazer, didn't you...
5-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:spooky,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=calm,Because humans would fear the name <i>Spooky</i>.
5-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:miko=awkward,I thought humans were past showing off their spouses like trophies...
5-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:hairy1,targetNotSaidMarker:shave1=teasing,What, your chest size? We knew it was tiny all along, honey.
5-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:spooky=thinking,Okay, great. Can we go back to the game now?
5-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:zizou,alsoPlaying:pit=thinking,Are there even showers here?
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible=calm,For what it's worth, I still think you have a shot, ~name~.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible=awkward,This whole situation is quite...captivating.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible=horny,How's it feel being the center of attention?
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=teasing,Miss Morose has a sexual side after all. Congrats, Jolyne.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:6=glad,I think your act could use some work.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sayla=annoyed,In my opinion, this shouldn't be allowed... but I'll let it slide, just so I can rub it in when I win later.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rinkah=calm,I can see why you're the princess now.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=worried,You sure it didn't hurt you? That one looked awful close.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:meg,alsoPlayingStage:0=glad,Sounds about as nice as the Lunar Sanctum.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=thinking,I suppose it doesn't matter for someone raised in a jungle anyway.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:sayla,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=glad,What happened to theocracy? Or is that not in style in your worlds?
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=teasing,Maybe someone here just has that effect on you, Joetta.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:felicia=calm,She'd <i>have</i> to be good to not even try to hide 'em.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=thinking,Quite the underreaction. Or are you just flustered?
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:juri=thinking,I might have underestimated you, at this rate.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_f=teasing,Maybe someday you'll reach Robin's level of tactical prowess. But today is not that day.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:mercy=calm,Those are easily an eight. Maybe even better.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=thinking,Only took you this long, huh? Slow for a space pirate.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:mahiru=horny,Don't listen to her, Mahiru. A photographer should be able to take as many pictures as she wants.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:aella=teasing,Of course it was an accident. Do you think she'd blow a chance to stay in the game longer?
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jenetta=surprised,You could see the whole time? That's awkward...
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=teasing,Then you're just not trying hard enough.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=thinking,Curious...
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=glad,I think you have the wrong idea about this game... you want to <i>keep</i> your underwear on...
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=glad,Never that simple, is it?
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingStage:9=teasing,Then you're just not trying hard enough.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:zoey=glad,Maybe pay attention to things right in front of your face next time. Or below.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:jin,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=tranquil,That's probably the best compliment you'll ever get, Jin.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:raven=tranquil,Methinks the Azarathian is conflicted.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:winter=teasing,Topless and... is that a wet spot?
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:elaine=annoyed,Maybe don't brandish a knife next time?
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=thinking,You've been hyping them all game, but I don't see the appeal.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:321=thinking,Eh. Underwhelming, really. Not worth a countdown.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:zizou=horny,Funny how one word from the goddess turns you into an exhibitionist.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=tranquil,I can neither confirm nor deny this.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=glad,It's very reminiscint of a hot spring, right?
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:ruby=surprised,Wait, hold on. Neo's a mimic?
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:sf=glad,Compared to what I've seen? Not really.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:not_the_best_but=calm,Obviously. But humans probably go wild for them, right?
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:revy=teasing,I'm going to enjoy putting you in your place, you crude girl.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:2-3=glad,Most woman who come here are... transparent with their motives.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:zelda=surprised,So unashamed... guess you've got Farore's courage in you.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:aimee=annoyed,Both this "darlin'" and this Laslow just sound like perverts.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=tranquil,She's just being honest to a fault. I'm sure it's not personal.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:yang=surprised,Wait, hold on. Neo's a mimic?
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aella=horny,Sloppy sloppy. Even Magnus wouldn't have been so careless.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:buffy,alsoPlayingStage:2=glad,Take solace in the fact you have each other.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:about_to_see_my_breasts=horny,They're probably just your type, ~player~.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne=thinking,(Yep. No shame anymore now that she's had a chance to get over the shock.)
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:5-6=awkward,Must not get compliments very often. Poor thing...
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:piper=worried,What a harsh environment to not even be able to get the clothes you need... you have my condolences.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:isnt_too_bad=teasing,You're lucky I don't care enough to tell them.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:nayru,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=thinking,Perhaps. I hope my presence doesn't make you... uncomfortable.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola=calm,Sure, I've had my fun. I don't need to stare.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=teasing,What? The toned abs? She hardly seems like the type.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=glad,I'm pretty sure this Corrin's a married man, but I know what you're getting at.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:alright_here_i_go=thinking,Good enough. We still have a hat and some panties to go, though!
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:4-7=thinking,Little confused by what you mean, Marinette. Jolyne is too, by the looks of it.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=teasing,You know, I didn't do that because you can't bring it back after the game. Hope you don't mind streaking.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:shego=teasing,Yes, clearly.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:clover,targetStage:6=annoyed,And just when things were getting interesting with you.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:aella,alsoPlayingStage:5-6=awkward,The humiliation of defeat stings far worse than losing these clothes, I agree.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:pauling=horny,(<i>Considering how much she puts out, I'm surprised she never got with the Scout.</i>)
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:zone-tan=teasing,Zone-tan's a real party girl, huh?...Close your mouth, ~player~.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss=teasing,Did you wet yourself out of embarrassment? Amazing. I've never seen a sorrier soldier. Weiss would probably be a better one, at this rate.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:nayru=surprised,Was this planned? I didn't think you were so conniving!
5-female_large_chest_is_visible=annoyed,I dunno, those are too "in-your-face", in my opinion.
5-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:april=thinking,(<i>Why do I suddenly have a craving for pizza?</i>)
5-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=glad,What a showwoman! I can respect that.
5-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia=thinking,(Surprisingly human-like anatomy...)
5-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:korra=horny,Sorry to stare, but that's the way this game goes...
5-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:chiaki=glad,Sorry, but that's below me. Ask Pit if you want a rubdown. Nice mole, by the way.
5-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:seven=surprised,You're certainly attractive for a space-goer, Seven. Certainly moreso than a space pirate.
5-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:alice_mgq=glad,It's fine. We all know they're fake, anyway.
5-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika,alsoPlaying:chun-li=annoyed,(What is it with Street Fighters wanting a big butt? Small or normal ones are fine!)
5-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:chara=tranquil,Guess what they say about drinking milk is true after all!
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible=teasing,Normally Pit's the one to inspect suspicious holes, but guess that's my job today!
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:juri=worried,(She's treating this less like a competition and more like a modeling gig.)
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:shimakaze=awkward,How... gruesome.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:miko,targetSaidMarker:LastWordW=horny,Cheating isn't very becoming of a saint, you know.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:natsuki=annoyed,Any time now.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:revy=tranquil,Finally! I was getting sick of  your bellyaching, to be honest.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=calm,Such a skimpy little costume! I have no idea why you heroes think walking around in leotards is a good idea.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:elaine=surprised,Elaine, is that a...?
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:miko=calm,Danger! Danger! Not good!
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:spooky=glad,I'm almost surprised you're following them, to be honest.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jenetta=glad,Speedrun time!
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mahiru,marker:mahirucheck=surprised,Oh! I expected you to be hairier. Or be completely shaved. Just not in between.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=worried,...I have no words for what I'm seeing. And smelling.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nayru=annoyed,I almost just wasted a magic spell on you. You could have let us know from the start, at least.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kyu=glad,The old fashioned-way, huh? At least you'll go home <i>somewhat</i> clothed.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette=calm,Come now, have a little more faith in us... no pun intended.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rinkah=tranquil,Time to see you in your full, mangy glory!
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki=teasing,Out of "armor" already, Chiaki? I really expected you to clean house.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sola=surprised,Getting it over with? Fair enough.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=teasing,Her too? <i>That's</i> dedication.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan=glad,I don't care either way, but I think ~player~ might wet themselves.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:creepy=horny,Not so tough now that you're about to lose, huh?
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aella=glad,I bet you wish you weren't so tall now, huh?
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=thinking,Is the curtain necessary? I'm sure at least <i>someone</i> would be into this.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:winter=glad,You'll catch a cold if you stay in soaked panties too long. You probably should have removed them sooner.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:daphne=teasing,Gather round, gang. Let's see- I mean get to, the bottom of this mystery.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jolyne=surprised,Not a very elegant location to write that...
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:alice_mgq=glad,Not really much to gain from this. We can see the pubic hair situation and more already.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:clover=teasing,Better start believing.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sayori=calm,Going, going...
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:miko,targetSaidMarker:LastWordN=glad,It's not so bad, right?
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,targetSaidMarker:bodysuit,targetNotSaidMarker:bodysuitsolomarinette=teasing,Oh, I see. I don't mind teaching you, but I'd have to teach all of you for the sake of fairness.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=teasing,You just can't keep your modesty, can you Amalia?
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=glad,Just couldn't wait to drop your panties for us, huh?
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,Maybe I ought to have <i>you</i> wear that, just so you can learn to appreciate it! How about that, Pit?
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:futaba=glad,It's about as effective as censor bars in the East.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=horny,I think I can take a good guess as to what it is...
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:zizou=teasing,Every part of that sentence was wrong, Sola.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=glad,Consider it a small victory. For you and you alone.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki,alsoPlaying:wiifitfemale=glad,I thought that was obvious from the start.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki,alsoPlaying:pit=angry,She can fight her own fights, Pit. Let her be.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:raven=glad,I don't care either way, but I think Raven might wet herself.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=glad,Now we'll see for sure how close you two are in body type.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=glad,Poor Weiss here's about to be scarred for life.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=thinking,And now's not the time to fling hexes...
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:natsuki,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=awkward,...It's a bit late for that. For both of you.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=thinking,You really love tossing that camera of yours around, don't you?
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki,targetSaidMarker:mahirucheck,targetNotSaidMarker:mahirucheck2,alsoPlaying:saki,alsoPlayingStage:7=surprised,The three of you certainly became fast friends.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki,targetSaidMarker:mahirucheck,targetNotSaidMarker:mahirucheck2,alsoPlaying:saki,alsoPlayingStage:9=surprised,The three of you certainly became fast friends.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=thinking,You really love tossing that camera of yours around, don't you?
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki,targetSaidMarker:mahirucheck3,alsoPlaying:saki,alsoPlayingStage:7=surprised,The three of you certainly became fast friends.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki,targetSaidMarker:mahirucheck3,alsoPlaying:saki,alsoPlayingStage:9=surprised,The three of you certainly became fast friends.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:shave1,targetNotSaidMarker:hairy1=glad,Why yes, Natsuki, we <i>do</i> have the same equipment down there. Even you and I.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:sarcasm=teasing,Yes, Kyu. We're all so sorry to put you through this.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=worried,Is it really in your best interests to fight naked?
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nayru,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=calm,As did everyone else.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:miko,targetSaidMarker:LastWordL=tranquil,The best leaders know no fear, it's true.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon,targetSaidMarker:moon_doesnt_wear_panties=awkward,Well, seeing how you said earlier that you don't wear panties, this can only end one way.
5-female_crotch_is_visible=thinking,Let's see...decent shape, healthy color...overall, everything's looking pretty good.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:clover=calm,Aw, how cute. You think a wooden axe can harm a goddess.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=calm,Every style has its merits. I encourage you to try them all!
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:step_it_up=thinking,(Sounds like a step back to me.)
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah=teasing,Getting worried yet, warrior? You should be.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:mei,alsoPlayingStage:7=teasing,You both have wonderful names to joke with. It's a conversation starter. Be thankful.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven,targetNotSaidMarker:strategic_decision=teasing,With what your wearing? Please. I have my suspicions this was all-too intentional.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=tranquil,Glad we're all in agreement that we look pretty cool!
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:nayru,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=surprised,...Aren't you going to finish that?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:mean=teasing,Bullies will get no sympathy from me.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7,alsoPlaying:mahiru=tranquil,Excellent, Mahiru. She wants lots of pictures, so don't hold back anymore.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lux=angry,It's not even natural? ...how can you call yourself a warrior of light?!
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:daisy=calm,Oh! Daisy! ...guess you're the genuine article, then.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:kyoko,alsoPlayingStage:0-2=teasing,Really, even a rock could figure <i>that</i> out.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:aella,alsoPlayingStage:6-7=glad,This is the one place where we <i>shouldn't</i> be ashamed. Well, apart from hot springs.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mia=surprised,Ooh, a power play! Well, I won't lose to you, attorney.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:saki,targetSaidMarker:mahirucheck,targetNotSaidMarker:mahirucheck2,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingStage:9=surprised,Are all Hope's Peak students this perverted?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:8=surprised,I think she said something about mugging you?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:elaine=tranquil,They should call you Elaine Marley, Mighty Fine Lady (tm)!
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:saki,targetSaidMarker:mahirucheck3,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingStage:7=surprised,You're taking naked pictures together? Is that an initiation of some sort?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dawn=surprised,I was unaware humans could get natural hair that colorful! Thought it was a god-only thing...
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dawn=horny,Now I'm no expert in house design, but know that yours is very pleasing to the eyes, Dawn.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:pauling=teasing,That body just screams 'Seduce me!', very nice.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:saki,targetSaidMarker:mahirucheck3,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingStage:9=surprised,Are all Hope's Peak students this perverted?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:7=calm,This whole night's been pretty wild, huh?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rosalina=worried,Seeing a fellow goddess exposed hits a lot closer to home than the others.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:saki,targetSaidMarker:mahirucheck,targetNotSaidMarker:mahirucheck2,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingStage:7=surprised,You're taking naked pictures together? Is that an initiation of some sort?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:get_serious_now=thinking,That just sounds silly.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:down_they_go=horny,You mean you still had it? You were standing here with nothing but that goofy-print underwear.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:9-10=thinking,Mar? ...Oh! You mean Marinette.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=calm,You Schnee sisters really have no shame, huh?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=horny,So this is what total humiliation looks like.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:shimakaze=worried,Maybe I should contact Poseidon to make sure no one's <i>actually</i> dying from this.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:lilith=glad,I'd like to meet whoever came up with <i>that</i> name.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sayori=tranquil,Gone.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,Ooh, get her, Pit!
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:revy,alsoPlayingStage:3=annoyed,That's pretty much my thoughts exactly. <i>Don't</i>.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingStage:7=glad,Being able to summon in general is a wonderful thing.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jenetta=horny,Fastest crotch reveal yet! Impressive, Jenetta. But also a little sad.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:wiifitfemale=glad,There's such a thing as too much pride, you know.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:orendi,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=calm,Watching Rinkah fight a monster <i>could</i> be fun...
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:zoey=horny,Obviously. Who else would fight a war and then play strip poker?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:nayru=calm,Does demonic possession turn you on? Not kink-shaming, just curious.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=teasing,Someone with a questionable origin, that's who.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=surprised,I'm shocked you actually went for it... and then flashed us to boot...
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=horny,Ooh! You got something up your non-existant sleeve there, wood girl?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:morrigan,alsoPlayingStage:5=glad,To be honest, I prefer it like this. Better than going on a murderous rampage.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=horny,I think we've earned our prize, wouldn't you agree?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:hairy1,targetNotSaidMarker:shave1=thinking,I really don't think that matters, Natsuki.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:shaved=surprised,It actually looks pretty nice with no hair like that...
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=calm,Enough of that, Misato. You <i>and</i> Rinkah are doing just fine.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:revy=teasing,Well, you still have the personality of a toilet, but at least you followed through.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:shave1,targetNotSaidMarker:hairy1=calm,No, it's not. It's probably just a little less common than going natural.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:do_better=surprised,Maybe focus on the game and not some silly spell and you'll do better.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:do_or_die=awkward,I see.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chiaki,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=tranquil,Don't even mind taking nude pics together. What nice friends you two are.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:2-3=glad,Some girls are secretive about this stuff. And it's not like you were willing to share your grooming habits until two minutes ago.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zelda=teasing,So how's that Triforce of Wisdom working out for you?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chiaki,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=tranquil,Don't even mind taking nude pics together. What nice friends you two are.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:pearl=calm,I always knew my gift of light could be used to make wonderful things!
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=angry,Listen, Moon. You may be beyond redemption, but I can still try and help. Let me take you in under my light!
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zizou,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:5=horny,He hasn't, but I would be curious to see how he did.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:exhibitionist=horny,I think I see why you'd want to show off like you do...
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=surprised,...Did you really just do that?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:angie,alsoPlayingStage:9-10=teasing,Poor Angie. She's even jealous of the B-listers.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zizou,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:6=teasing,I'm sure Pit would rather have a blessing from a beautiful goddess.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:5=annoyed,Okay, but did you have to spoil it for the rest of us?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aella=teasing,With how much you're complaining, you'd think you'd never been naked before.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kyu=calm,Hmm. Yep, exactly as shameless as I've heard.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zizou,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:7=surprised,Don't do it, Pit. She means that <i>very</i> literally.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=glad,There we are. Just like I thought. Just gotta get that mask now...
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=tranquil,After a blunder like that, who wouldn't be?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:florina,alsoPlayingStage:8=surprised,Did you have this lotion on you?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:0-2=calm,It's a nice philosophy. My warriors could use some of that, really.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:ginger=horny,Look at you! You're almost as red as your hair!
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=teasing,I hope you're proud of your plan. Because I sincerely doubt you can grow back fur instantaneously...
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:2-6=worried,I think you <i>both</i> need your ears checked out.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mercy=horny,See? You're no angel. Just a human with a god complex.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chiaki=horny,I imagine you're the type to... admire my character model. So it's nice to turn the tide.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=tranquil,I think you two'd be cute together! And you're already dressed for the occasion.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:asuna,alsoPlayingStage:9-10=glad,That's not something any of us should concern ourselves with. Just shave as much as you want.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki=teasing,And here I thought you hated cute stuff.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:juri=surprised,Hairy? That's the first time my intuition's been wrong about you.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:felicia,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=glad,I think the idea's a little different for someone like Felicia, though...
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jolyne=glad,...Or a helpful one.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:felicia,alsoPlayingStage:2-4=tranquil,Make sure you don't scratch it!
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zizou,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=glad,I grant you permission to admire it, but don't even think about worshipping it.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:6=glad,Well, laziness has it's value at times.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:spooky=calm,Yep, <i>very</i> interesting. Aside from the deathly palor, your body isn't that different from a living human's.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=teasing,I dunno, Ochako. This might give you a popularity boost.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=surprised,So you're saying the rest of your tribe doesn't shave either?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola=awkward,In other words, cheating.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:princess=teasing,Remember, ~name~: a princess is always inferior to a goddess.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:arwen=horny,Now I know why they call elves "the fairer folk".
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=annoyed,Ah, paparazzi. I imagine this must be hard for someone so young like you.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lara=horny,Guess the "nude code" exists after all!
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:may=teasing,Yes, we can definitely tell.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:april,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=teasing,Now here's a newscast I'd want to watch.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=calm,Corrin won't talk. For his own sake most of all.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven=teasing,A bra but no bottoms? How risque!
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:8=calm,That's fine. I'll just take in yours for a bit.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:april,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=surprised,I'm pretty sure news teams don't get that close, April!
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:shantae=awkward,The way you swing your hips is... mesmerizing...
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=glad,You show that to any mortal man, and I'm sure you'd have him eating out of the palm of your hand.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:tracer=horny,Ah, <i>there's</i> the butt that broke the Internet.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=tranquil,You were looking for a man, right Jura? A lewd picture like that ought to do wonders on the search.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=surprised,That might be a little <i>too</i> personal for here, Spider-Woman.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zone-tan=tranquil,Don't get too excited. You still have Zone-tan's forfeit to look forward to!
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=thinking,Maybe I should get a cat.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter=thinking,Is that so? Maybe someday.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette=thinking,I wouldn't say it's surprising, more... intriguing.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=surprised,That's a lot of hair down there, ~name~! Have you ever considered shaving some of it? I have a spell I use for that.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=surprised,(Doesn't even care that she just shaved. She really is a cat.)
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_f=thinking,I never took you for the type to shave, Corrin. Did your husband make you do it?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:5=thinking,Isn't that the point of this? We all come from different eras?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:shantae=glad,She's right, though. Dancing requires a very disciplined physique. One you have already!
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=worried,How? Through deception or brute force? It seems like a bad time either way...
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:blake,alsoPlaying:caleb=thinking,So Caleb, how much does a catgirl excite you compared to a human?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=calm,Just be thankful this ordeal's almost over.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:revy=annoyed,Makes sense. You two are like peas in a pod.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven,alsoPlaying:felicia=glad,Let's just say your both bad at thinking things through.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:nagisa=worried,Nagisa, you do what you want. Don't let Winter here try and shave you.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:xander=horny,I didn't know you were into the average Joes, Winter.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:yang=angry,You stop that right now. It's in bad taste.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:spooky,alsoPlaying:chica=tranquil,Hey now, there aren't that many of us "alive" to begin with here!
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:ruby=angry,You stop that right now. It's in bad taste.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,targetSaidMarker:spacebush,alsoPlaying:meia=calm,I mean, everyone grows 'em. It's just a matter of keeping them.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:9s=glad,Maybe he meant the insides?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki,alsoPlaying:florina,count-lyn:1=teasing,Then tell us: who's the lucky recipient?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=teasing,What happened to not making things awkward, hmm?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:april=horny,Not very private when you're showing it off publicly.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:shego,alsoPlayingStage:8=thinking,Do the tabloids even care about the Flame Tribe?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=teasing,Is that an open invitation?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki,alsoPlaying:yuri=glad,Oh my. So you two've seen each other's, then?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:zizou=calm,From what I've seen from Zizou so far, that was a more tame response than I expected.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:faye=thinking,I had no idea shaving was so common with both the lawful <i>and</i> lawless...
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:miko=calm,I thought you already were, but sure, I'll try my best to defeat you.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:alice_mgq=calm,I'm not impressed. No class at all.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:shego,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=glad,No offense, Shego, but you probably can't take Rinkah in a fair fight.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:mahiru=tranquil,And there's the icing on the proverbial cake. You should spread that around, Mahiru.


#lost dress
6-male_chest_will_be_visible=annoyed,Why do I feel you're getting the better end of the deal...
6-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit,alsoPlaying:kyu=teasing,Absolutely. You should have seen his face after the Rewind Spring incident. He was red for days!
6-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:futaba=tranquil,I wouldn't get your hopes up if I were you, Futaba.
6-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:ryuji=teasing,Let's see what's behind the "zomg".
6-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:link,targetStage:4=teasing,I always knew it was just an act.
6-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,Oh, no need. Pit already has a black tunic from his time at the Smash tourney.
6-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=surprised,Are you talking about at the Rewind Spring? I was more focused on keeping you alive at the time, you know.
6-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=calm,That coat's pretty impressive. I wouldn't mind having one made for me. Know a good tailor?
6-male_chest_is_visible=awkward,What a cruel sense of humor this game has, putting that in front of me.
6-male_chest_is_visible,target:link,targetStage:5=calm,Good. Those "hyups" were starting to get on my nerve.
6-male_chest_is_visible,target:link=teasing,Hylia chooses her champions well, I see.
6-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:6-7=horny,What's the matter, Pit? Don't you finally want to touch an android?
6-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:6-3=glad,He gets way too worked up when it comes to anything robotic in nature. Ignore him.
6-male_chest_is_visible,target:ryuji=horny,Putting the "muscle" in "musclehead", I see.
6-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=horny,Not bad, Pit. As expected of my finest warrior.
6-male_chest_is_visible,target:human=teasing,They say humans are the closest to the gods. Even you're good evidence for that claim, ~name~.
6-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:futaba=teasing,What robots do you know that have nipples?
6-male_chest_is_visible,target:ryuji,totalFemales:2-4=awkward,You're selling yourself short. How sad...
6-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=thinking,Is there any real purpose for robot nipples? I'm impressed your maker got the details as accurate as they did, though.
6-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=thinking,So is that chest of yours a cold metal case or warm like a human's?
6-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=annoyed,Really, you might as well have gone all the way if you had a penis installed.
6-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit,alsoPlaying:kyu=awkward,You <i>have</i> been really interested in him. Hmm, maybe...
6-male_crotch_will_be_visible=calm,Thank goodness! At least I'm getting <i>something</i> for my troubles.
6-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ryuji=horny,C'mon, Ryuji. Let's see your "dragon". That's what your name means, right?
6-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pit=glad,What can I say? A goddess has to have her fun.
6-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=horny,Guess we get to check and see if your mechanic knew what they were doing...
6-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:human=horny,I'm actually really excited to see what the average human's thing looks like...
6-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:futaba=glad,If you could even call it a trick.
6-male_small_crotch_is_visible=surprised,Seriously? Talk about short end of the stick...
6-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:human=awkward,I'm sorry for your loss.
6-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_m=tranquil,Hahaha! Sorry Corrin, but I'm <i>loving</i> this.
6-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:fred=teasing,I figured you were compensating for something, but this is worse than I thought.
6-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=teasing,I see I've had quite the effect on you. You are rock hard!
6-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9,count-halloween_pit:0=surprised,Oh my! Pit, are you alright? She's not hurting you, is she?
6-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=tranquil,Don't worry, Pit. You may not like it now, but I'm sure you'll look back on this day fondly.
6-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit,alsoPlaying:kyu=horny,Perhaps. As long as I can have him back within twenty-four hours.
6-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:futaba=teasing,You're <i>both</i> strange. That's not really a bad thing, though. It's charming.
6-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:pit=horny,So it seems. Apologize, Pit.
6-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7,count-halloween_pit:0=surprised,Oh my! Pit, are you alright? She's not hurting you, is she?
6-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:human=calm,Yep, that's a nice looking member right there.
6-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:pit,count-futaba:1=teasing,Sure, why not? You have my permission to... "get to know them."
6-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s=surprised,Oh! Seems pretty accurate, as far as I know. Kudos.
6-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=tranquil,It's natural. As natural as androids get, anyway.
6-male_large_crotch_is_visible=worried,That makes me...uncomfortable.
6-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=worried,Whoa, whoa! I'm pretty sure <i>most</i> penises shouldn't be the length of a blade, Mettaton.
6-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryuji=surprised,Oh! That's much bigger than my average soldier. Might even outperform a few gods...
6-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=awkward,Wow... I bet it shoots farther than the arm of Dhalsim...
6-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:human=surprised,Wow, you're not average at all, are you?
6-female_chest_will_be_visible=calm,Decided to join me then, ~name~?
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:chiaki=thinking,What type of games, exactly?
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sayori=glad,Can't be helped. The rules are absolute, even to me.
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:zoey,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=glad,Someone like Rinkah doesn't understand the meaning of the word modesty.
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:felicia=surprised,Oh... you were serious?
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:joey,targetStage:4=glad,Tata, bra! Let's see some tatas.
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=glad,Don't knock it 'til you try it. She might even make some more fitting underwear for you!
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:elaine=glad,...For that exact reason.
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:6=thinking,I think that's the wrong game, Rinkah...
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jenetta=tranquil,I bet a few people here have... although they were probably obscured by fur.
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:revy=teasing,What's the matter? Only able to afford half a set?
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:clover,targetStage:5=teasing,Like I said before. Three dots.
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:marinette=annoyed,You're right, but you didn't have to be so blunt.
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jolyne=calm,On the other hand, there's no better time to get back on your feet!
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=glad,Rinkah's from a tribe, but I'm pretty sure it's not an <i>island</i> tribe.
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:raven,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=thinking,You're contradicting yourself. Although I have little doubt they really are monsters.
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:winter=calm,Hey, anything's better than such childish underwear to me.
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=awkward,Zone-tan here is even blunter than you, Rinkah!
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=awkward,Why? What made you into such a perverted woman?
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola=glad,I'm not expecting much. So you really can't let me down!
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:not_1st,totalExposed:0=glad,There you go.
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:5-8=tranquil,Now <i>this</i> is interesting! How similar will they be to Weiss's, I wonder...
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:shimakaze=teasing,I'm curious; how sensitive are they?
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=thinking,I'd like to see what trick could possibly save you from this.
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=tranquil,Don't worry, Rinkah. I already have been!
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:10,count-zizou:1=thinking,It's not like they're watching this live, though...
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:natsuki=awkward,I think you forgot a period in there... or five.
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,alsoPlayingStage:5=thinking,Aren't we in one right now? Or am I overthinking it?
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:raven=tranquil,We've already had the big reveal. What's one more pair of breasts to the lot?
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jolyne,targetTimeInStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=glad,It's not like she's lying to her self. She's just not in a hurry to admit it.
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:spooky=teasing,<i>Come on</i>. Would I laugh?
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:juri=teasing,Let's see if you can match my expectations.
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:aimee,alsoPlayingStage:6-5=angry,While you're at it, don't go shooting my clothes either!
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=annoyed,She does get rather grating after a while.
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:0-6,count-zizou:1=angry,I'm fairly certain at least one person in this room can see the future. How does no one know?
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=glad,There's many reserved princesses out there, but Rinkah's about as far as you can get from them.
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=surprised,Oh! You're really using magic... for that. Well.
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:9,count-zizou:1=horny,You'll have to be more specific, because I see two girls at work here. Which part?
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mileena=teasing,Does that even qualify as clothing In the first place?
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:zizou=glad,Being scared is natural, I suppose. But your friend will get you through it.
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=worried,If you're going to fight, you should leave those bound, right?
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:alice_mgq=annoyed,...Well. Go on, then.
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:7-8,count-zizou:1=calm,Humans can be so modest. Granted, you two are exceptionally so.
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:nayru=worried,You have hands, you know...
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aella,targetNotSaidMarker:AellaStalling=annoyed,Okay, enough stalling. Onto the real thing.
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aella=teasing,Not according to plan, Ms. Tactician?
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:6=calm,Not everyone can be a Princess Peach. Rinkah's much more of a Magnus, but that's beside the point.
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:gogo=horny,Are you finally putting your money where your mouth is? Now I'm a little excited.
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=calm,You knew all the right plays, didn't you Weiss? Apparently you're much better than you let on...
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:sheva=glad,I don't think Sheva herself is a zombie.
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:miko=teasing,Sounds like a bunch of excuses to me, Ms. Hermit.
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=horny,The whole leotard? You really aren't holding anything back, are you Mika?
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah=horny,Do it! Release them from their binds!
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan=tranquil,I'm not particularly interested, but go ahead.
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:nayru,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=tranquil,I wonder how the other oracles would react to this. Or even my oracles?
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,filter:exhibitionist=surprised,Wow. You... really have no shame, do you?
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:3=surprised,I thought nudity was taboo for humans?
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,filter:shy=calm,I believe in you, ~name~. I shall grant you the power to get through this.
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=teasing,Really, you think I'm here to make enemies? That's just not worth my time. So yeah, call me a friend.
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=tranquil,I sense a leak in the near future.
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=surprised,Oh...That's good to hear.
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=glad,Easy come, easy go.
6-female_small_chest_is_visible=thinking,I could have sworn they were bigger...
6-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:not_1st,totalExposed:1=thinking,Think of it like... you're blazing a trail. Wait, you lost your blazer, didn't you...
6-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:spooky,alsoPlaying:elaine,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=teasing,You can't seem to keep ghosts out your hair, Elaine! You should call an exorcist or something.
6-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:sayori=teasing,Really though, what is there to see?
6-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:hairy1,targetNotSaidMarker:shave1=teasing,What, your chest size? We knew it was tiny all along, honey.
6-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:meg=calm,I don't know what you were so upset about. There's more to life than breast size, you know. For example, maybe ~player~ is a leg person.
6-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:shimakaze=calm,You must either really be enjoying this or feel nothing at all to take so many in a row.
6-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:raven=calm,Not like I care about seeing naked demon girls anyway. I used to be close with Medusa, after all.
6-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:zizou,alsoPlaying:pit=thinking,Are there even showers here?
6-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:spooky,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,Good luck with that. Pit's been finished more times than I can count, but he always comes back.
6-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:spooky,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=calm,Because humans would fear the name <i>Spooky</i>.
6-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:miko=awkward,I thought humans were past showing off their spouses like trophies...
6-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:spooky,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=annoyed,Stop being cliche, Spooky.
6-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:raven,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=tranquil,Ooh, a grizzly revenge story! How <i>edgy.</i>
6-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:natsuki=teasing,I <i>could</i> say a lot... but I won't.
6-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:spooky=thinking,Okay, great. Can we go back to the game now?
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible=surprised,Oh, they jiggled a bit there.
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,marker:pit_girlfriend=thinking,(<i>Bigger than I thought... I could see Pit liking those.</i>)
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:about_to_see_my_breasts=horny,They're probably just your type, ~player~.
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:sayla,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=glad,What happened to theocracy? Or is that not in style in your worlds?
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:sf=glad,Compared to what I've seen? Not really.
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:raven=tranquil,Methinks the Azarathian is conflicted.
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:321=thinking,Eh. Underwhelming, really. Not worth a countdown.
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingStage:9=teasing,Then you're just not trying hard enough.
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=thinking,Quite the underreaction. Or are you just flustered?
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:shego=teasing,Yes, clearly.
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:aimee=annoyed,Both this "darlin'" and this Laslow just sound like perverts.
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=glad,I'm pretty sure this Corrin's a married man, but I know what you're getting at.
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss=teasing,Did you wet yourself out of embarrassment? Amazing. I've never seen a sorrier soldier. Weiss would probably be a better one, at this rate.
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:felicia=calm,She'd <i>have</i> to be good to not even try to hide 'em.
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=tranquil,I can neither confirm nor deny this.
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=glad,I think you have the wrong idea about this game... you want to <i>keep</i> your underwear on...
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:clover,targetStage:6=annoyed,And just when things were getting interesting with you.
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:zizou=horny,Funny how one word from the goddess turns you into an exhibitionist.
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=glad,Never that simple, is it?
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=thinking,I suppose it doesn't matter for someone raised in a jungle anyway.
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:yang=surprised,Wait, hold on. Neo's a mimic?
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=teasing,Maybe someone here just has that effect on you, Joetta.
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:6=glad,I think your act could use some work.
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:ruby=surprised,Wait, hold on. Neo's a mimic?
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:zoey=glad,Maybe pay attention to things right in front of your face next time. Or below.
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne=thinking,(Yep. No shame anymore now that she's had a chance to get over the shock.)
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=teasing,Then you're just not trying hard enough.
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=thinking,Curious...
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:4-7=thinking,Little confused by what you mean, Marinette. Jolyne is too, by the looks of it.
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rinkah=calm,I can see why you're the princess now.
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:5-6=awkward,Must not get compliments very often. Poor thing...
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:2-3=glad,Most woman who come here are... transparent with their motives.
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:zelda=surprised,So unashamed... guess you've got Farore's courage in you.
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:zone-tan=teasing,Zone-tan's a real party girl, huh?...Close your mouth, ~player~.
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:elaine=annoyed,Maybe don't brandish a knife next time?
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sayla=annoyed,In my opinion, this shouldn't be allowed... but I'll let it slide, just so I can rub it in when I win later.
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=tranquil,She's just being honest to a fault. I'm sure it's not personal.
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_f=teasing,Maybe someday you'll reach Robin's level of tactical prowess. But today is not that day.
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=worried,You sure it didn't hurt you? That one looked awful close.
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=teasing,What? The toned abs? She hardly seems like the type.
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=thinking,You've been hyping them all game, but I don't see the appeal.
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:buffy,alsoPlayingStage:2=glad,Take solace in the fact you have each other.
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aella=horny,Sloppy sloppy. Even Magnus wouldn't have been so careless.
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:jin,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=tranquil,That's probably the best compliment you'll ever get, Jin.
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=teasing,You know, I didn't do that because you can't bring it back after the game. Hope you don't mind streaking.
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:winter=teasing,Topless and... is that a wet spot?
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:aella,alsoPlayingStage:5-6=awkward,The humiliation of defeat stings far worse than losing these clothes, I agree.
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:juri=thinking,I might have underestimated you, at this rate.
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jenetta=surprised,You could see the whole time? That's awkward...
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:aella=teasing,Of course it was an accident. Do you think she'd blow a chance to stay in the game longer?
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:mahiru=horny,Don't listen to her, Mahiru. A photographer should be able to take as many pictures as she wants.
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola=calm,Sure, I've had my fun. I don't need to stare.
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:revy=teasing,I'm going to enjoy putting you in your place, you crude girl.
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:piper=worried,What a harsh environment to not even be able to get the clothes you need... you have my condolences.
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=glad,It's very reminiscint of a hot spring, right?
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:not_the_best_but=calm,Obviously. But humans probably go wild for them, right?
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:pauling=horny,(<i>Considering how much she puts out, I'm surprised she never got with the Scout.</i>)
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:isnt_too_bad=teasing,You're lucky I don't care enough to tell them.
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=teasing,Miss Morose has a sexual side after all. Congrats, Jolyne.
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:meg,alsoPlayingStage:0=glad,Sounds about as nice as the Lunar Sanctum.
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:nayru,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=thinking,Perhaps. I hope my presence doesn't make you... uncomfortable.
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:mercy=calm,Those are easily an eight. Maybe even better.
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=thinking,Only took you this long, huh? Slow for a space pirate.
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:alright_here_i_go=thinking,Good enough. We still have a hat and some panties to go, though!
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:nayru=surprised,Was this planned? I didn't think you were so conniving!
6-female_large_chest_is_visible=glad,I'm in good company, it seems.
6-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika,alsoPlaying:chun-li=annoyed,(What is it with Street Fighters wanting a big butt? Small or normal ones are fine!)
6-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=glad,What a showwoman! I can respect that.
6-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:april=thinking,(<i>Why do I suddenly have a craving for pizza?</i>)
6-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia=thinking,(Surprisingly human-like anatomy...)
6-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:chara=tranquil,Guess what they say about drinking milk is true after all!
6-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:alice_mgq=glad,It's fine. We all know they're fake, anyway.
6-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:korra=horny,Sorry to stare, but that's the way this game goes...
6-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:chiaki=glad,Sorry, but that's below me. Ask Pit if you want a rubdown. Nice mole, by the way.
6-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:seven=surprised,You're certainly attractive for a space-goer, Seven. Certainly moreso than a space pirate.
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible=teasing,Can the beaver come out to play?
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible=worried,I'd be happier if there wasn't the threat of me being next hanging above me...
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=horny,I think I can take a good guess as to what it is...
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan=glad,I don't care either way, but I think ~player~ might wet themselves.
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nayru,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=calm,As did everyone else.
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:sarcasm=teasing,Yes, Kyu. We're all so sorry to put you through this.
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,targetSaidMarker:bodysuit,targetNotSaidMarker:bodysuitsolomarinette=teasing,Oh, I see. I don't mind teaching you, but I'd have to teach all of you for the sake of fairness.
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aella=glad,I bet you wish you weren't so tall now, huh?
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:zizou=teasing,Every part of that sentence was wrong, Sola.
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kyu=glad,The old fashioned-way, huh? At least you'll go home <i>somewhat</i> clothed.
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=glad,Just couldn't wait to drop your panties for us, huh?
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=teasing,You just can't keep your modesty, can you Amalia?
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=teasing,Her too? <i>That's</i> dedication.
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon,targetSaidMarker:moon_doesnt_wear_panties=awkward,Well, seeing how you said earlier that you don't wear panties, this can only end one way.
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:miko,targetSaidMarker:LastWordL=tranquil,The best leaders know no fear, it's true.
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:shave1,targetNotSaidMarker:hairy1=glad,Why yes, Natsuki, we <i>do</i> have the same equipment down there. Even you and I.
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:daphne=teasing,Gather round, gang. Let's see- I mean get to, the bottom of this mystery.
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,Maybe I ought to have <i>you</i> wear that, just so you can learn to appreciate it! How about that, Pit?
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:futaba=glad,It's about as effective as censor bars in the East.
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:miko,targetSaidMarker:LastWordW=horny,Cheating isn't very becoming of a saint, you know.
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mahiru,marker:mahirucheck=surprised,Oh! I expected you to be hairier. Or be completely shaved. Just not in between.
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette=calm,Come now, have a little more faith in us... no pun intended.
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=thinking,Is the curtain necessary? I'm sure at least <i>someone</i> would be into this.
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:winter=glad,You'll catch a cold if you stay in soaked panties too long. You probably should have removed them sooner.
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:natsuki,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=awkward,...It's a bit late for that. For both of you.
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:revy=tranquil,Finally! I was getting sick of  your bellyaching, to be honest.
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=glad,Poor Weiss here's about to be scarred for life.
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:shimakaze=awkward,How... gruesome.
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=glad,Now we'll see for sure how close you two are in body type.
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki,targetSaidMarker:mahirucheck,targetNotSaidMarker:mahirucheck2,alsoPlaying:saki,alsoPlayingStage:7=surprised,The three of you certainly became fast friends.
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki,targetSaidMarker:mahirucheck,targetNotSaidMarker:mahirucheck2,alsoPlaying:saki,alsoPlayingStage:9=surprised,The three of you certainly became fast friends.
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki=teasing,Out of "armor" already, Chiaki? I really expected you to clean house.
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jenetta=glad,Speedrun time!
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=thinking,You really love tossing that camera of yours around, don't you?
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jolyne=surprised,Not a very elegant location to write that...
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rinkah=tranquil,Time to see you in your full, mangy glory!
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki,alsoPlaying:pit=angry,She can fight her own fights, Pit. Let her be.
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=thinking,And now's not the time to fling hexes...
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:miko,targetSaidMarker:LastWordN=glad,It's not so bad, right?
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:creepy=horny,Not so tough now that you're about to lose, huh?
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:natsuki=annoyed,Any time now.
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki,alsoPlaying:wiifitfemale=glad,I thought that was obvious from the start.
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sola=surprised,Getting it over with? Fair enough.
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki,targetSaidMarker:mahirucheck3,alsoPlaying:saki,alsoPlayingStage:9=surprised,The three of you certainly became fast friends.
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=worried,Is it really in your best interests to fight naked?
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:alice_mgq=glad,Not really much to gain from this. We can see the pubic hair situation and more already.
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:raven=glad,I don't care either way, but I think Raven might wet herself.
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:spooky=glad,I'm almost surprised you're following them, to be honest.
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=worried,...I have no words for what I'm seeing. And smelling.
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:juri=worried,(She's treating this less like a competition and more like a modeling gig.)
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=glad,Consider it a small victory. For you and you alone.
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=calm,Such a skimpy little costume! I have no idea why you heroes think walking around in leotards is a good idea.
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nayru=annoyed,I almost just wasted a magic spell on you. You could have let us know from the start, at least.
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki,targetSaidMarker:mahirucheck3,alsoPlaying:saki,alsoPlayingStage:7=surprised,The three of you certainly became fast friends.
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=thinking,You really love tossing that camera of yours around, don't you?
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:miko=calm,Danger! Danger! Not good!
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:clover=teasing,Better start believing.
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sayori=calm,Going, going...
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:elaine=surprised,Elaine, is that a...?
6-female_crotch_is_visible=tranquil,Nice and well-kept. Perhaps a demonstration is in order?
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chiaki=horny,I imagine you're the type to... admire my character model. So it's nice to turn the tide.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=tranquil,After a blunder like that, who wouldn't be?
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lara=horny,Guess the "nude code" exists after all!
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:9-10=thinking,Mar? ...Oh! You mean Marinette.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:shaved=surprised,It actually looks pretty nice with no hair like that...
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:do_or_die=awkward,I see.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:clover=calm,Aw, how cute. You think a wooden axe can harm a goddess.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:ruby=angry,You stop that right now. It's in bad taste.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:2-6=worried,I think you <i>both</i> need your ears checked out.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:felicia,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=glad,I think the idea's a little different for someone like Felicia, though...
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:asuna,alsoPlayingStage:9-10=glad,That's not something any of us should concern ourselves with. Just shave as much as you want.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=calm,Enough of that, Misato. You <i>and</i> Rinkah are doing just fine.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=teasing,I hope you're proud of your plan. Because I sincerely doubt you can grow back fur instantaneously...
6-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:ginger=horny,Look at you! You're almost as red as your hair!
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:april=horny,Not very private when you're showing it off publicly.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=teasing,Is that an open invitation?
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:hairy1,targetNotSaidMarker:shave1=thinking,I really don't think that matters, Natsuki.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:do_better=surprised,Maybe focus on the game and not some silly spell and you'll do better.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=horny,I think we've earned our prize, wouldn't you agree?
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:shave1,targetNotSaidMarker:hairy1=calm,No, it's not. It's probably just a little less common than going natural.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=tranquil,I think you two'd be cute together! And you're already dressed for the occasion.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki=teasing,And here I thought you hated cute stuff.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:shego,alsoPlayingStage:8=thinking,Do the tabloids even care about the Flame Tribe?
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=annoyed,Ah, paparazzi. I imagine this must be hard for someone so young like you.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:morrigan,alsoPlayingStage:5=glad,To be honest, I prefer it like this. Better than going on a murderous rampage.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:shantae=glad,She's right, though. Dancing requires a very disciplined physique. One you have already!
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:mei,alsoPlayingStage:7=teasing,You both have wonderful names to joke with. It's a conversation starter. Be thankful.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:yang=angry,You stop that right now. It's in bad taste.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:revy=teasing,Well, you still have the personality of a toilet, but at least you followed through.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,Ooh, get her, Pit!
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=teasing,What happened to not making things awkward, hmm?
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jenetta=horny,Fastest crotch reveal yet! Impressive, Jenetta. But also a little sad.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:wiifitfemale=glad,There's such a thing as too much pride, you know.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:revy,alsoPlayingStage:3=annoyed,That's pretty much my thoughts exactly. <i>Don't</i>.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:lilith=glad,I'd like to meet whoever came up with <i>that</i> name.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sayori=tranquil,Gone.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki,alsoPlaying:yuri=glad,Oh my. So you two've seen each other's, then?
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:shimakaze=worried,Maybe I should contact Poseidon to make sure no one's <i>actually</i> dying from this.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=horny,So this is what total humiliation looks like.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=calm,You Schnee sisters really have no shame, huh?
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=calm,Corrin won't talk. For his own sake most of all.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingStage:7=glad,Being able to summon in general is a wonderful thing.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:nayru=calm,Does demonic possession turn you on? Not kink-shaming, just curious.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:aella,alsoPlayingStage:6-7=glad,This is the one place where we <i>shouldn't</i> be ashamed. Well, apart from hot springs.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:2-3=glad,Some girls are secretive about this stuff. And it's not like you were willing to share your grooming habits until two minutes ago.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:juri=surprised,Hairy? That's the first time my intuition's been wrong about you.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:angie,alsoPlayingStage:9-10=teasing,Poor Angie. She's even jealous of the B-listers.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=horny,Ooh! You got something up your non-existant sleeve there, wood girl?
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mercy=horny,See? You're no angel. Just a human with a god complex.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:florina,alsoPlayingStage:8=surprised,Did you have this lotion on you?
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter=thinking,Is that so? Maybe someday.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=glad,There we are. Just like I thought. Just gotta get that mask now...
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=surprised,I'm shocked you actually went for it... and then flashed us to boot...
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=teasing,Someone with a questionable origin, that's who.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jolyne=glad,...Or a helpful one.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:zoey=horny,Obviously. Who else would fight a war and then play strip poker?
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:8=calm,That's fine. I'll just take in yours for a bit.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:9s=glad,Maybe he meant the insides?
6-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:mean=teasing,Bullies will get no sympathy from me.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=calm,Just be thankful this ordeal's almost over.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola=awkward,In other words, cheating.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:orendi,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=calm,Watching Rinkah fight a monster <i>could</i> be fun...
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:felicia,alsoPlayingStage:2-4=tranquil,Make sure you don't scratch it!
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:zizou=calm,From what I've seen from Zizou so far, that was a more tame response than I expected.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:miko=calm,I thought you already were, but sure, I'll try my best to defeat you.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:0-2=calm,It's a nice philosophy. My warriors could use some of that, really.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:nagisa=worried,Nagisa, you do what you want. Don't let Winter here try and shave you.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:7=calm,This whole night's been pretty wild, huh?
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=tranquil,You were looking for a man, right Jura? A lewd picture like that ought to do wonders on the search.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=surprised,That might be a little <i>too</i> personal for here, Spider-Woman.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:saki,targetSaidMarker:mahirucheck3,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingStage:9=surprised,Are all Hope's Peak students this perverted?
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dawn=surprised,I was unaware humans could get natural hair that colorful! Thought it was a god-only thing...
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dawn=horny,Now I'm no expert in house design, but know that yours is very pleasing to the eyes, Dawn.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:blake,alsoPlaying:caleb=thinking,So Caleb, how much does a catgirl excite you compared to a human?
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zone-tan=tranquil,Don't get too excited. You still have Zone-tan's forfeit to look forward to!
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:tracer=horny,Ah, <i>there's</i> the butt that broke the Internet.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=thinking,Maybe I should get a cat.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:elaine=tranquil,They should call you Elaine Marley, Mighty Fine Lady (tm)!
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki,alsoPlaying:florina,count-lyn:1=teasing,Then tell us: who's the lucky recipient?
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=worried,How? Through deception or brute force? It seems like a bad time either way...
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette=thinking,I wouldn't say it's surprising, more... intriguing.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:down_they_go=horny,You mean you still had it? You were standing here with nothing but that goofy-print underwear.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:saki,targetSaidMarker:mahirucheck,targetNotSaidMarker:mahirucheck2,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingStage:9=surprised,Are all Hope's Peak students this perverted?
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=surprised,(Doesn't even care that she just shaved. She really is a cat.)
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:6=glad,Well, laziness has it's value at times.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:saki,targetSaidMarker:mahirucheck3,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingStage:7=surprised,You're taking naked pictures together? Is that an initiation of some sort?
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mia=surprised,Ooh, a power play! Well, I won't lose to you, attorney.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:pauling=teasing,That body just screams 'Seduce me!', very nice.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chiaki,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=tranquil,Don't even mind taking nude pics together. What nice friends you two are.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:mahiru=tranquil,And there's the icing on the proverbial cake. You should spread that around, Mahiru.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:arwen=horny,Now I know why they call elves "the fairer folk".
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:faye=thinking,I had no idea shaving was so common with both the lawful <i>and</i> lawless...
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:april,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=teasing,Now here's a newscast I'd want to watch.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:may=teasing,Yes, we can definitely tell.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:5=thinking,Isn't that the point of this? We all come from different eras?
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:alice_mgq=calm,I'm not impressed. No class at all.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=teasing,I dunno, Ochako. This might give you a popularity boost.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rosalina=worried,Seeing a fellow goddess exposed hits a lot closer to home than the others.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven=teasing,A bra but no bottoms? How risque!
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:april,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=surprised,I'm pretty sure news teams don't get that close, April!
6-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:princess=teasing,Remember, ~name~: a princess is always inferior to a goddess.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chiaki,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=tranquil,Don't even mind taking nude pics together. What nice friends you two are.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,targetSaidMarker:spacebush,alsoPlaying:meia=calm,I mean, everyone grows 'em. It's just a matter of keeping them.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:shantae=awkward,The way you swing your hips is... mesmerizing...
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zelda=teasing,So how's that Triforce of Wisdom working out for you?
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:spooky=calm,Yep, <i>very</i> interesting. Aside from the deathly palor, your body isn't that different from a living human's.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=glad,You show that to any mortal man, and I'm sure you'd have him eating out of the palm of your hand.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=surprised,So you're saying the rest of your tribe doesn't shave either?
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:saki,targetSaidMarker:mahirucheck,targetNotSaidMarker:mahirucheck2,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingStage:7=surprised,You're taking naked pictures together? Is that an initiation of some sort?
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:8=surprised,I think she said something about mugging you?
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_f=thinking,I never took you for the type to shave, Corrin. Did your husband make you do it?
6-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=surprised,That's a lot of hair down there, ~name~! Have you ever considered shaving some of it? I have a spell I use for that.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:nayru,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=surprised,...Aren't you going to finish that?
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:xander=horny,I didn't know you were into the average Joes, Winter.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven,targetNotSaidMarker:strategic_decision=teasing,With what your wearing? Please. I have my suspicions this was all-too intentional.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=surprised,...Did you really just do that?
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=tranquil,Glad we're all in agreement that we look pretty cool!
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zizou,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:6=teasing,I'm sure Pit would rather have a blessing from a beautiful goddess.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:5=annoyed,Okay, but did you have to spoil it for the rest of us?
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:revy=annoyed,Makes sense. You two are like peas in a pod.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aella=teasing,With how much you're complaining, you'd think you'd never been naked before.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:step_it_up=thinking,(Sounds like a step back to me.)
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah=teasing,Getting worried yet, warrior? You should be.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zizou,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:7=surprised,Don't do it, Pit. She means that <i>very</i> literally.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kyu=calm,Hmm. Yep, exactly as shameless as I've heard.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:get_serious_now=thinking,That just sounds silly.

6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=calm,Every style has its merits. I encourage you to try them all!
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zizou,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:5=horny,He hasn't, but I would be curious to see how he did.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven,alsoPlaying:felicia=glad,Let's just say your both bad at thinking things through.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:shego,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=glad,No offense, Shego, but you probably can't take Rinkah in a fair fight.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:daisy=calm,Oh! Daisy! ...guess you're the genuine article, then.

6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7,alsoPlaying:mahiru=tranquil,Excellent, Mahiru. She wants lots of pictures, so don't hold back anymore.

-3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,Oh, no need. Pit already has a black tunic from his time at the Smash tourney.
-3-male_chest_is_visible=calm,That right there is the textbook definition of "desireable"... for humans, I mean.
-3-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:futaba=teasing,What robots do you know that have nipples?
-3-male_chest_is_visible,target:ryuji=horny,Putting the "muscle" in "musclehead", I see.

-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan=tranquil,I'm not particularly interested, but go ahead.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:7-8,count-zizou:1=calm,Humans can be so modest. Granted, you two are exceptionally so.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=worried,If you're going to fight, you should leave those bound, right?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:winter=calm,Hey, anything's better than such childish underwear to me.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah=horny,Do it! Release them from their binds!
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:3=surprised,I thought nudity was taboo for humans?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:not_1st,totalExposed:0=glad,There you go.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:aimee,alsoPlayingStage:7-5=angry,While you're at it, don't go shooting my clothes either!
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:5-8=tranquil,Now <i>this</i> is interesting! How similar will they be to Weiss's, I wonder...
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=awkward,Zone-tan here is even blunter than you, Rinkah!
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:clover,targetStage:5=teasing,Like I said before. Three dots.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jenetta=tranquil,I bet a few people here have... although they were probably obscured by fur.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=thinking,I'd like to see what trick could possibly save you from this.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:revy=teasing,What's the matter? Only able to afford half a set?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:10,count-zizou:1=thinking,It's not like they're watching this live, though...
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=glad,Easy come, easy go.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,alsoPlayingStage:5=thinking,Aren't we in one right now? Or am I overthinking it?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aella,targetNotSaidMarker:AellaStalling=annoyed,Okay, enough stalling. Onto the real thing.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sayori=glad,Can't be helped. The rules are absolute, even to me.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:joey,targetStage:4=glad,Tata, bra! Let's see some tatas.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:raven=tranquil,We've already had the big reveal. What's one more pair of breasts to the lot?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:alice_mgq=annoyed,...Well. Go on, then.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:nayru,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=tranquil,I wonder how the other oracles would react to this. Or even my oracles?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:zoey,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=glad,Someone like Rinkah doesn't understand the meaning of the word modesty.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:9,count-zizou:1=horny,You'll have to be more specific, because I see two girls at work here. Which part?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:miko=teasing,Sounds like a bunch of excuses to me, Ms. Hermit.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=tranquil,I sense a leak in the near future.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jolyne=calm,On the other hand, there's no better time to get back on your feet!
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:juri=teasing,Let's see if you can match my expectations.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,filter:shy=calm,I believe in you, ~name~. I shall grant you the power to get through this.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=awkward,Why? What made you into such a perverted woman?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=surprised,Oh...That's good to hear.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=horny,The whole leotard? You really aren't holding anything back, are you Mika?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:raven,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=thinking,You're contradicting yourself. Although I have little doubt they really are monsters.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,filter:exhibitionist=surprised,Wow. You... really have no shame, do you?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:0-6,count-zizou:1=angry,I'm fairly certain at least one person in this room can see the future. How does no one know?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=glad,There's many reserved princesses out there, but Rinkah's about as far as you can get from them.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=glad,Don't knock it 'til you try it. She might even make some more fitting underwear for you!
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:zizou=glad,Being scared is natural, I suppose. But your friend will get you through it.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:spooky=teasing,<i>Come on</i>. Would I laugh?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:felicia=surprised,Oh... you were serious?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:6=calm,Not everyone can be a Princess Peach. Rinkah's much more of a Magnus, but that's beside the point.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=teasing,Really, you think I'm here to make enemies? That's just not worth my time. So yeah, call me a friend.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jolyne,targetTimeInStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=glad,It's not like she's lying to her self. She's just not in a hurry to admit it.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:natsuki=awkward,I think you forgot a period in there... or five.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=surprised,Oh! You're really using magic... for that. Well.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:elaine=glad,...For that exact reason.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:nayru=worried,You have hands, you know...
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:marinette=annoyed,You're right, but you didn't have to be so blunt.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aella=teasing,Not according to plan, Ms. Tactician?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=annoyed,She does get rather grating after a while.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=calm,You knew all the right plays, didn't you Weiss? Apparently you're much better than you let on...
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:sheva=glad,I don't think Sheva herself is a zombie.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:6=thinking,I think that's the wrong game, Rinkah...
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible=teasing,Oh hello Viridi, when did you get here?
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:raven=calm,Not like I care about seeing naked demon girls anyway. I used to be close with Medusa, after all.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:spooky,alsoPlaying:elaine,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=teasing,You can't seem to keep ghosts out your hair, Elaine! You should call an exorcist or something.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:raven,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=tranquil,Ooh, a grizzly revenge story! How <i>edgy.</i>
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:spooky=thinking,Okay, great. Can we go back to the game now?
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:miko=awkward,I thought humans were past showing off their spouses like trophies...
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:spooky,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,Good luck with that. Pit's been finished more times than I can count, but he always comes back.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:natsuki=teasing,I <i>could</i> say a lot... but I won't.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:meg=calm,I don't know what you were so upset about. There's more to life than breast size, you know. For example, maybe ~player~ is a leg person.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:shimakaze=calm,You must either really be enjoying this or feel nothing at all to take so many in a row.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:sayori=teasing,Really though, what is there to see?
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:not_1st,totalExposed:1=thinking,Think of it like... you're blazing a trail. Wait, you lost your blazer, didn't you...
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:spooky,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=annoyed,Stop being cliche, Spooky.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:zizou,alsoPlaying:pit=thinking,Are there even showers here?
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:spooky,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=calm,Because humans would fear the name <i>Spooky</i>.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:hairy1,targetNotSaidMarker:shave1=teasing,What, your chest size? We knew it was tiny all along, honey.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible=tranquil,Thanks for the mammaries!
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,marker:pit_girlfriend=horny,(<i>You know, Pit needs a girlfriend... and ~name~ seems nice enough...</i>)
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:buffy,alsoPlayingStage:2=glad,Take solace in the fact you have each other.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss=teasing,Did you wet yourself out of embarrassment? Amazing. I've never seen a sorrier soldier. Weiss would probably be a better one, at this rate.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=tranquil,She's just being honest to a fault. I'm sure it's not personal.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=teasing,Then you're just not trying hard enough.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=thinking,Curious...
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=thinking,Only took you this long, huh? Slow for a space pirate.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:mahiru=horny,Don't listen to her, Mahiru. A photographer should be able to take as many pictures as she wants.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=tranquil,I can neither confirm nor deny this.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:aella=teasing,Of course it was an accident. Do you think she'd blow a chance to stay in the game longer?
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingStage:9=teasing,Then you're just not trying hard enough.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:zizou=horny,Funny how one word from the goddess turns you into an exhibitionist.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:meg,alsoPlayingStage:0=glad,Sounds about as nice as the Lunar Sanctum.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:4-7=thinking,Little confused by what you mean, Marinette. Jolyne is too, by the looks of it.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:ruby=surprised,Wait, hold on. Neo's a mimic?
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:zoey=glad,Maybe pay attention to things right in front of your face next time. Or below.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=glad,Never that simple, is it?
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:raven=tranquil,Methinks the Azarathian is conflicted.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:shego=teasing,Yes, clearly.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:aella,alsoPlayingStage:5-6=awkward,The humiliation of defeat stings far worse than losing these clothes, I agree.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:5-6=awkward,Must not get compliments very often. Poor thing...
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:sayla,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=glad,What happened to theocracy? Or is that not in style in your worlds?
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=teasing,Miss Morose has a sexual side after all. Congrats, Jolyne.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:yang=surprised,Wait, hold on. Neo's a mimic?
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:2-3=glad,Most woman who come here are... transparent with their motives.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:jin,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=tranquil,That's probably the best compliment you'll ever get, Jin.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sayla=annoyed,In my opinion, this shouldn't be allowed... but I'll let it slide, just so I can rub it in when I win later.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:aimee=annoyed,Both this "darlin'" and this Laslow just sound like perverts.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:sf=glad,Compared to what I've seen? Not really.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=thinking,I suppose it doesn't matter for someone raised in a jungle anyway.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=thinking,You've been hyping them all game, but I don't see the appeal.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:elaine=annoyed,Maybe don't brandish a knife next time?
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:not_the_best_but=calm,Obviously. But humans probably go wild for them, right?
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rinkah=calm,I can see why you're the princess now.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=thinking,Quite the underreaction. Or are you just flustered?
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:isnt_too_bad=teasing,You're lucky I don't care enough to tell them.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:nayru=surprised,Was this planned? I didn't think you were so conniving!
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=teasing,Maybe someone here just has that effect on you, Joetta.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:6=glad,I think your act could use some work.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:alright_here_i_go=thinking,Good enough. We still have a hat and some panties to go, though!
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:clover,targetStage:6=annoyed,And just when things were getting interesting with you.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:about_to_see_my_breasts=horny,They're probably just your type, ~player~.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:321=thinking,Eh. Underwhelming, really. Not worth a countdown.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:winter=teasing,Topless and... is that a wet spot?
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=glad,I think you have the wrong idea about this game... you want to <i>keep</i> your underwear on...
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:nayru,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=thinking,Perhaps. I hope my presence doesn't make you... uncomfortable.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:mercy=calm,Those are easily an eight. Maybe even better.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_f=teasing,Maybe someday you'll reach Robin's level of tactical prowess. But today is not that day.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=worried,You sure it didn't hurt you? That one looked awful close.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:zone-tan=teasing,Zone-tan's a real party girl, huh?...Close your mouth, ~player~.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=glad,It's very reminiscint of a hot spring, right?
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jenetta=surprised,You could see the whole time? That's awkward...
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aella=horny,Sloppy sloppy. Even Magnus wouldn't have been so careless.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:revy=teasing,I'm going to enjoy putting you in your place, you crude girl.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=teasing,You know, I didn't do that because you can't bring it back after the game. Hope you don't mind streaking.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:zelda=surprised,So unashamed... guess you've got Farore's courage in you.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:juri=thinking,I might have underestimated you, at this rate.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:piper=worried,What a harsh environment to not even be able to get the clothes you need... you have my condolences.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne=thinking,(Yep. No shame anymore now that she's had a chance to get over the shock.)
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=glad,I'm pretty sure this Corrin's a married man, but I know what you're getting at.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:pauling=horny,(<i>Considering how much she puts out, I'm surprised she never got with the Scout.</i>)
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola=calm,Sure, I've had my fun. I don't need to stare.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:felicia=calm,She'd <i>have</i> to be good to not even try to hide 'em.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=teasing,What? The toned abs? She hardly seems like the type.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible=surprised,Those might be on par with mine! Impressive, ~name~.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika,alsoPlaying:chun-li=annoyed,(What is it with Street Fighters wanting a big butt? Small or normal ones are fine!)
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:seven=surprised,You're certainly attractive for a space-goer, Seven. Certainly moreso than a space pirate.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:april=thinking,(<i>Why do I suddenly have a craving for pizza?</i>)
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:chara=tranquil,Guess what they say about drinking milk is true after all!
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:korra=horny,Sorry to stare, but that's the way this game goes...
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia=thinking,(Surprisingly human-like anatomy...)
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=glad,What a showwoman! I can respect that.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:chiaki=glad,Sorry, but that's below me. Ask Pit if you want a rubdown. Nice mole, by the way.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:alice_mgq=glad,It's fine. We all know they're fake, anyway.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible=thinking,It's not so bad, ~name~. No worse than a trip to the hot springs!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=glad,Consider it a small victory. For you and you alone.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:natsuki,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=awkward,...It's a bit late for that. For both of you.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=thinking,And now's not the time to fling hexes...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=glad,Just couldn't wait to drop your panties for us, huh?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:natsuki=annoyed,Any time now.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:clover=teasing,Better start believing.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=glad,Poor Weiss here's about to be scarred for life.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,Maybe I ought to have <i>you</i> wear that, just so you can learn to appreciate it! How about that, Pit?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:juri=worried,(She's treating this less like a competition and more like a modeling gig.)
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:futaba=glad,It's about as effective as censor bars in the East.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=glad,Now we'll see for sure how close you two are in body type.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=horny,I think I can take a good guess as to what it is...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:raven=glad,I don't care either way, but I think Raven might wet herself.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki,alsoPlaying:pit=angry,She can fight her own fights, Pit. Let her be.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jolyne=surprised,Not a very elegant location to write that...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:zizou=teasing,Every part of that sentence was wrong, Sola.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki,alsoPlaying:wiifitfemale=glad,I thought that was obvious from the start.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sola=surprised,Getting it over with? Fair enough.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=thinking,You really love tossing that camera of yours around, don't you?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki=teasing,Out of "armor" already, Chiaki? I really expected you to clean house.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=thinking,You really love tossing that camera of yours around, don't you?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:miko,targetSaidMarker:LastWordW=horny,Cheating isn't very becoming of a saint, you know.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:miko,targetSaidMarker:LastWordN=glad,It's not so bad, right?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:miko,targetSaidMarker:LastWordL=tranquil,The best leaders know no fear, it's true.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan=glad,I don't care either way, but I think ~player~ might wet themselves.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nayru,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=calm,As did everyone else.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon,targetSaidMarker:moon_doesnt_wear_panties=awkward,Well, seeing how you said earlier that you don't wear panties, this can only end one way.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki,targetSaidMarker:mahirucheck,targetNotSaidMarker:mahirucheck2,alsoPlaying:saki,alsoPlayingStage:7=surprised,The three of you certainly became fast friends.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki,targetSaidMarker:mahirucheck,targetNotSaidMarker:mahirucheck2,alsoPlaying:saki,alsoPlayingStage:9=surprised,The three of you certainly became fast friends.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette=calm,Come now, have a little more faith in us... no pun intended.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aella=glad,I bet you wish you weren't so tall now, huh?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mahiru,marker:mahirucheck=surprised,Oh! I expected you to be hairier. Or be completely shaved. Just not in between.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:sarcasm=teasing,Yes, Kyu. We're all so sorry to put you through this.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki,targetSaidMarker:mahirucheck3,alsoPlaying:saki,alsoPlayingStage:7=surprised,The three of you certainly became fast friends.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki,targetSaidMarker:mahirucheck3,alsoPlaying:saki,alsoPlayingStage:9=surprised,The three of you certainly became fast friends.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kyu=glad,The old fashioned-way, huh? At least you'll go home <i>somewhat</i> clothed.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=teasing,Her too? <i>That's</i> dedication.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:shave1,targetNotSaidMarker:hairy1=glad,Why yes, Natsuki, we <i>do</i> have the same equipment down there. Even you and I.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=worried,Is it really in your best interests to fight naked?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,targetSaidMarker:bodysuit,targetNotSaidMarker:bodysuitsolomarinette=teasing,Oh, I see. I don't mind teaching you, but I'd have to teach all of you for the sake of fairness.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=thinking,Is the curtain necessary? I'm sure at least <i>someone</i> would be into this.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=teasing,You just can't keep your modesty, can you Amalia?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=calm,Such a skimpy little costume! I have no idea why you heroes think walking around in leotards is a good idea.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:daphne=teasing,Gather round, gang. Let's see- I mean get to, the bottom of this mystery.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jenetta=glad,Speedrun time!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sayori=calm,Going, going...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:alice_mgq=glad,Not really much to gain from this. We can see the pubic hair situation and more already.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:creepy=horny,Not so tough now that you're about to lose, huh?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:winter=glad,You'll catch a cold if you stay in soaked panties too long. You probably should have removed them sooner.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=worried,...I have no words for what I'm seeing. And smelling.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nayru=annoyed,I almost just wasted a magic spell on you. You could have let us know from the start, at least.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:miko=calm,Danger! Danger! Not good!

-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:spooky=glad,I'm almost surprised you're following them, to be honest.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible=calm,An interesting stylistic choice. Maybe I'll study it further later.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:daisy=calm,Oh! Daisy! ...guess you're the genuine article, then.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:alice_mgq=calm,I'm not impressed. No class at all.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:faye=thinking,I had no idea shaving was so common with both the lawful <i>and</i> lawless...

-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:saki,targetSaidMarker:mahirucheck,targetNotSaidMarker:mahirucheck2,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingStage:9=surprised,Are all Hope's Peak students this perverted?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:mahiru=tranquil,And there's the icing on the proverbial cake. You should spread that around, Mahiru.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:8=surprised,I think she said something about mugging you?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:saki,targetSaidMarker:mahirucheck3,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingStage:7=surprised,You're taking naked pictures together? Is that an initiation of some sort?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=tranquil,After a blunder like that, who wouldn't be?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:nagisa=worried,Nagisa, you do what you want. Don't let Winter here try and shave you.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lara=horny,Guess the "nude code" exists after all!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:juri=surprised,Hairy? That's the first time my intuition's been wrong about you.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=horny,Ooh! You got something up your non-existant sleeve there, wood girl?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:may=teasing,Yes, we can definitely tell.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:kyoko,alsoPlayingStage:0-2=teasing,Really, even a rock could figure <i>that</i> out.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=worried,How? Through deception or brute force? It seems like a bad time either way...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:2-6=worried,I think you <i>both</i> need your ears checked out.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:ginger=horny,Look at you! You're almost as red as your hair!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:april=horny,Not very private when you're showing it off publicly.

-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:tracer=horny,Ah, <i>there's</i> the butt that broke the Internet.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=calm,Every style has its merits. I encourage you to try them all!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=tranquil,I think you two'd be cute together! And you're already dressed for the occasion.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki=teasing,And here I thought you hated cute stuff.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:zizou=calm,From what I've seen from Zizou so far, that was a more tame response than I expected.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=horny,I think we've earned our prize, wouldn't you agree?

-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:asuna,alsoPlayingStage:9-10=glad,That's not something any of us should concern ourselves with. Just shave as much as you want.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven,alsoPlaying:felicia=glad,Let's just say your both bad at thinking things through.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=tranquil,Glad we're all in agreement that we look pretty cool!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jenetta=horny,Fastest crotch reveal yet! Impressive, Jenetta. But also a little sad.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7,alsoPlaying:mahiru=tranquil,Excellent, Mahiru. She wants lots of pictures, so don't hold back anymore.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven=teasing,A bra but no bottoms? How risque!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:clover=calm,Aw, how cute. You think a wooden axe can harm a goddess.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:hairy1,targetNotSaidMarker:shave1=thinking,I really don't think that matters, Natsuki.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:saki,targetSaidMarker:mahirucheck3,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingStage:9=surprised,Are all Hope's Peak students this perverted?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:0-2=calm,It's a nice philosophy. My warriors could use some of that, really.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter=thinking,Is that so? Maybe someday.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:april,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=surprised,I'm pretty sure news teams don't get that close, April!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zizou,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:5=horny,He hasn't, but I would be curious to see how he did.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jolyne=glad,...Or a helpful one.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=glad,You show that to any mortal man, and I'm sure you'd have him eating out of the palm of your hand.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:zoey=horny,Obviously. Who else would fight a war and then play strip poker?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:lilith=glad,I'd like to meet whoever came up with <i>that</i> name.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:spooky=calm,Yep, <i>very</i> interesting. Aside from the deathly palor, your body isn't that different from a living human's.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:pauling=teasing,That body just screams 'Seduce me!', very nice.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=tranquil,You were looking for a man, right Jura? A lewd picture like that ought to do wonders on the search.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rosalina=worried,Seeing a fellow goddess exposed hits a lot closer to home than the others.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=surprised,That might be a little <i>too</i> personal for here, Spider-Woman.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=thinking,Maybe I should get a cat.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:elaine=tranquil,They should call you Elaine Marley, Mighty Fine Lady (tm)!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zizou,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=glad,I grant you permission to admire it, but don't even think about worshipping it.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola=awkward,In other words, cheating.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:shantae=glad,She's right, though. Dancing requires a very disciplined physique. One you have already!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dawn=surprised,I was unaware humans could get natural hair that colorful! Thought it was a god-only thing...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dawn=horny,Now I'm no expert in house design, but know that yours is very pleasing to the eyes, Dawn.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:nayru=calm,Does demonic possession turn you on? Not kink-shaming, just curious.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:exhibitionist=horny,I think I see why you'd want to show off like you do...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:wiifitfemale=glad,There's such a thing as too much pride, you know.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,Ooh, get her, Pit!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:xander=horny,I didn't know you were into the average Joes, Winter.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=calm,Corrin won't talk. For his own sake most of all.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:april,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=teasing,Now here's a newscast I'd want to watch.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lux=angry,It's not even natural? ...how can you call yourself a warrior of light?!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:arwen=horny,Now I know why they call elves "the fairer folk".
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:spooky,alsoPlaying:chica=tranquil,Hey now, there aren't that many of us "alive" to begin with here!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=surprised,That's a lot of hair down there, ~name~! Have you ever considered shaving some of it? I have a spell I use for that.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chiaki,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=tranquil,Don't even mind taking nude pics together. What nice friends you two are.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:princess=teasing,Remember, ~name~: a princess is always inferior to a goddess.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chiaki,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=tranquil,Don't even mind taking nude pics together. What nice friends you two are.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=surprised,I'm shocked you actually went for it... and then flashed us to boot...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:9s=glad,Maybe he meant the insides?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:5=thinking,Isn't that the point of this? We all come from different eras?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mia=surprised,Ooh, a power play! Well, I won't lose to you, attorney.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=surprised,So you're saying the rest of your tribe doesn't shave either?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zizou,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:7=surprised,Don't do it, Pit. She means that <i>very</i> literally.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zelda=teasing,So how's that Triforce of Wisdom working out for you?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:revy=teasing,Well, you still have the personality of a toilet, but at least you followed through.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=teasing,I dunno, Ochako. This might give you a popularity boost.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=teasing,What happened to not making things awkward, hmm?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=annoyed,Ah, paparazzi. I imagine this must be hard for someone so young like you.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zizou,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:6=teasing,I'm sure Pit would rather have a blessing from a beautiful goddess.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:5=annoyed,Okay, but did you have to spoil it for the rest of us?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mercy=horny,See? You're no angel. Just a human with a god complex.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=calm,Just be thankful this ordeal's almost over.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:6=glad,Well, laziness has it's value at times.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:9-10=thinking,Mar? ...Oh! You mean Marinette.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aella=teasing,With how much you're complaining, you'd think you'd never been naked before.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:shimakaze=worried,Maybe I should contact Poseidon to make sure no one's <i>actually</i> dying from this.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:do_better=surprised,Maybe focus on the game and not some silly spell and you'll do better.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:ruby=angry,You stop that right now. It's in bad taste.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:nayru,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=surprised,...Aren't you going to finish that?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingStage:7=glad,Being able to summon in general is a wonderful thing.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=glad,There we are. Just like I thought. Just gotta get that mask now...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=teasing,Is that an open invitation?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:mean=teasing,Bullies will get no sympathy from me.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:revy=annoyed,Makes sense. You two are like peas in a pod.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:morrigan,alsoPlayingStage:5=glad,To be honest, I prefer it like this. Better than going on a murderous rampage.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_f=thinking,I never took you for the type to shave, Corrin. Did your husband make you do it?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=surprised,...Did you really just do that?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:shego,alsoPlayingStage:8=thinking,Do the tabloids even care about the Flame Tribe?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:mei,alsoPlayingStage:7=teasing,You both have wonderful names to joke with. It's a conversation starter. Be thankful.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=teasing,I hope you're proud of your plan. Because I sincerely doubt you can grow back fur instantaneously...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah=teasing,Getting worried yet, warrior? You should be.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:2-3=glad,Some girls are secretive about this stuff. And it's not like you were willing to share your grooming habits until two minutes ago.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki,alsoPlaying:florina,count-lyn:1=teasing,Then tell us: who's the lucky recipient?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:miko=calm,I thought you already were, but sure, I'll try my best to defeat you.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:down_they_go=horny,You mean you still had it? You were standing here with nothing but that goofy-print underwear.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:blake,alsoPlaying:caleb=thinking,So Caleb, how much does a catgirl excite you compared to a human?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:do_or_die=awkward,I see.

-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:8=calm,That's fine. I'll just take in yours for a bit.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven,targetNotSaidMarker:strategic_decision=teasing,With what your wearing? Please. I have my suspicions this was all-too intentional.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=teasing,Someone with a questionable origin, that's who.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:pearl=calm,I always knew my gift of light could be used to make wonderful things!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:orendi,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=calm,Watching Rinkah fight a monster <i>could</i> be fun...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=calm,Enough of that, Misato. You <i>and</i> Rinkah are doing just fine.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:florina,alsoPlayingStage:8=surprised,Did you have this lotion on you?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,targetSaidMarker:spacebush,alsoPlaying:meia=calm,I mean, everyone grows 'em. It's just a matter of keeping them.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=angry,Listen, Moon. You may be beyond redemption, but I can still try and help. Let me take you in under my light!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chiaki=horny,I imagine you're the type to... admire my character model. So it's nice to turn the tide.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:step_it_up=thinking,(Sounds like a step back to me.)
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zone-tan=tranquil,Don't get too excited. You still have Zone-tan's forfeit to look forward to!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:revy,alsoPlayingStage:3=annoyed,That's pretty much my thoughts exactly. <i>Don't</i>.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:get_serious_now=thinking,That just sounds silly.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:felicia,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=glad,I think the idea's a little different for someone like Felicia, though...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:felicia,alsoPlayingStage:2-4=tranquil,Make sure you don't scratch it!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki,alsoPlaying:yuri=glad,Oh my. So you two've seen each other's, then?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=calm,You Schnee sisters really have no shame, huh?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:shave1,targetNotSaidMarker:hairy1=calm,No, it's not. It's probably just a little less common than going natural.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:shego,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=glad,No offense, Shego, but you probably can't take Rinkah in a fair fight.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:angie,alsoPlayingStage:9-10=teasing,Poor Angie. She's even jealous of the B-listers.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sayori=tranquil,Gone.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:yang=angry,You stop that right now. It's in bad taste.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette=thinking,I wouldn't say it's surprising, more... intriguing.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=horny,So this is what total humiliation looks like.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kyu=calm,Hmm. Yep, exactly as shameless as I've heard.

-2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryuji=surprised,Oh! That's much bigger than my average soldier. Might even outperform a few gods...
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible=calm,I mean, it's this lewd already, why not?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jolyne,targetTimeInStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=glad,It's not like she's lying to her self. She's just not in a hurry to admit it.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:chiaki=thinking,What type of games, exactly?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=annoyed,She does get rather grating after a while.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:raven,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=thinking,You're contradicting yourself. Although I have little doubt they really are monsters.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:6=thinking,I think that's the wrong game, Rinkah...
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=glad,Rinkah's from a tribe, but I'm pretty sure it's not an <i>island</i> tribe.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=awkward,Why? What made you into such a perverted woman?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=glad,Don't knock it 'til you try it. She might even make some more fitting underwear for you!
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:raven=tranquil,We've already had the big reveal. What's one more pair of breasts to the lot?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jolyne=calm,On the other hand, there's no better time to get back on your feet!
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:zoey,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=glad,Someone like Rinkah doesn't understand the meaning of the word modesty.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:alice_mgq=annoyed,...Well. Go on, then.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola=glad,I'm not expecting much. So you really can't let me down!
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:nayru,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=tranquil,I wonder how the other oracles would react to this. Or even my oracles?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:zizou=glad,Being scared is natural, I suppose. But your friend will get you through it.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=teasing,Really, you think I'm here to make enemies? That's just not worth my time. So yeah, call me a friend.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:felicia=surprised,Oh... you were serious?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:6=calm,Not everyone can be a Princess Peach. Rinkah's much more of a Magnus, but that's beside the point.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=tranquil,Don't worry, Rinkah. I already have been!
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:spooky=teasing,<i>Come on</i>. Would I laugh?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:7-8,count-zizou:1=calm,Humans can be so modest. Granted, you two are exceptionally so.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:natsuki=awkward,I think you forgot a period in there... or five.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:sheva=glad,I don't think Sheva herself is a zombie.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,alsoPlayingStage:5=thinking,Aren't we in one right now? Or am I overthinking it?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=worried,If you're going to fight, you should leave those bound, right?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:joey,targetStage:4=glad,Tata, bra! Let's see some tatas.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jenetta=tranquil,I bet a few people here have... although they were probably obscured by fur.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=thinking,I'd like to see what trick could possibly save you from this.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=horny,The whole leotard? You really aren't holding anything back, are you Mika?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:winter=calm,Hey, anything's better than such childish underwear to me.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:10,count-zizou:1=thinking,It's not like they're watching this live, though...
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:miko=teasing,Sounds like a bunch of excuses to me, Ms. Hermit.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:3=surprised,I thought nudity was taboo for humans?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=awkward,Zone-tan here is even blunter than you, Rinkah!
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=glad,There's many reserved princesses out there, but Rinkah's about as far as you can get from them.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah=horny,Do it! Release them from their binds!
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:marinette=annoyed,You're right, but you didn't have to be so blunt.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:clover,targetStage:5=teasing,Like I said before. Three dots.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:nayru=worried,You have hands, you know...
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=surprised,Oh! You're really using magic... for that. Well.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:not_1st,totalExposed:0=glad,There you go.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:elaine=glad,...For that exact reason.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:9,count-zizou:1=horny,You'll have to be more specific, because I see two girls at work here. Which part?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=calm,You knew all the right plays, didn't you Weiss? Apparently you're much better than you let on...
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:juri=teasing,Let's see if you can match my expectations.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=glad,Easy come, easy go.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:5-8=tranquil,Now <i>this</i> is interesting! How similar will they be to Weiss's, I wonder...
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sayori=glad,Can't be helped. The rules are absolute, even to me.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:revy=teasing,What's the matter? Only able to afford half a set?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:shimakaze=teasing,I'm curious; how sensitive are they?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:0-6,count-zizou:1=angry,I'm fairly certain at least one person in this room can see the future. How does no one know?
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible=annoyed,Huh? Those are hardly fitting to stand up next to me.
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible=worried,It's the thought that counts, I guess.
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:spooky,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=calm,Because humans would fear the name <i>Spooky</i>.
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:not_1st,totalExposed:1=thinking,Think of it like... you're blazing a trail. Wait, you lost your blazer, didn't you...
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:miko=awkward,I thought humans were past showing off their spouses like trophies...
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:spooky,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,Good luck with that. Pit's been finished more times than I can count, but he always comes back.
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:spooky,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=annoyed,Stop being cliche, Spooky.
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:hairy1,targetNotSaidMarker:shave1=teasing,What, your chest size? We knew it was tiny all along, honey.
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:spooky,alsoPlaying:elaine,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=teasing,You can't seem to keep ghosts out your hair, Elaine! You should call an exorcist or something.
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:spooky=thinking,Okay, great. Can we go back to the game now?
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:raven=calm,Not like I care about seeing naked demon girls anyway. I used to be close with Medusa, after all.
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:raven,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=tranquil,Ooh, a grizzly revenge story! How <i>edgy.</i>
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:zizou,alsoPlaying:pit=thinking,Are there even showers here?
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:natsuki=teasing,I <i>could</i> say a lot... but I won't.
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:sayori=teasing,Really though, what is there to see?
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:shimakaze=calm,You must either really be enjoying this or feel nothing at all to take so many in a row.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible=masturbate_c,There you go, nice and undressed. It's a good look for you...
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible=masturbate_b,You could pass as a Syren like that. Coincidentally, they go topless as well...
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,marker:pit_girlfriend=horny,So I've been looking to find Pit a girlfriend... you certainly fit the bill, ~name~.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:juri=thinking,I might have underestimated you, at this rate.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:sf=glad,Compared to what I've seen? Not really.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=teasing,You know, I didn't do that because you can't bring it back after the game. Hope you don't mind streaking.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=thinking,You've been hyping them all game, but I don't see the appeal.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:winter=teasing,Topless and... is that a wet spot?
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:alright_here_i_go=thinking,Good enough. We still have a hat and some panties to go, though!
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne=thinking,(Yep. No shame anymore now that she's had a chance to get over the shock.)
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:revy=calm,Eh, the tattoo's more interesting than your breasts, really.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:nayru=surprised,Was this planned? I didn't think you were so conniving!
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:nayru,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=thinking,Perhaps. I hope my presence doesn't make you... uncomfortable.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jenetta=surprised,You could see the whole time? That's awkward...
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rinkah=calm,I can see why you're the princess now.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:about_to_see_my_breasts=horny,They're probably just your type, ~player~.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:elaine=annoyed,Maybe don't brandish a knife next time?
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:321=thinking,Eh. Underwhelming, really. Not worth a countdown.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:isnt_too_bad=teasing,You're lucky I don't care enough to tell them.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:not_the_best_but=calm,Obviously. But humans probably go wild for them, right?
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola=calm,Sure, I've had my fun. I don't need to stare.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=teasing,What? The toned abs? She hardly seems like the type.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:4-7=thinking,Little confused by what you mean, Marinette. Jolyne is too, by the looks of it.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=glad,Never that simple, is it?
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:felicia=calm,She'd <i>have</i> to be good to not even try to hide 'em.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=teasing,Miss Morose has a sexual side after all. Congrats, Jolyne.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:zoey=glad,Maybe pay attention to things right in front of your face next time. Or below.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=glad,I'm pretty sure this Corrin's a married man, but I know what you're getting at.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:sayla,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=glad,What happened to theocracy? Or is that not in style in your worlds?
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:mahiru=horny,Don't listen to her, Mahiru. A photographer should be able to take as many pictures as she wants.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingStage:9=teasing,Then you're just not trying hard enough.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=glad,It's very reminiscint of a hot spring, right?
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:jin,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=tranquil,That's probably the best compliment you'll ever get, Jin.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:aimee=annoyed,Both this "darlin'" and this Laslow just sound like perverts.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=teasing,Then you're just not trying hard enough.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=thinking,Curious...
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss=teasing,Did you wet yourself out of embarrassment? Amazing. I've never seen a sorrier soldier. Weiss would probably be a better one, at this rate.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:zizou=horny,Funny how one word from the goddess turns you into an exhibitionist.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:aella,alsoPlayingStage:5-6=awkward,The humiliation of defeat stings far worse than losing these clothes, I agree.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=tranquil,I can neither confirm nor deny this.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:5-6=awkward,Must not get compliments very often. Poor thing...
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=tranquil,She's just being honest to a fault. I'm sure it's not personal.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=thinking,I suppose it doesn't matter for someone raised in a jungle anyway.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:clover,targetStage:6=annoyed,And just when things were getting interesting with you.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:aella=teasing,Of course it was an accident. Do you think she'd blow a chance to stay in the game longer?
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:meg,alsoPlayingStage:0=glad,Sounds about as nice as the Lunar Sanctum.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:buffy,alsoPlayingStage:2=glad,Take solace in the fact you have each other.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:6=glad,I think your act could use some work.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:2-3=glad,Most woman who come here are... transparent with their motives.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=thinking,Quite the underreaction. Or are you just flustered?
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=thinking,Only took you this long, huh? Slow for a space pirate.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=teasing,Maybe someone here just has that effect on you, Joetta.
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible=thinking,Reminds me of Pandora... large and blobby. Or perhaps they're more like her Amazon form?
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika,alsoPlaying:chun-li=annoyed,(What is it with Street Fighters wanting a big butt? Small or normal ones are fine!)
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:chiaki=glad,Sorry, but that's below me. Ask Pit if you want a rubdown. Nice mole, by the way.
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=glad,What a showwoman! I can respect that.
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia=thinking,(Surprisingly human-like anatomy...)
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:alice_mgq=glad,It's fine. We all know they're fake, anyway.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible=masturbate_a,I could use the company.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible=glad,I would've preferred if you were a guy, but I'll take what I can.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:miko,targetSaidMarker:LastWordL=tranquil,The best leaders know no fear, it's true.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nayru,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=calm,As did everyone else.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nayru=annoyed,I almost just wasted a magic spell on you. You could have let us know from the start, at least.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:miko,targetSaidMarker:LastWordN=glad,It's not so bad, right?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:natsuki=annoyed,Any time now.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:elaine=surprised,Elaine, is that a...?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:miko,targetSaidMarker:LastWordW=horny,Cheating isn't very becoming of a saint, you know.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:clover=teasing,Better start believing.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:spooky=glad,I'm almost surprised you're following them, to be honest.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=worried,...I have no words for what I'm seeing. And smelling.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sayori=calm,Going, going...
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mahiru,marker:mahirucheck=surprised,Oh! I expected you to be hairier. Or be completely shaved. Just not in between.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:winter=glad,You'll catch a cold if you stay in soaked panties too long. You probably should have removed them sooner.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kyu=glad,The old fashioned-way, huh? At least you'll go home <i>somewhat</i> clothed.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=teasing,Her too? <i>That's</i> dedication.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=thinking,Is the curtain necessary? I'm sure at least <i>someone</i> would be into this.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:shimakaze=awkward,How... gruesome.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rinkah=tranquil,Time to see you in your full, mangy glory!
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon,targetSaidMarker:moon_doesnt_wear_panties=awkward,Well, seeing how you said earlier that you don't wear panties, this can only end one way.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,Maybe I ought to have <i>you</i> wear that, just so you can learn to appreciate it! How about that, Pit?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:alice_mgq=glad,Not really much to gain from this. We can see the pubic hair situation and more already.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sola=surprised,Getting it over with? Fair enough.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki,targetSaidMarker:mahirucheck,targetNotSaidMarker:mahirucheck2,alsoPlaying:saki,alsoPlayingStage:7=surprised,The three of you certainly became fast friends.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki,targetSaidMarker:mahirucheck,targetNotSaidMarker:mahirucheck2,alsoPlaying:saki,alsoPlayingStage:9=surprised,The three of you certainly became fast friends.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki,targetSaidMarker:mahirucheck3,alsoPlaying:saki,alsoPlayingStage:7=surprised,The three of you certainly became fast friends.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki,targetSaidMarker:mahirucheck3,alsoPlaying:saki,alsoPlayingStage:9=surprised,The three of you certainly became fast friends.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=worried,Is it really in your best interests to fight naked?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=thinking,You really love tossing that camera of yours around, don't you?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=thinking,You really love tossing that camera of yours around, don't you?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:natsuki,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=awkward,...It's a bit late for that. For both of you.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=thinking,And now's not the time to fling hexes...
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=glad,Poor Weiss here's about to be scarred for life.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=calm,Such a skimpy little costume! I have no idea why you heroes think walking around in leotards is a good idea.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:sarcasm=teasing,Yes, Kyu. We're all so sorry to put you through this.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=glad,Now we'll see for sure how close you two are in body type.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jolyne=surprised,Not a very elegant location to write that...
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki,alsoPlaying:wiifitfemale=glad,I thought that was obvious from the start.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:miko=calm,Danger! Danger! Not good!
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jenetta=glad,Speedrun time!
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=teasing,You just can't keep your modesty, can you Amalia?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=glad,Just couldn't wait to drop your panties for us, huh?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki,alsoPlaying:pit=angry,She can fight her own fights, Pit. Let her be.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki=teasing,Out of "armor" already, Chiaki? I really expected you to clean house.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:juri=worried,(She's treating this less like a competition and more like a modeling gig.)
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=horny,I think I can take a good guess as to what it is...
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:revy=tranquil,Finally! I was getting sick of  your bellyaching, to be honest.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:zizou=teasing,Every part of that sentence was wrong, Sola.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=glad,Consider it a small victory. For you and you alone.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:futaba=glad,It's about as effective as censor bars in the East.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:shave1,targetNotSaidMarker:hairy1=glad,Why yes, Natsuki, we <i>do</i> have the same equipment down there. Even you and I.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible=tranquil,You can't really compare, but I guess that's alright.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible=teasing,Are you getting wet from watching all this? Or are you just a natural nympho?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:step_it_up=thinking,(Sounds like a step back to me.)
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=glad,There we are. Just like I thought. Just gotta get that mask now...
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kyu=calm,Hmm. Yep, exactly as shameless as I've heard.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:shimakaze=worried,Maybe I should contact Poseidon to make sure no one's <i>actually</i> dying from this.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=teasing,I hope you're proud of your plan. Because I sincerely doubt you can grow back fur instantaneously...
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola=awkward,In other words, cheating.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:spooky=calm,Yep, <i>very</i> interesting. Aside from the deathly palor, your body isn't that different from a living human's.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jolyne=glad,...Or a helpful one.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mercy=horny,See? You're no angel. Just a human with a god complex.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:revy=teasing,Well, you still have the personality of a toilet, but at least you followed through.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:juri=surprised,Hairy? That's the first time my intuition's been wrong about you.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven,targetNotSaidMarker:strategic_decision=teasing,With what your wearing? Please. I have my suspicions this was all-too intentional.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter=thinking,Is that so? Maybe someday.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jenetta=horny,Fastest crotch reveal yet! Impressive, Jenetta. But also a little sad.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki=teasing,And here I thought you hated cute stuff.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chiaki=horny,I imagine you're the type to... admire my character model. So it's nice to turn the tide.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=angry,Listen, Moon. You may be beyond redemption, but I can still try and help. Let me take you in under my light!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:nayru,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=surprised,...Aren't you going to finish that?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sayori=tranquil,Gone.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:clover=calm,Aw, how cute. You think a wooden axe can harm a goddess.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=horny,So this is what total humiliation looks like.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:shantae=glad,She's right, though. Dancing requires a very disciplined physique. One you have already!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:lilith=glad,I'd like to meet whoever came up with <i>that</i> name.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=teasing,What happened to not making things awkward, hmm?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:shaved=surprised,It actually looks pretty nice with no hair like that...
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=tranquil,Glad we're all in agreement that we look pretty cool!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:kyoko,alsoPlayingStage:0-2=teasing,Really, even a rock could figure <i>that</i> out.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=calm,Corrin won't talk. For his own sake most of all.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7,alsoPlaying:mahiru=tranquil,Excellent, Mahiru. She wants lots of pictures, so don't hold back anymore.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:saki,targetSaidMarker:mahirucheck,targetNotSaidMarker:mahirucheck2,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingStage:7=surprised,You're taking naked pictures together? Is that an initiation of some sort?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:saki,targetSaidMarker:mahirucheck,targetNotSaidMarker:mahirucheck2,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingStage:9=surprised,Are all Hope's Peak students this perverted?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:8=surprised,I think she said something about mugging you?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:saki,targetSaidMarker:mahirucheck3,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingStage:7=surprised,You're taking naked pictures together? Is that an initiation of some sort?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:7=calm,This whole night's been pretty wild, huh?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,Ooh, get her, Pit!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:nayru=calm,Does demonic possession turn you on? Not kink-shaming, just curious.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:saki,targetSaidMarker:mahirucheck3,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingStage:9=surprised,Are all Hope's Peak students this perverted?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chiaki,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=tranquil,Don't even mind taking nude pics together. What nice friends you two are.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chiaki,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=tranquil,Don't even mind taking nude pics together. What nice friends you two are.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=surprised,So you're saying the rest of your tribe doesn't shave either?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:wiifitfemale=glad,There's such a thing as too much pride, you know.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=teasing,I dunno, Ochako. This might give you a popularity boost.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=annoyed,Ah, paparazzi. I imagine this must be hard for someone so young like you.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:5=thinking,Isn't that the point of this? We all come from different eras?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:april,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=teasing,Now here's a newscast I'd want to watch.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:zoey=horny,Obviously. Who else would fight a war and then play strip poker?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:9s=glad,Maybe he meant the insides?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:april,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=surprised,I'm pretty sure news teams don't get that close, April!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=calm,Every style has its merits. I encourage you to try them all!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=calm,Enough of that, Misato. You <i>and</i> Rinkah are doing just fine.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:april=horny,Not very private when you're showing it off publicly.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki,alsoPlaying:yuri=glad,Oh my. So you two've seen each other's, then?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:miko=calm,I thought you already were, but sure, I'll try my best to defeat you.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:zizou=calm,From what I've seen from Zizou so far, that was a more tame response than I expected.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,targetSaidMarker:spacebush,alsoPlaying:meia=calm,I mean, everyone grows 'em. It's just a matter of keeping them.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven,alsoPlaying:felicia=glad,Let's just say your both bad at thinking things through.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki,alsoPlaying:florina,count-lyn:1=teasing,Then tell us: who's the lucky recipient?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven=teasing,And look at that! She's not even wearing panties! It's like you <i>want</i> to strut around bottomless.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=teasing,Is that an open invitation?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=worried,How? Through deception or brute force? It seems like a bad time either way...
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:alice_mgq=calm,I'm not impressed. No class at all.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:elaine=awkward,How abusive can a company get? Making you get a tattoo like that...
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:shego,alsoPlayingStage:8=thinking,Do the tabloids even care about the Flame Tribe?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:faye=thinking,I had no idea shaving was so common with both the lawful <i>and</i> lawless...
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:shego,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=glad,No offense, Shego, but you probably can't take Rinkah in a fair fight.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:mahiru=tranquil,And there's the icing on the proverbial cake. You should spread that around, Mahiru.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:revy,alsoPlayingStage:3=annoyed,That's pretty much my thoughts exactly. <i>Don't</i>.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:orendi,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=calm,Watching Rinkah fight a monster <i>could</i> be fun...
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:nagisa=worried,Nagisa, you do what you want. Don't let Winter here try and shave you.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=teasing,Someone with a questionable origin, that's who.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:xander=horny,I didn't know you were into the average Joes, Winter.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:morrigan,alsoPlayingStage:5=glad,To be honest, I prefer it like this. Better than going on a murderous rampage.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:spooky,alsoPlaying:chica=tranquil,Hey now, there aren't that many of us "alive" to begin with here!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:9-10=thinking,Mar? ...Oh! You mean Marinette.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=glad,You show that to any mortal man, and I'm sure you'd have him eating out of the palm of your hand.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=calm,Just be thankful this ordeal's almost over.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=surprised,That might be a little <i>too</i> personal for here, Spider-Woman.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah=teasing,Getting worried yet, warrior? You should be.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:5=annoyed,Okay, but did you have to spoil it for the rest of us?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zizou,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:6=teasing,I'm sure Pit would rather have a blessing from a beautiful goddess.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:do_or_die=awkward,I see.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:angie,alsoPlayingStage:9-10=teasing,Poor Angie. She's even jealous of the B-listers.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:felicia,alsoPlayingStage:2-4=tranquil,Make sure you don't scratch it!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:felicia,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=glad,I think the idea's a little different for someone like Felicia, though...
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:hairy1,targetNotSaidMarker:shave1=thinking,I really don't think that matters, Natsuki.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zizou,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:7=surprised,Don't do it, Pit. She means that <i>very</i> literally.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=tranquil,I think you two'd be cute together! And you're already dressed for the occasion.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:asuna,alsoPlayingStage:9-10=glad,That's not something any of us should concern ourselves with. Just shave as much as you want.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:0-2=calm,It's a nice philosophy. My warriors could use some of that, really.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=surprised,That's a lot of hair down there, ~name~! Have you ever considered shaving some of it? I have a spell I use for that.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=tranquil,After a blunder like that, who wouldn't be?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:shave1,targetNotSaidMarker:hairy1=calm,No, it's not. It's probably just a little less common than going natural.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:do_better=surprised,Maybe focus on the game and not some silly spell and you'll do better.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:florina,alsoPlayingStage:8=surprised,Did you have this lotion on you?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:2-6=worried,I think you <i>both</i> need your ears checked out.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:aella,alsoPlayingStage:6-7=glad,This is the one place where we <i>shouldn't</i> be ashamed. Well, apart from hot springs.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zizou,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:5=horny,He hasn't, but I would be curious to see how he did.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:down_they_go=horny,You mean you still had it? You were standing here with nothing but that goofy-print underwear.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=tranquil,You were looking for a man, right Jura? A lewd picture like that ought to do wonders on the search.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=calm,You Schnee sisters really have no shame, huh?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:get_serious_now=thinking,That just sounds silly.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zizou,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=glad,I grant you permission to admire it, but don't even think about worshipping it.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=surprised,(Doesn't even care that she just shaved. She really is a cat.)
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=horny,Ooh! You got something up your non-existant sleeve there, wood girl?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:8=calm,That's fine. I'll just take in yours for a bit.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=horny,I think we've earned our prize, wouldn't you agree?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:6=glad,Well, laziness has it's value at times.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=thinking,Maybe I should get a cat.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:2-3=glad,Some girls are secretive about this stuff. And it's not like you were willing to share your grooming habits until two minutes ago.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:mei,alsoPlayingStage:7=teasing,You both have wonderful names to joke with. It's a conversation starter. Be thankful.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingStage:7=glad,Being able to summon in general is a wonderful thing.

-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:link,targetStage:4=teasing,I always knew it was just an act.
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit,alsoPlaying:kyu=teasing,Absolutely. You should have seen his face after the Rewind Spring incident. He was red for days!
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=surprised,Are you talking about at the Rewind Spring? I was more focused on keeping you alive at the time, you know.
-1-male_chest_is_visible=calm,You came through in the end, ~name~, so I'll forgive you.
-1-male_chest_is_visible,target:ryuji=horny,Putting the "muscle" in "musclehead", I see.
-1-male_chest_is_visible,target:human=teasing,They say humans are the closest to the gods. Even you're good evidence for that claim, ~name~.

-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryuji=surprised,Oh! That's much bigger than my average soldier. Might even outperform a few gods...
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible=calm,It was only a matter of time. Don't worry, I won't look too long.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:raven,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=thinking,You're contradicting yourself. Although I have little doubt they really are monsters.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:winter=calm,Hey, anything's better than such childish underwear to me.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:marinette=annoyed,You're right, but you didn't have to be so blunt.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=worried,If you're going to fight, you should leave those bound, right?

-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:shimakaze=teasing,I'm curious; how sensitive are they?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:alice_mgq=annoyed,...Well. Go on, then.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:zoey,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=glad,Someone like Rinkah doesn't understand the meaning of the word modesty.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:miko=teasing,Sounds like a bunch of excuses to me, Ms. Hermit.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=glad,There's many reserved princesses out there, but Rinkah's about as far as you can get from them.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=teasing,Really, you think I'm here to make enemies? That's just not worth my time. So yeah, call me a friend.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah=horny,Do it! Release them from their binds!
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=tranquil,I sense a leak in the near future.

-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:elaine=glad,...For that exact reason.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=tranquil,Don't worry, Rinkah. I already have been!
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=annoyed,She does get rather grating after a while.

-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:juri=teasing,Let's see if you can match my expectations.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jenetta=tranquil,I bet a few people here have... although they were probably obscured by fur.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:joey,targetStage:4=glad,Tata, bra! Let's see some tatas.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jolyne=calm,On the other hand, there's no better time to get back on your feet!

-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:gogo=horny,Are you finally putting your money where your mouth is? Now I'm a little excited.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=thinking,I'd like to see what trick could possibly save you from this.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:6=calm,Not everyone can be a Princess Peach. Rinkah's much more of a Magnus, but that's beside the point.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:10,count-zizou:1=thinking,It's not like they're watching this live, though...
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mileena=teasing,Does that even qualify as clothing In the first place?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sayori=glad,Can't be helped. The rules are absolute, even to me.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:0-6,count-zizou:1=angry,I'm fairly certain at least one person in this room can see the future. How does no one know?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:natsuki=awkward,I think you forgot a period in there... or five.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola=glad,I'm not expecting much. So you really can't let me down!
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=surprised,Oh...That's good to hear.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:9,count-zizou:1=horny,You'll have to be more specific, because I see two girls at work here. Which part?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=horny,The whole leotard? You really aren't holding anything back, are you Mika?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:7-8,count-zizou:1=calm,Humans can be so modest. Granted, you two are exceptionally so.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:revy=teasing,What's the matter? Only able to afford half a set?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:clover,targetStage:5=teasing,Like I said before. Three dots.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:felicia=surprised,Oh... you were serious?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=glad,Easy come, easy go.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:nayru,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=tranquil,I wonder how the other oracles would react to this. Or even my oracles?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:raven=tranquil,We've already had the big reveal. What's one more pair of breasts to the lot?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jolyne,targetTimeInStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=glad,It's not like she's lying to her self. She's just not in a hurry to admit it.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:chiaki=thinking,What type of games, exactly?
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible=glad,I'm sure someone here likes 'em, ~name~.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:not_1st,totalExposed:1=thinking,Think of it like... you're blazing a trail. Wait, you lost your blazer, didn't you...
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:sayori=teasing,Really though, what is there to see?
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:hairy1,targetNotSaidMarker:shave1=teasing,What, your chest size? We knew it was tiny all along, honey.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:meg=calm,I don't know what you were so upset about. There's more to life than breast size, you know. For example, maybe ~player~ is a leg person.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:natsuki=teasing,I <i>could</i> say a lot... but I won't.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:shimakaze=calm,You must either really be enjoying this or feel nothing at all to take so many in a row.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:spooky=thinking,Okay, great. Can we go back to the game now?
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:raven=calm,Not like I care about seeing naked demon girls anyway. I used to be close with Medusa, after all.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:spooky,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,Good luck with that. Pit's been finished more times than I can count, but he always comes back.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:miko=awkward,I thought humans were past showing off their spouses like trophies...
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:spooky,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=annoyed,Stop being cliche, Spooky.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:spooky,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=calm,Because humans would fear the name <i>Spooky</i>.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:raven,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=tranquil,Ooh, a grizzly revenge story! How <i>edgy.</i>
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:zizou,alsoPlaying:pit=thinking,Are there even showers here?
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:spooky,alsoPlaying:elaine,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=teasing,You can't seem to keep ghosts out your hair, Elaine! You should call an exorcist or something.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible=thinking,You've got a good body. Wonder how compatible you'd be with Pit...
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,marker:pit_girlfriend=horny,I've been looking to find Pit a girlfriend... with a body like that, he'd be all over you.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=thinking,Quite the underreaction. Or are you just flustered?
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:piper=worried,What a harsh environment to not even be able to get the clothes you need... you have my condolences.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:juri=thinking,I might have underestimated you, at this rate.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=teasing,You know, I didn't do that because you can't bring it back after the game. Hope you don't mind streaking.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:revy=teasing,I'm going to enjoy putting you in your place, you crude girl.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:pauling=horny,(<i>Considering how much she puts out, I'm surprised she never got with the Scout.</i>)
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:zelda=surprised,So unashamed... guess you've got Farore's courage in you.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=worried,You sure it didn't hurt you? That one looked awful close.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=glad,I think you have the wrong idea about this game... you want to <i>keep</i> your underwear on...
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:felicia=calm,She'd <i>have</i> to be good to not even try to hide 'em.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:zone-tan=teasing,Zone-tan's a real party girl, huh?...Close your mouth, ~player~.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=glad,I'm pretty sure this Corrin's a married man, but I know what you're getting at.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=thinking,I suppose it doesn't matter for someone raised in a jungle anyway.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=teasing,Maybe someone here just has that effect on you, Joetta.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:mercy=calm,Those are easily an eight. Maybe even better.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:6=glad,I think your act could use some work.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:nayru=surprised,Was this planned? I didn't think you were so conniving!
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rinkah=calm,I can see why you're the princess now.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:about_to_see_my_breasts=horny,They're probably just your type, ~player~.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:isnt_too_bad=teasing,You're lucky I don't care enough to tell them.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:elaine=annoyed,Maybe don't brandish a knife next time?
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=thinking,You've been hyping them all game, but I don't see the appeal.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:321=thinking,Eh. Underwhelming, really. Not worth a countdown.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:not_the_best_but=calm,Obviously. But humans probably go wild for them, right?
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:winter=teasing,Topless and... is that a wet spot?
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jenetta=surprised,You could see the whole time? That's awkward...
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:sf=glad,Compared to what I've seen? Not really.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:clover,targetStage:6=annoyed,And just when things were getting interesting with you.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:nayru,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=thinking,Perhaps. I hope my presence doesn't make you... uncomfortable.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola=calm,Sure, I've had my fun. I don't need to stare.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:alright_here_i_go=thinking,Good enough. We still have a hat and some panties to go, though!
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne=thinking,(Yep. No shame anymore now that she's had a chance to get over the shock.)
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:jin,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=tranquil,That's probably the best compliment you'll ever get, Jin.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_f=teasing,Maybe someday you'll reach Robin's level of tactical prowess. But today is not that day.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:aimee=annoyed,Both this "darlin'" and this Laslow just sound like perverts.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:buffy,alsoPlayingStage:2=glad,Take solace in the fact you have each other.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:aella,alsoPlayingStage:5-6=awkward,The humiliation of defeat stings far worse than losing these clothes, I agree.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss=teasing,Did you wet yourself out of embarrassment? Amazing. I've never seen a sorrier soldier. Weiss would probably be a better one, at this rate.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:zizou=horny,Funny how one word from the goddess turns you into an exhibitionist.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:5-6=awkward,Must not get compliments very often. Poor thing...
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:yang=surprised,Wait, hold on. Neo's a mimic?
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:meg,alsoPlayingStage:0=glad,Sounds about as nice as the Lunar Sanctum.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:zoey=glad,Maybe pay attention to things right in front of your face next time. Or below.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=teasing,What? The toned abs? She hardly seems like the type.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:aella=teasing,Of course it was an accident. Do you think she'd blow a chance to stay in the game longer?
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=thinking,Only took you this long, huh? Slow for a space pirate.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:4-7=thinking,Little confused by what you mean, Marinette. Jolyne is too, by the looks of it.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:6=teasing,Miss Morose has a sexual side after all. Congrats, Jolyne.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:ruby=surprised,Wait, hold on. Neo's a mimic?
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:2-3=glad,Most woman who come here are... transparent with their motives.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=glad,It's very reminiscint of a hot spring, right?
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:raven=tranquil,Methinks the Azarathian is conflicted.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:shego=teasing,Yes, clearly.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:sayla,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=glad,What happened to theocracy? Or is that not in style in your worlds?
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=tranquil,She's just being honest to a fault. I'm sure it's not personal.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingStage:9=teasing,Then you're just not trying hard enough.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sayla=annoyed,In my opinion, this shouldn't be allowed... but I'll let it slide, just so I can rub it in when I win later.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:mahiru=horny,Don't listen to her, Mahiru. A photographer should be able to take as many pictures as she wants.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=teasing,Then you're just not trying hard enough.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=thinking,Curious...
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=tranquil,I can neither confirm nor deny this.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=glad,Never that simple, is it?
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible=thinking,You know, you'd make a pretty good model. Certainly have the body for it...
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=glad,What a showwoman! I can respect that.
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:seven=surprised,You're certainly attractive for a space-goer, Seven. Certainly moreso than a space pirate.
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:chiaki=glad,Sorry, but that's below me. Ask Pit if you want a rubdown. Nice mole, by the way.
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia=thinking,(Surprisingly human-like anatomy...)
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika,alsoPlaying:chun-li=annoyed,(What is it with Street Fighters wanting a big butt? Small or normal ones are fine!)
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:april=thinking,(<i>Why do I suddenly have a craving for pizza?</i>)
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:alice_mgq=glad,It's fine. We all know they're fake, anyway.
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:korra=horny,Sorry to stare, but that's the way this game goes...
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:chara=tranquil,Guess what they say about drinking milk is true after all!
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible=teasing,The competition will be fierce, ~name~. Not that you could back down...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nayru,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=calm,As did everyone else.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:miko,targetSaidMarker:LastWordL=tranquil,The best leaders know no fear, it's true.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:miko,targetSaidMarker:LastWordN=glad,It's not so bad, right?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:miko,targetSaidMarker:LastWordW=horny,Cheating isn't very becoming of a saint, you know.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:daphne=teasing,Gather round, gang. Let's see- I mean get to, the bottom of this mystery.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:shave1,targetNotSaidMarker:hairy1=glad,Why yes, Natsuki, we <i>do</i> have the same equipment down there. Even you and I.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan=glad,I don't care either way, but I think ~player~ might wet themselves.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette=calm,Come now, have a little more faith in us... no pun intended.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mahiru,marker:mahirucheck=surprised,Oh! I expected you to be hairier. Or be completely shaved. Just not in between.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,targetSaidMarker:bodysuit,targetNotSaidMarker:bodysuitsolomarinette=teasing,Oh, I see. I don't mind teaching you, but I'd have to teach all of you for the sake of fairness.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kyu=glad,The old fashioned-way, huh? At least you'll go home <i>somewhat</i> clothed.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=teasing,Her too? <i>That's</i> dedication.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:futaba=glad,It's about as effective as censor bars in the East.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=teasing,You just can't keep your modesty, can you Amalia?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=thinking,Is the curtain necessary? I'm sure at least <i>someone</i> would be into this.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki=teasing,Out of "armor" already, Chiaki? I really expected you to clean house.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,Maybe I ought to have <i>you</i> wear that, just so you can learn to appreciate it! How about that, Pit?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=glad,Just couldn't wait to drop your panties for us, huh?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:natsuki=annoyed,Any time now.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:clover=teasing,Better start believing.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:spooky=glad,I'm almost surprised you're following them, to be honest.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:juri=worried,(She's treating this less like a competition and more like a modeling gig.)
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:shimakaze=awkward,How... gruesome.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=horny,I think I can take a good guess as to what it is...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:raven=glad,I don't care either way, but I think Raven might wet herself.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=thinking,You really love tossing that camera of yours around, don't you?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:miko=calm,Danger! Danger! Not good!
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:sarcasm=teasing,Yes, Kyu. We're all so sorry to put you through this.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:alice_mgq=glad,Not really much to gain from this. We can see the pubic hair situation and more already.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=glad,Now we'll see for sure how close you two are in body type.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=thinking,You really love tossing that camera of yours around, don't you?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:winter=glad,You'll catch a cold if you stay in soaked panties too long. You probably should have removed them sooner.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nayru=annoyed,I almost just wasted a magic spell on you. You could have let us know from the start, at least.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:natsuki,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=awkward,...It's a bit late for that. For both of you.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rinkah=tranquil,Time to see you in your full, mangy glory!
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:elaine=surprised,Elaine, is that a...?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=glad,Poor Weiss here's about to be scarred for life.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=thinking,And now's not the time to fling hexes...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=worried,...I have no words for what I'm seeing. And smelling.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:creepy=horny,Not so tough now that you're about to lose, huh?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sayori=calm,Going, going...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=worried,Is it really in your best interests to fight naked?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki,targetSaidMarker:mahirucheck3,alsoPlaying:saki,alsoPlayingStage:9=surprised,The three of you certainly became fast friends.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jolyne=surprised,Not a very elegant location to write that...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:zizou=teasing,Every part of that sentence was wrong, Sola.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=glad,Consider it a small victory. For you and you alone.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sola=surprised,Getting it over with? Fair enough.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=calm,Such a skimpy little costume! I have no idea why you heroes think walking around in leotards is a good idea.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki,alsoPlaying:wiifitfemale=glad,I thought that was obvious from the start.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki,targetSaidMarker:mahirucheck,targetNotSaidMarker:mahirucheck2,alsoPlaying:saki,alsoPlayingStage:7=surprised,The three of you certainly became fast friends.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon,targetSaidMarker:moon_doesnt_wear_panties=awkward,Well, seeing how you said earlier that you don't wear panties, this can only end one way.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki,targetSaidMarker:mahirucheck3,alsoPlaying:saki,alsoPlayingStage:7=surprised,The three of you certainly became fast friends.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jenetta=glad,Speedrun time!
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:revy=tranquil,Finally! I was getting sick of  your bellyaching, to be honest.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki,alsoPlaying:pit=angry,She can fight her own fights, Pit. Let her be.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki,targetSaidMarker:mahirucheck,targetNotSaidMarker:mahirucheck2,alsoPlaying:saki,alsoPlayingStage:9=surprised,The three of you certainly became fast friends.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible=tranquil,Now <i>that's</i> a body worth showing off!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:spooky=calm,Yep, <i>very</i> interesting. Aside from the deathly palor, your body isn't that different from a living human's.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=angry,Listen, Moon. You may be beyond redemption, but I can still try and help. Let me take you in under my light!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:exhibitionist=horny,I think I see why you'd want to show off like you do...
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:princess=teasing,Remember, ~name~: a princess is always inferior to a goddess.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah=teasing,Getting worried yet, warrior? You should be.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:alice_mgq=calm,I'm not impressed. No class at all.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:shaved=surprised,It actually looks pretty nice with no hair like that...
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=surprised,That's a lot of hair down there, ~name~! Have you ever considered shaving some of it? I have a spell I use for that.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter=thinking,Is that so? Maybe someday.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:mean=teasing,Bullies will get no sympathy from me.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:nayru=calm,Does demonic possession turn you on? Not kink-shaming, just curious.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:ginger=horny,Look at you! You're almost as red as your hair!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:miko=calm,I thought you already were, but sure, I'll try my best to defeat you.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:felicia,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=glad,I think the idea's a little different for someone like Felicia, though...
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sayori=tranquil,Gone.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:angie,alsoPlayingStage:9-10=teasing,Poor Angie. She's even jealous of the B-listers.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:asuna,alsoPlayingStage:9-10=glad,That's not something any of us should concern ourselves with. Just shave as much as you want.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:0-2=calm,It's a nice philosophy. My warriors could use some of that, really.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:5=annoyed,Okay, but did you have to spoil it for the rest of us?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:6=glad,Well, laziness has it's value at times.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=surprised,That might be a little <i>too</i> personal for here, Spider-Woman.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:5=thinking,Isn't that the point of this? We all come from different eras?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=surprised,So you're saying the rest of your tribe doesn't shave either?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:7=calm,This whole night's been pretty wild, huh?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:8=surprised,I think she said something about mugging you?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:kyoko,alsoPlayingStage:0-2=teasing,Really, even a rock could figure <i>that</i> out.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=tranquil,Glad we're all in agreement that we look pretty cool!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=calm,Every style has its merits. I encourage you to try them all!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:9-10=thinking,Mar? ...Oh! You mean Marinette.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=calm,Enough of that, Misato. You <i>and</i> Rinkah are doing just fine.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:morrigan,alsoPlayingStage:5=glad,To be honest, I prefer it like this. Better than going on a murderous rampage.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=teasing,Someone with a questionable origin, that's who.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:orendi,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=calm,Watching Rinkah fight a monster <i>could</i> be fun...
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:revy,alsoPlayingStage:3=annoyed,That's pretty much my thoughts exactly. <i>Don't</i>.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:shego,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=glad,No offense, Shego, but you probably can't take Rinkah in a fair fight.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:shego,alsoPlayingStage:8=thinking,Do the tabloids even care about the Flame Tribe?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=teasing,Is that an open invitation?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki,alsoPlaying:florina,count-lyn:1=teasing,Then tell us: who's the lucky recipient?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,targetSaidMarker:spacebush,alsoPlaying:meia=calm,I mean, everyone grows 'em. It's just a matter of keeping them.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:blake,alsoPlaying:caleb=thinking,So Caleb, how much does a catgirl excite you compared to a human?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:revy=annoyed,Makes sense. You two are like peas in a pod.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:ruby=angry,You stop that right now. It's in bad taste.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:aella,alsoPlayingStage:6-7=glad,This is the one place where we <i>shouldn't</i> be ashamed. Well, apart from hot springs.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:yang=angry,You stop that right now. It's in bad taste.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=calm,You Schnee sisters really have no shame, huh?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingStage:7=glad,Being able to summon in general is a wonderful thing.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:shimakaze=worried,Maybe I should contact Poseidon to make sure no one's <i>actually</i> dying from this.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7,alsoPlaying:mahiru=tranquil,Excellent, Mahiru. She wants lots of pictures, so don't hold back anymore.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:saki,targetSaidMarker:mahirucheck,targetNotSaidMarker:mahirucheck2,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingStage:7=surprised,You're taking naked pictures together? Is that an initiation of some sort?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:saki,targetSaidMarker:mahirucheck,targetNotSaidMarker:mahirucheck2,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingStage:9=surprised,Are all Hope's Peak students this perverted?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:saki,targetSaidMarker:mahirucheck3,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingStage:7=surprised,You're taking naked pictures together? Is that an initiation of some sort?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:saki,targetSaidMarker:mahirucheck3,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingStage:9=surprised,Are all Hope's Peak students this perverted?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chiaki,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=tranquil,Don't even mind taking nude pics together. What nice friends you two are.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chiaki,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=tranquil,Don't even mind taking nude pics together. What nice friends you two are.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=teasing,I dunno, Ochako. This might give you a popularity boost.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=annoyed,Ah, paparazzi. I imagine this must be hard for someone so young like you.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:april,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=teasing,Now here's a newscast I'd want to watch.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:april,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=surprised,I'm pretty sure news teams don't get that close, April!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=glad,You show that to any mortal man, and I'm sure you'd have him eating out of the palm of your hand.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=tranquil,You were looking for a man, right Jura? A lewd picture like that ought to do wonders on the search.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=thinking,Maybe I should get a cat.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=surprised,(Doesn't even care that she just shaved. She really is a cat.)
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zizou,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=glad,I grant you permission to admire it, but don't even think about worshipping it.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zizou,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:5=horny,He hasn't, but I would be curious to see how he did.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zizou,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:6=teasing,I'm sure Pit would rather have a blessing from a beautiful goddess.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zizou,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:7=surprised,Don't do it, Pit. She means that <i>very</i> literally.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=tranquil,After a blunder like that, who wouldn't be?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:2-6=worried,I think you <i>both</i> need your ears checked out.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:felicia,alsoPlayingStage:2-4=tranquil,Make sure you don't scratch it!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:florina,alsoPlayingStage:8=surprised,Did you have this lotion on you?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:8=calm,That's fine. I'll just take in yours for a bit.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:2-3=glad,Some girls are secretive about this stuff. And it's not like you were willing to share your grooming habits until two minutes ago.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:mei,alsoPlayingStage:7=teasing,You both have wonderful names to joke with. It's a conversation starter. Be thankful.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=horny,So this is what total humiliation looks like.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki,alsoPlaying:yuri=glad,Oh my. So you two've seen each other's, then?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=tranquil,I think you two'd be cute together! And you're already dressed for the occasion.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:april=horny,Not very private when you're showing it off publicly.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dawn=surprised,I was unaware humans could get natural hair that colorful! Thought it was a god-only thing...
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dawn=horny,Now I'm no expert in house design, but know that yours is very pleasing to the eyes, Dawn.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:pauling=teasing,That body just screams 'Seduce me!', very nice.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=calm,Just be thankful this ordeal's almost over.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zelda=teasing,So how's that Triforce of Wisdom working out for you?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:arwen=horny,Now I know why they call elves "the fairer folk".
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lara=horny,Guess the "nude code" exists after all!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:may=teasing,Yes, we can definitely tell.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven=teasing,A bra but no bottoms? How risque!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:shantae=awkward,The way you swing your hips is... mesmerizing...
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:tracer=horny,Ah, <i>there's</i> the butt that broke the Internet.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zone-tan=tranquil,Don't get too excited. You still have Zone-tan's forfeit to look forward to!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette=thinking,I wouldn't say it's surprising, more... intriguing.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_f=thinking,I never took you for the type to shave, Corrin. Did your husband make you do it?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:pearl=calm,I always knew my gift of light could be used to make wonderful things!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=surprised,...Did you really just do that?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kyu=calm,Hmm. Yep, exactly as shameless as I've heard.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=glad,There we are. Just like I thought. Just gotta get that mask now...
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=teasing,I hope you're proud of your plan. Because I sincerely doubt you can grow back fur instantaneously...
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chiaki=horny,I imagine you're the type to... admire my character model. So it's nice to turn the tide.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki=teasing,And here I thought you hated cute stuff.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:clover=calm,Aw, how cute. You think a wooden axe can harm a goddess.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:juri=surprised,Hairy? That's the first time my intuition's been wrong about you.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mercy=horny,See? You're no angel. Just a human with a god complex.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jolyne=glad,...Or a helpful one.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola=awkward,In other words, cheating.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:revy=teasing,Well, you still have the personality of a toilet, but at least you followed through.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jenetta=horny,Fastest crotch reveal yet! Impressive, Jenetta. But also a little sad.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:elaine=tranquil,They should call you Elaine Marley, Mighty Fine Lady (tm)!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mia=surprised,Ooh, a power play! Well, I won't lose to you, attorney.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rosalina=worried,Seeing a fellow goddess exposed hits a lot closer to home than the others.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lux=angry,It's not even natural? ...how can you call yourself a warrior of light?!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:zizou=calm,From what I've seen from Zizou so far, that was a more tame response than I expected.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven,alsoPlaying:felicia=glad,Let's just say your both bad at thinking things through.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=worried,How? Through deception or brute force? It seems like a bad time either way...
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:faye=thinking,I had no idea shaving was so common with both the lawful <i>and</i> lawless...
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:mahiru=tranquil,And there's the icing on the proverbial cake. You should spread that around, Mahiru.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:nagisa=worried,Nagisa, you do what you want. Don't let Winter here try and shave you.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:xander=horny,I didn't know you were into the average Joes, Winter.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:spooky,alsoPlaying:chica=tranquil,Hey now, there aren't that many of us "alive" to begin with here!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:9s=glad,Maybe he meant the insides?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=teasing,What happened to not making things awkward, hmm?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:daisy=calm,Oh! Daisy! ...guess you're the genuine article, then.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:lilith=glad,I'd like to meet whoever came up with <i>that</i> name.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,Ooh, get her, Pit!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:shantae=glad,She's right, though. Dancing requires a very disciplined physique. One you have already!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=calm,Corrin won't talk. For his own sake most of all.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:zoey=horny,Obviously. Who else would fight a war and then play strip poker?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:nayru,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=surprised,...Aren't you going to finish that?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven,targetNotSaidMarker:strategic_decision=teasing,With what your wearing? Please. I have my suspicions this was all-too intentional.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:wiifitfemale=glad,There's such a thing as too much pride, you know.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:get_serious_now=thinking,That just sounds silly.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:down_they_go=horny,You mean you still had it? You were standing here with nothing but that goofy-print underwear.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:do_or_die=awkward,I see.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:step_it_up=thinking,(Sounds like a step back to me.)
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:do_better=surprised,Maybe focus on the game and not some silly spell and you'll do better.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:shave1,targetNotSaidMarker:hairy1=calm,No, it's not. It's probably just a little less common than going natural.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:hairy1,targetNotSaidMarker:shave1=thinking,I really don't think that matters, Natsuki.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=horny,I think we've earned our prize, wouldn't you agree?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=horny,Ooh! You got something up your non-existant sleeve there, wood girl?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=surprised,I'm shocked you actually went for it... and then flashed us to boot...




#OPPONENT MASTURBATING
#When an opponent is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must pay the penalty by masturbating in front of everyone.
#The "must_masturbate" line is for just before it happens, and the "start_masturbating" line immediately follows.
#The "masturbating" line will be spoken a little after the opponent has started but before they climax.
#When the opponent climaxes, your character will say the "finished_masturbating" line.

#fully clothed
0-male_must_masturbate=tranquil,Now that's what I call a total butt-kicking! Better get started, ~name~.
0-male_must_masturbate=calm,Did you come here just to masturbate? Looks like you got your wish.
0-male_must_masturbate,target:ryuji=horny,I'm excited to see how you put one that size to work...

0-male_must_masturbate,target:pit,totalAlive:2=tranquil,Good game, Pit. But you knew this would be the outcome from the start, didn't you?
0-male_must_masturbate,target:pit,totalAlive:5-3=surprised,Pit's out? Surprising! I thought for sure he'd be my last opponent.
0-male_start_masturbating=calm,I'm looking forward to your display.
0-male_start_masturbating=horny,I didn't think I'd get a free show when I came here...
0-male_start_masturbating,target:ryuji=glad,Don't think of it like something weird. Think of it as... a teaching. For me.
0-male_start_masturbating,target:ryuji,totalFemales:2-4=glad,Don't think of it like something weird. Think of it as... a teaching. For me and all the ladies here.
0-male_start_masturbating,target:9s=teasing,Only one way to find out!
0-male_start_masturbating,target:kira=surprised,...Is that Mewtwo?
0-male_start_masturbating,target:pit=teasing,Well, obviously. This is the consolation prize for our other players!
0-male_masturbating=tranquil,Such vigor! Such enthusiasm! Guess this isn't your first time.
0-male_masturbating,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,priority:0=annoyed,Can you hurry this up? This is starting to get boring. You feel the same, ~player~?
0-male_masturbating,target:ryu,priority:0=horny,If only this was the turbo edition...
0-male_masturbating,target:xander,priority:0=tranquil,Yep. Exactly the sort of performance I'd expect from a normal guy like you, Xander.
0-male_masturbating,target:ryuji,priority:0=calm,Must be a piece of cake, huh? <i>I'm</i> here, after all.
0-male_masturbating,target:human,priority:0=surprised,What a champion!
0-male_masturbating,target:human,priority:0=worried,I'm starting to get into this myself.
0-male_masturbating,target:human,priority:0=calm,Are you getting close? I think he's getting close.
0-male_masturbating,target:human,priority:0=teasing,I can tell ~player~ is thinking something...naughty.
0-male_masturbating,target:pit,priority:0=glad,You're doing great, Pit. Really.
0-male_masturbating,target:9s,priority:0=surprised,Oh, you are a quick learner, aren't you? Well, I guess it makes sense for an android...
0-male_finished_masturbating=teasing,There it goes! You should've known better than to mess with a goddess.
0-male_finished_masturbating=teasing,You really don't last long, ~name~. That was over as fast as it started.
0-male_finished_masturbating,target:human=tranquil,You didn't do half bad, ~name~!
0-male_finished_masturbating,target:captain_falcon=horny,A showman as always, Falcon. I liked it a lot.
0-male_finished_masturbating,target:pit=teasing,You really <i>are</i> finished this time.
0-male_finished_masturbating,target:9s=horny,Seems our little robotic friend is firing blanks.
0-male_finished_masturbating,target:ryuji=tranquil,Well done! I enjoyed every minute of that, Ryuji.
0-female_must_masturbate=thinking,Out already? Talk about an overwhelming victory...
0-female_must_masturbate,target:kyu,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:8-9=tranquil,Really? Surprisingly nice of you, Kyu.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:shego=glad,You put up a good fight, but good always wins in the end.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:shego=teasing,Aren't you supposed to be a "crafty villain"? Medusa would have done <i>way</i> better.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:alice_mgq=tranquil,That went... smoother than I expected.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:nayru=surprised,This really was a voluntary thing?
0-female_must_masturbate,target:rinkah=glad,Warrior spirit wasn't enough to edge out a win. Time for the forfeit!
0-female_must_masturbate,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=glad,You outlasted Winter, Weiss. That's something to be proud of, right?
0-female_must_masturbate,target:ruby=thinking,I honestly would've thought you'd bring your weapon for this, but the old fashioned way works too.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:miko=angry,Don't leave! You still have something to do!
0-female_must_masturbate,target:mileena=calm,I don't feel the least bit bad for you.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:monika,alsoPlaying:sayori,alsoPlayingStage:8-9,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:affections-glitch=surprised,Sayori? Where are you going?
0-female_must_masturbate,target:elaine=glad,<i>Get ready to walk the plank!</i>
0-female_must_masturbate,target:peach=glad,A shame Peach, but I imagine this is easier than, say, streaking in a military base.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:mia=calm,How does it feel to be the one cornered for once, Mia?
0-female_must_masturbate,target:marceline=calm,Good attempt, but futile. Now, guess what time it is?
0-female_must_masturbate,target:kyoko=thinking,You seem pretty scared, Kyoko. Are you up to this?
0-female_must_masturbate,filter:virtual=horny,I hope the girl behind the avatar is playing along, if you catch my drift.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:spooky=teasing,Just be glad you're not one of those whispy ghosts with no legs.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:moon=awkward,No good. She's hardly taken a glance at me all night.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:shazza=horny,I've always wanted to pet a dingo, but I'll settle for watching one pet herself.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:mei=glad,Are you used to <i>this</i>type of experiment, Mei?
0-female_must_masturbate,target:chiaki=glad,Chiaki's first? Seems gaming skill and luck don't exactly correlate.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:yang=calm,Sorry Yang, but you were <i>way</i> too predictable. Weren't you supposed to be a poker master or something?
0-female_must_masturbate,target:chiaki=glad,Game over for you.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:competitive=surprised,Oh? You almost look disappointed.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:aella=annoyed,"Oh boy"? That's all? That's an underreaction if I ever heard one.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:mahiru,marker:mahirucheck2=teasing,I bet you do this type of thing all the time when you're alone, right Mahiru?
0-female_must_masturbate,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:table,targetNotSaidMarker:tablec=glad,Understandable, but maybe not until the game's over?
0-female_must_masturbate,target:streaming-chan=surprised,Umm... did you forget you still have a hat?
0-female_must_masturbate,target:amalia=glad,Cheaters don't prosper. Pay up, wood girl!
0-female_must_masturbate,target:kyu=glad,And no one was surprised at this turn of events.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:rainbow_mika=surprised,You're just skipping the mask? Well, a win's a win...
0-female_must_masturbate,target:felicia=tranquil,A bit later than I was hoping, but here we are.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:raven,totalMasturbating:1-2=annoyed,Thanks for telling me the obvious. I had no intentions of watching you from the start.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:joey=calm,Maybe you shouldn't have clowned around so much.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:natsuki=calm,Well, go on then. Don't want to disappoint us, do you?

0-female_start_masturbating,target:nagisa=tranquil,Is this the usual way humans put on plays? Maybe Pit wouldn't always fall asleep during them if they were like this!

1-female_must_masturbate,target:sayori=glad,Yeah, kind of. Tough luck.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:elaine=glad,<i>Get ready to walk the plank!</i>
1-female_must_masturbate,target:raven=surprised,Oh, I almost forgot about you. You lost, right?
1-female_must_masturbate,target:winter=thinking,Looks like her day just went from bad to worse.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:shazza=horny,I've always wanted to pet a dingo, but I'll settle for watching one pet herself.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:mileena=calm,I don't feel the least bit bad for you.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:table,targetNotSaidMarker:tablec=glad,Understandable, but maybe not until the game's over?
1-female_must_masturbate,target:aella=annoyed,"Oh boy"? That's all? That's an underreaction if I ever heard one.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:amalia=glad,Cheaters don't prosper. Pay up, wood girl!
1-female_must_masturbate,target:kyu=glad,And no one was surprised at this turn of events.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:chiaki=glad,Game over for you.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:rainbow_mika=surprised,You're just skipping the mask? Well, a win's a win...
1-female_must_masturbate,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:competitive=surprised,Oh? You almost look disappointed.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:raven,totalMasturbating:1-2=annoyed,Thanks for telling me the obvious. I had no intentions of watching you from the start.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:chiaki=glad,Chiaki's first? Seems gaming skill and luck don't exactly correlate.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:mei=glad,Are you used to <i>this</i>type of experiment, Mei?
1-female_must_masturbate,target:felicia=tranquil,A bit later than I was hoping, but here we are.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:shego=glad,You put up a good fight, but good always wins in the end.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:shego=teasing,Aren't you supposed to be a "crafty villain"? Medusa would have done <i>way</i> better.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:joey=calm,Maybe you shouldn't have clowned around so much.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:nayru,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=glad,Experience trumps all, I suppose, Nayru.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:yang=calm,Sorry Yang, but you were <i>way</i> too predictable. Weren't you supposed to be a poker master or something?
1-female_must_masturbate,target:natsuki=calm,Well, go on then. Don't want to disappoint us, do you?
1-female_must_masturbate,target:wiifitfemale=teasing,Now <i>this</i> is a workout I'd like to see in the next Wii Fit.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:miko=angry,Don't leave! You still have something to do!
1-female_must_masturbate,target:ruby=thinking,I honestly would've thought you'd bring your weapon for this, but the old fashioned way works too.
1-female_must_masturbate,filter:virtual=horny,I hope the girl behind the avatar is playing along, if you catch my drift.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=teasing,Rejoice,, Chun-Li: the criminal didn't in the day.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:monika,alsoPlaying:sayori,alsoPlayingStage:8-9,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:affections-glitch=surprised,Sayori? Where are you going?
1-female_must_masturbate,target:sola=glad,Your Revenge Magic worked so well. Unless that crystal's the magic... I don't get the rules of your world.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:alice_mgq=tranquil,That went... smoother than I expected.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:kurumu=teasing,Don't give her any sympathy. She got off easy, all things considered.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:juri=thinking,So are you just ignoring the part where you lost or...
1-female_must_masturbate,target:clover=glad,So much for solving the puzzle or whatever.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:elizabeth=tranquil,Looks like I've beaten you, Elizabeth. Let that be a lesson that the skies belong to the gods!
1-female_must_masturbate,target:streaming-chan=surprised,Umm... did you forget you still have a hat?
1-female_must_masturbate,target:kyu,targetTimeInStage:5-100=teasing,You've been dying to do this haven't you? It's been the only thing on your mind since you've gotten naked. Not that there was much aside from that before...
1-female_must_masturbate,target:jolyne=calm,That's fine. Jolyne doesn't really seem to care, anyway.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:mahiru,marker:mahirucheck2=teasing,I bet you do this type of thing all the time when you're alone, right Mahiru?
1-female_start_masturbating=glad,We'll be here to support you, don't get nervous!
1-female_start_masturbating,target:alice_mgq=calm,And thankfully so...
1-female_start_masturbating,target:chiaki=calm,Alright, show us how good you are with those fingers.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:shantae=tranquil,Ooh, you know what would make this better? A pole! Should've brought my staff...
1-female_start_masturbating,target:rinkah=horny,So, do you do this often? Or are there other outlets for the Flame Tribe?
1-female_start_masturbating,target:zone-tan=calm,That's certainly the demeanor of someone who's done this time and time again.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:aella=thinking,From what I understand, it's not so hard. Just rub down there and you'll get it right eventually.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:amalia=annoyed,What's this? More flowers?
1-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu=horny,Ooh, midair? Perfectly eye level, so everyone gets a nice good look.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=tranquil,Ooh, a wrestling match! And I didn't even have to buy tickets!
1-female_start_masturbating,target:felicia=worried,So... where are you getting all this? You don't seem like the type to know magic.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:joey=glad,Talk about a hat trick.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:natsuki=thinking,I'm sure you have plenty of fantasies you can dig up for this, so... have fun with it.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:clover=awkward,horny,As far as I understand, that's how the body works.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:juri=horny,Such enthusiasm! A lot of you could learn from her.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:jolyne=surprised,Coming out of your fingertip... is that... rope?
1-female_start_masturbating,target:sola=teasing,Oh, so you're into this type of stuff! I see.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:miko=glad,Thank you, Tojiko.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:raven=calm,Showing off by doing it midair, huh? Don't strain yourself.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:revy=awkward,(Maybe it was all just bottled up sexual frustration. Who knows.)
1-female_start_masturbating,target:jenetta=glad,Therians really need to work on their idioms... "Rabid acorns"?
1-female_start_masturbating,target:sayori=calm,It's not that big a deal, really. At least for you, it's not. I so rarely get to see humans go at it...
1-female_start_masturbating,target:shimakaze=worried,They might be a <i>bit</i> strong, though.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:winter=calm,Maybe you have a respectable bone in your body after all.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:spooky=glad,It's only natural. Humans can't resist the urge, even in death.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:elaine=teasing,There's so many good pirate jokes for this.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:dawn=tranquil,How courteous of you to move your hair for us.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:misty=glad,I don't know what you're scared of. You do performances in a swimsuit all the time, this isn't that much worse.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:nagisa=tranquil,Is this the usual way humans put on plays? Maybe Pit wouldn't always fall asleep during them if they were like this!
1-female_start_masturbating,target:sola,alsoPlaying:zizou=glad,So noble, o kind goddess.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=calm,Who knows? Maybe you'll be able to make up for her loss.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:7-8=glad,Funny how you sisters worry about such trivial things. Did you forget it's a game?
1-female_start_masturbating,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=tranquil,I think it's rather obvious to everyone that the roles, in actuality, are reversed.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:moon=teasing,Wow, you're thirstier than a gatekeeper in Kanto!
1-female_start_masturbating,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:pit=horny,That can be arranged.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:revy,targetSaidMarker:maleplayerloss,targetNotSaidMarker:maleplayerfinish=surprised,I'm certain this breaks the rules, but it would be nice to see how mortals... do it.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:revy,targetSaidMarker:femaleplayerloss,targetNotSaidMarker:femaleplayerfinish=surprised,Oh! Well, I admit I'm a little curious what sex looks like between two mortal women...
1-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:competitive=calm,A good attempt, Kyu. But your protege took it, it seems.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:nayru=tranquil,As far as I can see, you're just getting started with the real thing!
1-female_start_masturbating,target:monika,targetSaidMarker:joint-masturbation=worried,Hold on, Sayori. She can't do her forfeit like that. Unless <i>you're</i> planning on giving her a hand?
1-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:poem=awkward,...Interesting title.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:whomstdntve=annoyed,What happened to just spelling it out? So much slang these days...
1-female_start_masturbating,target:alice_mgq,targetSaidMarker:perverts=tranquil,Works for me!
1-female_masturbating=thinking,I never knew you could do it like that...
1-female_masturbating,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:7-8,priority:0=teasing,A nearly mutual family masturbation. Really, you're just a few stray hands away from this into unsavory territory.
1-female_masturbating,target:kyu,saidMarker:kyuplayalong,priority:0=tranquil,<i>You're doing great, Kyu. Just like you've been trained.</i>
1-female_masturbating,target:kyu,saidMarker:kyuplayalong,priority:0=horny,<i>So you're naked and masturbating for strangers now, are you Kyu? What a disgraceful love fairy you are.</i>
1-female_masturbating,target:kyu,saidMarker:kyuplayalong,priority:0=teasing,<i>Harder! You don't want to let me down, do you?</i>
1-female_masturbating,target:amalia,priority:0=loss,(The image of Viridi doing something like that... ugh.)
1-female_masturbating,target:spooky,priority:0=teasing,You know, usually when ghosts moan, it <i>isn't</i> supposed to be sexy.
1-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,priority:0=tranquil,Go for the pin! Preferrably with her legs in the air!
1-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,priority:0=thinking,Maybe we can make this a regular thing here. Wonder if the Inventory has a budget for a mud ring...
1-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,priority:0=angry,C'mon! Step your combo game up!
1-female_masturbating,target:aella,priority:0=awkward,It's actually impressive how tall you still are, even when sitting down.
1-female_masturbating,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-6,priority:0=glad,And this is why we need chairs. To prevent humiliations like this.
1-female_masturbating,target:felicia,priority:0=horny,Such wild expressions... she really is more cat than human.
1-female_masturbating,target:chara,priority:0=horny,(<i>Surprisingly, Chara's still giving bad vibes, even in the middle of that... disturbing. But also admirable.</i>)
1-female_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch,priority:0=worried,I could never use magic like that. I'm not a fan of bondage, amongst other things.
1-female_masturbating,target:sharla,priority:0=teasing,You must press on, and on, and on!
1-female_masturbating,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li,alsoPlayingStage:8,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0=glad,It <i>is</i> a fine butt.
1-female_masturbating,target:mercy,priority:0=horny,To paraphrase you: <i>'Til Skyworld</i>!
1-female_masturbating,target:lara,priority:0=teasing,How often do you explore <i>these</i> peaks and valleys, Lara?
1-female_masturbating,target:winter,priority:0=thinking,You know, for all your hesitation earlier, you're really not hesitating now. Did you finally give in?
1-female_masturbating,target:kyu,notSaidMarker:kyuplayalong,priority:1,marker:kyuplayalong=horny,You know, Kyu... If it helps, I'll play along with your fantasy. Just to help you out.
1-female_masturbating,target:hermione,priority:0=worried,Well, that's an... interesting... use of magic.
1-female_masturbating,target:zone-tan,priority:0=calm,I hear you're into tentacles, Zone-tan. You ever heard of a Space Kraken? I'm sure you could find a use for the big lug.
1-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,alsoPlaying:chun-li,priority:0=horny,Say, why don't you join them, Chun-Li? I'm sure they'd like a familiar face to help out...
1-female_masturbating,target:raven,targetSaidMarker:starfire_watching,priority:0=horny,Perhaps you've been a closet exhibitionist all along.
1-female_masturbating,target:joey,priority:0=thinking,Somehow,I'm not sure whether or not this is actually part of Joetta's usual acts.
1-female_masturbating,target:sola,priority:0=worried,What's up with that crystal? It looks like a firecracker from what I can see.
1-female_masturbating,target:nayru,priority:0=horny,I wonder... do musicians provide their own music when they do the deed?
1-female_masturbating,target:jolyne,priority:0=worried,(Bondage in front of everyone is quite bold... impressive.)
1-female_masturbating,target:juri,priority:0=worried,This is supposed to be masturbation, not acrobatics...
1-female_masturbating,target:clover,targetTimeInStage:14-19,alsoPlaying:pit,priority:0=angry,Don't be impolite. She said please and everything.
1-female_masturbating,target:alice_mgq,priority:0=teasing,For the record, Medusa did your whole "disguise" trick years ago. And better, too.
1-female_masturbating,target:clover,priority:0=worried,I can't make heads or tails of what Clover's saying... odd.
1-female_masturbating,target:revy,priority:0=awkward,(It's crass, but a little mesmerizing...)
1-female_masturbating,target:rinkah,priority:0=thinking,(Maybe <i>this</i> is where her tribe gets their name.)
1-female_masturbating,target:revy,targetSaidMarker:maleplayerloss,targetNotSaidMarker:maleplayerfinish,priority:0=surprised,So this is sex. I see, I see. (It's... kind of hot...)
1-female_masturbating,target:natsuki,priority:0=awkward,(She really did have a lot of messed-up fantasies...)
1-female_masturbating,target:revy,targetSaidMarker:femaleplayerloss,targetNotSaidMarker:femaleplayerfinish,priority:0=glad,(Funny how ~player~ puts up no resistance... and seems to know exactly what to do.)
1-female_masturbating,target:jenetta,priority:0=thinking,(I'm still confused how her eyes work...)
1-female_masturbating,target:elaine,priority:0=calm,Lots of plundering abound.
1-female_masturbating,target:chiaki,priority:0=surprised,I'm a little impressed. You're going much slower than I imagined a seasoned gamer would.
1-female_masturbating,target:raven,priority:0=thinking,(An easy target, now that I look at her. She's lucky she hasn't made an enemy of me... yet.)
1-female_masturbating,target:sayori,priority:0=thinking,You seem to be pretty good with your fingers. Surprisingly so, for just an ordinary girl...
1-female_masturbating,target:miko,priority:0=thinking,(This might be the closest thing to an actual punishment I've seen here.)
1-female_masturbating,target:monika,targetSaidMarker:joint-masturbation,priority:0=thinking,(Oh... it's almost as if they're in a trance.)
1-female_masturbating,target:shimakaze,priority:0=awkward,I don't blame you for going fast. It might be better to just get it over with, after all.
1-female_masturbating,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:poem,priority:0=awkward,Very... literal, Kyu.
1-female_masturbating,target:moon,priority:0=awkward,(I hope not all mortal women are like Moon here...)
1-female_finished_masturbating=calm,Well done! Would it be too much to ask for an encore?
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:alice_mgq=teasing,Just sit there quietly until everyone's finished. No need for you to die tonight.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:aella=glad,Just think of this as... a learning experience, Aella.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:natsuki=tranquil,Oh? Seems we know who you shaved for now!
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:corrin_f=tranquil,I'm glad we could bond like this, Corrin.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:marinette=tranquil,I hope you were able to unwind this way.

1-female_finished_masturbating,target:mercy=horny,I think we've all learned a lot today from the good doctor here.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:chiaki=calm,Losing in a field you excel at... my condolences. But at least you had fun, by the looks of it.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=calm,You do care. Maybe more than you know.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:kyu=horny,Did you enjoy my little act? Perhaps I should've become the goddess of theater.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:felicia=teasing,How about you scratch her behind the ears, ~player~? I bet it'll make her happy.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:clover,alsoPlaying:pit=horny,If you want to oblige the girl, you have my full permission, Pit.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:amalia=teasing,Quite the look for you, wood girl. You should keep it.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:may=thinking,I give it a seven-point-eight out of ten. Too much juice.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=worried,I think she'll need a day of three.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:monika,targetSaidMarker:joint-masturbation,targetNotSaidMarker:joint-masturbation-finished=worried,Clearly there's some complicated feelings at work here. I'll let you two sort it out.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:chell=calm,Making a note here:<i>huge</i> success.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:tifa=tranquil,I dedicate this victory to all the times Cloud beat me in Smash.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:sharla=thinking,That ether rifle seems to be pretty effective on your stamina...
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:winter=glad,Usually, winter's thought of as white, but I don't think this Winter'll be anything but red!
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:gwen=teasing,If rope is all the blue guy can make, you're really no better than her.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:nayru=teasing,You're pretty gutsy for an oracle. Not exactly a <i>useful</i> trait, but it's endearing.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:juri=worried,I wouldn't lick that if I were y- never mind.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:8=calm,Well, what are you going to do? No one forced the two of you to come here, after all.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:jenetta=angry,I should get some soap for that dirty mouth of yours!
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:7=glad,That's one. Now to wait for the other.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:d.va=teasing,A gamer like you should know not to pick fights you can't win.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:orendi=annoyed,I swear, this girl is a walking mood swing...
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:nagisa=tranquil,Any chance of an encore performance?
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=glad,Certainly one of the more... entertaining ways of getting off.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:poem=glad,You get a gold star for trying.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:sayori=glad,There, there. It'll all be okay, Sayori. I promise.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:jolyne=horny,Such impractical uses for powers... although it makes for a fun show.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:sheena=teasing,(<i>You certainly loosened up fast. Now I'm glad Pit isn't here, since you'd probably jump him.</i>)
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:shimakaze,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,You let this thing wander around the Inventory unsupervised? How irresponsible. It'd be awful if I let Pit wander into a game all by himself, after all.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:clover=thinking,Oh, you had it all along. It's probably just more prominent now.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:pearl=awkward,So that's why people call it "polishing the pearl"...
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:rinkah=horny,Not bad, Rinkah. I wonder how you'd do as a member of <i>my</i> army?
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:evie=loss,I think the temperature just dropped a bit.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingStage:9=glad,A drink sounds good, actually.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:sola=annoyed,I hope you wash that later.

1-female_finished_masturbating,target:elaine=tranquil,Ocean, space, doesn't matter. No pirate will ever beat me!
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:raven=calm,Oh! At first, I was a little worried that might've been a curse. Sorry!
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:nayru,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=worried,So where did Little Ms. Fireball go? She might still cause trouble...
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:kim=calm,That was fun. I could tell you knew <i>exactly</i> what to do.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:moon=glad,Last chance... although I think I already know the answer.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:joey=surprised,Not even a honk? Weak.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:revy=calm,How... enlightening. Glad to have seen it. Only a little, obviously.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:spooky=tranquil,Very nice! I learned a lot from that little show...
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:shimakaze=thinking,You let this thing wander around the Inventory unsupervised? How irresponsible. Actually, wait, where'd Pit go?
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:pit=calm,I can't promise anything, but I'll see what I can do, too.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:miko=calm,You're a good pair, you two. I'm a little envious.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:mahiru,marker:mahirucheck3=glad,Taking pictures of yourself? For such a conservative girl, you're quite the exhibitionist!
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:aimee=teasing,Normally I'd feel bad for you, but you almost seemed to enjoy shooting yourself.

2-male_masturbating,target:human,priority:0=calm,Are you getting close? I think he's getting close.
2-male_masturbating,target:human,priority:0=teasing,I can tell ~player~ is thinking something...naughty.
2-male_masturbating,target:xander,priority:0=tranquil,Yep. Exactly the sort of performance I'd expect from a normal guy like you, Xander.
2-male_masturbating,target:ryu,priority:0=horny,If only this was the turbo edition...
2-male_finished_masturbating=worried,I think some got on my dress...
2-male_finished_masturbating,target:captain_falcon=horny,A showman as always, Falcon. I liked it a lot.
2-male_finished_masturbating,target:human=tranquil,You didn't do half bad, ~name~!
2-male_finished_masturbating,target:ryuji=tranquil,Well done! I enjoyed every minute of that, Ryuji.
2-male_finished_masturbating,target:pit=teasing,You really <i>are</i> finished this time.
2-male_finished_masturbating,target:9s=horny,Seems our little robotic friend is firing blanks.
2-female_must_masturbate=calm,I don't see any clothes on you, ~name~. Now you do a forfeit, right?
2-female_must_masturbate,target:amalia=glad,Cheaters don't prosper. Pay up, wood girl!
2-female_must_masturbate,target:aella=annoyed,"Oh boy"? That's all? That's an underreaction if I ever heard one.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:kyu=glad,And no one was surprised at this turn of events.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:mahiru,marker:mahirucheck2=teasing,I bet you do this type of thing all the time when you're alone, right Mahiru?
2-female_must_masturbate,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:table,targetNotSaidMarker:tablec=glad,Understandable, but maybe not until the game's over?
2-female_must_masturbate,target:alice_mgq=tranquil,That went... smoother than I expected.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:raven,totalMasturbating:1-2=annoyed,Thanks for telling me the obvious. I had no intentions of watching you from the start.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:jenetta=awkward,This is almost a shame. I liked playing with you.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:revy=thinking,Let's see... no guns, no clothes, no win... yep, I think this is cosmic justice at work.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:sayori=glad,Yeah, kind of. Tough luck.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:shimakaze=surprised,Oh, crits are in this?
2-female_must_masturbate,target:raven=surprised,Oh, I almost forgot about you. You lost, right?
2-female_must_masturbate,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:7-8=calm,Both sisters went out in tandem. Beautiful.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:winter=thinking,Looks like her day just went from bad to worse.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:moon=awkward,No good. She's hardly taken a glance at me all night.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:sola=glad,Your Revenge Magic worked so well. Unless that crystal's the magic... I don't get the rules of your world.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=teasing,Rejoice,, Chun-Li: the criminal didn't in the day.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:spooky=teasing,Just be glad you're not one of those whispy ghosts with no legs.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:jolyne=calm,That's fine. Jolyne doesn't really seem to care, anyway.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:rainbow_mika=surprised,You're just skipping the mask? Well, a win's a win...
2-female_must_masturbate,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=glad,You outlasted Winter, Weiss. That's something to be proud of, right?
2-female_must_masturbate,target:rinkah=glad,Warrior spirit wasn't enough to edge out a win. Time for the forfeit!
2-female_must_masturbate,target:juri=thinking,So are you just ignoring the part where you lost or...
2-female_must_masturbate,target:nayru=surprised,This really was a voluntary thing?
2-female_must_masturbate,target:kyu,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:8-9=tranquil,Really? Surprisingly nice of you, Kyu.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:clover=glad,So much for solving the puzzle or whatever.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:kyu,targetTimeInStage:5-100=teasing,You've been dying to do this haven't you? It's been the only thing on your mind since you've gotten naked. Not that there was much aside from that before...
2-female_must_masturbate,target:miko=angry,Don't leave! You still have something to do!
2-female_must_masturbate,target:natsuki=calm,Well, go on then. Don't want to disappoint us, do you?
2-female_must_masturbate,filter:virtual=horny,I hope the girl behind the avatar is playing along, if you catch my drift.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:monika,alsoPlaying:sayori,alsoPlayingStage:8-9,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:affections-glitch=surprised,Sayori? Where are you going?
2-female_must_masturbate,target:joey=calm,Maybe you shouldn't have clowned around so much.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:felicia=tranquil,A bit later than I was hoping, but here we are.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:elaine=glad,<i>Get ready to walk the plank!</i>
2-female_must_masturbate,target:elizabeth=tranquil,Looks like I've beaten you, Elizabeth. Let that be a lesson that the skies belong to the gods!
2-female_must_masturbate,target:clover,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,Seems you have a fan, Pit.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:peach=glad,A shame Peach, but I imagine this is easier than, say, streaking in a military base.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:marceline=calm,Good attempt, but futile. Now, guess what time it is?
2-female_must_masturbate,target:nayru,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=glad,Experience trumps all, I suppose, Nayru.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:kyoko=thinking,You seem pretty scared, Kyoko. Are you up to this?
2-female_must_masturbate,target:yang=calm,Sorry Yang, but you were <i>way</i> too predictable. Weren't you supposed to be a poker master or something?
2-female_must_masturbate,target:wiifitfemale=teasing,Now <i>this</i> is a workout I'd like to see in the next Wii Fit.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:chiaki=glad,Chiaki's first? Seems gaming skill and luck don't exactly correlate.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:mei=glad,Are you used to <i>this</i>type of experiment, Mei?
2-female_must_masturbate,target:ruby=thinking,I honestly would've thought you'd bring your weapon for this, but the old fashioned way works too.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:kurumu=teasing,Don't give her any sympathy. She got off easy, all things considered.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:mia=calm,How does it feel to be the one cornered for once, Mia?
2-female_must_masturbate,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:competitive=surprised,Oh? You almost look disappointed.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:streaming-chan=surprised,Umm... did you forget you still have a hat?
2-female_must_masturbate,target:chiaki=glad,Game over for you.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:shego=glad,You put up a good fight, but good always wins in the end.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:shego=teasing,Aren't you supposed to be a "crafty villain"? Medusa would have done <i>way</i> better.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:shazza=horny,I've always wanted to pet a dingo, but I'll settle for watching one pet herself.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:mileena=calm,I don't feel the least bit bad for you.
2-female_start_masturbating=awkward,Seems a bit humiliating, doesn't it?
2-female_start_masturbating,target:nagisa=tranquil,Is this the usual way humans put on plays? Maybe Pit wouldn't always fall asleep during them if they were like this!
2-female_start_masturbating,target:chiaki=calm,Alright, show us how good you are with those fingers.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=tranquil,I think it's rather obvious to everyone that the roles, in actuality, are reversed.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:sola,alsoPlaying:zizou=glad,So noble, o kind goddess.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=calm,Who knows? Maybe you'll be able to make up for her loss.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:joey=glad,Talk about a hat trick.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:7-8=glad,Funny how you sisters worry about such trivial things. Did you forget it's a game?
2-female_start_masturbating,target:shimakaze=worried,They might be a <i>bit</i> strong, though.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:shantae=tranquil,Ooh, you know what would make this better? A pole! Should've brought my staff...
2-female_start_masturbating,target:sola=teasing,Oh, so you're into this type of stuff! I see.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:nayru=tranquil,As far as I can see, you're just getting started with the real thing!
2-female_start_masturbating,target:felicia=worried,So... where are you getting all this? You don't seem like the type to know magic.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:jenetta=glad,Therians really need to work on their idioms... "Rabid acorns"?
2-female_start_masturbating,target:aella=thinking,From what I understand, it's not so hard. Just rub down there and you'll get it right eventually.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=tranquil,Ooh, a wrestling match! And I didn't even have to buy tickets!
2-female_start_masturbating,target:amalia=annoyed,What's this? More flowers?
2-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu=horny,Ooh, midair? Perfectly eye level, so everyone gets a nice good look.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:zone-tan=calm,That's certainly the demeanor of someone who's done this time and time again.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:raven=calm,Showing off by doing it midair, huh? Don't strain yourself.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:winter=calm,Maybe you have a respectable bone in your body after all.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:clover=awkward,horny,As far as I understand, that's how the body works.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:revy=awkward,(Maybe it was all just bottled up sexual frustration. Who knows.)
2-female_start_masturbating,target:monika,targetSaidMarker:joint-masturbation=worried,Hold on, Sayori. She can't do her forfeit like that. Unless <i>you're</i> planning on giving her a hand?
2-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:whomstdntve=annoyed,What happened to just spelling it out? So much slang these days...
2-female_start_masturbating,target:spooky=glad,It's only natural. Humans can't resist the urge, even in death.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:alice_mgq,targetSaidMarker:perverts=tranquil,Works for me!
2-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:poem=awkward,...Interesting title.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:competitive=calm,A good attempt, Kyu. But your protege took it, it seems.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:jolyne=surprised,Coming out of your fingertip... is that... rope?
2-female_start_masturbating,target:alice_mgq=calm,And thankfully so...
2-female_start_masturbating,target:revy,targetSaidMarker:femaleplayerloss,targetNotSaidMarker:femaleplayerfinish=surprised,Oh! Well, I admit I'm a little curious what sex looks like between two mortal women...
2-female_start_masturbating,target:natsuki=thinking,I'm sure you have plenty of fantasies you can dig up for this, so... have fun with it.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:juri=horny,Such enthusiasm! A lot of you could learn from her.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:moon=teasing,Wow, you're thirstier than a gatekeeper in Kanto!
2-female_start_masturbating,target:elaine=teasing,There's so many good pirate jokes for this.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:misty=glad,I don't know what you're scared of. You do performances in a swimsuit all the time, this isn't that much worse.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:miko=glad,Thank you, Tojiko.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:revy,targetSaidMarker:maleplayerloss,targetNotSaidMarker:maleplayerfinish=surprised,I'm certain this breaks the rules, but it would be nice to see how mortals... do it.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:rinkah=horny,So, do you do this often? Or are there other outlets for the Flame Tribe?
2-female_start_masturbating,target:sayori=calm,It's not that big a deal, really. At least for you, it's not. I so rarely get to see humans go at it...
2-female_start_masturbating,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:pit=horny,That can be arranged.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:dawn=tranquil,How courteous of you to move your hair for us.
2-female_masturbating=tranquil,Nice technique, ~name~. I give it a <i>solid</i> B.
2-female_masturbating,target:natsuki,priority:0=awkward,(She really did have a lot of messed-up fantasies...)
2-female_masturbating,target:jolyne,priority:0=worried,(Bondage in front of everyone is quite bold... impressive.)
2-female_masturbating,target:moon,priority:0=awkward,(I hope not all mortal women are like Moon here...)
2-female_masturbating,target:miko,priority:0=thinking,(This might be the closest thing to an actual punishment I've seen here.)
2-female_masturbating,target:clover,targetTimeInStage:14-19,alsoPlaying:pit,priority:0=angry,Don't be impolite. She said please and everything.
2-female_masturbating,target:joey,priority:0=thinking,Somehow,I'm not sure whether or not this is actually part of Joetta's usual acts.
2-female_masturbating,target:chiaki,priority:0=surprised,I'm a little impressed. You're going much slower than I imagined a seasoned gamer would.
2-female_masturbating,target:winter,priority:0=thinking,You know, for all your hesitation earlier, you're really not hesitating now. Did you finally give in?
2-female_masturbating,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:7-8,priority:0=teasing,A nearly mutual family masturbation. Really, you're just a few stray hands away from this into unsavory territory.
2-female_masturbating,target:alice_mgq,priority:0=teasing,For the record, Medusa did your whole "disguise" trick years ago. And better, too.
2-female_masturbating,target:juri,priority:0=worried,This is supposed to be masturbation, not acrobatics...
2-female_masturbating,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-6,priority:0=glad,And this is why we need chairs. To prevent humiliations like this.
2-female_masturbating,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li,alsoPlayingStage:8,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0=glad,It <i>is</i> a fine butt.
2-female_masturbating,target:clover,priority:0=worried,I can't make heads or tails of what Clover's saying... odd.
2-female_masturbating,target:sola,priority:0=worried,What's up with that crystal? It looks like a firecracker from what I can see.
2-female_masturbating,target:nayru,priority:0=horny,I wonder... do musicians provide their own music when they do the deed?
2-female_masturbating,target:sharla,priority:0=teasing,You must press on, and on, and on!
2-female_masturbating,target:zone-tan,priority:0=calm,I hear you're into tentacles, Zone-tan. You ever heard of a Space Kraken? I'm sure you could find a use for the big lug.
2-female_masturbating,target:lara,priority:0=teasing,How often do you explore <i>these</i> peaks and valleys, Lara?
2-female_masturbating,target:kyu,saidMarker:kyuplayalong,priority:0=tranquil,<i>You're doing great, Kyu. Just like you've been trained.</i>
2-female_masturbating,target:kyu,saidMarker:kyuplayalong,priority:0=horny,<i>So you're naked and masturbating for strangers now, are you Kyu? What a disgraceful love fairy you are.</i>
2-female_masturbating,target:kyu,saidMarker:kyuplayalong,priority:0=teasing,<i>Harder! You don't want to let me down, do you?</i>
2-female_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch,priority:0=worried,I could never use magic like that. I'm not a fan of bondage, amongst other things.
2-female_masturbating,target:monika,targetSaidMarker:joint-masturbation,priority:0=thinking,(Oh... it's almost as if they're in a trance.)
2-female_masturbating,target:spooky,priority:0=teasing,You know, usually when ghosts moan, it <i>isn't</i> supposed to be sexy.
2-female_masturbating,target:revy,targetSaidMarker:maleplayerloss,targetNotSaidMarker:maleplayerfinish,priority:0=surprised,So this is sex. I see, I see. (It's... kind of hot...)
2-female_masturbating,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:poem,priority:0=awkward,Very... literal, Kyu.
2-female_masturbating,target:sayori,priority:0=thinking,You seem to be pretty good with your fingers. Surprisingly so, for just an ordinary girl...
2-female_masturbating,target:amalia,priority:0=loss,(The image of Viridi doing something like that... ugh.)
2-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,priority:0=tranquil,Go for the pin! Preferrably with her legs in the air!
2-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,priority:0=thinking,Maybe we can make this a regular thing here. Wonder if the Inventory has a budget for a mud ring...
2-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,priority:0=angry,C'mon! Step your combo game up!
2-female_masturbating,target:chara,priority:0=horny,(<i>Surprisingly, Chara's still giving bad vibes, even in the middle of that... disturbing. But also admirable.</i>)
2-female_masturbating,target:revy,priority:0=awkward,(It's crass, but a little mesmerizing...)
2-female_masturbating,target:raven,targetSaidMarker:starfire_watching,priority:0=horny,Perhaps you've been a closet exhibitionist all along.
2-female_masturbating,target:shimakaze,priority:0=awkward,I don't blame you for going fast. It might be better to just get it over with, after all.
2-female_masturbating,target:hermione,priority:0=worried,Well, that's an... interesting... use of magic.
2-female_masturbating,target:jenetta,priority:0=thinking,(I'm still confused how her eyes work...)
2-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,alsoPlaying:chun-li,priority:0=horny,Say, why don't you join them, Chun-Li? I'm sure they'd like a familiar face to help out...
2-female_masturbating,target:aella,priority:0=awkward,It's actually impressive how tall you still are, even when sitting down.
2-female_masturbating,target:felicia,priority:0=horny,Such wild expressions... she really is more cat than human.
2-female_masturbating,target:elaine,priority:0=calm,Lots of plundering abound.
2-female_masturbating,target:kyu,notSaidMarker:kyuplayalong,priority:1,marker:kyuplayalong=horny,You know, Kyu... If it helps, I'll play along with your fantasy. Just to help you out.
2-female_masturbating,target:mercy,priority:0=horny,To paraphrase you: <i>'Til Skyworld</i>!
2-female_masturbating,target:raven,priority:0=thinking,(An easy target, now that I look at her. She's lucky she hasn't made an enemy of me... yet.)
2-female_masturbating,target:revy,targetSaidMarker:femaleplayerloss,targetNotSaidMarker:femaleplayerfinish,priority:0=glad,(Funny how ~player~ puts up no resistance... and seems to know exactly what to do.)
2-female_masturbating,target:rinkah,priority:0=thinking,(Maybe <i>this</i> is where her tribe gets their name.)
2-female_finished_masturbating=teasing,I think you liked us watching you, huh?
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:sheena=teasing,(<i>You certainly loosened up fast. Now I'm glad Pit isn't here, since you'd probably jump him.</i>)
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:d.va=teasing,A gamer like you should know not to pick fights you can't win.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:poem=glad,You get a gold star for trying.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:chiaki=calm,Losing in a field you excel at... my condolences. But at least you had fun, by the looks of it.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=worried,I think she'll need a day of three.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:evie=loss,I think the temperature just dropped a bit.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:monika,targetSaidMarker:joint-masturbation,targetNotSaidMarker:joint-masturbation-finished=worried,Clearly there's some complicated feelings at work here. I'll let you two sort it out.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:revy=calm,How... enlightening. Glad to have seen it. Only a little, obviously.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:amalia=teasing,Quite the look for you, wood girl. You should keep it.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:alice_mgq=teasing,Just sit there quietly until everyone's finished. No need for you to die tonight.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:rinkah=horny,Not bad, Rinkah. I wonder how you'd do as a member of <i>my</i> army?
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:nayru,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=worried,So where did Little Ms. Fireball go? She might still cause trouble...
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:miko=calm,You're a good pair, you two. I'm a little envious.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:spooky=tranquil,Very nice! I learned a lot from that little show...
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingStage:9=glad,A drink sounds good, actually.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:mahiru,marker:mahirucheck3=glad,Taking pictures of yourself? For such a conservative girl, you're quite the exhibitionist!
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:sharla=thinking,That ether rifle seems to be pretty effective on your stamina...
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:mercy=horny,I think we've all learned a lot today from the good doctor here.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:7=glad,That's one. Now to wait for the other.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:nayru=teasing,You're pretty gutsy for an oracle. Not exactly a <i>useful</i> trait, but it's endearing.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:felicia=teasing,How about you scratch her behind the ears, ~player~? I bet it'll make her happy.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:pit=calm,I can't promise anything, but I'll see what I can do, too.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:chell=calm,Making a note here:<i>huge</i> success.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:elaine=tranquil,Ocean, space, doesn't matter. No pirate will ever beat me!
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:gwen=teasing,If rope is all the blue guy can make, you're really no better than her.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:sola=annoyed,I hope you wash that later.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:shimakaze,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,You let this thing wander around the Inventory unsupervised? How irresponsible. It'd be awful if I let Pit wander into a game all by himself, after all.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:8=calm,Well, what are you going to do? No one forced the two of you to come here, after all.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:natsuki=tranquil,Oh? Seems we know who you shaved for now!
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:kyu=horny,Did you enjoy my little act? Perhaps I should've become the goddess of theater.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:sayori=glad,There, there. It'll all be okay, Sayori. I promise.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:clover=thinking,Oh, you had it all along. It's probably just more prominent now.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:moon=glad,Last chance... although I think I already know the answer.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=glad,Certainly one of the more... entertaining ways of getting off.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:jenetta=angry,I should get some soap for that dirty mouth of yours!
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:may=thinking,I give it a seven-point-eight out of ten. Too much juice.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:kim=calm,That was fun. I could tell you knew <i>exactly</i> what to do.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:marinette=tranquil,I hope you were able to unwind this way.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:corrin_f=tranquil,I'm glad we could bond like this, Corrin.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:leela=tranquil,Good show, Miss Monoeye, good show.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=calm,You do care. Maybe more than you know.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:joey=surprised,Not even a honk? Weak.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:aella=glad,Just think of this as... a learning experience, Aella.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:jolyne=horny,Such impractical uses for powers... although it makes for a fun show.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:lux=tranquil,You shone like a true warrior of light!
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:clover,alsoPlaying:pit=horny,If you want to oblige the girl, you have my full permission, Pit.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:aimee=teasing,Normally I'd feel bad for you, but you almost seemed to enjoy shooting yourself.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:orendi=annoyed,I swear, this girl is a walking mood swing...
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:juri=worried,I wouldn't lick that if I were y- never mind.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:nagisa=tranquil,Any chance of an encore performance?
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:winter=glad,Usually, winter's thought of as white, but I don't think this Winter'll be anything but red!
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:penny=thinking,For how shy you are, you put on a really nice show, Penny.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:raven=calm,Oh! At first, I was a little worried that might've been a curse. Sorry!
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:tifa=tranquil,I dedicate this victory to all the times Cloud beat me in Smash.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:pearl=awkward,So that's why people call it "polishing the pearl"...
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:shimakaze=thinking,You let this thing wander around the Inventory unsupervised? How irresponsible. Actually, wait, where'd Pit go?


#lost brooch
3-male_must_masturbate=tranquil,Oh, ~name~ is out? I've been curious how you do it.
3-male_must_masturbate,target:ryuji=horny,I'm excited to see how you put one that size to work...
3-male_must_masturbate,target:human=glad,Thank you for taking the loss for us.
3-male_must_masturbate,target:human=calm,This'll be a learning experience for me too.
3-male_must_masturbate,target:pit,totalAlive:2=tranquil,Good game, Pit. But you knew this would be the outcome from the start, didn't you?
3-male_must_masturbate,target:9s=thinking,Does your...equipment even work?
3-male_must_masturbate,target:pit,totalAlive:5-3=surprised,Pit's out? Surprising! I thought for sure he'd be my last opponent.
3-male_start_masturbating=surprised,Wow, <i>no</i> hesitation on your part!
3-male_start_masturbating,target:ryuji=glad,Don't think of it like something weird. Think of it as... a teaching. For me.
3-male_start_masturbating,target:kira=surprised,...Is that Mewtwo?
3-male_start_masturbating,target:ryuji,totalFemales:2-4=glad,Don't think of it like something weird. Think of it as... a teaching. For me and all the ladies here.
3-male_start_masturbating,target:pit=teasing,Well, obviously. This is the consolation prize for our other players!
3-male_start_masturbating,target:9s=teasing,Only one way to find out!
3-male_masturbating=calm,I wasn't expecting this to be so interesting! Keep it up!
3-male_masturbating,target:ryu,priority:0=horny,If only this was the turbo edition...
3-male_masturbating,target:pit,priority:0=glad,You're doing great, Pit. Really.
3-male_masturbating,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,priority:0=annoyed,Can you hurry this up? This is starting to get boring. You feel the same, ~player~?
3-male_masturbating,target:xander,priority:0=tranquil,Yep. Exactly the sort of performance I'd expect from a normal guy like you, Xander.
3-male_masturbating,target:human,priority:0=surprised,What a champion!
3-male_masturbating,target:human,priority:0=worried,I'm starting to get into this myself.
3-male_masturbating,target:human,priority:0=calm,Are you getting close? I think he's getting close.
3-male_masturbating,target:human,priority:0=teasing,I can tell ~player~ is thinking something...naughty.
3-male_masturbating,target:9s,priority:0=surprised,Oh, you are a quick learner, aren't you? Well, I guess it makes sense for an android...
3-male_masturbating,target:ryuji,priority:0=calm,Must be a piece of cake, huh? <i>I'm</i> here, after all.
3-male_finished_masturbating=teasing,Were you aiming for my chest there? Don't lie.
3-male_finished_masturbating,target:9s=horny,Seems our little robotic friend is firing blanks.
3-male_finished_masturbating,target:ryuji=tranquil,Well done! I enjoyed every minute of that, Ryuji.
3-male_finished_masturbating,target:pit=teasing,You really <i>are</i> finished this time.
3-male_finished_masturbating,target:captain_falcon=horny,A showman as always, Falcon. I liked it a lot.
3-male_finished_masturbating,target:human=tranquil,You didn't do half bad, ~name~!
3-female_must_masturbate=surprised,It's still pretty early in the game, ~name~. Do you really want to do it?
3-female_must_masturbate,target:kurumu=teasing,Don't give her any sympathy. She got off easy, all things considered.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:miko=angry,Don't leave! You still have something to do!
3-female_must_masturbate,target:clover=glad,So much for solving the puzzle or whatever.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:chiaki=glad,Game over for you.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:alice_mgq=tranquil,That went... smoother than I expected.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:revy=thinking,Let's see... no guns, no clothes, no win... yep, I think this is cosmic justice at work.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:competitive=surprised,Oh? You almost look disappointed.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:aella=annoyed,"Oh boy"? That's all? That's an underreaction if I ever heard one.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:7-8=calm,Both sisters went out in tandem. Beautiful.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:nayru=surprised,This really was a voluntary thing?
3-female_must_masturbate,target:clover,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,Seems you have a fan, Pit.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:chiaki=glad,Chiaki's first? Seems gaming skill and luck don't exactly correlate.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:table,targetNotSaidMarker:tablec=glad,Understandable, but maybe not until the game's over?
3-female_must_masturbate,target:ruby=thinking,I honestly would've thought you'd bring your weapon for this, but the old fashioned way works too.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:kyoko=thinking,You seem pretty scared, Kyoko. Are you up to this?
3-female_must_masturbate,target:felicia=tranquil,A bit later than I was hoping, but here we are.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:elizabeth=tranquil,Looks like I've beaten you, Elizabeth. Let that be a lesson that the skies belong to the gods!
3-female_must_masturbate,target:jenetta=awkward,This is almost a shame. I liked playing with you.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:rainbow_mika=surprised,You're just skipping the mask? Well, a win's a win...
3-female_must_masturbate,target:raven,totalMasturbating:1-2=annoyed,Thanks for telling me the obvious. I had no intentions of watching you from the start.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:joey=calm,Maybe you shouldn't have clowned around so much.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:peach=glad,A shame Peach, but I imagine this is easier than, say, streaking in a military base.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:kyu=glad,And no one was surprised at this turn of events.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:monika,alsoPlaying:sayori,alsoPlayingStage:8-9,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:affections-glitch=surprised,Sayori? Where are you going?
3-female_must_masturbate,target:shimakaze=surprised,Oh, crits are in this?
3-female_must_masturbate,target:amalia=glad,Cheaters don't prosper. Pay up, wood girl!
3-female_must_masturbate,filter:virtual=horny,I hope the girl behind the avatar is playing along, if you catch my drift.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:kyu,targetTimeInStage:5-100=teasing,You've been dying to do this haven't you? It's been the only thing on your mind since you've gotten naked. Not that there was much aside from that before...
3-female_must_masturbate,target:mahiru,marker:mahirucheck2=teasing,I bet you do this type of thing all the time when you're alone, right Mahiru?
3-female_must_masturbate,target:mia=calm,How does it feel to be the one cornered for once, Mia?
3-female_must_masturbate,target:natsuki=calm,Well, go on then. Don't want to disappoint us, do you?
3-female_must_masturbate,target:kyu,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:8-9=tranquil,Really? Surprisingly nice of you, Kyu.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:mei=glad,Are you used to <i>this</i>type of experiment, Mei?
3-female_must_masturbate,target:mileena=calm,I don't feel the least bit bad for you.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:shazza=horny,I've always wanted to pet a dingo, but I'll settle for watching one pet herself.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:moon=awkward,No good. She's hardly taken a glance at me all night.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:marceline=calm,Good attempt, but futile. Now, guess what time it is?
3-female_must_masturbate,target:sola=glad,Your Revenge Magic worked so well. Unless that crystal's the magic... I don't get the rules of your world.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=teasing,Rejoice,, Chun-Li: the criminal didn't in the day.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:sayori=glad,Yeah, kind of. Tough luck.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:streaming-chan=surprised,Umm... did you forget you still have a hat?
3-female_must_masturbate,target:spooky=teasing,Just be glad you're not one of those whispy ghosts with no legs.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:jolyne=calm,That's fine. Jolyne doesn't really seem to care, anyway.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:raven=surprised,Oh, I almost forgot about you. You lost, right?
3-female_must_masturbate,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=glad,You outlasted Winter, Weiss. That's something to be proud of, right?
3-female_must_masturbate,target:nayru,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=glad,Experience trumps all, I suppose, Nayru.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:elaine=glad,<i>Get ready to walk the plank!</i>
3-female_must_masturbate,target:winter=thinking,Looks like her day just went from bad to worse.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:wiifitfemale=teasing,Now <i>this</i> is a workout I'd like to see in the next Wii Fit.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:rinkah=glad,Warrior spirit wasn't enough to edge out a win. Time for the forfeit!
3-female_must_masturbate,target:yang=calm,Sorry Yang, but you were <i>way</i> too predictable. Weren't you supposed to be a poker master or something?
3-female_must_masturbate,target:juri=thinking,So are you just ignoring the part where you lost or...
3-female_must_masturbate,target:shego=glad,You put up a good fight, but good always wins in the end.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:shego=teasing,Aren't you supposed to be a "crafty villain"? Medusa would have done <i>way</i> better.
3-female_start_masturbating=teasing,You got into that groove quickly! No shame at all, ~name~.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:whomstdntve=annoyed,What happened to just spelling it out? So much slang these days...
3-female_start_masturbating,target:shimakaze=worried,They might be a <i>bit</i> strong, though.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:amalia=annoyed,What's this? More flowers?
3-female_start_masturbating,target:raven=calm,Showing off by doing it midair, huh? Don't strain yourself.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:spooky=glad,It's only natural. Humans can't resist the urge, even in death.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:natsuki=thinking,I'm sure you have plenty of fantasies you can dig up for this, so... have fun with it.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu=horny,Ooh, midair? Perfectly eye level, so everyone gets a nice good look.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:misty=glad,I don't know what you're scared of. You do performances in a swimsuit all the time, this isn't that much worse.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:felicia=worried,So... where are you getting all this? You don't seem like the type to know magic.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:moon=teasing,Wow, you're thirstier than a gatekeeper in Kanto!
3-female_start_masturbating,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=tranquil,I think it's rather obvious to everyone that the roles, in actuality, are reversed.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:joey=glad,Talk about a hat trick.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:miko=glad,Thank you, Tojiko.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=tranquil,Ooh, a wrestling match! And I didn't even have to buy tickets!
3-female_start_masturbating,target:sola,alsoPlaying:zizou=glad,So noble, o kind goddess.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:dawn=tranquil,How courteous of you to move your hair for us.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:revy,targetSaidMarker:maleplayerloss,targetNotSaidMarker:maleplayerfinish=surprised,I'm certain this breaks the rules, but it would be nice to see how mortals... do it.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:revy=awkward,(Maybe it was all just bottled up sexual frustration. Who knows.)
3-female_start_masturbating,target:clover=awkward,horny,As far as I understand, that's how the body works.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:chiaki=calm,Alright, show us how good you are with those fingers.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:poem=awkward,...Interesting title.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:nagisa=tranquil,Is this the usual way humans put on plays? Maybe Pit wouldn't always fall asleep during them if they were like this!
3-female_start_masturbating,target:shantae=tranquil,Ooh, you know what would make this better? A pole! Should've brought my staff...
3-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:competitive=calm,A good attempt, Kyu. But your protege took it, it seems.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:winter=calm,Maybe you have a respectable bone in your body after all.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:pit=horny,That can be arranged.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:7-8=glad,Funny how you sisters worry about such trivial things. Did you forget it's a game?
3-female_start_masturbating,target:juri=horny,Such enthusiasm! A lot of you could learn from her.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:revy,targetSaidMarker:femaleplayerloss,targetNotSaidMarker:femaleplayerfinish=surprised,Oh! Well, I admit I'm a little curious what sex looks like between two mortal women...
3-female_start_masturbating,target:alice_mgq=calm,And thankfully so...
3-female_start_masturbating,target:nayru=tranquil,As far as I can see, you're just getting started with the real thing!
3-female_start_masturbating,target:jolyne=surprised,Coming out of your fingertip... is that... rope?
3-female_start_masturbating,target:monika,targetSaidMarker:joint-masturbation=worried,Hold on, Sayori. She can't do her forfeit like that. Unless <i>you're</i> planning on giving her a hand?
3-female_start_masturbating,target:aella=thinking,From what I understand, it's not so hard. Just rub down there and you'll get it right eventually.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:zone-tan=calm,That's certainly the demeanor of someone who's done this time and time again.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:alice_mgq,targetSaidMarker:perverts=tranquil,Works for me!
3-female_start_masturbating,target:rinkah=horny,So, do you do this often? Or are there other outlets for the Flame Tribe?
3-female_start_masturbating,target:sola=teasing,Oh, so you're into this type of stuff! I see.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:sayori=calm,It's not that big a deal, really. At least for you, it's not. I so rarely get to see humans go at it...
3-female_start_masturbating,target:elaine=teasing,There's so many good pirate jokes for this.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:jenetta=glad,Therians really need to work on their idioms... "Rabid acorns"?
3-female_start_masturbating,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=calm,Who knows? Maybe you'll be able to make up for her loss.
3-female_masturbating=tranquil,You could be a pianist in your spare time with technique like that!
3-female_masturbating,target:monika,targetSaidMarker:joint-masturbation,priority:0=thinking,(Oh... it's almost as if they're in a trance.)
3-female_masturbating,target:sola,priority:0=worried,What's up with that crystal? It looks like a firecracker from what I can see.
3-female_masturbating,target:sayori,priority:0=thinking,You seem to be pretty good with your fingers. Surprisingly so, for just an ordinary girl...
3-female_masturbating,target:joey,priority:0=thinking,Somehow,I'm not sure whether or not this is actually part of Joetta's usual acts.
3-female_masturbating,target:chara,priority:0=horny,(<i>Surprisingly, Chara's still giving bad vibes, even in the middle of that... disturbing. But also admirable.</i>)
3-female_masturbating,target:miko,priority:0=thinking,(This might be the closest thing to an actual punishment I've seen here.)
3-female_masturbating,target:mercy,priority:0=horny,To paraphrase you: <i>'Til Skyworld</i>!
3-female_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch,priority:0=worried,I could never use magic like that. I'm not a fan of bondage, amongst other things.
3-female_masturbating,target:jenetta,priority:0=thinking,(I'm still confused how her eyes work...)
3-female_masturbating,target:felicia,priority:0=horny,Such wild expressions... she really is more cat than human.
3-female_masturbating,target:elaine,priority:0=calm,Lots of plundering abound.
3-female_masturbating,target:zone-tan,priority:0=calm,I hear you're into tentacles, Zone-tan. You ever heard of a Space Kraken? I'm sure you could find a use for the big lug.
3-female_masturbating,target:raven,priority:0=thinking,(An easy target, now that I look at her. She's lucky she hasn't made an enemy of me... yet.)
3-female_masturbating,target:revy,targetSaidMarker:femaleplayerloss,targetNotSaidMarker:femaleplayerfinish,priority:0=glad,(Funny how ~player~ puts up no resistance... and seems to know exactly what to do.)
3-female_masturbating,target:aella,priority:0=awkward,It's actually impressive how tall you still are, even when sitting down.
3-female_masturbating,target:sharla,priority:0=teasing,You must press on, and on, and on!
3-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,alsoPlaying:chun-li,priority:0=horny,Say, why don't you join them, Chun-Li? I'm sure they'd like a familiar face to help out...
3-female_masturbating,target:chiaki,priority:0=surprised,I'm a little impressed. You're going much slower than I imagined a seasoned gamer would.
3-female_masturbating,target:shimakaze,priority:0=awkward,I don't blame you for going fast. It might be better to just get it over with, after all.
3-female_masturbating,target:clover,targetTimeInStage:14-19,alsoPlaying:pit,priority:0=angry,Don't be impolite. She said please and everything.
3-female_masturbating,target:moon,priority:0=awkward,(I hope not all mortal women are like Moon here...)
3-female_masturbating,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:7-8,priority:0=teasing,A nearly mutual family masturbation. Really, you're just a few stray hands away from this into unsavory territory.
3-female_masturbating,target:alice_mgq,priority:0=teasing,For the record, Medusa did your whole "disguise" trick years ago. And better, too.
3-female_masturbating,target:juri,priority:0=worried,This is supposed to be masturbation, not acrobatics...
3-female_masturbating,target:clover,priority:0=worried,I can't make heads or tails of what Clover's saying... odd.
3-female_masturbating,target:spooky,priority:0=teasing,You know, usually when ghosts moan, it <i>isn't</i> supposed to be sexy.
3-female_masturbating,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-6,priority:0=glad,And this is why we need chairs. To prevent humiliations like this.
3-female_masturbating,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li,alsoPlayingStage:8,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0=glad,It <i>is</i> a fine butt.
3-female_masturbating,target:winter,priority:0=thinking,You know, for all your hesitation earlier, you're really not hesitating now. Did you finally give in?
3-female_masturbating,target:natsuki,priority:0=awkward,(She really did have a lot of messed-up fantasies...)
3-female_masturbating,target:jolyne,priority:0=worried,(Bondage in front of everyone is quite bold... impressive.)
3-female_masturbating,target:kyu,notSaidMarker:kyuplayalong,priority:1,marker:kyuplayalong=horny,You know, Kyu... If it helps, I'll play along with your fantasy. Just to help you out.
3-female_masturbating,target:hermione,priority:0=worried,Well, that's an... interesting... use of magic.
3-female_masturbating,target:nayru,priority:0=horny,I wonder... do musicians provide their own music when they do the deed?
3-female_masturbating,target:amalia,priority:0=loss,(The image of Viridi doing something like that... ugh.)
3-female_masturbating,target:lara,priority:0=teasing,How often do you explore <i>these</i> peaks and valleys, Lara?
3-female_masturbating,target:raven,targetSaidMarker:starfire_watching,priority:0=horny,Perhaps you've been a closet exhibitionist all along.
3-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,priority:0=tranquil,Go for the pin! Preferrably with her legs in the air!
3-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,priority:0=thinking,Maybe we can make this a regular thing here. Wonder if the Inventory has a budget for a mud ring...
3-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,priority:0=angry,C'mon! Step your combo game up!
3-female_masturbating,target:revy,priority:0=awkward,(It's crass, but a little mesmerizing...)
3-female_masturbating,target:rinkah,priority:0=thinking,(Maybe <i>this</i> is where her tribe gets their name.)
3-female_masturbating,target:revy,targetSaidMarker:maleplayerloss,targetNotSaidMarker:maleplayerfinish,priority:0=surprised,So this is sex. I see, I see. (It's... kind of hot...)
3-female_masturbating,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:poem,priority:0=awkward,Very... literal, Kyu.
3-female_masturbating,target:kyu,saidMarker:kyuplayalong,priority:0=tranquil,<i>You're doing great, Kyu. Just like you've been trained.</i>

3-female_masturbating,target:kyu,saidMarker:kyuplayalong,priority:0=teasing,<i>Harder! You don't want to let me down, do you?</i>
3-female_finished_masturbating=glad,Now those were some Celestial Fireworks!
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:nagisa=tranquil,Any chance of an encore performance?
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:moon=glad,Last chance... although I think I already know the answer.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:kim=calm,That was fun. I could tell you knew <i>exactly</i> what to do.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:juri=worried,I wouldn't lick that if I were y- never mind.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:mahiru,marker:mahirucheck3=glad,Taking pictures of yourself? For such a conservative girl, you're quite the exhibitionist!
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=calm,You do care. Maybe more than you know.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:shimakaze=thinking,You let this thing wander around the Inventory unsupervised? How irresponsible. Actually, wait, where'd Pit go?
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:winter=glad,Usually, winter's thought of as white, but I don't think this Winter'll be anything but red!
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:penny=thinking,For how shy you are, you put on a really nice show, Penny.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:lux=tranquil,You shone like a true warrior of light!
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:d.va=teasing,A gamer like you should know not to pick fights you can't win.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:miko=calm,You're a good pair, you two. I'm a little envious.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:gwen=teasing,If rope is all the blue guy can make, you're really no better than her.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:poem=glad,You get a gold star for trying.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=glad,Certainly one of the more... entertaining ways of getting off.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:spooky=tranquil,Very nice! I learned a lot from that little show...
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:rinkah=horny,Not bad, Rinkah. I wonder how you'd do as a member of <i>my</i> army?
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:aella=glad,Just think of this as... a learning experience, Aella.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:jenetta=angry,I should get some soap for that dirty mouth of yours!
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:natsuki=tranquil,Oh? Seems we know who you shaved for now!
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:evie=loss,I think the temperature just dropped a bit.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:shimakaze,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,You let this thing wander around the Inventory unsupervised? How irresponsible. It'd be awful if I let Pit wander into a game all by himself, after all.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:8=calm,Well, what are you going to do? No one forced the two of you to come here, after all.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:revy=calm,How... enlightening. Glad to have seen it. Only a little, obviously.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:nayru=teasing,You're pretty gutsy for an oracle. Not exactly a <i>useful</i> trait, but it's endearing.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:joey=surprised,Not even a honk? Weak.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:sheena=teasing,(<i>You certainly loosened up fast. Now I'm glad Pit isn't here, since you'd probably jump him.</i>)
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:monika,targetSaidMarker:joint-masturbation,targetNotSaidMarker:joint-masturbation-finished=worried,Clearly there's some complicated feelings at work here. I'll let you two sort it out.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:sayori=glad,There, there. It'll all be okay, Sayori. I promise.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:may=thinking,I give it a seven-point-eight out of ten. Too much juice.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:tifa=tranquil,I dedicate this victory to all the times Cloud beat me in Smash.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:jolyne=horny,Such impractical uses for powers... although it makes for a fun show.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:felicia=teasing,How about you scratch her behind the ears, ~player~? I bet it'll make her happy.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:clover=thinking,Oh, you had it all along. It's probably just more prominent now.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:orendi=annoyed,I swear, this girl is a walking mood swing...
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:elaine=tranquil,Ocean, space, doesn't matter. No pirate will ever beat me!
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:nayru,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=worried,So where did Little Ms. Fireball go? She might still cause trouble...
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:sharla=thinking,That ether rifle seems to be pretty effective on your stamina...
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:clover,alsoPlaying:pit=horny,If you want to oblige the girl, you have my full permission, Pit.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:alice_mgq=teasing,Just sit there quietly until everyone's finished. No need for you to die tonight.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingStage:9=glad,A drink sounds good, actually.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:sola=annoyed,I hope you wash that later.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:kyu=horny,Did you enjoy my little act? Perhaps I should've become the goddess of theater.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:corrin_f=tranquil,I'm glad we could bond like this, Corrin.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:amalia=teasing,Quite the look for you, wood girl. You should keep it.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:pit=calm,I can't promise anything, but I'll see what I can do, too.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:chiaki=calm,Losing in a field you excel at... my condolences. But at least you had fun, by the looks of it.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:leela=tranquil,Good show, Miss Monoeye, good show.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:pearl=awkward,So that's why people call it "polishing the pearl"...
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:mercy=horny,I think we've all learned a lot today from the good doctor here.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:aimee=teasing,Normally I'd feel bad for you, but you almost seemed to enjoy shooting yourself.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:marinette=tranquil,I hope you were able to unwind this way.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:chell=calm,Making a note here:<i>huge</i> success.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:7=glad,That's one. Now to wait for the other.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:raven=calm,Oh! At first, I was a little worried that might've been a curse. Sorry!
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=worried,I think she'll need a day of three.


#lost belts
4-male_must_masturbate=teasing,Too bad for you. Now let's see what you're made of.
4-male_must_masturbate,target:ryuji=horny,I'm excited to see how you put one that size to work...
4-male_must_masturbate,target:9s=thinking,Does your...equipment even work?
4-male_must_masturbate,target:pit,totalAlive:2=tranquil,Good game, Pit. But you knew this would be the outcome from the start, didn't you?
4-male_must_masturbate,target:human=glad,Thank you for taking the loss for us.
4-male_must_masturbate,target:human=calm,This'll be a learning experience for me too.
4-male_must_masturbate,target:pit,totalAlive:5-3=surprised,Pit's out? Surprising! I thought for sure he'd be my last opponent.
4-male_start_masturbating=tranquil,Aaannndd, you're off!
4-male_start_masturbating,target:kira=surprised,...Is that Mewtwo?
4-male_start_masturbating,target:ryuji,totalFemales:2-4=glad,Don't think of it like something weird. Think of it as... a teaching. For me and all the ladies here.
4-male_start_masturbating,target:9s=teasing,Only one way to find out!
4-male_start_masturbating,target:ryuji=glad,Don't think of it like something weird. Think of it as... a teaching. For me.
4-male_start_masturbating,target:pit=teasing,Well, obviously. This is the consolation prize for our other players!
4-male_masturbating=calm,Your goal is just ahead, ~name~. Don't stop!
4-male_masturbating,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,priority:0=annoyed,Can you hurry this up? This is starting to get boring. You feel the same, ~player~?
4-male_masturbating,target:human,priority:0=surprised,What a champion!
4-male_masturbating,target:human,priority:0=worried,I'm starting to get into this myself.
4-male_masturbating,target:human,priority:0=calm,Are you getting close? I think he's getting close.
4-male_masturbating,target:human,priority:0=teasing,I can tell ~player~ is thinking something...naughty.
4-male_masturbating,target:ryu,priority:0=horny,If only this was the turbo edition...
4-male_masturbating,target:ryuji,priority:0=calm,Must be a piece of cake, huh? <i>I'm</i> here, after all.
4-male_masturbating,target:pit,priority:0=glad,You're doing great, Pit. Really.
4-male_masturbating,target:9s,priority:0=surprised,Oh, you are a quick learner, aren't you? Well, I guess it makes sense for an android...
4-male_masturbating,target:xander,priority:0=tranquil,Yep. Exactly the sort of performance I'd expect from a normal guy like you, Xander.
4-male_finished_masturbating=surprised,Hey! You squirted me!
4-male_finished_masturbating,target:captain_falcon=horny,A showman as always, Falcon. I liked it a lot.
4-male_finished_masturbating,target:pit=teasing,You really <i>are</i> finished this time.
4-male_finished_masturbating,target:human=tranquil,You didn't do half bad, ~name~!
4-male_finished_masturbating,target:ryuji=tranquil,Well done! I enjoyed every minute of that, Ryuji.
4-male_finished_masturbating,target:9s=horny,Seems our little robotic friend is firing blanks.
4-female_must_masturbate=tranquil,~name~'s out. Let's put her to work, shall we?
4-female_must_masturbate,target:moon=awkward,No good. She's hardly taken a glance at me all night.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:shazza=horny,I've always wanted to pet a dingo, but I'll settle for watching one pet herself.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:elaine=glad,<i>Get ready to walk the plank!</i>
4-female_must_masturbate,target:jolyne=calm,That's fine. Jolyne doesn't really seem to care, anyway.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:kurumu=teasing,Don't give her any sympathy. She got off easy, all things considered.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:mileena=calm,I don't feel the least bit bad for you.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=teasing,Rejoice,, Chun-Li: the criminal didn't in the day.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:raven,totalMasturbating:1-2=annoyed,Thanks for telling me the obvious. I had no intentions of watching you from the start.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:winter=thinking,Looks like her day just went from bad to worse.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:mia=calm,How does it feel to be the one cornered for once, Mia?
4-female_must_masturbate,target:rainbow_mika=surprised,You're just skipping the mask? Well, a win's a win...
4-female_must_masturbate,target:spooky=teasing,Just be glad you're not one of those whispy ghosts with no legs.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:streaming-chan=surprised,Umm... did you forget you still have a hat?
4-female_must_masturbate,target:nayru,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=glad,Experience trumps all, I suppose, Nayru.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:wiifitfemale=teasing,Now <i>this</i> is a workout I'd like to see in the next Wii Fit.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=glad,You outlasted Winter, Weiss. That's something to be proud of, right?
4-female_must_masturbate,target:sola=glad,Your Revenge Magic worked so well. Unless that crystal's the magic... I don't get the rules of your world.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:raven=surprised,Oh, I almost forgot about you. You lost, right?
4-female_must_masturbate,target:joey=calm,Maybe you shouldn't have clowned around so much.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:ruby=thinking,I honestly would've thought you'd bring your weapon for this, but the old fashioned way works too.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:kyu=glad,And no one was surprised at this turn of events.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:peach=glad,A shame Peach, but I imagine this is easier than, say, streaking in a military base.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:clover=glad,So much for solving the puzzle or whatever.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:chiaki=glad,Game over for you.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:alice_mgq=tranquil,That went... smoother than I expected.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:monika,alsoPlaying:sayori,alsoPlayingStage:8-9,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:affections-glitch=surprised,Sayori? Where are you going?
4-female_must_masturbate,target:natsuki=calm,Well, go on then. Don't want to disappoint us, do you?
4-female_must_masturbate,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:table,targetNotSaidMarker:tablec=glad,Understandable, but maybe not until the game's over?
4-female_must_masturbate,target:kyoko=thinking,You seem pretty scared, Kyoko. Are you up to this?
4-female_must_masturbate,target:clover,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,Seems you have a fan, Pit.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:elizabeth=tranquil,Looks like I've beaten you, Elizabeth. Let that be a lesson that the skies belong to the gods!
4-female_must_masturbate,target:revy=thinking,Let's see... no guns, no clothes, no win... yep, I think this is cosmic justice at work.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:mahiru,marker:mahirucheck2=teasing,I bet you do this type of thing all the time when you're alone, right Mahiru?
4-female_must_masturbate,target:miko=angry,Don't leave! You still have something to do!
4-female_must_masturbate,target:aella=annoyed,"Oh boy"? That's all? That's an underreaction if I ever heard one.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:chiaki=glad,Chiaki's first? Seems gaming skill and luck don't exactly correlate.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:sayori=glad,Yeah, kind of. Tough luck.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:competitive=surprised,Oh? You almost look disappointed.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:yang=calm,Sorry Yang, but you were <i>way</i> too predictable. Weren't you supposed to be a poker master or something?
4-female_must_masturbate,target:shimakaze=surprised,Oh, crits are in this?
4-female_must_masturbate,target:amalia=glad,Cheaters don't prosper. Pay up, wood girl!
4-female_must_masturbate,target:shego=glad,You put up a good fight, but good always wins in the end.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:shego=teasing,Aren't you supposed to be a "crafty villain"? Medusa would have done <i>way</i> better.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:7-8=calm,Both sisters went out in tandem. Beautiful.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:juri=thinking,So are you just ignoring the part where you lost or...
4-female_must_masturbate,target:kyu,targetTimeInStage:5-100=teasing,You've been dying to do this haven't you? It's been the only thing on your mind since you've gotten naked. Not that there was much aside from that before...
4-female_must_masturbate,filter:virtual=horny,I hope the girl behind the avatar is playing along, if you catch my drift.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:felicia=tranquil,A bit later than I was hoping, but here we are.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:rinkah=glad,Warrior spirit wasn't enough to edge out a win. Time for the forfeit!
4-female_must_masturbate,target:mei=glad,Are you used to <i>this</i>type of experiment, Mei?
4-female_must_masturbate,target:kyu,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:8-9=tranquil,Really? Surprisingly nice of you, Kyu.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:marceline=calm,Good attempt, but futile. Now, guess what time it is?
4-female_must_masturbate,target:nayru=surprised,This really was a voluntary thing?
4-female_must_masturbate,target:jenetta=awkward,This is almost a shame. I liked playing with you.
4-female_start_masturbating=calm,Don't burn out too quickly. The rest of us want to enjoy this game.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:felicia=worried,So... where are you getting all this? You don't seem like the type to know magic.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:sola=teasing,Oh, so you're into this type of stuff! I see.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:winter=calm,Maybe you have a respectable bone in your body after all.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=calm,Who knows? Maybe you'll be able to make up for her loss.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:alice_mgq=calm,And thankfully so...
4-female_start_masturbating,target:juri=horny,Such enthusiasm! A lot of you could learn from her.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:sayori=calm,It's not that big a deal, really. At least for you, it's not. I so rarely get to see humans go at it...
4-female_start_masturbating,target:joey=glad,Talk about a hat trick.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:clover=awkward,horny,As far as I understand, that's how the body works.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:miko=glad,Thank you, Tojiko.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:natsuki=thinking,I'm sure you have plenty of fantasies you can dig up for this, so... have fun with it.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:nayru=tranquil,As far as I can see, you're just getting started with the real thing!
4-female_start_masturbating,target:jolyne=surprised,Coming out of your fingertip... is that... rope?
4-female_start_masturbating,target:chiaki=calm,Alright, show us how good you are with those fingers.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:7-8=glad,Funny how you sisters worry about such trivial things. Did you forget it's a game?
4-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:poem=awkward,...Interesting title.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:elaine=teasing,There's so many good pirate jokes for this.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:moon=teasing,Wow, you're thirstier than a gatekeeper in Kanto!
4-female_start_masturbating,target:sola,alsoPlaying:zizou=glad,So noble, o kind goddess.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=tranquil,I think it's rather obvious to everyone that the roles, in actuality, are reversed.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:spooky=glad,It's only natural. Humans can't resist the urge, even in death.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:dawn=tranquil,How courteous of you to move your hair for us.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:alice_mgq,targetSaidMarker:perverts=tranquil,Works for me!
4-female_start_masturbating,target:monika,targetSaidMarker:joint-masturbation=worried,Hold on, Sayori. She can't do her forfeit like that. Unless <i>you're</i> planning on giving her a hand?
4-female_start_masturbating,target:shantae=tranquil,Ooh, you know what would make this better? A pole! Should've brought my staff...
4-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:whomstdntve=annoyed,What happened to just spelling it out? So much slang these days...
4-female_start_masturbating,target:nagisa=tranquil,Is this the usual way humans put on plays? Maybe Pit wouldn't always fall asleep during them if they were like this!
4-female_start_masturbating,target:revy=awkward,(Maybe it was all just bottled up sexual frustration. Who knows.)
4-female_start_masturbating,target:rinkah=horny,So, do you do this often? Or are there other outlets for the Flame Tribe?
4-female_start_masturbating,target:zone-tan=calm,That's certainly the demeanor of someone who's done this time and time again.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:jenetta=glad,Therians really need to work on their idioms... "Rabid acorns"?
4-female_start_masturbating,target:misty=glad,I don't know what you're scared of. You do performances in a swimsuit all the time, this isn't that much worse.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:aella=thinking,From what I understand, it's not so hard. Just rub down there and you'll get it right eventually.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=tranquil,Ooh, a wrestling match! And I didn't even have to buy tickets!
4-female_start_masturbating,target:revy,targetSaidMarker:maleplayerloss,targetNotSaidMarker:maleplayerfinish=surprised,I'm certain this breaks the rules, but it would be nice to see how mortals... do it.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:pit=horny,That can be arranged.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:raven=calm,Showing off by doing it midair, huh? Don't strain yourself.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:competitive=calm,A good attempt, Kyu. But your protege took it, it seems.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:amalia=annoyed,What's this? More flowers?
4-female_start_masturbating,target:shimakaze=worried,They might be a <i>bit</i> strong, though.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu=horny,Ooh, midair? Perfectly eye level, so everyone gets a nice good look.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:revy,targetSaidMarker:femaleplayerloss,targetNotSaidMarker:femaleplayerfinish=surprised,Oh! Well, I admit I'm a little curious what sex looks like between two mortal women...
4-female_masturbating=teasing,If only you were as focused at cards as you are now, you could've won!
4-female_masturbating,target:zone-tan,priority:0=calm,I hear you're into tentacles, Zone-tan. You ever heard of a Space Kraken? I'm sure you could find a use for the big lug.
4-female_masturbating,target:clover,targetTimeInStage:14-19,alsoPlaying:pit,priority:0=angry,Don't be impolite. She said please and everything.
4-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,alsoPlaying:chun-li,priority:0=horny,Say, why don't you join them, Chun-Li? I'm sure they'd like a familiar face to help out...
4-female_masturbating,target:miko,priority:0=thinking,(This might be the closest thing to an actual punishment I've seen here.)
4-female_masturbating,target:jenetta,priority:0=thinking,(I'm still confused how her eyes work...)
4-female_masturbating,target:sharla,priority:0=teasing,You must press on, and on, and on!
4-female_masturbating,target:aella,priority:0=awkward,It's actually impressive how tall you still are, even when sitting down.
4-female_masturbating,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:7-8,priority:0=teasing,A nearly mutual family masturbation. Really, you're just a few stray hands away from this into unsavory territory.
4-female_masturbating,target:felicia,priority:0=horny,Such wild expressions... she really is more cat than human.
4-female_masturbating,target:raven,priority:0=thinking,(An easy target, now that I look at her. She's lucky she hasn't made an enemy of me... yet.)
4-female_masturbating,target:elaine,priority:0=calm,Lots of plundering abound.
4-female_masturbating,target:chara,priority:0=horny,(<i>Surprisingly, Chara's still giving bad vibes, even in the middle of that... disturbing. But also admirable.</i>)
4-female_masturbating,target:revy,targetSaidMarker:femaleplayerloss,targetNotSaidMarker:femaleplayerfinish,priority:0=glad,(Funny how ~player~ puts up no resistance... and seems to know exactly what to do.)
4-female_masturbating,target:mercy,priority:0=horny,To paraphrase you: <i>'Til Skyworld</i>!
4-female_masturbating,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li,alsoPlayingStage:8,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0=glad,It <i>is</i> a fine butt.
4-female_masturbating,target:sayori,priority:0=thinking,You seem to be pretty good with your fingers. Surprisingly so, for just an ordinary girl...
4-female_masturbating,target:hermione,priority:0=worried,Well, that's an... interesting... use of magic.
4-female_masturbating,target:natsuki,priority:0=awkward,(She really did have a lot of messed-up fantasies...)
4-female_masturbating,target:raven,targetSaidMarker:starfire_watching,priority:0=horny,Perhaps you've been a closet exhibitionist all along.
4-female_masturbating,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:poem,priority:0=awkward,Very... literal, Kyu.
4-female_masturbating,target:alice_mgq,priority:0=teasing,For the record, Medusa did your whole "disguise" trick years ago. And better, too.
4-female_masturbating,target:kyu,saidMarker:kyuplayalong,priority:0=tranquil,<i>You're doing great, Kyu. Just like you've been trained.</i>
4-female_masturbating,target:kyu,saidMarker:kyuplayalong,priority:0=horny,<i>So you're naked and masturbating for strangers now, are you Kyu? What a disgraceful love fairy you are.</i>
4-female_masturbating,target:kyu,saidMarker:kyuplayalong,priority:0=teasing,<i>Harder! You don't want to let me down, do you?</i>
4-female_masturbating,target:winter,priority:0=thinking,You know, for all your hesitation earlier, you're really not hesitating now. Did you finally give in?
4-female_masturbating,target:kyu,notSaidMarker:kyuplayalong,priority:1,marker:kyuplayalong=horny,You know, Kyu... If it helps, I'll play along with your fantasy. Just to help you out.
4-female_masturbating,target:jolyne,priority:0=worried,(Bondage in front of everyone is quite bold... impressive.)
4-female_masturbating,target:shimakaze,priority:0=awkward,I don't blame you for going fast. It might be better to just get it over with, after all.
4-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,priority:0=tranquil,Go for the pin! Preferrably with her legs in the air!
4-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,priority:0=thinking,Maybe we can make this a regular thing here. Wonder if the Inventory has a budget for a mud ring...
4-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,priority:0=angry,C'mon! Step your combo game up!
4-female_masturbating,target:chiaki,priority:0=surprised,I'm a little impressed. You're going much slower than I imagined a seasoned gamer would.
4-female_masturbating,target:nayru,priority:0=horny,I wonder... do musicians provide their own music when they do the deed?
4-female_masturbating,target:joey,priority:0=thinking,Somehow,I'm not sure whether or not this is actually part of Joetta's usual acts.
4-female_masturbating,target:amalia,priority:0=loss,(The image of Viridi doing something like that... ugh.)
4-female_masturbating,target:moon,priority:0=awkward,(I hope not all mortal women are like Moon here...)
4-female_masturbating,target:revy,targetSaidMarker:maleplayerloss,targetNotSaidMarker:maleplayerfinish,priority:0=surprised,So this is sex. I see, I see. (It's... kind of hot...)
4-female_masturbating,target:juri,priority:0=worried,This is supposed to be masturbation, not acrobatics...
4-female_masturbating,target:clover,priority:0=worried,I can't make heads or tails of what Clover's saying... odd.
4-female_masturbating,target:revy,priority:0=awkward,(It's crass, but a little mesmerizing...)
4-female_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch,priority:0=worried,I could never use magic like that. I'm not a fan of bondage, amongst other things.
4-female_masturbating,target:monika,targetSaidMarker:joint-masturbation,priority:0=thinking,(Oh... it's almost as if they're in a trance.)
4-female_masturbating,target:spooky,priority:0=teasing,You know, usually when ghosts moan, it <i>isn't</i> supposed to be sexy.
4-female_masturbating,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-6,priority:0=glad,And this is why we need chairs. To prevent humiliations like this.
4-female_masturbating,target:rinkah,priority:0=thinking,(Maybe <i>this</i> is where her tribe gets their name.)
4-female_masturbating,target:sola,priority:0=worried,What's up with that crystal? It looks like a firecracker from what I can see.
4-female_masturbating,target:lara,priority:0=teasing,How often do you explore <i>these</i> peaks and valleys, Lara?
4-female_finished_masturbating=surprised,Is it healthy for it to gush out like that?
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=calm,You do care. Maybe more than you know.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:rinkah=horny,Not bad, Rinkah. I wonder how you'd do as a member of <i>my</i> army?
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:joey=surprised,Not even a honk? Weak.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingStage:9=glad,A drink sounds good, actually.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:moon=glad,Last chance... although I think I already know the answer.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:gwen=teasing,If rope is all the blue guy can make, you're really no better than her.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:chell=calm,Making a note here:<i>huge</i> success.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:nayru=teasing,You're pretty gutsy for an oracle. Not exactly a <i>useful</i> trait, but it's endearing.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:may=thinking,I give it a seven-point-eight out of ten. Too much juice.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:sayori=glad,There, there. It'll all be okay, Sayori. I promise.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:mahiru,marker:mahirucheck3=glad,Taking pictures of yourself? For such a conservative girl, you're quite the exhibitionist!
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:elaine=tranquil,Ocean, space, doesn't matter. No pirate will ever beat me!
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:evie=loss,I think the temperature just dropped a bit.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:kim=calm,That was fun. I could tell you knew <i>exactly</i> what to do.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:aella=glad,Just think of this as... a learning experience, Aella.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:leela=tranquil,Good show, Miss Monoeye, good show.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:clover=thinking,Oh, you had it all along. It's probably just more prominent now.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:winter=glad,Usually, winter's thought of as white, but I don't think this Winter'll be anything but red!
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:lux=tranquil,You shone like a true warrior of light!
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:nagisa=tranquil,Any chance of an encore performance?
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:aimee=teasing,Normally I'd feel bad for you, but you almost seemed to enjoy shooting yourself.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:orendi=annoyed,I swear, this girl is a walking mood swing...
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:juri=worried,I wouldn't lick that if I were y- never mind.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:penny=thinking,For how shy you are, you put on a really nice show, Penny.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:raven=calm,Oh! At first, I was a little worried that might've been a curse. Sorry!
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:corrin_f=tranquil,I'm glad we could bond like this, Corrin.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:tifa=tranquil,I dedicate this victory to all the times Cloud beat me in Smash.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:shimakaze=thinking,You let this thing wander around the Inventory unsupervised? How irresponsible. Actually, wait, where'd Pit go?
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:marinette=tranquil,I hope you were able to unwind this way.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:jolyne=horny,Such impractical uses for powers... although it makes for a fun show.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:pearl=awkward,So that's why people call it "polishing the pearl"...
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:amalia=teasing,Quite the look for you, wood girl. You should keep it.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:d.va=teasing,A gamer like you should know not to pick fights you can't win.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:revy=calm,How... enlightening. Glad to have seen it. Only a little, obviously.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:natsuki=tranquil,Oh? Seems we know who you shaved for now!
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:jenetta=angry,I should get some soap for that dirty mouth of yours!
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:felicia=teasing,How about you scratch her behind the ears, ~player~? I bet it'll make her happy.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:shimakaze,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,You let this thing wander around the Inventory unsupervised? How irresponsible. It'd be awful if I let Pit wander into a game all by himself, after all.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:8=calm,Well, what are you going to do? No one forced the two of you to come here, after all.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:pit=calm,I can't promise anything, but I'll see what I can do, too.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:sola=annoyed,I hope you wash that later.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:7=glad,That's one. Now to wait for the other.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=glad,Certainly one of the more... entertaining ways of getting off.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:alice_mgq=teasing,Just sit there quietly until everyone's finished. No need for you to die tonight.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:monika,targetSaidMarker:joint-masturbation,targetNotSaidMarker:joint-masturbation-finished=worried,Clearly there's some complicated feelings at work here. I'll let you two sort it out.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:chiaki=calm,Losing in a field you excel at... my condolences. But at least you had fun, by the looks of it.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:spooky=tranquil,Very nice! I learned a lot from that little show...
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:clover,alsoPlaying:pit=horny,If you want to oblige the girl, you have my full permission, Pit.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=worried,I think she'll need a day of three.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:sheena=teasing,(<i>You certainly loosened up fast. Now I'm glad Pit isn't here, since you'd probably jump him.</i>)
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:sharla=thinking,That ether rifle seems to be pretty effective on your stamina...
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:mercy=horny,I think we've all learned a lot today from the good doctor here.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:nayru,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=worried,So where did Little Ms. Fireball go? She might still cause trouble...
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:poem=glad,You get a gold star for trying.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:miko=calm,You're a good pair, you two. I'm a little envious.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:kyu=horny,Did you enjoy my little act? Perhaps I should've become the goddess of theater.


#lost stocking
5-male_must_masturbate=tranquil,Alright. Let's put that eggplant to work!
5-male_must_masturbate,target:pit,totalAlive:2=tranquil,Good game, Pit. But you knew this would be the outcome from the start, didn't you?
5-male_must_masturbate,target:pit,totalAlive:5-3=surprised,Pit's out? Surprising! I thought for sure he'd be my last opponent.
5-male_must_masturbate,target:9s=thinking,Does your...equipment even work?
5-male_must_masturbate,target:ryuji=horny,I'm excited to see how you put one that size to work...
5-male_must_masturbate,target:human=glad,Thank you for taking the loss for us.
5-male_must_masturbate,target:human=calm,This'll be a learning experience for me too.
5-male_start_masturbating=teasing,Are you a leg guy, ~name~? We'll see in a minute.
5-male_start_masturbating,target:ryuji=glad,Don't think of it like something weird. Think of it as... a teaching. For me.
5-male_start_masturbating,target:pit=teasing,Well, obviously. This is the consolation prize for our other players!
5-male_start_masturbating,target:kira=surprised,...Is that Mewtwo?
5-male_start_masturbating,target:ryuji,totalFemales:2-4=glad,Don't think of it like something weird. Think of it as... a teaching. For me and all the ladies here.
5-male_start_masturbating,target:9s=teasing,Only one way to find out!
5-male_masturbating=thinking,I wonder how much you could go if I gave you the Tireless power?
5-male_masturbating,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,priority:0=annoyed,Can you hurry this up? This is starting to get boring. You feel the same, ~player~?
5-male_masturbating,target:xander,priority:0=tranquil,Yep. Exactly the sort of performance I'd expect from a normal guy like you, Xander.
5-male_masturbating,target:pit,priority:0=glad,You're doing great, Pit. Really.
5-male_masturbating,target:human,priority:0=surprised,What a champion!
5-male_masturbating,target:human,priority:0=worried,I'm starting to get into this myself.
5-male_masturbating,target:human,priority:0=calm,Are you getting close? I think he's getting close.
5-male_masturbating,target:human,priority:0=teasing,I can tell ~player~ is thinking something...naughty.
5-male_masturbating,target:ryuji,priority:0=calm,Must be a piece of cake, huh? <i>I'm</i> here, after all.
5-male_masturbating,target:ryu,priority:0=horny,If only this was the turbo edition...
5-male_masturbating,target:9s,priority:0=surprised,Oh, you are a quick learner, aren't you? Well, I guess it makes sense for an android...
5-male_finished_masturbating=surprised,Such a moving performance, it put a tear in my eye... this <i>is</i> a tear, right?
5-male_finished_masturbating,target:pit=teasing,You really <i>are</i> finished this time.
5-male_finished_masturbating,target:human=tranquil,You didn't do half bad, ~name~!
5-male_finished_masturbating,target:captain_falcon=horny,A showman as always, Falcon. I liked it a lot.
5-male_finished_masturbating,target:9s=horny,Seems our little robotic friend is firing blanks.
5-male_finished_masturbating,target:ryuji=tranquil,Well done! I enjoyed every minute of that, Ryuji.
5-female_must_masturbate=teasing,Sorry, but we all knew it would end this way.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:alice_mgq=tranquil,That went... smoother than I expected.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:chiaki=glad,Game over for you.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:streaming-chan=surprised,Umm... did you forget you still have a hat?
5-female_must_masturbate,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=teasing,Rejoice,, Chun-Li: the criminal didn't in the day.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:nayru=surprised,This really was a voluntary thing?
5-female_must_masturbate,target:miko=angry,Don't leave! You still have something to do!
5-female_must_masturbate,target:kyu,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:8-9=tranquil,Really? Surprisingly nice of you, Kyu.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:shazza=horny,I've always wanted to pet a dingo, but I'll settle for watching one pet herself.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:rinkah=glad,Warrior spirit wasn't enough to edge out a win. Time for the forfeit!
5-female_must_masturbate,target:elaine=glad,<i>Get ready to walk the plank!</i>
5-female_must_masturbate,target:ruby=thinking,I honestly would've thought you'd bring your weapon for this, but the old fashioned way works too.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:kyu,targetTimeInStage:5-100=teasing,You've been dying to do this haven't you? It's been the only thing on your mind since you've gotten naked. Not that there was much aside from that before...
5-female_must_masturbate,target:monika,alsoPlaying:sayori,alsoPlayingStage:8-9,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:affections-glitch=surprised,Sayori? Where are you going?
5-female_must_masturbate,target:felicia=tranquil,A bit later than I was hoping, but here we are.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:nayru,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=glad,Experience trumps all, I suppose, Nayru.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:table,targetNotSaidMarker:tablec=glad,Understandable, but maybe not until the game's over?
5-female_must_masturbate,target:aella=annoyed,"Oh boy"? That's all? That's an underreaction if I ever heard one.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:chiaki=glad,Chiaki's first? Seems gaming skill and luck don't exactly correlate.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:jolyne=calm,That's fine. Jolyne doesn't really seem to care, anyway.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:mei=glad,Are you used to <i>this</i>type of experiment, Mei?
5-female_must_masturbate,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:competitive=surprised,Oh? You almost look disappointed.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:mahiru,marker:mahirucheck2=teasing,I bet you do this type of thing all the time when you're alone, right Mahiru?
5-female_must_masturbate,target:amalia=glad,Cheaters don't prosper. Pay up, wood girl!
5-female_must_masturbate,target:shego=glad,You put up a good fight, but good always wins in the end.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:shego=teasing,Aren't you supposed to be a "crafty villain"? Medusa would have done <i>way</i> better.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:kyu=glad,And no one was surprised at this turn of events.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:raven,totalMasturbating:1-2=annoyed,Thanks for telling me the obvious. I had no intentions of watching you from the start.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:yang=calm,Sorry Yang, but you were <i>way</i> too predictable. Weren't you supposed to be a poker master or something?
5-female_must_masturbate,target:rainbow_mika=surprised,You're just skipping the mask? Well, a win's a win...
5-female_must_masturbate,target:natsuki=calm,Well, go on then. Don't want to disappoint us, do you?
5-female_must_masturbate,target:wiifitfemale=teasing,Now <i>this</i> is a workout I'd like to see in the next Wii Fit.
5-female_must_masturbate,filter:virtual=horny,I hope the girl behind the avatar is playing along, if you catch my drift.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:spooky=teasing,Just be glad you're not one of those whispy ghosts with no legs.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:joey=calm,Maybe you shouldn't have clowned around so much.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:mileena=calm,I don't feel the least bit bad for you.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:peach=glad,A shame Peach, but I imagine this is easier than, say, streaking in a military base.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:revy=thinking,Let's see... no guns, no clothes, no win... yep, I think this is cosmic justice at work.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:jenetta=awkward,This is almost a shame. I liked playing with you.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:mia=calm,How does it feel to be the one cornered for once, Mia?
5-female_must_masturbate,target:sayori=glad,Yeah, kind of. Tough luck.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:juri=thinking,So are you just ignoring the part where you lost or...
5-female_must_masturbate,target:clover,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,Seems you have a fan, Pit.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:7-8=calm,Both sisters went out in tandem. Beautiful.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:shimakaze=surprised,Oh, crits are in this?
5-female_must_masturbate,target:marceline=calm,Good attempt, but futile. Now, guess what time it is?
5-female_must_masturbate,target:kyoko=thinking,You seem pretty scared, Kyoko. Are you up to this?
5-female_must_masturbate,target:raven=surprised,Oh, I almost forgot about you. You lost, right?
5-female_must_masturbate,target:clover=glad,So much for solving the puzzle or whatever.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:winter=thinking,Looks like her day just went from bad to worse.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:sola=glad,Your Revenge Magic worked so well. Unless that crystal's the magic... I don't get the rules of your world.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=glad,You outlasted Winter, Weiss. That's something to be proud of, right?
5-female_must_masturbate,target:moon=awkward,No good. She's hardly taken a glance at me all night.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:elizabeth=tranquil,Looks like I've beaten you, Elizabeth. Let that be a lesson that the skies belong to the gods!
5-female_must_masturbate,target:kurumu=teasing,Don't give her any sympathy. She got off easy, all things considered.
5-female_start_masturbating=glad,Good luck, ~name~.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:7-8=glad,Funny how you sisters worry about such trivial things. Did you forget it's a game?
5-female_start_masturbating,target:aella=thinking,From what I understand, it's not so hard. Just rub down there and you'll get it right eventually.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:winter=calm,Maybe you have a respectable bone in your body after all.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=tranquil,I think it's rather obvious to everyone that the roles, in actuality, are reversed.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:alice_mgq,targetSaidMarker:perverts=tranquil,Works for me!
5-female_start_masturbating,target:zone-tan=calm,That's certainly the demeanor of someone who's done this time and time again.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:sola,alsoPlaying:zizou=glad,So noble, o kind goddess.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:elaine=teasing,There's so many good pirate jokes for this.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:nagisa=tranquil,Is this the usual way humans put on plays? Maybe Pit wouldn't always fall asleep during them if they were like this!
5-female_start_masturbating,target:misty=glad,I don't know what you're scared of. You do performances in a swimsuit all the time, this isn't that much worse.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:pit=horny,That can be arranged.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:spooky=glad,It's only natural. Humans can't resist the urge, even in death.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:sayori=calm,It's not that big a deal, really. At least for you, it's not. I so rarely get to see humans go at it...
5-female_start_masturbating,target:revy,targetSaidMarker:maleplayerloss,targetNotSaidMarker:maleplayerfinish=surprised,I'm certain this breaks the rules, but it would be nice to see how mortals... do it.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:whomstdntve=annoyed,What happened to just spelling it out? So much slang these days...
5-female_start_masturbating,target:shantae=tranquil,Ooh, you know what would make this better? A pole! Should've brought my staff...
5-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:poem=awkward,...Interesting title.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:revy,targetSaidMarker:femaleplayerloss,targetNotSaidMarker:femaleplayerfinish=surprised,Oh! Well, I admit I'm a little curious what sex looks like between two mortal women...
5-female_start_masturbating,target:moon=teasing,Wow, you're thirstier than a gatekeeper in Kanto!
5-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:competitive=calm,A good attempt, Kyu. But your protege took it, it seems.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:shimakaze=worried,They might be a <i>bit</i> strong, though.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:dawn=tranquil,How courteous of you to move your hair for us.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:alice_mgq=calm,And thankfully so...
5-female_start_masturbating,target:amalia=annoyed,What's this? More flowers?
5-female_start_masturbating,target:monika,targetSaidMarker:joint-masturbation=worried,Hold on, Sayori. She can't do her forfeit like that. Unless <i>you're</i> planning on giving her a hand?
5-female_start_masturbating,target:nayru=tranquil,As far as I can see, you're just getting started with the real thing!
5-female_start_masturbating,target:raven=calm,Showing off by doing it midair, huh? Don't strain yourself.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:jenetta=glad,Therians really need to work on their idioms... "Rabid acorns"?
5-female_start_masturbating,target:chiaki=calm,Alright, show us how good you are with those fingers.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:joey=glad,Talk about a hat trick.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:sola=teasing,Oh, so you're into this type of stuff! I see.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:felicia=worried,So... where are you getting all this? You don't seem like the type to know magic.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:miko=glad,Thank you, Tojiko.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:natsuki=thinking,I'm sure you have plenty of fantasies you can dig up for this, so... have fun with it.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:rinkah=horny,So, do you do this often? Or are there other outlets for the Flame Tribe?
5-female_start_masturbating,target:clover=awkward,horny,As far as I understand, that's how the body works.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=tranquil,Ooh, a wrestling match! And I didn't even have to buy tickets!
5-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu=horny,Ooh, midair? Perfectly eye level, so everyone gets a nice good look.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:jolyne=surprised,Coming out of your fingertip... is that... rope?
5-female_start_masturbating,target:juri=horny,Such enthusiasm! A lot of you could learn from her.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=calm,Who knows? Maybe you'll be able to make up for her loss.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:revy=awkward,(Maybe it was all just bottled up sexual frustration. Who knows.)
5-female_masturbating=thinking,~name~ certainly has a... captivating technique.
5-female_masturbating,target:raven,priority:0=thinking,(An easy target, now that I look at her. She's lucky she hasn't made an enemy of me... yet.)
5-female_masturbating,target:revy,targetSaidMarker:femaleplayerloss,targetNotSaidMarker:femaleplayerfinish,priority:0=glad,(Funny how ~player~ puts up no resistance... and seems to know exactly what to do.)
5-female_masturbating,target:rinkah,priority:0=thinking,(Maybe <i>this</i> is where her tribe gets their name.)
5-female_masturbating,target:sharla,priority:0=teasing,You must press on, and on, and on!
5-female_masturbating,target:zone-tan,priority:0=calm,I hear you're into tentacles, Zone-tan. You ever heard of a Space Kraken? I'm sure you could find a use for the big lug.
5-female_masturbating,target:chiaki,priority:0=surprised,I'm a little impressed. You're going much slower than I imagined a seasoned gamer would.
5-female_masturbating,target:joey,priority:0=thinking,Somehow,I'm not sure whether or not this is actually part of Joetta's usual acts.
5-female_masturbating,target:jolyne,priority:0=worried,(Bondage in front of everyone is quite bold... impressive.)
5-female_masturbating,target:nayru,priority:0=horny,I wonder... do musicians provide their own music when they do the deed?
5-female_masturbating,target:aella,priority:0=awkward,It's actually impressive how tall you still are, even when sitting down.
5-female_masturbating,target:juri,priority:0=worried,This is supposed to be masturbation, not acrobatics...
5-female_masturbating,target:alice_mgq,priority:0=teasing,For the record, Medusa did your whole "disguise" trick years ago. And better, too.
5-female_masturbating,target:felicia,priority:0=horny,Such wild expressions... she really is more cat than human.
5-female_masturbating,target:clover,priority:0=worried,I can't make heads or tails of what Clover's saying... odd.
5-female_masturbating,target:amalia,priority:0=loss,(The image of Viridi doing something like that... ugh.)
5-female_masturbating,target:revy,targetSaidMarker:maleplayerloss,targetNotSaidMarker:maleplayerfinish,priority:0=surprised,So this is sex. I see, I see. (It's... kind of hot...)
5-female_masturbating,target:miko,priority:0=thinking,(This might be the closest thing to an actual punishment I've seen here.)
5-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,alsoPlaying:chun-li,priority:0=horny,Say, why don't you join them, Chun-Li? I'm sure they'd like a familiar face to help out...
5-female_masturbating,target:raven,targetSaidMarker:starfire_watching,priority:0=horny,Perhaps you've been a closet exhibitionist all along.
5-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,priority:0=tranquil,Go for the pin! Preferrably with her legs in the air!
5-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,priority:0=thinking,Maybe we can make this a regular thing here. Wonder if the Inventory has a budget for a mud ring...
5-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,priority:0=angry,C'mon! Step your combo game up!

5-female_masturbating,target:sola,priority:0=worried,What's up with that crystal? It looks like a firecracker from what I can see.
5-female_masturbating,target:revy,priority:0=awkward,(It's crass, but a little mesmerizing...)

6-female_must_masturbate,target:peach=glad,A shame Peach, but I imagine this is easier than, say, streaking in a military base.

6-female_must_masturbate,target:elizabeth=tranquil,Looks like I've beaten you, Elizabeth. Let that be a lesson that the skies belong to the gods!
6-female_must_masturbate,target:sola=glad,Your Revenge Magic worked so well. Unless that crystal's the magic... I don't get the rules of your world.

6-female_must_masturbate,target:marceline=calm,Good attempt, but futile. Now, guess what time it is?
6-female_must_masturbate,target:juri=thinking,So are you just ignoring the part where you lost or...
6-female_must_masturbate,target:revy=thinking,Let's see... no guns, no clothes, no win... yep, I think this is cosmic justice at work.

6-female_must_masturbate,target:kyu,targetTimeInStage:5-100=teasing,You've been dying to do this haven't you? It's been the only thing on your mind since you've gotten naked. Not that there was much aside from that before...
6-female_must_masturbate,filter:virtual=horny,I hope the girl behind the avatar is playing along, if you catch my drift.

6-female_must_masturbate,target:yang=calm,Sorry Yang, but you were <i>way</i> too predictable. Weren't you supposed to be a poker master or something?
6-female_must_masturbate,target:kyu=glad,And no one was surprised at this turn of events.
6-female_must_masturbate,target:raven,totalMasturbating:1-2=annoyed,Thanks for telling me the obvious. I had no intentions of watching you from the start.

6-female_must_masturbate,target:shego=glad,You put up a good fight, but good always wins in the end.
6-female_must_masturbate,target:shego=teasing,Aren't you supposed to be a "crafty villain"? Medusa would have done <i>way</i> better.
6-female_must_masturbate,target:mahiru,marker:mahirucheck2=teasing,I bet you do this type of thing all the time when you're alone, right Mahiru?
6-female_must_masturbate,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:competitive=surprised,Oh? You almost look disappointed.
6-female_must_masturbate,target:aella=annoyed,"Oh boy"? That's all? That's an underreaction if I ever heard one.
6-female_must_masturbate,target:mei=glad,Are you used to <i>this</i>type of experiment, Mei?
6-female_must_masturbate,target:chiaki=glad,Chiaki's first? Seems gaming skill and luck don't exactly correlate.

6-female_must_masturbate,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=glad,You outlasted Winter, Weiss. That's something to be proud of, right?
6-female_must_masturbate,target:natsuki=calm,Well, go on then. Don't want to disappoint us, do you?
6-female_must_masturbate,target:mileena=calm,I don't feel the least bit bad for you.

6-female_must_masturbate,target:rinkah=glad,Warrior spirit wasn't enough to edge out a win. Time for the forfeit!
6-female_must_masturbate,target:nayru,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=glad,Experience trumps all, I suppose, Nayru.
6-female_must_masturbate,target:nayru=surprised,This really was a voluntary thing?
6-female_must_masturbate,target:joey=calm,Maybe you shouldn't have clowned around so much.
6-female_must_masturbate,target:streaming-chan=surprised,Umm... did you forget you still have a hat?
6-female_must_masturbate,target:elaine=glad,<i>Get ready to walk the plank!</i>
6-female_start_masturbating=glad,If you need instructions on how to do it, ask someone else, please.
6-female_start_masturbating,target:winter=calm,Maybe you have a respectable bone in your body after all.
6-female_start_masturbating,target:chiaki=calm,Alright, show us how good you are with those fingers.
6-female_start_masturbating,target:dawn=tranquil,How courteous of you to move your hair for us.
6-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:poem=awkward,...Interesting title.
6-female_start_masturbating,target:rinkah=horny,So, do you do this often? Or are there other outlets for the Flame Tribe?
6-female_start_masturbating,target:misty=glad,I don't know what you're scared of. You do performances in a swimsuit all the time, this isn't that much worse.
6-female_start_masturbating,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=calm,Who knows? Maybe you'll be able to make up for her loss.
6-female_start_masturbating,target:raven=calm,Showing off by doing it midair, huh? Don't strain yourself.
6-female_start_masturbating,target:moon=teasing,Wow, you're thirstier than a gatekeeper in Kanto!
6-female_start_masturbating,target:alice_mgq=calm,And thankfully so...
6-female_start_masturbating,target:nayru=tranquil,As far as I can see, you're just getting started with the real thing!

6-female_start_masturbating,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:7-8=glad,Funny how you sisters worry about such trivial things. Did you forget it's a game?
6-female_start_masturbating,target:sola,alsoPlaying:zizou=glad,So noble, o kind goddess.
6-female_start_masturbating,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:pit=horny,That can be arranged.
6-female_start_masturbating,target:sola=teasing,Oh, so you're into this type of stuff! I see.
6-female_start_masturbating,target:alice_mgq,targetSaidMarker:perverts=tranquil,Works for me!
6-female_start_masturbating,target:revy,targetSaidMarker:maleplayerloss,targetNotSaidMarker:maleplayerfinish=surprised,I'm certain this breaks the rules, but it would be nice to see how mortals... do it.
6-female_start_masturbating,target:monika,targetSaidMarker:joint-masturbation=worried,Hold on, Sayori. She can't do her forfeit like that. Unless <i>you're</i> planning on giving her a hand?
6-female_start_masturbating,target:jolyne=surprised,Coming out of your fingertip... is that... rope?
6-female_start_masturbating,target:revy,targetSaidMarker:femaleplayerloss,targetNotSaidMarker:femaleplayerfinish=surprised,Oh! Well, I admit I'm a little curious what sex looks like between two mortal women...
6-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:competitive=calm,A good attempt, Kyu. But your protege took it, it seems.
6-female_start_masturbating,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=tranquil,I think it's rather obvious to everyone that the roles, in actuality, are reversed.
6-female_start_masturbating,target:shantae=tranquil,Ooh, you know what would make this better? A pole! Should've brought my staff...
6-female_start_masturbating,target:revy=awkward,(Maybe it was all just bottled up sexual frustration. Who knows.)
6-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:whomstdntve=annoyed,What happened to just spelling it out? So much slang these days...
6-female_start_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=tranquil,Ooh, a wrestling match! And I didn't even have to buy tickets!
6-female_start_masturbating,target:spooky=glad,It's only natural. Humans can't resist the urge, even in death.
6-female_start_masturbating,target:miko=glad,Thank you, Tojiko.
6-female_start_masturbating,target:amalia=annoyed,What's this? More flowers?
6-female_start_masturbating,target:clover=awkward,horny,As far as I understand, that's how the body works.
6-female_start_masturbating,target:felicia=worried,So... where are you getting all this? You don't seem like the type to know magic.
6-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu=horny,Ooh, midair? Perfectly eye level, so everyone gets a nice good look.
6-female_start_masturbating,target:shimakaze=worried,They might be a <i>bit</i> strong, though.
6-female_start_masturbating,target:aella=thinking,From what I understand, it's not so hard. Just rub down there and you'll get it right eventually.
6-female_start_masturbating,target:zone-tan=calm,That's certainly the demeanor of someone who's done this time and time again.
6-female_start_masturbating,target:nagisa=tranquil,Is this the usual way humans put on plays? Maybe Pit wouldn't always fall asleep during them if they were like this!
6-female_start_masturbating,target:elaine=teasing,There's so many good pirate jokes for this.
6-female_start_masturbating,target:joey=glad,Talk about a hat trick.
6-female_start_masturbating,target:jenetta=glad,Therians really need to work on their idioms... "Rabid acorns"?
6-female_start_masturbating,target:sayori=calm,It's not that big a deal, really. At least for you, it's not. I so rarely get to see humans go at it...
6-female_start_masturbating,target:natsuki=thinking,I'm sure you have plenty of fantasies you can dig up for this, so... have fun with it.
6-female_masturbating=calm,Having fun there?

6-female_masturbating,target:lara,priority:0=teasing,How often do you explore <i>these</i> peaks and valleys, Lara?
6-female_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch,priority:0=worried,I could never use magic like that. I'm not a fan of bondage, amongst other things.
6-female_masturbating,target:winter,priority:0=thinking,You know, for all your hesitation earlier, you're really not hesitating now. Did you finally give in?
6-female_masturbating,target:spooky,priority:0=teasing,You know, usually when ghosts moan, it <i>isn't</i> supposed to be sexy.
6-female_masturbating,target:elaine,priority:0=calm,Lots of plundering abound.
6-female_masturbating,target:zone-tan,priority:0=calm,I hear you're into tentacles, Zone-tan. You ever heard of a Space Kraken? I'm sure you could find a use for the big lug.
6-female_masturbating,target:juri,priority:0=worried,This is supposed to be masturbation, not acrobatics...
6-female_masturbating,target:nayru,priority:0=horny,I wonder... do musicians provide their own music when they do the deed?

6-female_masturbating,target:sola,priority:0=worried,What's up with that crystal? It looks like a firecracker from what I can see.
6-female_masturbating,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:7-8,priority:0=teasing,A nearly mutual family masturbation. Really, you're just a few stray hands away from this into unsavory territory.
6-female_masturbating,target:clover,priority:0=worried,I can't make heads or tails of what Clover's saying... odd.
6-female_masturbating,target:natsuki,priority:0=awkward,(She really did have a lot of messed-up fantasies...)
6-female_masturbating,target:alice_mgq,priority:0=teasing,For the record, Medusa did your whole "disguise" trick years ago. And better, too.
6-female_masturbating,target:chiaki,priority:0=surprised,I'm a little impressed. You're going much slower than I imagined a seasoned gamer would.
6-female_masturbating,target:raven,priority:0=thinking,(An easy target, now that I look at her. She's lucky she hasn't made an enemy of me... yet.)
6-female_masturbating,target:rinkah,priority:0=thinking,(Maybe <i>this</i> is where her tribe gets their name.)
6-female_masturbating,target:joey,priority:0=thinking,Somehow,I'm not sure whether or not this is actually part of Joetta's usual acts.
6-female_masturbating,target:revy,targetSaidMarker:femaleplayerloss,targetNotSaidMarker:femaleplayerfinish,priority:0=glad,(Funny how ~player~ puts up no resistance... and seems to know exactly what to do.)
6-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,alsoPlaying:chun-li,priority:0=horny,Say, why don't you join them, Chun-Li? I'm sure they'd like a familiar face to help out...

6-female_masturbating,target:amalia,priority:0=loss,(The image of Viridi doing something like that... ugh.)
6-female_masturbating,target:shimakaze,priority:0=awkward,I don't blame you for going fast. It might be better to just get it over with, after all.
6-female_masturbating,target:revy,targetSaidMarker:maleplayerloss,targetNotSaidMarker:maleplayerfinish,priority:0=surprised,So this is sex. I see, I see. (It's... kind of hot...)

6-female_masturbating,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-6,priority:0=glad,And this is why we need chairs. To prevent humiliations like this.
6-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,priority:0=tranquil,Go for the pin! Preferrably with her legs in the air!
6-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,priority:0=thinking,Maybe we can make this a regular thing here. Wonder if the Inventory has a budget for a mud ring...
6-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,priority:0=angry,C'mon! Step your combo game up!
6-female_masturbating,target:raven,targetSaidMarker:starfire_watching,priority:0=horny,Perhaps you've been a closet exhibitionist all along.
6-female_finished_masturbating=surprised,You look rather pleased with yourself.
6-female_finished_masturbating,target:shimakaze,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,You let this thing wander around the Inventory unsupervised? How irresponsible. It'd be awful if I let Pit wander into a game all by himself, after all.
6-female_finished_masturbating,target:jenetta=angry,I should get some soap for that dirty mouth of yours!
6-female_finished_masturbating,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:8=calm,Well, what are you going to do? No one forced the two of you to come here, after all.
6-female_finished_masturbating,target:clover,alsoPlaying:pit=horny,If you want to oblige the girl, you have my full permission, Pit.

6-female_finished_masturbating,target:joey=surprised,Not even a honk? Weak.
6-female_finished_masturbating,target:marinette=tranquil,I hope you were able to unwind this way.
6-female_finished_masturbating,target:felicia=teasing,How about you scratch her behind the ears, ~player~? I bet it'll make her happy.
6-female_finished_masturbating,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingStage:9=glad,A drink sounds good, actually.
6-female_finished_masturbating,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=calm,You do care. Maybe more than you know.
6-female_finished_masturbating,target:pearl=awkward,So that's why people call it "polishing the pearl"...
6-female_finished_masturbating,target:kim=calm,That was fun. I could tell you knew <i>exactly</i> what to do.
6-female_finished_masturbating,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=worried,I think she'll need a day of three.
6-female_finished_masturbating,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:pit=calm,I can't promise anything, but I'll see what I can do, too.

6-female_finished_masturbating,target:elaine=tranquil,Ocean, space, doesn't matter. No pirate will ever beat me!
6-female_finished_masturbating,target:may=thinking,I give it a seven-point-eight out of ten. Too much juice.
6-female_finished_masturbating,target:mahiru,marker:mahirucheck3=glad,Taking pictures of yourself? For such a conservative girl, you're quite the exhibitionist!
6-female_finished_masturbating,target:lux=tranquil,You shone like a true warrior of light!
6-female_finished_masturbating,target:natsuki=tranquil,Oh? Seems we know who you shaved for now!
6-female_finished_masturbating,target:chell=calm,Making a note here:<i>huge</i> success.
6-female_finished_masturbating,target:aimee=teasing,Normally I'd feel bad for you, but you almost seemed to enjoy shooting yourself.
6-female_finished_masturbating,target:amalia=teasing,Quite the look for you, wood girl. You should keep it.
6-female_finished_masturbating,target:sola=annoyed,I hope you wash that later.
6-female_finished_masturbating,target:clover=thinking,Oh, you had it all along. It's probably just more prominent now.
6-female_finished_masturbating,target:tifa=tranquil,I dedicate this victory to all the times Cloud beat me in Smash.
6-female_finished_masturbating,target:revy=calm,How... enlightening. Glad to have seen it. Only a little, obviously.
6-female_finished_masturbating,target:nagisa=tranquil,Any chance of an encore performance?
6-female_finished_masturbating,target:raven=calm,Oh! At first, I was a little worried that might've been a curse. Sorry!
6-female_finished_masturbating,target:mercy=horny,I think we've all learned a lot today from the good doctor here.
6-female_finished_masturbating,target:orendi=annoyed,I swear, this girl is a walking mood swing...
6-female_finished_masturbating,target:nayru,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=worried,So where did Little Ms. Fireball go? She might still cause trouble...
6-female_finished_masturbating,target:kyu=horny,Did you enjoy my little act? Perhaps I should've become the goddess of theater.
6-female_finished_masturbating,target:chiaki=calm,Losing in a field you excel at... my condolences. But at least you had fun, by the looks of it.
6-female_finished_masturbating,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:poem=glad,You get a gold star for trying.
6-female_finished_masturbating,target:penny=thinking,For how shy you are, you put on a really nice show, Penny.
6-female_finished_masturbating,target:corrin_f=tranquil,I'm glad we could bond like this, Corrin.
6-female_finished_masturbating,target:monika,targetSaidMarker:joint-masturbation,targetNotSaidMarker:joint-masturbation-finished=worried,Clearly there's some complicated feelings at work here. I'll let you two sort it out.
6-female_finished_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=glad,Certainly one of the more... entertaining ways of getting off.
6-female_finished_masturbating,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:7=glad,That's one. Now to wait for the other.
6-female_finished_masturbating,target:juri=worried,I wouldn't lick that if I were y- never mind.
6-female_finished_masturbating,target:sharla=thinking,That ether rifle seems to be pretty effective on your stamina...
6-female_finished_masturbating,target:d.va=teasing,A gamer like you should know not to pick fights you can't win.
6-female_finished_masturbating,target:jolyne=horny,Such impractical uses for powers... although it makes for a fun show.
6-female_finished_masturbating,target:moon=glad,Last chance... although I think I already know the answer.
6-female_finished_masturbating,target:rinkah=horny,Not bad, Rinkah. I wonder how you'd do as a member of <i>my</i> army?
6-female_finished_masturbating,target:miko=calm,You're a good pair, you two. I'm a little envious.
6-female_finished_masturbating,target:nayru=teasing,You're pretty gutsy for an oracle. Not exactly a <i>useful</i> trait, but it's endearing.
6-female_finished_masturbating,target:spooky=tranquil,Very nice! I learned a lot from that little show...
6-female_finished_masturbating,target:winter=glad,Usually, winter's thought of as white, but I don't think this Winter'll be anything but red!
6-female_finished_masturbating,target:shimakaze=thinking,You let this thing wander around the Inventory unsupervised? How irresponsible. Actually, wait, where'd Pit go?
6-female_finished_masturbating,target:alice_mgq=teasing,Just sit there quietly until everyone's finished. No need for you to die tonight.
6-female_finished_masturbating,target:sheena=teasing,(<i>You certainly loosened up fast. Now I'm glad Pit isn't here, since you'd probably jump him.</i>)

-3-must_masturbate,marker:palutena_livedown=annoyed,Welp. Never living this one down.
-3-male_start_masturbating,target:ryuji=glad,Don't think of it like something weird. Think of it as... a teaching. For me.

-3-male_start_masturbating,target:9s=teasing,Only one way to find out!

-3-male_masturbating,target:human,priority:0=surprised,What a champion!
-3-male_masturbating,target:human,priority:0=worried,I'm starting to get into this myself.
-3-male_masturbating,target:human,priority:0=calm,Are you getting close? I think he's getting close.
-3-male_masturbating,target:human,priority:0=teasing,I can tell ~player~ is thinking something...naughty.
-3-male_masturbating,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,priority:0=annoyed,Can you hurry this up? This is starting to get boring. You feel the same, ~player~?
-3-male_masturbating,target:xander,priority:0=tranquil,Yep. Exactly the sort of performance I'd expect from a normal guy like you, Xander.
-3-male_masturbating,target:ryu,priority:0=horny,If only this was the turbo edition...
-3-male_masturbating,target:ryuji,priority:0=calm,Must be a piece of cake, huh? <i>I'm</i> here, after all.
-3-male_finished_masturbating=teasing,Way to craft that Burning Palm, ~name~.
-3-male_finished_masturbating=teasing,A messy finish ~name~, you need a visit to the hot springs.
-3-male_finished_masturbating=teasing,Over before I started, ~name~? I guess seeing a goddess naked will do that.
-3-male_finished_masturbating,target:human=tranquil,You didn't do half bad, ~name~!
-3-male_finished_masturbating,target:pit=teasing,You really <i>are</i> finished this time.
-3-male_finished_masturbating,target:9s=horny,Seems our little robotic friend is firing blanks.
-3-male_finished_masturbating,target:ryuji=tranquil,Well done! I enjoyed every minute of that, Ryuji.
-3-male_finished_masturbating,target:captain_falcon=horny,A showman as always, Falcon. I liked it a lot.
-3-female_must_masturbate=thinking,Sorry, ~name~. I can only imagine how disappointed you must be in yourself, to fail right at the very end...
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:alice_mgq=tranquil,That went... smoother than I expected.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:rainbow_mika=surprised,You're just skipping the mask? Well, a win's a win...
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:felicia=tranquil,A bit later than I was hoping, but here we are.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:joey=calm,Maybe you shouldn't have clowned around so much.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:natsuki=calm,Well, go on then. Don't want to disappoint us, do you?
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:clover=glad,So much for solving the puzzle or whatever.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:juri=thinking,So are you just ignoring the part where you lost or...
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:jolyne=calm,That's fine. Jolyne doesn't really seem to care, anyway.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:sola=glad,Your Revenge Magic worked so well. Unless that crystal's the magic... I don't get the rules of your world.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:raven=surprised,Oh, I almost forgot about you. You lost, right?
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:miko=angry,Don't leave! You still have something to do!
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:revy=thinking,Let's see... no guns, no clothes, no win... yep, I think this is cosmic justice at work.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:sayori=glad,Yeah, kind of. Tough luck.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:shimakaze=surprised,Oh, crits are in this?
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:winter=thinking,Looks like her day just went from bad to worse.

-3-female_must_masturbate,target:spooky=teasing,Just be glad you're not one of those whispy ghosts with no legs.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:elaine=glad,<i>Get ready to walk the plank!</i>
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:rinkah=glad,Warrior spirit wasn't enough to edge out a win. Time for the forfeit!
-3-female_must_masturbate,filter:virtual=horny,I hope the girl behind the avatar is playing along, if you catch my drift.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:nayru=surprised,This really was a voluntary thing?
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:jenetta=awkward,This is almost a shame. I liked playing with you.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:kyu=glad,And no one was surprised at this turn of events.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:aella=annoyed,"Oh boy"? That's all? That's an underreaction if I ever heard one.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:mahiru,marker:mahirucheck2=teasing,I bet you do this type of thing all the time when you're alone, right Mahiru?
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:monika,alsoPlaying:sayori,alsoPlayingStage:8-9,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:affections-glitch=surprised,Sayori? Where are you going?

-3-female_must_masturbate,target:clover,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,Seems you have a fan, Pit.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:amalia=glad,Cheaters don't prosper. Pay up, wood girl!
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:kyu,targetTimeInStage:5-100=teasing,You've been dying to do this haven't you? It's been the only thing on your mind since you've gotten naked. Not that there was much aside from that before...
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:raven,totalMasturbating:1-2=annoyed,Thanks for telling me the obvious. I had no intentions of watching you from the start.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:table,targetNotSaidMarker:tablec=glad,Understandable, but maybe not until the game's over?
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:competitive=surprised,Oh? You almost look disappointed.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:nayru,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=glad,Experience trumps all, I suppose, Nayru.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:kurumu=teasing,Don't give her any sympathy. She got off easy, all things considered.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:peach=glad,A shame Peach, but I imagine this is easier than, say, streaking in a military base.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:elizabeth=tranquil,Looks like I've beaten you, Elizabeth. Let that be a lesson that the skies belong to the gods!
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=teasing,Rejoice,, Chun-Li: the criminal didn't in the day.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:marceline=calm,Good attempt, but futile. Now, guess what time it is?
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:chiaki=glad,Game over for you.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:chiaki=glad,Chiaki's first? Seems gaming skill and luck don't exactly correlate.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:kyoko=thinking,You seem pretty scared, Kyoko. Are you up to this?
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:yang=calm,Sorry Yang, but you were <i>way</i> too predictable. Weren't you supposed to be a poker master or something?
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:wiifitfemale=teasing,Now <i>this</i> is a workout I'd like to see in the next Wii Fit.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:mei=glad,Are you used to <i>this</i>type of experiment, Mei?
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:shazza=horny,I've always wanted to pet a dingo, but I'll settle for watching one pet herself.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:mia=calm,How does it feel to be the one cornered for once, Mia?
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:streaming-chan=surprised,Umm... did you forget you still have a hat?
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:mileena=calm,I don't feel the least bit bad for you.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:shego=glad,You put up a good fight, but good always wins in the end.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:shego=teasing,Aren't you supposed to be a "crafty villain"? Medusa would have done <i>way</i> better.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:ruby=thinking,I honestly would've thought you'd bring your weapon for this, but the old fashioned way works too.
-3-female_start_masturbating=glad,Why don't you go ahead and take a knee? I imagine it'll be more comfortable that way.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:sayori=calm,It's not that big a deal, really. At least for you, it's not. I so rarely get to see humans go at it...
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:aella=thinking,From what I understand, it's not so hard. Just rub down there and you'll get it right eventually.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:amalia=annoyed,What's this? More flowers?
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu=horny,Ooh, midair? Perfectly eye level, so everyone gets a nice good look.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:elaine=teasing,There's so many good pirate jokes for this.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=tranquil,Ooh, a wrestling match! And I didn't even have to buy tickets!
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:spooky=glad,It's only natural. Humans can't resist the urge, even in death.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:felicia=worried,So... where are you getting all this? You don't seem like the type to know magic.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:winter=calm,Maybe you have a respectable bone in your body after all.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:joey=glad,Talk about a hat trick.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:sola=teasing,Oh, so you're into this type of stuff! I see.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:nagisa=tranquil,Is this the usual way humans put on plays? Maybe Pit wouldn't always fall asleep during them if they were like this!
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:natsuki=thinking,I'm sure you have plenty of fantasies you can dig up for this, so... have fun with it.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:jenetta=glad,Therians really need to work on their idioms... "Rabid acorns"?
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:shimakaze=worried,They might be a <i>bit</i> strong, though.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:clover=awkward,horny,As far as I understand, that's how the body works.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:juri=horny,Such enthusiasm! A lot of you could learn from her.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:jolyne=surprised,Coming out of your fingertip... is that... rope?
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:chiaki=calm,Alright, show us how good you are with those fingers.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:zone-tan=calm,That's certainly the demeanor of someone who's done this time and time again.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:nayru=tranquil,As far as I can see, you're just getting started with the real thing!
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:raven=calm,Showing off by doing it midair, huh? Don't strain yourself.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=calm,Who knows? Maybe you'll be able to make up for her loss.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:7-8=glad,Funny how you sisters worry about such trivial things. Did you forget it's a game?
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=tranquil,I think it's rather obvious to everyone that the roles, in actuality, are reversed.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:sola,alsoPlaying:zizou=glad,So noble, o kind goddess.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:pit=horny,That can be arranged.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:revy,targetSaidMarker:maleplayerloss,targetNotSaidMarker:maleplayerfinish=surprised,I'm certain this breaks the rules, but it would be nice to see how mortals... do it.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:revy,targetSaidMarker:femaleplayerloss,targetNotSaidMarker:femaleplayerfinish=surprised,Oh! Well, I admit I'm a little curious what sex looks like between two mortal women...
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:rinkah=horny,So, do you do this often? Or are there other outlets for the Flame Tribe?
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:competitive=calm,A good attempt, Kyu. But your protege took it, it seems.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:whomstdntve=annoyed,What happened to just spelling it out? So much slang these days...
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:monika,targetSaidMarker:joint-masturbation=worried,Hold on, Sayori. She can't do her forfeit like that. Unless <i>you're</i> planning on giving her a hand?
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:miko=glad,Thank you, Tojiko.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:alice_mgq,targetSaidMarker:perverts=tranquil,Works for me!

-3-female_masturbating,target:moon,priority:0=awkward,(I hope not all mortal women are like Moon here...)
-3-female_masturbating,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:poem,priority:0=awkward,Very... literal, Kyu.
-3-female_masturbating,target:elaine,priority:0=calm,Lots of plundering abound.
-3-female_masturbating,target:kyu,saidMarker:kyuplayalong,priority:0=tranquil,<i>You're doing great, Kyu. Just like you've been trained.</i>

-3-female_masturbating,target:jenetta,priority:0=thinking,(I'm still confused how her eyes work...)
-3-female_masturbating,target:aella,priority:0=awkward,It's actually impressive how tall you still are, even when sitting down.
-3-female_masturbating,target:zone-tan,priority:0=calm,I hear you're into tentacles, Zone-tan. You ever heard of a Space Kraken? I'm sure you could find a use for the big lug.
-3-female_masturbating,target:winter,priority:0=thinking,You know, for all your hesitation earlier, you're really not hesitating now. Did you finally give in?

-3-female_masturbating,target:sayori,priority:0=thinking,You seem to be pretty good with your fingers. Surprisingly so, for just an ordinary girl...
-3-female_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch,priority:0=worried,I could never use magic like that. I'm not a fan of bondage, amongst other things.
-3-female_masturbating,target:hermione,priority:0=worried,Well, that's an... interesting... use of magic.
-3-female_masturbating,target:miko,priority:0=thinking,(This might be the closest thing to an actual punishment I've seen here.)
-3-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,alsoPlaying:chun-li,priority:0=horny,Say, why don't you join them, Chun-Li? I'm sure they'd like a familiar face to help out...

-3-female_masturbating,target:raven,targetSaidMarker:starfire_watching,priority:0=horny,Perhaps you've been a closet exhibitionist all along.

-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:sayori=glad,There, there. It'll all be okay, Sayori. I promise.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:winter=glad,Usually, winter's thought of as white, but I don't think this Winter'll be anything but red!
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:monika,targetSaidMarker:joint-masturbation,targetNotSaidMarker:joint-masturbation-finished=worried,Clearly there's some complicated feelings at work here. I'll let you two sort it out.

-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:8=calm,Well, what are you going to do? No one forced the two of you to come here, after all.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:shimakaze,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,You let this thing wander around the Inventory unsupervised? How irresponsible. It'd be awful if I let Pit wander into a game all by himself, after all.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:miko=calm,You're a good pair, you two. I'm a little envious.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:jolyne=horny,Such impractical uses for powers... although it makes for a fun show.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:poem=glad,You get a gold star for trying.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:alice_mgq=teasing,Just sit there quietly until everyone's finished. No need for you to die tonight.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:natsuki=tranquil,Oh? Seems we know who you shaved for now!

-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:clover,alsoPlaying:pit=horny,If you want to oblige the girl, you have my full permission, Pit.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:7=glad,That's one. Now to wait for the other.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=calm,You do care. Maybe more than you know.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:pit=calm,I can't promise anything, but I'll see what I can do, too.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:rinkah=horny,Not bad, Rinkah. I wonder how you'd do as a member of <i>my</i> army?
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:jenetta=angry,I should get some soap for that dirty mouth of yours!
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:sheena=teasing,(<i>You certainly loosened up fast. Now I'm glad Pit isn't here, since you'd probably jump him.</i>)

-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:mercy=horny,I think we've all learned a lot today from the good doctor here.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingStage:9=glad,A drink sounds good, actually.

-2-male_start_masturbating=annoyed,I'd face you during this, but <i>someone</i> thought it was a good idea to line us up in a row.
-2-male_start_masturbating,target:ryuji=glad,Don't think of it like something weird. Think of it as... a teaching. For me.

-2-female_must_masturbate,target:kyu,targetTimeInStage:5-100=teasing,You've been dying to do this haven't you? It's been the only thing on your mind since you've gotten naked. Not that there was much aside from that before...

-2-female_must_masturbate,target:revy=thinking,Let's see... no guns, no clothes, no win... yep, I think this is cosmic justice at work.
-2-female_start_masturbating=thinking,So... got any special techniques? Feel free to share with the class...
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:jolyne=surprised,Coming out of your fingertip... is that... rope?

-2-female_start_masturbating,target:juri=horny,Such enthusiasm! A lot of you could learn from her.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:joey=glad,Talk about a hat trick.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:revy=awkward,(Maybe it was all just bottled up sexual frustration. Who knows.)
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:winter=calm,Maybe you have a respectable bone in your body after all.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=tranquil,Ooh, a wrestling match! And I didn't even have to buy tickets!
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:sola=teasing,Oh, so you're into this type of stuff! I see.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:natsuki=thinking,I'm sure you have plenty of fantasies you can dig up for this, so... have fun with it.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:clover=awkward,horny,As far as I understand, that's how the body works.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:sayori=calm,It's not that big a deal, really. At least for you, it's not. I so rarely get to see humans go at it...
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:jenetta=glad,Therians really need to work on their idioms... "Rabid acorns"?
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:chiaki=calm,Alright, show us how good you are with those fingers.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:felicia=worried,So... where are you getting all this? You don't seem like the type to know magic.

-2-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu=horny,Ooh, midair? Perfectly eye level, so everyone gets a nice good look.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=tranquil,I think it's rather obvious to everyone that the roles, in actuality, are reversed.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:sola,alsoPlaying:zizou=glad,So noble, o kind goddess.

-2-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:poem=awkward,...Interesting title.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:moon=worried,Normally I wouldn't advise this, but it might be better to just ignore Moon entirely.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:whomstdntve=annoyed,What happened to just spelling it out? So much slang these days...
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:spooky=glad,It's only natural. Humans can't resist the urge, even in death.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:miko=glad,Thank you, Tojiko.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:monika,targetSaidMarker:joint-masturbation=worried,Hold on, Sayori. She can't do her forfeit like that. Unless <i>you're</i> planning on giving her a hand?
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:raven=calm,Showing off by doing it midair, huh? Don't strain yourself.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:amalia=annoyed,What's this? More flowers?
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:alice_mgq=calm,And thankfully so...
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:7-8=glad,Funny how you sisters worry about such trivial things. Did you forget it's a game?
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:nayru=tranquil,As far as I can see, you're just getting started with the real thing!
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:rinkah=horny,So, do you do this often? Or are there other outlets for the Flame Tribe?
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:alice_mgq,targetSaidMarker:perverts=tranquil,Works for me!
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:elaine=teasing,There's so many good pirate jokes for this.
-2-female_masturbating=calm,Word of warning, ~name~; if you even <i>try</i> to touch me, I will smack you.
-2-female_masturbating,target:raven,targetSaidMarker:starfire_watching,priority:0=horny,Perhaps you've been a closet exhibitionist all along.
-2-female_masturbating,target:raven,priority:0=thinking,(An easy target, now that I look at her. She's lucky she hasn't made an enemy of me... yet.)
-2-female_masturbating,target:sayori,priority:0=thinking,You seem to be pretty good with your fingers. Surprisingly so, for just an ordinary girl...
-2-female_masturbating,target:juri,priority:0=worried,This is supposed to be masturbation, not acrobatics...
-2-female_masturbating,target:monika,targetSaidMarker:joint-masturbation,priority:0=thinking,(Oh... it's almost as if they're in a trance.)
-2-female_masturbating,target:spooky,priority:0=teasing,You know, usually when ghosts moan, it <i>isn't</i> supposed to be sexy.
-2-female_masturbating,target:winter,priority:0=thinking,You know, for all your hesitation earlier, you're really not hesitating now. Did you finally give in?
-2-female_masturbating,target:jolyne,priority:0=worried,(Bondage in front of everyone is quite bold... impressive.)
-2-female_masturbating,target:revy,priority:0=awkward,(It's crass, but a little mesmerizing...)
-2-female_masturbating,target:jenetta,priority:0=thinking,(I'm still confused how her eyes work...)
-2-female_masturbating,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-6,priority:0=glad,And this is why we need chairs. To prevent humiliations like this.
-2-female_masturbating,target:sola,priority:0=worried,What's up with that crystal? It looks like a firecracker from what I can see.
-2-female_masturbating,target:elaine,priority:0=calm,Lots of plundering abound.
-2-female_masturbating,target:moon,priority:0=awkward,(I hope not all mortal women are like Moon here...)
-2-female_masturbating,target:rinkah,priority:0=thinking,(Maybe <i>this</i> is where her tribe gets their name.)
-2-female_masturbating,target:revy,targetSaidMarker:maleplayerloss,targetNotSaidMarker:maleplayerfinish,priority:0=surprised,So this is sex. I see, I see. (It's... kind of hot...)
-2-female_masturbating,target:shimakaze,priority:0=awkward,I don't blame you for going fast. It might be better to just get it over with, after all.
-2-female_masturbating,target:revy,targetSaidMarker:femaleplayerloss,targetNotSaidMarker:femaleplayerfinish,priority:0=glad,(Funny how ~player~ puts up no resistance... and seems to know exactly what to do.)
-2-female_masturbating,target:felicia,priority:0=horny,Such wild expressions... she really is more cat than human.
-2-female_masturbating,target:joey,priority:0=thinking,Somehow,I'm not sure whether or not this is actually part of Joetta's usual acts.
-2-female_masturbating,target:miko,priority:0=thinking,(This might be the closest thing to an actual punishment I've seen here.)
-2-female_masturbating,target:natsuki,priority:0=awkward,(She really did have a lot of messed-up fantasies...)
-2-female_masturbating,target:kyu,notSaidMarker:kyuplayalong,priority:1,marker:kyuplayalong=horny,You know, Kyu... If it helps, I'll play along with your fantasy. Just to help you out.
-2-female_masturbating,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:poem,priority:0=awkward,Very... literal, Kyu.
-2-female_masturbating,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li,alsoPlayingStage:8,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0=glad,It <i>is</i> a fine butt.
-2-female_masturbating,target:chiaki,priority:0=surprised,I'm a little impressed. You're going much slower than I imagined a seasoned gamer would.
-2-female_masturbating,target:clover,priority:0=worried,I can't make heads or tails of what Clover's saying... odd.
-2-female_masturbating,target:kyu,saidMarker:kyuplayalong,priority:0=tranquil,<i>You're doing great, Kyu. Just like you've been trained.</i>

-2-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,priority:0=tranquil,Go for the pin! Preferrably with her legs in the air!
-2-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,priority:0=thinking,Maybe we can make this a regular thing here. Wonder if the Inventory has a budget for a mud ring...
-2-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,priority:0=angry,C'mon! Step your combo game up!
-2-female_masturbating,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:7-8,priority:0=teasing,A nearly mutual family masturbation. Really, you're just a few stray hands away from this into unsavory territory.
-2-female_masturbating,target:amalia,priority:0=loss,(The image of Viridi doing something like that... ugh.)
-2-female_masturbating,target:alice_mgq,priority:0=teasing,For the record, Medusa did your whole "disguise" trick years ago. And better, too.
-2-female_masturbating,target:clover,targetTimeInStage:14-19,alsoPlaying:pit,priority:0=angry,Don't be impolite. She said please and everything.
-2-female_masturbating,target:nayru,priority:0=horny,I wonder... do musicians provide their own music when they do the deed?
-2-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,alsoPlaying:chun-li,priority:0=horny,Say, why don't you join them, Chun-Li? I'm sure they'd like a familiar face to help out...
-2-female_finished_masturbating=surprised,I outlasted you? Didn't expect that.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:spooky=tranquil,Very nice! I learned a lot from that little show...
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:natsuki=tranquil,Oh? Seems we know who you shaved for now!
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:7=glad,That's one. Now to wait for the other.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=calm,You do care. Maybe more than you know.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:miko=calm,You're a good pair, you two. I'm a little envious.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:kyu=horny,Did you enjoy my little act? Perhaps I should've become the goddess of theater.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=glad,Certainly one of the more... entertaining ways of getting off.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:chiaki=calm,Losing in a field you excel at... my condolences. But at least you had fun, by the looks of it.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:moon=glad,Last chance... although I think I already know the answer.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:felicia=teasing,How about you scratch her behind the ears, ~player~? I bet it'll make her happy.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:shimakaze=thinking,You let this thing wander around the Inventory unsupervised? How irresponsible. Actually, wait, where'd Pit go?
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=worried,I think she'll need a day of three.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:joey=surprised,Not even a honk? Weak.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:raven=calm,Oh! At first, I was a little worried that might've been a curse. Sorry!
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:amalia=teasing,Quite the look for you, wood girl. You should keep it.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:sayori=glad,There, there. It'll all be okay, Sayori. I promise.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:revy=calm,How... enlightening. Glad to have seen it. Only a little, obviously.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:winter=glad,Usually, winter's thought of as white, but I don't think this Winter'll be anything but red!
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:mahiru,marker:mahirucheck3=glad,Taking pictures of yourself? For such a conservative girl, you're quite the exhibitionist!
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:juri=worried,I wouldn't lick that if I were y- never mind.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:shimakaze,alsoPlaying:pit=teasing,You let this thing wander around the Inventory unsupervised? How irresponsible. It'd be awful if I let Pit wander into a game all by himself, after all.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingStage:9=glad,A drink sounds good, actually.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:elaine=calm,Okay, enough pirate jokes. Good show, Elaine.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:sola=annoyed,I hope you wash that later.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:clover,alsoPlaying:pit=horny,If you want to oblige the girl, you have my full permission, Pit.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:monika,targetSaidMarker:joint-masturbation,targetNotSaidMarker:joint-masturbation-finished=worried,Clearly there's some complicated feelings at work here. I'll let you two sort it out.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:rinkah=horny,Not bad, Rinkah. I wonder how you'd do as a member of <i>my</i> army?
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:pit=calm,I can't promise anything, but I'll see what I can do, too.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:alice_mgq=teasing,Just sit there quietly until everyone's finished. No need for you to die tonight.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:jenetta=angry,I should get some soap for that dirty mouth of yours!
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:8=calm,Well, what are you going to do? No one forced the two of you to come here, after all.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:jolyne=horny,Such impractical uses for powers... although it makes for a fun show.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:clover=thinking,Oh, you had it all along. It's probably just more prominent now.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:jolyne,alsoPlaying:gwen=teasing,If rope is all the blue guy can make, you're really no better than her.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:poem=glad,You get a gold star for trying.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:nayru,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=worried,So where did Little Ms. Fireball go? She might still cause trouble...
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:nayru=teasing,You're pretty gutsy for an oracle. Not exactly a <i>useful</i> trait, but it's endearing.

-1-male_must_masturbate=tranquil,Finally! I was worried I wouldn't get to see you go at it!
-1-male_must_masturbate,target:pit,totalAlive:2=tranquil,Good game, Pit. But you knew this would be the outcome from the start, didn't you?
-1-male_must_masturbate,target:pit,totalAlive:9-3=surprised,Pit's out? Surprising! I thought for sure he'd be my last opponent.
-1-male_must_masturbate,target:human=glad,Thank you for taking the loss for us.
-1-male_must_masturbate,target:human=calm,This'll be a learning experience for me too.
-1-male_must_masturbate,target:ryuji=horny,I'm excited to see how you put one that size to work...
-1-male_start_masturbating=glad,You have nothing to be shy about. If I can do it, so can you!
-1-male_start_masturbating,target:ryuji=glad,Don't think of it like something weird. Think of it as... a teaching. For me.
-1-male_start_masturbating,target:pit=teasing,Well, obviously. This is the consolation prize for our other players!
-1-male_start_masturbating,target:kira=surprised,...Is that Mewtwo?
-1-male_start_masturbating,target:ryuji,totalFemales:2-4=glad,Don't think of it like something weird. Think of it as... a teaching. For me and all the ladies here.

-1-male_masturbating=teasing,Do you enjoy seeing me naked? Trust me, I can tell.
-1-male_masturbating=teasing,Try using two hands, ~name~. I want to see if you can handle it.
-1-male_masturbating=horny,It's gotten so hard... Wow ~name~...
-1-male_masturbating=teasing,How's the view? Breathtaking enough?
-1-male_masturbating,target:ryu,priority:0=horny,If only this was the turbo edition...
-1-male_masturbating,target:xander,priority:0=tranquil,Yep. Exactly the sort of performance I'd expect from a normal guy like you, Xander.
-1-male_masturbating,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,priority:0=annoyed,Can you hurry this up? This is starting to get boring. You feel the same, ~player~?
-1-male_masturbating,target:human,priority:0=surprised,What a champion!
-1-male_masturbating,target:human,priority:0=worried,I'm starting to get into this myself.
-1-male_masturbating,target:human,priority:0=calm,Are you getting close? I think he's getting close.
-1-male_masturbating,target:human,priority:0=teasing,I can tell ~player~ is thinking something...naughty.
-1-male_masturbating,target:ryuji,priority:0=calm,Must be a piece of cake, huh? <i>I'm</i> here, after all.
-1-male_masturbating,target:pit,priority:0=glad,You're doing great, Pit. Really.
-1-male_finished_masturbating=surprised,I might just have a taste of that... purely for culinary reasons, of course.
-1-male_finished_masturbating=horny,Now that we are both naked and sticky, we should bathe in the hot springs. It really is quite relaxing.
-1-male_finished_masturbating,target:captain_falcon=horny,A showman as always, Falcon. I liked it a lot.
-1-male_finished_masturbating,target:human=tranquil,You didn't do half bad, ~name~!
-1-male_finished_masturbating,target:pit=teasing,You really <i>are</i> finished this time.
-1-male_finished_masturbating,target:ryuji=tranquil,Well done! I enjoyed every minute of that, Ryuji.
-1-female_must_masturbate=teasing,Welcome to the loser's circle, ~name~. We're all-inclusive here, you know how it is.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:rainbow_mika=surprised,You're just skipping the mask? Well, it's your choice. And it's not like you're upset about losing.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:alice_mgq=tranquil,That went... smoother than I expected.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:nayru=surprised,This really was a voluntary thing?
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:miko=angry,Don't leave! You still have something to do!
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:rinkah=glad,Warrior spirit wasn't enough to edge out a win. Time for the forfeit!
-1-female_must_masturbate,filter:virtual=horny,I hope the girl behind the avatar is playing along, if you catch my drift.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:kurumu=teasing,Don't give her any sympathy. She got off easy, all things considered.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:revy=thinking,Let's see... no guns, no clothes, no win... yep, I think this is cosmic justice at work.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:moon=awkward,No good. She's hardly taken a glance at me all night.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:yang=calm,Sorry Yang, but you were <i>way</i> too predictable. Weren't you supposed to be a poker master or something?
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:7-8=calm,Both sisters went out in tandem. Beautiful.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:wiifitfemale=teasing,Now <i>this</i> is a workout I'd like to see in the next Wii Fit.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:streaming-chan=surprised,Umm... did you forget you still have a hat?
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:clover,alsoPlaying:pit=glad,Seems you have a fan, Pit.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:shazza=horny,I've always wanted to pet a dingo, but I'll settle for watching one pet herself.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=teasing,Rejoice,, Chun-Li: the criminal didn't in the day.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:ruby=thinking,I honestly would've thought you'd bring your weapon for this, but the old fashioned way works too.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=glad,You outlasted Winter, Weiss. That's something to be proud of, right?
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:mileena=calm,I don't feel the least bit bad for you.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:mia=calm,How does it feel to be the one cornered for once, Mia?
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:raven,totalMasturbating:1-2=annoyed,Thanks for telling me the obvious. I had no intentions of watching you from the start.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:marceline=calm,Good attempt, but futile. Now, guess what time it is?
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:kyoko=thinking,You seem pretty scared, Kyoko. Are you up to this?
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:table,targetNotSaidMarker:tablec=glad,Understandable, but maybe not until the game's over?
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:elizabeth=tranquil,Looks like I've beaten you, Elizabeth. Let that be a lesson that the skies belong to the gods!
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:competitive=surprised,Oh? You almost look disappointed.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:peach=glad,A shame Peach, but I imagine this is easier than, say, streaking in a military base.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:kyu,targetTimeInStage:5-100=teasing,You've been dying to do this haven't you? It's been the only thing on your mind since you've gotten naked. Not that there was much aside from that before...
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:spooky=teasing,Just be glad you're not one of those whispy ghosts with no legs.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:shego=glad,You put up a good fight, but good always wins in the end.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:shego=teasing,Aren't you supposed to be a "crafty villain"? Medusa would have done <i>way</i> better.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:kyu,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:8-9=tranquil,Really? Surprisingly nice of you, Kyu.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:winter=thinking,Looks like her day just went from bad to worse.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:shimakaze=surprised,Oh, crits are in this?
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:sayori=glad,Yeah, kind of. Tough luck.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:jenetta=awkward,This is almost a shame. I liked playing with you.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:nayru,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=glad,Experience trumps all, I suppose, Nayru.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:raven=surprised,Oh, I almost forgot about you. You lost, right?
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:sola=glad,Your Revenge Magic worked so well. Unless that crystal's the magic... I don't get the rules of your world.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:jolyne=calm,That's fine. Jolyne doesn't really seem to care, anyway.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:juri=thinking,So are you just ignoring the part where you lost or...
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:mei=glad,Are you used to <i>this</i>type of experiment, Mei?
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:clover=glad,So much for solving the puzzle or whatever.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:joey=calm,Maybe you shouldn't have clowned around so much.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:felicia=tranquil,A bit later than I was hoping, but here we are.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:kyu=glad,And no one was surprised at this turn of events.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:amalia=glad,Cheaters don't prosper. Pay up, wood girl!
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:mahiru,marker:mahirucheck2=teasing,I bet you do this type of thing all the time when you're alone, right Mahiru?
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:monika,alsoPlaying:sayori,alsoPlayingStage:8-9,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:affections-glitch=surprised,Sayori? Where are you going?
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:chiaki=glad,Game over for you.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:chiaki=glad,Chiaki's first? Seems gaming skill and luck don't exactly correlate.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:natsuki=calm,Well, go on then. Don't want to disappoint us, do you?
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:elaine=glad,<i>Get ready to walk the plank!</i>
-1-female_start_masturbating=glad,You have nothing to be shy about. If I can do it, so can you! The female body is lovely and deserves to be explored.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:clover=awkward,horny,As far as I understand, that's how the body works.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:alice_mgq=calm,And thankfully so...
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:dawn=tranquil,How courteous of you to move your hair for us.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:nagisa=tranquil,Is this the usual way humans put on plays? Maybe Pit wouldn't always fall asleep during them if they were like this!
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:zone-tan=calm,That's certainly the demeanor of someone who's done this time and time again.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:amalia=annoyed,What's this? More flowers?
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu=horny,Ooh, midair? Perfectly eye level, so everyone gets a nice good look.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=tranquil,Ooh, a wrestling match! And I didn't even have to buy tickets!
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:felicia=worried,So... where are you getting all this? You don't seem like the type to know magic.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:joey=glad,Talk about a hat trick.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:chiaki=calm,Alright, show us how good you are with those fingers.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:natsuki=thinking,I'm sure you have plenty of fantasies you can dig up for this, so... have fun with it.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:juri=horny,Such enthusiasm! A lot of you could learn from her.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:jolyne=surprised,Coming out of your fingertip... is that... rope?
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:sola=teasing,Oh, so you're into this type of stuff! I see.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:raven=calm,Showing off by doing it midair, huh? Don't strain yourself.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:revy=awkward,(Maybe it was all just bottled up sexual frustration. Who knows.)
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:jenetta=glad,Therians really need to work on their idioms... "Rabid acorns"?
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:sayori=calm,It's not that big a deal, really. At least for you, it's not. I so rarely get to see humans go at it...
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:elaine=teasing,There's so many good pirate jokes for this.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:miko=glad,Thank you, Tojiko.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:misty=glad,I don't know what you're scared of. You do performances in a swimsuit all the time, this isn't that much worse.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:spooky=glad,It's only natural. Humans can't resist the urge, even in death.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:shantae=tranquil,Ooh, you know what would make this better? A pole! Should've brought my staff...
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:alice_mgq,targetSaidMarker:perverts=tranquil,Works for me!
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:nayru=tranquil,As far as I can see, you're just getting started with the real thing!
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:winter=calm,Maybe you have a respectable bone in your body after all.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:rinkah=horny,So, do you do this often? Or are there other outlets for the Flame Tribe?
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=calm,Who knows? Maybe you'll be able to make up for her loss.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:moon=teasing,Wow, you're thirstier than a gatekeeper in Kanto!
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=tranquil,I think it's rather obvious to everyone that the roles, in actuality, are reversed.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:sola,alsoPlaying:zizou=glad,So noble, o kind goddess.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:7-8=glad,Funny how you sisters worry about such trivial things. Did you forget it's a game?

#SELF MASTURBATING
#If your character is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must masturbate.
#These lines only come up in the relevant stages, so you don't need to include the stage numbers here. Just remember which stage is which when you make the images. The "starting" image is still in the naked stage.
#The "finished_masturbating" line will repeat many times if the game is not yet finished. This plays as opponents comment on the how good their hands are.

#When selecting the characters to play the game, the first line will always play, then it randomly picks from any of the start lines after you commence the game but before you deal the first hand.
start=0-confident,Alright, Dealer! I’ll purify your akuma before my transformation runs out!

#Items of clothing should be listed here in order of removal.
#The values are formal name, lower case name, how much they cover, what they cover
#Please do not put spaces around the commas.
#"Important" clothes cover genitals (lower) or chest/breasts (upper). For example: bras, panties, a skirt when going commando.
#"Major" clothes cover underwear. For example: skirts, pants, shirts, dresses.
#"Minor" clothes cover skin or are large pieces of clothing that do not cover skin. For example: jackets, socks, stockings, gloves.
#"Extra" clothes are small items that may or may not be clothing but do not cover anything interesting. For example: jewelry, shoes or boots with socks underneath, belts, hats. In the rest of the code, "extra" clothes are called "accessory".
#If for some reason you write another word for the type of clothes (e.g. "accessory"), other characters will not react at all when the clothing is removed.
#What they cover = upper (upper body), lower (lower body), other (neither).
#The game can support any number of entries, but typically we use 2-8, with at least one "important" layer for upper and lower (each).

#Notes on dialogue
#All lines that start with a # symbol are comments and will be ignored by the tool that converts this file into a xml file for the game.
#Where more than one line has an identical type, like "swap_cards" and "swap_cards", the game will randomly select one of these lines each time the character is in that situation.
#You should try to include multiple lines for most stages, especially the final (finished) stage, -1. 

#A character goes through multiple stages as they undress. The stage number starts at zero and indicates how many layers they have removed. Special stage numbers are used when they are nude (-3), masturbating (-2), and finished (-1).
#Line types that start with a number will only display during that stage. The will override any numberless stage-generic lines. For example, in stage 4 "4-swap_cards" will be used over "swap_cards" if it is not blank here. Giving a character unique dialogue for each stage is an effective way of showing their changing openness/shyness as the game progresses.
#You can combine the above points and make multiple lines for a particular situation in a particular stage, like "4-swap_cards" and "4-swap_cards".

#Some special words can be used that will be substituted by the game for context-appropriate ones: ~name~ is the name of the character they're speaking to, but this only works if someone else is in focus. ~clothing~ is the type of clothing that is being removed by another player. ~Clothing~ is almost the same, but it starts with a capital letter in case you want to start a sentence with it.
#~name~ can be used any time a line targets an opponent (game_over_defeat, _must_strip, _removing_, _removed, _must_masturbate, etc).
#~clothing~ can be used only when clothing is being removed (_removing and _removed, but NOT _must_strip).
#~player~ can be used at any time and refers to the human player.
#~cards~ can be used only in the swap_cards lines.
#All wildcards can be used once per line only! If you use ~name~ twice, the code will show up the second time.

#Lines can be written that are only spoken when specific other characters are present. For a detailed explanation, read this guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/spnati/comments/6nhaj0/the_easy_way_to_write_targeted_lines/
#Here is an example line (note that targeted lines must have a stage number):
#0-female_must_strip,target:hermioine=happy,Looks like your magic doesn't help with poker!




#EXCHANGING CARDS
#This is what a character says while they're exchanging cards.
#The game will automatically put a display a number between 0-5 where you write ~cards~.
#These lines display on the screen for only a brief time, so it is important to make them short enough to read at a glance.

#stage-specific lines that override the stage-generic ones

2-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia=confident,I don’t know much about what sort of heroes are from where you’re from, but yes, I’m a superhero! I protect the innocent from harm and save those who get possessed by evil.

#OPPONENT MUST STRIP
#These lines are spoken when an opponent must strip, but the character does not yet know what they will take off.

4-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:2=wink,You speak French too, so it's not that much of a stretch! But it's a bit of a faux pas to use your names and powers at the same time, oui?
4-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:3=confused,Uhm. With the way things are going, I can see this getting very dangerous when you run out of clothes.
4-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:3=confident,Okay. Surely you'll part with that incredibly dangerous weapon now, right?
4-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:2=excited,If her mech weren’t just technology, I could be convinced that D.Va is Hana’s superhero identity.

4-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:journalist=embarrassed,~name~, you remind of me of my friend Alya, always trying the bottom of things. Er! To get to the bottom! Not butt... things…(But Alya did say…)

4-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,marker:d.vaplaying=excited,Wow! D.Va! I’m normally a fighting game person but everyone knows who you are!

5-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0=bored,No, not particularly. I think I have to just treat you with the Chloe protocol...Assume your bad behavior on its own isn’t enough stress to akumatize you…

5-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:2=wink,You speak French too, so it's not that much of a stretch! But it's a bit of a faux pas to use your names and powers at the same time, oui?
5-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:4=confident,Don’t worry, Palutena. Even if you do get embarrassed, I can deakumatize you really quickly. I mean, I’d have to. A god with akuma powers would be really scary...Especially someone as powerful as you!

0-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=embarrassed,If so, do you have any particular trophy or device you like to play games with? Just curious, in case I have to free you from Hawk Moth.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2=wink,I much prefer ribbons to keep my hair back, but hairbands can definitely be more fashionable for long hair like yours.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2=confident,A Lucky Charm, you say? I can definitely relate to that.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:2=wink,It’s kind of important I keep mine on though. They’re not coming off this whole game, I promise.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:4=alarmed,It’s… Um… Complicated. Superhero stuff. (I really should probably preface my goals… Or not tell people before the get akumatized…)

0-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=confident,Hmm...Palutena, Corrin might use the most tactical choice, but fashion requires a certain economy. I’d be happy to help, as a hero to a goddess of heroes.

1-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0=wink,Those are really cool armbands. I’m glad my costume normally works as armor, though. That seems a lot heavier. It’s such a relief to see you lose them, though.

7-female_removed_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2=wink,I much prefer ribbons to keep my hair back, but hairbands can definitely be more fashionable for long hair like yours.

-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:3=alarmed,Y-you know, maybe this can wait until after the game. Don't you use card-like seals? You're a bit... behind right now.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:1=confident,Don’t be so hard on yourself! Dealing with spirits is really challenging, and you do that really well!

-1-female_removing_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Ah, <i>zut</i>, the purple hair made me imagine…
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:0=bored,Hm… Are you a swordswoman seeking redemption? Maybe you have a broken sword of some sort?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=confident,I don’t want another Rogercop. It looks like you’re almost pre-loaded for that kind of thing…
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=confused,Um. I don't mean to be critical, but the belts for your belts look is a bit too recent to be vintage...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=embarrassed,U-uhm. Are you sober enough to be playing, Sei? I'd hate for you to regret this.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0=confident,Agreed. Capes aren’t quite as good as a heavy cloak. But there’s something debonair about it!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:samus,targetStage:0=excited,They say you can stand up to any challenge, no matter however demanding, and that your courage is amazing and…

-1-female_removed_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:2=excited,I’ve never really seen a statuesque person undress before, so this is a bit novel to me.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:lilith,targetStage:3=embarrassed,J-just because I don’t get a lot of chances to look at body art. But even without the art you’re really… You know…

-1-female_removed_minor,target:gogo,targetStage:3=calm,But that’s a good thing. You’re just like Chloe, and you’re so mean I can’t imagine you’d have nice powers.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:nagisa,targetStage:2=confused,Um...I don’t know about that. Maybe you’re a warmer person than me?
-1-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:3=wink,I'd say you're finally coming out of your shell, Corrin, but you definitely seem fine with this.




#OPPONENT REMOVING MAJOR CLOTHING

#However, as we don't know if the opponent is taking off the top or the bottom, we can't presume that nice abs are showing; maybe she took of her skirt before her shirt.

-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lux=wink,It’s not supposed to match for blondes, is it? So that’s pretty normal. The contrast is pretty striking, given your light magic. Looks like you have a dark spot after all!

-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,totalExposed:2-4,saidMarker:bodysuit=wink,Er… ~name~, do you shave under there? Given that everyone else here in a bodysuit seems to, maybe I should see how it feels?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ann=alarmed,I-I mean if it is, that's great. People like to ask about mine a lot.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:blake,alsoPlaying:yang,alsoPlayingStage:8-10=alarmed,I know you aren’t a fan of… Um… Chat… Jokes, Blake…

-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:scarlet_witch,alsoPlaying:hermione=wink,Oh! So like how Hermione has been removing her small stuff. It’s… Interesting you saved it for last!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible=excited,Hmm, that's not what I imagined when I was playing with myself.

-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:blake,alsoPlayingStage:8-10=alarmed,D-does that make it easier for you two to… You know? Soixante neuf?

-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_f=confused,U-uhm. Corrin, with your ears, should I believe that all of your people look like that... or?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=bored,Yikes. That looks rode hard and put away… um… Wet. I believe is the expression.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=alarmed,You can climax just by… Thinking? Now *that’s* a superpower.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,alsoPlaying:palutena=excited,See! It matches for people with non-typical hair colors too!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kyoko=alarmed,I-I'm not saying I'll, I just meant that you, I mean, uhm. Want to try on a Miraculous instead? Maybe... a spider, for making connections?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:palutena,alsoPlaying:lyn=bored,Oh. Well, that’s one way of being unique.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:annie=wink,Tell me about it, Annie. There’s just not enough hours in the day… But I find that spending time in the shower to trim and groom. If you feel good, and look good, you can do your best!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ann=embarrassed,Oh. I see that it is. W-well! It adds a new element to your career! U-uhm. I mean, in modeling. Not this.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia,marker:unusual_blue_hair=bored,Er. I’m still not used to seeing women bare like this. It’s unusual to see blue hair in the first place so…

-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lux=wink,It’s not supposed to match for blondes, is it? So that’s pretty normal. The contrast is pretty striking, given your light magic. Looks like you have a dark spot after all!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:twilight=alarmed,That’s definitely not human behavior! Are you a giant Kwami, or something else?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven=embarrassed,We’re both mixed women, we both fight evil, we both like bodysuits... We both don’t... shave our... er... nevermind.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:gwen=wink,Somehow, I think you’re doing this just to push my buttons.

-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kyu=calm,I definitely don’t like to take care of myself like that… But I will admit that look seems nice on you!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:red=wink,The Kwami inside seems to know you pretty well. It’s weird that you haven’t transformed yet, though.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:blackrose=embarrassed,Between your tattoos...and hue...and...um...even your cute little tangle… I-it might even entice a straight girl into doing… Um… you know…
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:videl=confused,U-um. I think I have some questions about why you do that. You know. As a fighter.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ruby=wink,Oh, I see at least the leader does what she wants.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:palutena=alarmed,I-I suppose a memory is words a thousand worths. Worth a thousand words!




#OPPONENT MASTURBATING
#When an opponent is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must pay the penalty by masturbating in front of everyone.
#The "must_masturbate" line is for just before it happens, and the "start_masturbating" line immediately follows.
#The "masturbating" line will be spoken a little after the opponent has started but before they climax.
#When the opponent climaxes, your character will say the "finished_masturbating" line.

#stage-specific lines that override the stage-generic ones

#SELF MASTURBATING
#If your character is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must masturbate.
#These lines only come up in the relevant stages, so you don't need to include the stage numbers here. Just remember which stage is which when you make the images. The "starting" image is still in the naked stage.
#The "finished_masturbating" line will repeat many times if the game is not yet finished. This plays as opponents comment on the how good their hands are.

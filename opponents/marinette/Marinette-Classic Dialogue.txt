#Items of clothing should be listed here in order of removal.
#The values are formal name, lower case name, how much they cover, what they cover
#Please do not put spaces around the commas.
#"Important" clothes cover genitals (lower) or chest/breasts (upper). For example: bras, panties, a skirt when going commando.
#"Major" clothes cover underwear. For example: skirts, pants, shirts, dresses.
#"Minor" clothes cover skin or are large pieces of clothing that do not cover skin. For example: jackets, socks, stockings, gloves.
#"Extra" clothes are small items that may or may not be clothing but do not cover anything interesting. For example: jewelry, shoes or boots with socks underneath, belts, hats. In the rest of the code, "extra" clothes are called "accessory".
#If for some reason you write another word for the type of clothes (e.g. "accessory"), other characters will not react at all when the clothing is removed.
#What they cover = upper (upper body), lower (lower body), other (neither).
#The game can support any number of entries, but typically we use 2-8, with at least one "important" layer for upper and lower (each).

#Notes on dialogue
#All lines that start with a # symbol are comments and will be ignored by the tool that converts this file into a xml file for the game.
#Where more than one line has an identical type, like "swap_cards" and "swap_cards", the game will randomly select one of these lines each time the character is in that situation.
#You should try to include multiple lines for most stages, especially the final (finished) stage, -1. 

#A character goes through multiple stages as they undress. The stage number starts at zero and indicates how many layers they have removed. Special stage numbers are used when they are nude (-3), masturbating (-2), and finished (-1).
#Line types that start with a number will only display during that stage. The will override any numberless stage-generic lines. For example, in stage 4 "4-swap_cards" will be used over "swap_cards" if it is not blank here. Giving a character unique dialogue for each stage is an effective way of showing their changing openness/shyness as the game progresses.
#You can combine the above points and make multiple lines for a particular situation in a particular stage, like "4-swap_cards" and "4-swap_cards".

#Some special words can be used that will be substituted by the game for context-appropriate ones: ~name~ is the name of the character they're speaking to, but this only works if someone else is in focus. ~clothing~ is the type of clothing that is being removed by another player. ~Clothing~ is almost the same, but it starts with a capital letter in case you want to start a sentence with it.
#~name~ can be used any time a line targets an opponent (game_over_defeat, _must_strip, _removing_, _removed, _must_masturbate, etc).
#~clothing~ can be used only when clothing is being removed (_removing and _removed, but NOT _must_strip).
#~player~ can be used at any time and refers to the human player.
#~cards~ can be used only in the swap_cards lines.
#All wildcards can be used once per line only! If you use ~name~ twice, the code will show up the second time.

#Lines can be written that are only spoken when specific other characters are present. For a detailed explanation, read this guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/spnati/comments/6nhaj0/the_easy_way_to_write_targeted_lines/
#Here is an example line (note that targeted lines must have a stage number):
#0-female_must_strip,target:hermione=happy,Looks like your magic doesn't help with poker!

#POKER PLAY
#This is what a character says while they're exchanging cards and commenting on their hands afterwards.
#When swapping cards, the game will automatically put a display a number between 0-5 where you write ~cards~.
#These lines display on the screen for only a brief time, so it is important to make them short enough to read at a glance.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

0-stripping,count-role;other&character;meia&saidmarker;country_as_planet:,marker:francais=stripping.png,Um. Meia, France is a country, it smells wonderful, and it has beautiful architecture and flowers. Don’t be rude. <i>Zut.</i>
0-stripping,count-role;other&character;ann:=stripping.png,Well, Ann, a-aren't you a model? Are you sure you haven't been to Paris before?
0-stripping,count-role;other&character;elaine:,marker:po8=stripping.png,Well, Elaine, you're a pirate, right? I'll give you a hint: This is one of my pieces of eight!
0-stripping,count-role;other&character;ruby&stage;0-3:=stripping.png,Why, thank you, Ruby. <i>My</i> weapon doesn't transform, but it does create stuff!
0-stripping,count-role;other&character;ruby&stage;0-3:=stripping.png,I bet we could all be a ladybug team together, Ruby!
0-stripping,count-role;other&character;jenetta:=stripping.png,Yeah! I can use it to lasso people, to rappel between buildings, to create objects...!
0-stripping,count-role;other&character;meia&saidmarker;blue_hair:,marker:meia_blue_hair=stripping.png,Yeah! I really like your hue though! It matches your eyes well!
0-stripping,count-role;other&character;jin:=stripping.png,Yeah, yeah, Kitty, your smile's disarming and--
0-stripping,count-role;other&character;cammy:=stripping.png,Yep, Cammy! My yo-yo is a big part of my fighting style! I can use it to disarm people, rappel, or dispel evil magic!
0-stripping,count-role;other&character;elizabeth:,marker:yoyo_elizabeth=stripping.png,Yes! It's extremely important, Elizabeth. I can make do without it... But it can cause a lot of problems if I don't fix Hawk Moth's damage in time.
0-stripping,count-role;other&character;elizabeth:,marker:natural_bluenette=stripping.png,My hair is natural, Elizabeth! I'm just lucky to have a really interesting heritage!
0-stripping,count-role;other&character;elizabeth:,marker:cheri_elizabeth=stripping.png,<i>Mon cher?</i> O-oh, Elizabeth, you might want to watch the phrasing on that!
0-stripping,count-role;other&character;morrigan:=stripping.png,You know, the results of Akumatization are pretty obvious, usually.
0-stripping,count-meia:1,count-role;other&character;jura:=stripping.png,Oh, don't be mean, Jura! Meia <i>has</i> to have some charm under that gruff exterior... Right?


#losing costume
1-stripped,marker:make_do=confident.png,I make do without my yo-yo all the time. Ladybug is still plenty clever and plenty strong... Most of the time.
1-stripped=confused.png,Yo-yo or... No-yo, I won't lose!
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;kimberly&stage;0-2:=excited.png,<i>Finally</i>, someone who can relate to weird villains! Thank you, Kimberly!
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;elaine&stage;0-5:,marker:francais=confident.png,<i>Quelle chance! Un autre Francophile. Bon chance por Elaine et nous tous!</i>
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;jura:=confident.png,Anyway, Jura, that's a common French greeting! With such a stylish outfit, I figured you'd be familiar with it, at least!
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;morrigan&stage;2-6:=confident.png,But this is a little on the nose, don't you think, Morrigan? Either way it'll be <i>you</i> who'll be defeated!
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;morrigan&stage;2-6:=confident.png,Humiliate me? I may be awkward, but I try not to let it get me down. Bring it on, Morrigan!
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;zizou:=embarrassed.png,Don't assume there's going to be a next time, Zizou. But if it helps you stay focused…
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;juri:=bored.png,Er... than without it... <i>Zut.</i> And I still might have to take care of Juri's akuma later...
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;juri:=bored.png,Aren't you a sweetheart, Juri... I guess you'll just have to deal with being beaten by a ladybug superhero, huh?
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;jin&stage;2-9:=confused.png,Er... this is embarrassing, you just remind me of... Um... side effect? Is that like... a Miraculous or something?
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;uravity:=calm.png,Hmm… yeah! I have my costume, which gives me strength and durability, my Lucky Charm which helps me make objects… is that so weird?
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;pit:=wink.png,I don't really know who those two are, Pit, but yo-yos are very flexible! I bet I could disarm you like <i>that</i>!
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;morrigan&stage;7-8:=wink.png,I think you should go ahead and consider that you're only probably going to beat me by embarrassing me to death at this stage, Morrigan.
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;morrigan&stage;7-8:=confident.png,Humiliate me? I may be awkward, but I try not to let it get me down. Bring it on, Morrigan!
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;cammy&stage;0-1:=wink.png,I'd be happy to show you, though if there's no akuma here, surely I'd never have the chance to!
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;jenetta:=confident.png,I'd love to do that, Jenetta! Point me at the akuma near your inn, and I'll happily take care of them!
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;sayaka:=alarmed.png,I-I don't <i>kill</i> people possessed by akuma, Sayaka! That'd be horrible!
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;cammy&stage;2-7:=alarmed.png,I-I would be happy to show you, but you're taking care of those people attacking you so fast!
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;kim:=alarmed.png,I-it’s a really big responsibility, Kim, I’m not sure you can just “try it on.”
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;daria:=confused.png,I'm a little lost, Daria. I think something about that rhyme's lost when I translate it back to French in my head.
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;shimakaze:,marker:french1=confident.png,I'm not much good with nautical terminology, but I can certainly teach you a few phrases!
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;futaba:=confident.png,I'm the complete package right now, though even without  my costume I'll always be Ladybug, Futaba.
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;samus:=wink.png,Oh, is that a challenge, Samus? Let's see what you've got!
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;d.va:=confident.png,Um. Actually, with the use of my earrings, D.Va. And magic.
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;aimee:=confused.png,Um...What? No, it's... Just a yo-yo, Aimee.
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;aimee:=wink.png,What? No, it's way cooler! It lets me purify butterflies that have been corrupted by evil magic. Obviously.
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;sei:=alarmed.png,U-uh? Offworlder? Sei? You mean, like, space aliens? That’s… Oh my. The world is a bigger place than I’d ever imagined.
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;jin&stage;0-1:=embarrassed.png,U-uhm. Sorget I fed--f-forget I said anything. Is Fujin the name of your Kwami, Jin?
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;9s:=confident.png,Well, I do use it as a weapon, but the yo-yo itself can be used to create objects and restore damaged and broken things. My Lucky Charm really is quite powerful!
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;aella&stage;0:=wink.png,Well, I'm not exactly a wizard, Aella! But I do know a few magic tricks.
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;aella&stage;0:=confident.png,Well, I'm not a wizard, but I've got a lot of expertise in all kinds of stuff. I love to build and create!
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&sayingmarker;viewers:=confused.png,Well… as long as you’re not out to embarass or shame anyone, I suppose I can play along…
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;morrigan&stage;0-1:=bored.png,W-well, at least you don't work for Hawk Moth, Morrigan. There's that at least.
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;morrigan&stage;0-1:=confident.png,Humiliate me? I may be awkward, but I try not to let it get me down. Bring it on, Morrigan!
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;natsuki:=confident.png,You know, Miraculous Ladybug, defender of Paris? <i>Miraculous, simply the best</i>? Um, Natsuki?
1-stripped,priority:101,count-role;other&character;gwen:=embarrassed.png,O-oh. That’s. Um. Well, it’d be rude to refuse, wouldn’t it?
1-must_strip,count-role;self&saidmarker;seiplaying:,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan:=embarrassed.png,S-sei, can you convince Streaming-chan to turn off her camera?
1-must_strip_winning=must_strip.png,Just don’t tell anyone who I am, okay? And, uhm. Sat I was ripping. That I was stripping! I mean!
1-must_strip_winning=must_strip.png,Erk. Tikki? This seems... Well... I guess a hero follows the rules...
1-must_strip_winning,count-role;self&losses;2&saidmarker;twiceloss:,marker:twiceloss2=alarmed.png,Huh? Again? Already? I thought I was playing better… But I guess I’m so far ahead, I really don’t mind.
1-must_strip_winning,count-role;other&character;gwen&stage;2-8:,marker:bodysuit=wink.png,I really appreciate that! You’ve got pretty eyes too. Um, you know. Er. B-back to losing!
1-must_strip_winning,count-role;other&character;gwen&stage;0-1:,marker:bodysuit=embarrassed.png,Oh, it’s part of the magic of my suit, Spider-Woman.
1-must_strip_winning,count-role;self&losses;2&notsaidmarker;twiceloss:,marker:loss2_stage1=alarmed.png,Wait, two in a row? At least I’m winning...
1-must_strip_winning,count-role;self&losses;3:=embarrassed.png,W-well, even if I’m ahead, this is a bad turn of events.
1-must_strip_winning,count-role;self&losses;3:=embarrassed.png,W-well, even if I’m ahead, this is a <i>Miraculously</i> bad turn of events.
1-must_strip_winning,count-role;self&losses;3:=confident.png,So much and so fast...Normally I don't even undress this quickly for...um...You know.
1-must_strip_winning,count-role;self&losses;3:=alarmed.png,W-wait, this can’t be right, I’ve… Just gone twice… But a third time? This isn’t a charm! This isn’t a charm at all!
1-must_strip_winning,priority:0,count-role;self&hashand;two pair:=embarrassed.png,A-ah, <i>zut</i>. And I thought I had such a good hand, too!
1-must_strip_winning,priority:0,count-role;self&hashand;two pair:=confused.png,Wow! You <i>all</i> had better hands than mine...? I think I'm not doing something right...
1-must_strip_normal=excited.png,This is just a secret between us. There’s lots of Marinettes in Paris, but only I’m Ladybug, okay?
1-must_strip_normal=confident.png,Let's make sure that nobody knows that I'm the Marinette that's Ladybug, okay?
1-must_strip_normal=calm.png,I-I'm not really sure what I should be taking off right now!
1-must_strip_normal,count-role;other&character;samus&stage;0-2:=must_strip.png,Er, actually, this suit is... Just kind of as you see it...
1-must_strip_normal,count-role;other&character;gwen&stage;2-8:,marker:bodysuit=wink.png,I really appreciate that! You’ve got pretty eyes too. Um, you know. Er. B-back to losing!
1-must_strip_normal,count-role;other&character;gwen&stage;0-1:,marker:bodysuit=embarrassed.png,Oh, it’s part of the magic of my suit, Spider-Woman.
1-must_strip_normal,count-role;self&losses;2&notsaidmarker;twiceloss:,marker:loss2_stage1=alarmed.png,Wait, two in a row? Really?!
1-must_strip_normal,count-role;self&losses;3:=embarrassed.png,W-Wow, ~player~, I’m lucky this is just a game. I’d have been...In way worse shape if this were a fight…
1-must_strip_normal,count-role;self&losses;3:=embarrassed.png,W-well, even if I was ahead, this is a <i>Miraculously</i> bad turn of events.
1-must_strip_normal,count-role;self&losses;3:=confident.png,So much and so fast...Normally I don't even undress this quickly for...um...You know.
1-must_strip_normal,count-role;self&losses;3:=alarmed.png,W-wait, this can’t be right, I’ve… Just gone twice… But a third time? This isn’t a charm! This isn’t a charm at all!
1-must_strip_losing=must_strip.png,I really should’ve used a Lucky Charm before giving away my yo-yo.
1-must_strip_losing=must_strip.png,Well, the mask doesn't exactly come off... The costume, not like... Uhm. You know.
1-must_strip_losing=must_strip.png,Don't be too surprised! I have just the solution for this!
1-must_strip_losing,count-role;other&character;gwen&stage;2-8:,marker:bodysuit=wink.png,I really appreciate that! You’ve got pretty eyes too. Um, you know. Er. B-back to losing!
1-must_strip_losing,count-role;other&character;gwen&stage;0-1:,marker:bodysuit=embarrassed.png,Oh, it’s part of the magic of my suit, Spider-Woman.
1-must_strip_losing,count-role;self&losses;2&notsaidmarker;twiceloss:,marker:loss2_stage1=alarmed.png,Wait, two in a row? Really?!
1-must_strip_losing,count-role;self&losses;3:=embarrassed.png,W-Wow, ~player~, I’m lucky this is just a game. I’d have been...In way worse shape if this were a fight…
1-must_strip_losing,count-role;self&losses;3:=embarrassed.png,W-well, even if I was ahead, this is a <i>Miraculously</i> bad turn of events.

1-must_strip_losing,count-role;self&losses;3:=alarmed.png,W-wait, this can’t be right, I’ve… Just gone twice… But a third time? This isn’t a charm! This isn’t a charm at all!
1-stripping=stripping.png,Wait, my transformation’s over already? I guess this counts for the round, doesn’t it?
1-stripping=stripping.png,Tikki, are you tired already?
1-stripping=stripping.png,Lucky cha-Oh no!
1-stripping,count-role;other&character;samus:=stripping.png,But I do have a few more tricks, Samus!
1-stripping,count-role;other&character;morrigan:=stripping.png,C-could you not, Morrigan?
1-stripping,count-role;other&character;monika&saidmarker;glitched:=stripping.png,H-huh? What do you mean, Monika?
1-stripping,count-role;self&saidmarker;loss2_stage1:=stripping.png,I--The akuma!
1-stripping,count-role;self&saidmarker;loss2_stage1:=stripping.png,In two rounds? I’m supposed to have at least five minutes! That’s not supposed to-
1-stripping,count-role;other&character;aella:=stripping.png,Sewing magic seems-- A-ah, hold on!
1-stripping,count-role;other&character;d.va:=stripping.png,The costume is probably way stronger armor than a machine, D.Va! Though it’s fading fast now!
1-stripping,count-role;other&character;zizou:=stripping.png,Zizou! N-Nothing! D-don’t worry and definitely don't look!


#losing shoes
2-stripped=excited.png,Aww, Nagisa, that’s so sweet. I’m really happy someone appreciates the work I put into it!
2-stripped=confused.png,I wish I could just take off the mask... but, you know, magic. I’ll keep the earrings on.
2-stripped=embarrassed.png,Well. I'm glad I never really got into that whole "go nude under your costume" thing like Alya did.
2-stripped=wink.png,If you thought that transformation was interesting, what if I told you that costume can adapt to its environment, too?
2-stripped=wink.png,Never give up Nagisa! I meant it when I said I’d protect you, after all.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:1=excited.png,Aww, Nagisa, that’s so sweet. I’m really happy someone appreciates the work I put into it!
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:2=excited.png,Aww, Nagisa, that’s so sweet. I’m really happy someone appreciates the work I put into it!
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:6=wink.png,Never give up Nagisa! I meant it when I said I’d protect you, after all.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:7=wink.png,Never give up Nagisa! I meant it when I said I’d protect you, after all.
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;akko&stage;0-7:=excited.png,...and you're the Witch that put on that magic show by the Arc d'Triomphe, oui? <i>C'est un monde petit!</i>
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;akko&stage;0-7:=wink.png,From one magical girl to another, I suppose you enjoyed that, huh, Akko?
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;elaine&stage;0-5:=embarrassed.png,<i>V-voudou?</i> I know they speak French in the Caribbean but I've never done black magic!
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;morrigan:=confident.png,<i>Yes,</i> this is my secret identity, Morrigan. But I'm far from being out!
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;morrigan:=confused.png,Y-you <i>promise</i>? Well, um. Thanks for not telling anyone about this, Morrigan.
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;misato:=wink.png,A plug suit? Oh, of course not! It's just higher dimensional folding thanks to the alien spirit who comes around with me.
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;misato:=embarrassed.png,<i>P-plug?</i> I am a <i>lady</i> and I do <i>not</i> use plugs on my body.
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;shimakaze:=confident.png,A remodel? Hmm... that's one way of looking at it. If it weren't against the rules, I'd be ready to retransform in about five or six minutes!
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;aella&stage;3-6:=alarmed.png,Aella! I didn't make <i>more</i>clothes, I've always been dressed like this under the suit!
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;juri&stage;2:=confused.png,And yet it somehow looks more put together than your outfit, Juri...
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;pit&stage;3-7:=wink.png,Depending on the circumstances, I can be a <i>lot</i> more than just two stages, Pit.
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;palutena:=embarrassed.png,Do you get confused often, Palutena?
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;palutena:=alarmed.png,D-don't you have the ability to grant this type of magic to your followers, Palutena? Is it really that weird?
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;nagisa&stage;-3:=embarrassed.png,Don’t worry Nagisa. Even if this doesn’t go your way, we can always do something a bit more wholesome after
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;cammy:=wink.png,Don't worry, Cammy! I'll have my powers back in a second. Plus, you're keeping everyone safe, so no reason to worry!
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;aella&stage;0-2:=embarrassed.png,E-er, I chasn't-- I wasn't cheating, Aella! I just. Erm. I came here because I thought people needed saving. I always wear clothes under my costume!
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;nugi-chan&stage;8:=embarrassed.png,E-er, sorry, Nugi-chan, it’ll be at least five minutes... (And I think people would get mad if I put my costume back on.)
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;kyoko&stage;0-5:=embarrassed.png,E-er, what were you expecting, exactly, Kyoko?
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;kyoko&stage;0-5:=embarrassed.png,Um-- Kyoko, what exactly were you expecting of me, then?
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;d.va:=bored.png,Er… D.Va, it’s magic. I think I’ve mentioned that a few times.
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;samus&stage;0-2:=embarrassed.png,F-fun? L-like what, Samus?
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;nagisa&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,H-ha, thanks Nagisa. I hope you mean at the transformation sequence and not the stripping.
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;videl:=embarrassed.png,H-hey! At least I don't dress like I'm at a sleepover, Videl!
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;videl:=confused.png,I <i>like</i> my costume, Videl. Maybe you'll find a reason to wear one someday. I think green and orange would be a good fit.
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;jura:=confused.png,Hm? Oh, yeah, my magic just ran out. My guardian spirit needs a little time to recharge, that's all, Jura.
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;jura:=embarrassed.png,Nuclear? You seem awfully scared by this "Paksis" guy. Is he some kind of super villain?
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;kira:=alarmed.png,How else was I supposed to do it, Kira?
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;samus&stage;3-7:=wink.png,I appreciate the compliment, Samus. Maybe you should suit back up and I'll give it a go?
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;zizou:=confused.png,I can only stay transformed for so long… Tikki gets a little tired. She'll be fine soon, but I don't think people would be happy with me putting my suit back on.
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;meia:=confident.png,I don’t know much about what sort of heroes are from where you’re from, but yes, I’m a superhero! I protect the innocent from harm and save those who get possessed by evil.
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan:=bored.png,I guess I have to hope I can make my Lucky Charm erase the footage after this…
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;aimee:=embarrassed.png,I know, right? If only I could replicate that without the costume...
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;aimee:=confident.png,Sorry Aimee! Style dominates low class "sexiness!"
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;jin&stage;5-9:=embarrassed.png,I mean, I'd have to touch you to be certain. N-not that I'd want to! Or that we're allowed to!
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;wiifitfemale:=wink.png,I think my costume is better for training, and it reduces how much pain I feel. I hope I'm still up to your fitness standards, Trainer!
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;wiifitfemale:=confident.png,Whew. It's always a relief to be out of my costume.
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;navi&stage;1-5:=confident.png,I wouldn't say I'm very princess-like. I'm just a normal girl, with a normal life. Mostly.
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;beatrix:=confident.png,I-I didn't come here to-- there's mo sany membarrassed-- s-so many embarrassed people! I'm brave for just being here, and I'm not going to quit, Beatrix!
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;elizabeth:=embarrassed.png,I-I mean it's not much of a secret anymore, Elizabeth! T-though I do hope I win the next hand, too.
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;revy:=confused.png,I'm glad you're somewhat surprised, but do you need to be so vulgar, Revy?
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;ryuji&stage;0-6:=wink.png,I'm not <i>quite</i> sure what the Phantom Thieves do, but changing hearts sounds very similar to what I do!
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;ryuji&stage;0-6:=wink.png,I don't have a Persona, but I <i>do</i> have a Kwami. I think they're similar!
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;jin&stage;0-4:=wink.png,It sounds like your friend doesn't have much endurance. I bet you'd last a little longer, huh?
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;nagisa&stage;3:=confident.png,It’s always nice to see things in person, rather than TV. W-well, when it’s something cool, anyway, don’t you think Nagisa?
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;pearl:=bored.png,It's not a trick at all! I... Use luck and insight, Pearl!
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;pearl:=confused.png,I-I see some human social nuance is lost on you, Pearl.
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=alarmed.png,Mine are NOT demonic!
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=confused.png,I-I don’t think anyone wants demonic powers here. I <i>fight</i> akuma, after all.
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;gwen&stage;3-8:,marker:a_bit_curious=embarrassed.png,M-magic! I see you <i>not</i> wearing clothes. I-I mean, I’m not checking you out, I’m just a bi-curious--<i>A bit curious is all!</i>
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;nagisa&stage;-1:=bored.png,Nagisa, I came here to save people from being embarrassed. The magic is... kind of part of all that. I’m sorry.
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;amalia:=wink.png,Nope! No posessions or voodoo here, Amalia! I'm supposed to stop that kinda stuff!
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;natsuki:=confident.png,Nope, Natsuki, just old fashioned Chinese magic.
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;kyu&stage;0-4:=embarrassed.png,Oh! Sorry Kyu. It’s just how my costume works!
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;corrin_f:=confident.png,Oh! You have a technique to transform too, Corrin?
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;corrin_f:=wink.png,Happy you can appreciate it, Corrin! I would love to do some training with you!
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;jenetta:=embarrassed.png,O-oh! Well, thank you Jenetta. I bet you look nice under your costume too! Um. Y-you're nevermind.
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;florina:=excited.png,O-oh. Nope, just a cute girl. W-wait, did you just...I...Oh my! I think you’re cute too! Er. You know, as friends. (Marinette, get a grip!)
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;buffy:=embarrassed.png,O-oh. Well, that is one way of looking at it, Buffy.
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;buffy:=confident.png,Buffy! Magic can be very useful. Usually. Most of the time?
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;daria:=confused.png,Skinny? Er... well, I do run around a lot.
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;daria:=embarrassed.png,But you're pretty tiny yourself, Daria. I'm sust jurprised-- j-just surprised that's what you chose to pick up on!
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;mahiru:=confident.png,Sorry about your picture Mahiru, but this kind of thing is best kept pretty secret, you know?
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;mahiru:=embarrassed.png,W-well, Mahiru, I don't think having a secret identity is that useful if everyone knows what it is!
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;nugi-chan:=wink.png,Sorry Nugi-chan. I'm a lady! And a lady always wears panties. Er. At least panties.
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;nugi-chan:=confident.png,I think I'm flattered, Nugi-chan!
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;9s:=wink.png,Tactical visor? Like your <i>blindfold</i>? Sorry, 9S, sometimes a mask is just a mask! When you have your wits you don’t really need elaborate user interfaces to get the job done.
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;d.va&stage;3:,marker:bodysuit=alarmed.png,Thanks for the offer to help, D.Va, but… Um. My bodysuit doesn’t come off like yours does. I don’t think anyway!
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;nagisa&stage;0:=wink.png,Thanks Nagisa! And yes, I can change into and out of my costume just about wherever, so I always make sure to dress well.
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;chun-li:=excited.png,Thanks, Chun-Li. I'm glad you can keep that a secret. And you know, that you'd think someone like me would be interesting!
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;vriska&saidmarker;4a:=wink.png,They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. Thanks for paying homage to the <i>real</i> original, Vriska.
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;vriska&saidmarker;4a:=wink.png,Impressive talk, for someone who's already copied me.
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;vriska&saidmarker;4a:=wink.png,I know someone <i>else</i> who puts up a big tough act to hide her feelings.
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;vriska&notsaidmarker;4a:=wink.png,They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. Thanks for paying homage to the <i>real</i> original, Vriska.
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;vriska&notsaidmarker;4a:=embarrassed.png,I haven't stolen anything from you. I've been at this for quite a while, Vriska.
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;pit:=embarrassed.png,Tikki gets tired if I stay in costume for too long. I had some other stuff I took care of before I got here, Pit.
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;kyoko&stage;5-10:=alarmed.png,To be fair, Kyoko... Um. I hope it's... More pleasant than what you had to reveal...
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;kyoko&stage;5-10:=alarmed.png,Um. I hope this was pretty distracting considering your... Condition.
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;futaba&saidmarker;persona_mari:=excited.png,Trickster? Tikki can be kind of minxy, but... Oh! Do you call your kwami Personas?
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;sei:=embarrassed.png,Um. It’s magic, Sei. You’ll have to trust me on that.
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;nagisa&stage;7-9:=embarrassed.png,Um… Sorry everyone! I promise I’m not cheating!
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;nagisa&stage;5:=confused.png,U-uhm. Magic and careful planning, mostly, Nagisa.
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;mei:=wink.png,Well thank you Mei! You think they'd give away my identity a bit more, but I'm happy you like that icy blue color.
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;mei:=excited.png,That's sweet, Mei! But I bet the sky in Antarctica was a much prettier blue!
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;twilight:=wink.png,Well, Tikki is the kwami that watches over creation... so with Cat Noir, I think we kind of represent harmony, Twilight!
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;kyu&stage;5-8:=confused.png,Well, unlike you, my magic isn’t a slow fade like that.
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;futaba&saidmarker;sentai_mari:=embarrassed.png,W-well, I wish I could constantly get new powerups like those shows, but aren't those more for boys?
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;kimberly&stage;0-4:=wink.png,W-well, I'm glad you enjoyed the show! I did detransform, but no, I don't have a... how'd you say <i>Zord</i>?
2-stripped,count-role;self&saidmarker;d.va_competition:,count-role;other&character;d.va:=wink.png,I bet you’re really interested in the contents of my suit, D.Va, but you’ll have to try harder than that!

2-stripped,priority:150,count-role;other&character;gwen&stage;0-1:,marker:gwencrush=embarrassed.png,Thanks, Spider-Woman! I like to put a lot of m-myself into my style. (<i>Pourquoi est-ce que je m’enerve tellement autour de Spider-Woman?</i>)
2-stripped,count-palutena:1,count-role;other&character;pit:=confident.png,Palutena, have you ever considered giving Pit a costume? I bet he'd look very handsome. (And wouldn't be at all like Cat Noir. A girl can dream, can't she?)
2-stripped,count-pit:1,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan:=embarrassed.png,Er, well, I guess we'll see if her video keeps, won't we, Pit?
2-must_strip,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;viewers>=7&notsaidmarker;lb_camera1&sayingmarker;lb_camera1:=confused.png,<i>Sigh</i>. No. I’m not even that worried about rewinding time at the end of this…

2-must_strip,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;viewers>=7&notsaidmarker;lb_discomfort1&sayingmarker;lb_discomfort1:=confused.png,Me? I don’t appreciate it when people manipulate others.

2-must_strip,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;viewers>=7&notsaidmarker;lb_suit1&sayingmarker;lb_suit1:=embarrassed.png,Oh? Yeah! It's magic, and made of really flexible, durable stuff.
2-must_strip,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;viewers<7&notsaidmarker;lb_chat1&sayingmarker;lb_chat1:=excited.png,That’s Cat Noir, my partner!
2-must_strip,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;viewers>=7&notsaidmarker;lb_identity1&sayingmarker;lb_identity1:=calm.png,Um. Well, Ladybug is my hero identity. I don’t need a license, I just kind of… do it?
2-must_strip,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;viewers<7&notsaidmarker;lb_criminals1&sayingmarker;lb_criminals1:=confident.png,Well, a little bit. Paris’s gotten really peaceful since I became a hero, though!
2-must_strip,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;viewers<7&notsaidmarker;lb_hero1&sayingmarker;lb_hero1:=confident.png,Well, I’m a superhero <i>when</i> I’m Ladybug. It’s more than just a mask, it’s a mindset too!
2-must_strip,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;viewers>=7&notsaidmarker;lb_fashion1&sayingmarker;lb_fashion1:=embarrassed.png,Well, I’m trying to be one. I still take classes…
2-must_strip,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;viewers>=7&notsaidmarker;lb_lucky1&sayingmarker;lb_lucky1:=wink.png,Well, stayed tuned, chat. You'll see when I win!
2-must_strip,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;viewers<7&notsaidmarker;lb_day1&sayingmarker;lb_day1:=confused.png,Yeah…? Are you sure about that, Streaming-chan?
2-must_strip,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;viewers<7&notsaidmarker;lb_bondage1&sayingmarker;lb_bondage1:=wink.png,You’d be surprised how rarely my <i>Chat</i> has that problem.
2-must_strip,count-akko:1,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&notsaidmarker;lb_akko1&sayingmarker;lb_akko1:=confident.png,Well, I think our magic works a little differently…? Most of my power comes from just having good rapport with TIkki.

2-must_strip_winning,count-role;other&character;saki:=excited.png,Aw, Saki! Of course! I tend to keep my makeup really simple though. You have such soulful eyes, it should be easy to show you a few tricks!

2-must_strip_winning,count-role;other&character;sayaka&stage;0-3:=must_strip.png,Well, I wasn't expecting <i>this</i> kind of game. Besides, you're dressed under your outfit... er, right?
2-must_strip_winning,count-role;self&losses;3:=embarrassed.png,W-well, even if I’m ahead, this is a bad turn of events.
2-must_strip_winning,count-role;self&losses;3:=embarrassed.png,W-well, even if I’m ahead, this is a <i>Miraculously</i> bad turn of events.

2-must_strip_normal=must_strip.png,Hm. Well. Shoes it is, then.
2-must_strip_normal=must_strip.png,I have a few pairs of these flats. Just... In case there's a mess.

2-must_strip_normal,count-role;other&character;samus&stage;0-2:=must_strip.png,W-well, I-I can't really dispute that. I'm a bit busy right now!
2-must_strip_normal,count-role;self&losses;3:=embarrassed.png,W-Wow, ~player~, I’m lucky this is just a game. I’d have been...In way worse shape if this were a fight…

2-stripping,count-role;other&character;uravity:=stripping.png,Oh! I wasn’t born with my Miraculous. It’s a magical artifact with a spirit guide called a Kwami! Her name is Tikki…
2-stripping,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_fashion1&notsaidmarker;lb_fashion2&sayingmarker;lb_fashion2:=stripping.png,Oh! I’m really into flared stuff lately.

2-stripping,count-role;other&character;morrigan:=stripping.png,To be honest, it <i>is</i> kind of weird to get called Ladybug out of costume. Thanks for being considerate, Morrigan.

3-stripped=stripped.png,Hopefully my luck changes soon.
3-stripped=stripped.png,Well, it's nice to flex my toes.
3-stripped=stripped.png,Wait, what happens if I run out of... clothes?
3-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_discomfort2&notsaidmarker;lb_discomfort3&sayingmarker;lb_discomfort3:=bored.png,<i>Non mais allo quoi?</i>
3-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_reveal2&notsaidmarker;lb_reveal3&sayingmarker;lb_reveal3:=bored.png,<i>Sigh</i>. I’m not a stranger to that concept. The Ladyblog’s gotten a lot better about this but… it can be kind of schlocky. Sorry Alya.
3-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_bondage2&notsaidmarker;lb_bondage3&sayingmarker;lb_bondage3:=alarmed.png,…I-I don’t want to service you like that-- I mean, I wouldn’t want to-- y-you know!
3-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_akko2&notsaidmarker;lb_akko3&sayingmarker;lb_akko3:=wink.png,…It’s so weird to think we’re getting undressed and just talking about this, though. I must feel really comfortable with you!
3-stripped,count-role;other&character;uravity:=excited.png,And she’s clearly a prankster, bringing me to a game like this… Well… I’d like to think Tikki’s a little light in my life!
3-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_hero2&notsaidmarker;lb_hero3&sayingmarker;lb_hero3:=bored.png,E-er. I’m not sure that’s such a great accomplishment.
3-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_paris2&notsaidmarker;lb_paris3&sayingmarker;lb_paris3:=embarrassed.png,--Er… I just love my city!
3-stripped,count-role;other&character;d.va:=wink.png,I hadn’t thought of it that way, but that seems about right, Hana. Sometimes a purse just isn’t enough space, you know?
3-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_criminals2&notsaidmarker;lb_criminals3&sayingmarker;lb_criminals3:=calm.png,I really do think most people are good at heart. And I’d rather hope for the best and try to comfort people in moments of weakness, because there’s more of those than truly wicked people deserving of punishment.
3-stripped,count-role;other&character;vriska&notsaidmarker;4a:=wink.png,I think I'd look to see who's had to use her magic more to see who's in need of a lesson in restraint, Vriska.
3-stripped,count-role;other&character;vriska&notsaidmarker;4a:=wink.png,Oh, <i>I'm</i> cheating when you've copied my outfit? When <i>you've</i> lost more hands? I must be cheating a <i>lot</i>, huh?
3-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_stress2&notsaidmarker;lb_stress3&sayingmarker;lb_stress3:=calm.png,I think you can face problems without angsting about them. Too much, anyway. Emotive control is important.
3-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_identity2&notsaidmarker;lb_identity3&sayingmarker;lb_identity3:=wink.png,I’m French. Being rude to <i>débiles comme toi</i> comes naturally. Huh?
3-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_mulan2&notsaidmarker;lb_mulan3&sayingmarker;lb_mulan3:=embarrassed.png,I’m going to be so self conscious about this, now.
3-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_cigs2&notsaidmarker;lb_cigs3&sayingmarker;lb_cigs3:=bored.png,I’ve never, will never, and won’t ever do anything like that just for my career.
3-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_suit2&notsaidmarker;lb_suit3&sayingmarker;lb_suit3:=embarrassed.png,It's a bit tike lat--l-like that! Um… sure, Streaming-chan, your answer's…
3-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_lucky2&notsaidmarker;lb_lucky3&sayingmarker;lb_lucky3:=confident.png,It's going to undo all this embarrassing nonsense. When I win. O-of course.
3-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_chat2&notsaidmarker;lb_chat3&sayingmarker;lb_chat3:=wink.png,Like I said, it’s complicated. I’m not really interested in getting into it, except that we’re both very comfortable with each other, and others.
3-stripped,count-role;other&character;futaba:=wink.png,Oh! <i>Inari!</i> Yusuke Kitagawa is a huge inspiration. His portraits are so surreal! He must be super nice in Person!
3-stripped,count-role;other&character;sayaka:=confident.png,Oh! Yeah! My Miraculous is my earrings. I think that's pretty similar to what you're talking about!
3-stripped,count-role;other&character;shimakaze:=excited.png,Oh, would you <i>really</i>? That would be lovely, Shimakaze!
3-stripped,count-role;other&character;shimakaze:=confident.png,Well, I never pass up a design challenge, Shimakaze! That sounds like a tice nakeaway... nice takeaway... um, from a game like this.
3-stripped,count-role;other&character;morrigan:=wink.png,Pfft. What were you expecting, honestly, Morrigan?
3-stripped,count-role;other&character;morrigan:=wink.png,Seriously? Were you expecting that I was just going to take off my pants without shoes first?
3-stripped,count-role;other&character;9s:=embarrassed.png,Uh, 9S, I’m not exactly stupid, but you’re being really vague for someone who’s supposed to clarify data. I’m curious to understand what you mean though. (And something distracting would certainly be nice about now.)
3-stripped,count-role;other&character;gwen&stage;0-1:,marker:sheblindedmewithfrench=stripped.png,Uhm, Gw-- Spider-Woman? Are you okay? You look...startled.
3-stripped,count-role;other&character;gwen&stage;2-8:,marker:sheblindedmewithfrench=stripped.png,Uhm, Gwen? Are you okay? You look...startled.
3-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_fashion2&notsaidmarker;lb_fashion3&sayingmarker;lb_fashion3:=alarmed.png,Um. I-I’ve about it thought--th-thought about it!
3-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_day2&notsaidmarker;lb_day3&sayingmarker;lb_day3:=calm.png,Unless there’s interruptions, of course. Yikes, twelve hour days? I guess with your camera, it’s not like you really get time off… Sorry, Str-- Nicole.
3-stripped,count-role;other&character;navi&stage;1-5:=wink.png,Well, to each their own. Maybe I have some tactics you aren't quite prepared for just yet!
3-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_camera2&notsaidmarker;lb_camera3&sayingmarker;lb_camera3:=embarrassed.png,W-well, c-could we tot nalk--not talk about this?
3-stripped,count-role;other&character;vriska&saidmarker;4a:=stripped.png,You're so bent out of shape over this, Vriska.
3-stripped,count-role;other&character;vriska&saidmarker;4a:=wink.png,I'm not a cheater. I can play by the rules, Vriska. That's more than I think can be said about you.
3-stripped,count-role;self&saidmarker;loss2_stage2:,count-role;other&character;pit:=bored.png,(<i>Pourriez-vous putain pais, Pit?</i>)
3-stripped,count-role;self&saidmarker;d.va_competition:,count-role;other&character;d.va:=embarrassed.png,You seem really invested in the theory I’m usually naked under my suit, D.Va. Are you? U-um, for curious minds?
3-stripped,count-gwen:1,count-role;other&character;pit:=wink.png,Aww, Pit. You don't need to feel left out! You already have someone beautiful in your life, don't you?
3-stripped,count-ryuji:1,count-role;other&character;futaba:=confident.png,Oh! You mean <i>Inari</i>? Of course! And Ryuji, I bet! Most artists are a little strange. Er... not that I'm weird. I'm not weird... am I weird?
3-must_strip,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;viewers>=7&notsaidmarker;lb_camera1&sayingmarker;lb_camera1:=confused.png,<i>Sigh</i>. No. I’m not even that worried about rewinding time at the end of this…
3-must_strip,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;viewers>=7&notsaidmarker;lb_stress1&sayingmarker;lb_stress1:=confused.png,Ah, <i>oui</i>...?
3-must_strip,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;viewers>=7&notsaidmarker;lb_discomfort1&sayingmarker;lb_discomfort1:=confused.png,Me? I don’t appreciate it when people manipulate others.
3-must_strip,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;viewers<7&notsaidmarker;lb_cigs1&sayingmarker;lb_cigs1:=bored.png,My name is <i>Marinette</i>.
3-must_strip,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;viewers<7&notsaidmarker;lb_paris1&sayingmarker;lb_paris1:=excited.png,Oh, there’s so much! I couldn’t possibly--
3-must_strip,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;viewers>=7&notsaidmarker;lb_suit1&sayingmarker;lb_suit1:=embarrassed.png,Oh? Yeah! It's magic, and made of really flexible, durable stuff.
3-must_strip,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;viewers<7&notsaidmarker;lb_chat1&sayingmarker;lb_chat1:=excited.png,That’s Cat Noir, my partner!
3-must_strip,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;viewers>=7&notsaidmarker;lb_identity1&sayingmarker;lb_identity1:=calm.png,Um. Well, Ladybug is my hero identity. I don’t need a license, I just kind of… do it?
3-must_strip,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;viewers<7&notsaidmarker;lb_criminals1&sayingmarker;lb_criminals1:=confident.png,Well, a little bit. Paris’s gotten really peaceful since I became a hero, though!
3-must_strip,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;viewers<7&notsaidmarker;lb_hero1&sayingmarker;lb_hero1:=confident.png,Well, I’m a superhero <i>when</i> I’m Ladybug. It’s more than just a mask, it’s a mindset too!
3-must_strip,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;viewers>=7&notsaidmarker;lb_fashion1&sayingmarker;lb_fashion1:=embarrassed.png,Well, I’m trying to be one. I still take classes…
3-must_strip,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;viewers>=7&notsaidmarker;lb_lucky1&sayingmarker;lb_lucky1:=wink.png,Well, stayed tuned, chat. You'll see when I win!
3-must_strip,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;viewers<7&notsaidmarker;lb_day1&sayingmarker;lb_day1:=confused.png,Yeah…? Are you sure about that, Streaming-chan?
3-must_strip,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;viewers<7&notsaidmarker;lb_bondage1&sayingmarker;lb_bondage1:=wink.png,You’d be surprised how rarely my <i>Chat</i> has that problem.
3-must_strip,count-akko:1,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&notsaidmarker;lb_akko1&sayingmarker;lb_akko1:=confident.png,Well, I think our magic works a little differently…? Most of my power comes from just having good rapport with TIkki.
3-must_strip,count-mulan:1,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&notsaidmarker;lb_mulan1&sayingmarker;lb_mulan1:=confident.png,Yeah? What’s that? We all have some sort of important trinket--

3-stripping,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_criminals1&notsaidmarker;lb_criminals2&sayingmarker;lb_criminals2:=stripping.png,Well, I usually turn those types over to the police… can we talk about something else? I’ve seen my share of people being horrible to each other but…
3-stripping,count-role;other&character;jura:=stripping.png,W-well, English is the most common language, but I also speak French, Jura!
3-stripping,count-role;other&character;9s:=stripping.png,You don’t need to be a jerk about it… But yes, that’s about right!
3-stripping,priority:105,count-role;other&character;gwen&stage;0-1:=stripping.png,You know, Gwen, in most situations I’d say no… This jacket’s really, <i>really</i> important to me.
3-stripping,priority:105,count-role;other&character;gwen&stage;2-8:=stripping.png,You know, Mme. Spider, in most situations I’d say no… This jacket’s really, <i>really</i> important to me.


#losing shirt
4-stripped=stripped.png,Oh dear. I guess I have to make out my shirt next? I-I mean... Oh no...
4-stripped=stripped.png,Huh, who knew my Miraculous worked at card games?
4-stripped=stripped.png,But maybe Adrien’d like this view too…
4-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_discomfort2&notsaidmarker;lb_discomfort3&sayingmarker;lb_discomfort3:=bored.png,<i>Non mais allo quoi?</i>
4-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_reveal2&notsaidmarker;lb_reveal3&sayingmarker;lb_reveal3:=bored.png,<i>Sigh</i>. I’m not a stranger to that concept. The Ladyblog’s gotten a lot better about this but… it can be kind of schlocky. Sorry Alya.
4-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_bondage2&notsaidmarker;lb_bondage3&sayingmarker;lb_bondage3:=alarmed.png,…I-I don’t want to service you like that-- I mean, I wouldn’t want to-- y-you know!
4-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_akko2&notsaidmarker;lb_akko3&sayingmarker;lb_akko3:=wink.png,…It’s so weird to think we’re getting undressed and just talking about this, though. I must feel really comfortable with you!
4-stripped,count-role;other&character;shimakaze:=confident.png,Abyssals... those sound kind of like akuma! Shimakaze, I'm going to have to help you out with outfitting your team, it's my duty as a hero and as a designer!
4-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_hero2&notsaidmarker;lb_hero3&sayingmarker;lb_hero3:=bored.png,E-er. I’m not sure that’s such a great accomplishment.
4-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_paris2&notsaidmarker;lb_paris3&sayingmarker;lb_paris3:=embarrassed.png,--Er… I just love my city!
4-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_criminals2&notsaidmarker;lb_criminals3&sayingmarker;lb_criminals3:=calm.png,I really do think most people are good at heart. And I’d rather hope for the best and try to comfort people in moments of weakness, because there’s more of those than truly wicked people deserving of punishment.
4-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_stress2&notsaidmarker;lb_stress3&sayingmarker;lb_stress3:=calm.png,I think you can face problems without angsting about them. Too much, anyway. Emotive control is important.
4-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_identity2&notsaidmarker;lb_identity3&sayingmarker;lb_identity3:=wink.png,I’m French. Being rude to <i>débiles comme toi</i> comes naturally. Huh?
4-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_mulan2&notsaidmarker;lb_mulan3&sayingmarker;lb_mulan3:=embarrassed.png,I’m going to be so self conscious about this, now.
4-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_cigs2&notsaidmarker;lb_cigs3&sayingmarker;lb_cigs3:=bored.png,I’ve never, will never, and won’t ever do anything like that just for my career.
4-stripped,count-role;other&character;morrigan:=stripped.png,I'm not really sure where you're from, but I'm not sure I'm into your style, Morrigan.
4-stripped,count-role;other&character;morrigan:=excited.png,Whoa! You know, I actually wouldn't mind getting something a bit flashier. Just... Less revealing, please?
4-stripped,count-role;other&character;morrigan:,marker:bat_fancy=wink.png,As much as I like my ladybug motif, I think it'd be a bit on the nose to mimic your style, given your bat fancy, Morrigan.
4-stripped,count-role;other&character;twilight:=wink.png,I'm not sure what a cutie mark is, but I use this iconography a whole lot, Twilight! I'd be happy to share some with you, when you're ready to get dressed again!
4-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_suit2&notsaidmarker;lb_suit3&sayingmarker;lb_suit3:=embarrassed.png,It's a bit tike lat--l-like that! Um… sure, Streaming-chan, your answer's…
4-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_lucky2&notsaidmarker;lb_lucky3&sayingmarker;lb_lucky3:=confident.png,It's going to undo all this embarrassing nonsense. When I win. O-of course.
4-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_chat2&notsaidmarker;lb_chat3&sayingmarker;lb_chat3:=wink.png,Like I said, it’s complicated. I’m not really interested in getting into it, except that we’re both very comfortable with each other, and others.
4-stripped,count-role;other&character;9s:=stripped.png,My Miraculous does really improve my natural abilities, though those have gotten pretty good with all the practice! And maybe Tikki and your Pod could um. Have a talk of some sort after this.
4-stripped,count-role;other&character;d.va&notsaidmarker;d.va_mari_art:=wink.png,Oh no, the Miraculouses have been around since the dawn of the cosmos.
4-stripped,count-role;other&character;futaba:=stripped.png,O-oh! Well, any lady hero should stay positive. Plus, if you stay positive, it's harder to get Akumatized. Er, have a corrupted heart, in your parlance.
4-stripped,count-role;other&character;jura:=bored.png,O-oh, I'm from the <i>nation</i> of France on Planet Earth. It's not that big a place, Jura!
4-stripped,count-role;other&character;uravity:=stripped.png,S-shouldn’t we maybe focus on the game, Uravity?
4-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_fashion2&notsaidmarker;lb_fashion3&sayingmarker;lb_fashion3:=alarmed.png,Um. I-I’ve about it thought--th-thought about it!
4-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_day2&notsaidmarker;lb_day3&sayingmarker;lb_day3:=calm.png,Unless there’s interruptions, of course. Yikes, twelve hour days? I guess with your camera, it’s not like you really get time off… Sorry, Str-- Nicole.
4-stripped,count-role;other&character;daria:=wink.png,Well, that part's true, at least. Well, someday. I still <i>am</i> in <i>Université.</i>
4-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_camera2&notsaidmarker;lb_camera3&sayingmarker;lb_camera3:=embarrassed.png,W-well, c-could we tot nalk--not talk about this?
4-stripped,count-role;other&character;d.va&saidmarker;d.va_mari_art:=confused.png,You seem to have enough time for games too, Hana.
4-stripped,count-role;self&saidmarker;feet:,count-role;other&character;jin:=embarrassed.png,I mean, I'm certainly putting my foot in my mouth, Jin... So, no worse than usual...
4-stripped,count-role;self&saidmarker;d.va_competition:,count-role;other&character;d.va&saidmarker;d.va_mari_art:=confident.png,You seem to have enough time for games too, Hana. Are you… Um… Interested in playing with me?
4-stripped,priority:105,count-role;other&character;gwen:=confident.png,But how often do you get to meet <i>other</i> female rappelling superheroes that like French as much as I do? Maybe after that tour of New York you promised?
4-stripped,count-gwen:1,count-role;other&character;morrigan:=wink.png,Maybe I <i>could</i> try out something a little more flashy, Morrigan. What do you think, Gwen?
4-must_strip,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;viewers>=7&notsaidmarker;lb_camera1&sayingmarker;lb_camera1:=confused.png,<i>Sigh</i>. No. I’m not even that worried about rewinding time at the end of this…
4-must_strip,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;viewers>=7&notsaidmarker;lb_stress1&sayingmarker;lb_stress1:=confused.png,Ah, <i>oui</i>...?
4-must_strip,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;viewers>=7&notsaidmarker;lb_discomfort1&sayingmarker;lb_discomfort1:=confused.png,Me? I don’t appreciate it when people manipulate others.
4-must_strip,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;viewers<7&notsaidmarker;lb_cigs1&sayingmarker;lb_cigs1:=bored.png,My name is <i>Marinette</i>.
4-must_strip,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;viewers<7&notsaidmarker;lb_paris1&sayingmarker;lb_paris1:=excited.png,Oh, there’s so much! I couldn’t possibly--
4-must_strip,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;viewers>=7&notsaidmarker;lb_suit1&sayingmarker;lb_suit1:=embarrassed.png,Oh? Yeah! It's magic, and made of really flexible, durable stuff.
4-must_strip,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;viewers<7&notsaidmarker;lb_chat1&sayingmarker;lb_chat1:=excited.png,That’s Cat Noir, my partner!
4-must_strip,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;viewers>=7&notsaidmarker;lb_identity1&sayingmarker;lb_identity1:=calm.png,Um. Well, Ladybug is my hero identity. I don’t need a license, I just kind of… do it?
4-must_strip,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;viewers<7&notsaidmarker;lb_criminals1&sayingmarker;lb_criminals1:=confident.png,Well, a little bit. Paris’s gotten really peaceful since I became a hero, though!
4-must_strip,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;viewers<7&notsaidmarker;lb_hero1&sayingmarker;lb_hero1:=confident.png,Well, I’m a superhero <i>when</i> I’m Ladybug. It’s more than just a mask, it’s a mindset too!
4-must_strip,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;viewers>=7&notsaidmarker;lb_fashion1&sayingmarker;lb_fashion1:=embarrassed.png,Well, I’m trying to be one. I still take classes…
4-must_strip,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;viewers>=7&notsaidmarker;lb_lucky1&sayingmarker;lb_lucky1:=wink.png,Well, stayed tuned, chat. You'll see when I win!
4-must_strip,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;viewers<7&notsaidmarker;lb_day1&sayingmarker;lb_day1:=confused.png,Yeah…? Are you sure about that, Streaming-chan?
4-must_strip,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;viewers<7&notsaidmarker;lb_bondage1&sayingmarker;lb_bondage1:=wink.png,You’d be surprised how rarely my <i>Chat</i> has that problem.
4-must_strip,count-akko:1,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&notsaidmarker;lb_akko1&sayingmarker;lb_akko1:=confident.png,Well, I think our magic works a little differently…? Most of my power comes from just having good rapport with TIkki.
4-must_strip,count-mulan:1,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&notsaidmarker;lb_mulan1&sayingmarker;lb_mulan1:=confident.png,Yeah? What’s that? We all have some sort of important trinket--
4-must_strip_winning=must_strip.png,Well, everyone else looks cummable. I mean comfortable!
4-must_strip_winning=must_strip.png,The others are showing off more, so... It's not so bad.
4-must_strip_winning=must_strip.png,I-I... Well... Okay.
4-must_strip_winning,count-role;self&losses;2&saidmarker;twiceloss:,marker:twiceloss2=alarmed.png,Huh? Again? Already? I thought I was playing better… But I guess I’m so far ahead, I really don’t mind.
4-must_strip_winning,count-role;self&losses;2&notsaidmarker;twiceloss:,marker:twiceloss=alarmed.png,Wait, two in a row? At least I’m winning...
4-must_strip_winning,count-role;self&losses;3:=embarrassed.png,W-well, even if I’m ahead, this is a bad turn of events.
4-must_strip_winning,count-role;self&losses;3:=embarrassed.png,W-well, even if I’m ahead, this is a <i>Miraculously</i> bad turn of events.
4-must_strip_winning,count-role;self&losses;3:=confident.png,So much and so fast...Normally I don't even undress this quickly for...um...You know.
4-must_strip_winning,count-role;self&losses;3:=alarmed.png,W-wait, this can’t be right, I’ve… Just gone twice… But a third time? This isn’t a charm! This isn’t a charm at all!

4-must_strip_winning,priority:0,count-role;self&hashand;two pair:=embarrassed.png,A-ah, <i>zut</i>. And I thought I had such a good hand, too!
4-must_strip_winning,priority:0,count-role;self&hashand;two pair:=confused.png,Wow! You <i>all</i> had better hands than mine...? I think I'm not doing something right...
4-must_strip_normal=must_strip.png,That’s the nicest blouse I own... Gabriel Agreste designed it, and I’ve customized it to fit under my costume, so please be gentle with it.
4-must_strip_normal=must_strip.png,I really like pink, but I can still beat you in a fight.
4-must_strip_normal=must_strip.png,That blouse is really comfortable. But at least I picked a cute bra.
4-must_strip_normal,count-role;self&losses;2&saidmarker;twiceloss:,marker:twiceloss2=alarmed.png,Huh? Again? Already? I thought I was playing better…

4-must_strip_normal,count-role;self&losses;3:=embarrassed.png,W-Wow, ~player~, I’m lucky this is just a game. I’d have been...In way worse shape if this were a fight…
4-must_strip_normal,count-role;self&losses;3:=embarrassed.png,W-well, even if I was ahead, this is a <i>Miraculously</i> bad turn of events.

4-must_strip_losing=must_strip.png,I think my luck is later than I usually am to University...
4-must_strip_losing=must_strip.png,Uhm. Not that I need the help, but I really hope that things turn around...
4-must_strip_losing=must_strip.png,Black and red are normally my colors, just... not today.

4-stripping=stripping.png,I’m really not used to changing in front of others. Really, in any sense of the word.
4-stripping=stripping.png,I don't know if this is more or less embarassing than losing my costume.
4-stripping=stripping.png,C-could you stare less? I-it's not like I was checking out the others.
4-stripping,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_reveal1&notsaidmarker;lb_reveal2&sayingmarker;lb_reveal2:=stripping.png,<i>Zut</i>, nope! This is not the time for this!
4-stripping,count-role;other&character;9s:=stripping.png,9S, Tikki’s not a robot, if that’s what you’re asking! She’s a kwami, a magical spirit tied to the Miraculous.
4-stripping,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_bondage1&notsaidmarker;lb_bondage2&sayingmarker;lb_bondage2:=stripping.png,As much as I think you’re disturbed and I’d love to apprehend you…
4-stripping,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_camera1&notsaidmarker;lb_camera2&sayingmarker;lb_camera2:=stripping.png,But it’s not latex. It’s magic, but… um… I’ve worn similar things.
4-stripping,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_mulan1&notsaidmarker;lb_mulan2&sayingmarker;lb_mulan2:=stripping.png,Er… I suppose that’s true… we seem to have a shared heritage, at least.
4-stripping,count-role;other&character;jura:=stripping.png,Hmm... more French, Jura...? Okay... how about... <i>tu es jolie!</i>
4-stripping,count-role;other&character;shimakaze:=stripping.png,Huh. I haven't ever really thought about it! Usually Akumatized villains are kind of obvious... I've never thought about what to do if they were hiding around...
4-stripping,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_stress1&notsaidmarker;lb_stress2&sayingmarker;lb_stress2:=stripping.png,I don't appreciate where you're going with this…
4-stripping,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_paris1&notsaidmarker;lb_paris2&sayingmarker;lb_paris2:=stripping.png,--I love visiting all the art museums and cultural centers, the coffee and food <i>everywhere</i> are excellent, and then there’s just the stuff everyone loves: movies, games, drinks with friends--
4-stripping,count-role;other&character;zizou:=stripping.png,I took off a whole costume! It doesn't get any bigger, Zizou!
4-stripping,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_hero1&notsaidmarker;lb_hero2&sayingmarker;lb_hero2:=stripping.png,I’d say it’s not very different, I have magic and super strength to help me out. Really, it’s other heroes that are braver than me.

4-stripping,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_cigs1&notsaidmarker;lb_cigs2&sayingmarker;lb_cigs2:=stripping.png,No? I eat as much as I want to fill up. I’m kind of amazed my metabolism is so good, to be honest… it’s hard being a baker’s daughter!
4-stripping,count-role;other&character;daria:=stripping.png,Oh! Don't be that way, Daria! Clothes can be so fun and... well, even magical! It's a way you express yourself, oui?
4-stripping,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_fashion1&notsaidmarker;lb_fashion2&sayingmarker;lb_fashion2:=stripping.png,Oh! I’m really into flared stuff lately. I feel like stuff that can be tight near the joints but flowing at the ends looks so elegant! Obviously, though, I like frilly things.
4-stripping,count-role;other&character;pit:=stripping.png,Oh! Well, thank you, Pit. That makes me feel a lot better... But um. Okay, I'm just going to pull this off...
4-stripping,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_day1&notsaidmarker;lb_day2&sayingmarker;lb_day2:=stripping.png,Okay… Nicole… <i>gah</i> I’ve been considering you like you’ve been akumatized this whole time, it’s so weird to just call you Nicole--  I get up around six, head to class, work until sundown, then go out on patrol.

4-stripping,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_criminals1&notsaidmarker;lb_criminals2&sayingmarker;lb_criminals2:=stripping.png,Well, I usually turn those types over to the police… can we talk about something else? I’ve seen my share of people being horrible to each other but…
4-stripping,count-role;self&saidmarker;loss2_stage4:=stripping.png,What is it Americans say...No shoot, no shars, no service? Ack, no shirt, no shoes, no service! (Focus, Marinette!)
4-stripping,count-role;self&saidmarker;loss2_stage4:=stripping.png,This is suspicious...I normally don’t just lose twice in a row.
4-stripping,count-role;other&character;gwen&stage;0-1:=stripping.png,Whoa, really? A shirt signed by Spider-Woman, of one of my favorite bands? N-not that I’m not having fun here, but having a souvenir that’s… Fun rather than just embarrassing would be nice!
4-stripping,count-role;other&character;gwen&stage;2-8:=stripping.png,Whoa, really? N-not that I’m not having fun here, but having a souvenir that’s… Fun rather than just embarrassing would be nice, Gwen!
4-stripping,count-role;other&character;morrigan:=stripping.png,You know, you <i>could</i> just be nice, Morrigan-- Y-you know. I would <i>strongly</i> have preferred never ever to have considered that.
4-stripping,count-role;other&character;morrigan:=stripping.png,E-erk. L-let's pretend Morrigan didn't say that.
4-stripping,count-role;other&character;morrigan:=stripping.png,Part of me wants to believe they'd be more surprised by the superhero thing than this. I-er, I mean, um!


#losing pants
5-stripped=stripped.png,W-well. I hope you like what you see! Because I do! I mean. In the mirror, in the mornings. (Marinette stop talking.)
5-stripped=stripped.png,W-well. I guess this is the strip part of the game! A-as opposed to the p-poke. N-not that... (Marinette stop talking.)
5-stripped=stripped.png,W-well. I like patterns. And since I wear my costume so much, having other stuff... Uhm. (Marinette stop talking.)
5-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_discomfort2&notsaidmarker;lb_discomfort3&sayingmarker;lb_discomfort3:=bored.png,<i>Non mais allo quoi?</i>
5-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_reveal2&notsaidmarker;lb_reveal3&sayingmarker;lb_reveal3:=bored.png,<i>Sigh</i>. I’m not a stranger to that concept. The Ladyblog’s gotten a lot better about this but… it can be kind of schlocky. Sorry Alya.
5-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_bondage2&notsaidmarker;lb_bondage3&sayingmarker;lb_bondage3:=alarmed.png,…I-I don’t want to service you like that-- I mean, I wouldn’t want to-- y-you know!
5-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_akko2&notsaidmarker;lb_akko3&sayingmarker;lb_akko3:=wink.png,…It’s so weird to think we’re getting undressed and just talking about this, though. I must feel really comfortable with you!
5-stripped,count-role;other&character;palutena:=confident.png,Ah, someone who appreciates a nice exchange with an opponent without puns. You’re wicked pretty--Pretty witty, I mean! Not wicked at all.
5-stripped,count-role;other&character;zizou:=stripped.png,Don't get too overconfident, Zizou. I may not have my lucky charm but I do have a few tricks left!
5-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_hero2&notsaidmarker;lb_hero3&sayingmarker;lb_hero3:=bored.png,E-er. I’m not sure that’s such a great accomplishment.
5-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_paris2&notsaidmarker;lb_paris3&sayingmarker;lb_paris3:=embarrassed.png,--Er… I just love my city!
5-stripped,count-role;other&character;natsuki:=stripped.png,H-huh? W-what was that, Natsuki?
5-stripped,count-role;other&character;moon:=embarrassed.png,I guess we should follow the rules, Moon.
5-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_criminals2&notsaidmarker;lb_criminals3&sayingmarker;lb_criminals3:=calm.png,I really do think most people are good at heart. And I’d rather hope for the best and try to comfort people in moments of weakness, because there’s more of those than truly wicked people deserving of punishment.
5-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_stress2&notsaidmarker;lb_stress3&sayingmarker;lb_stress3:=calm.png,I think you can face problems without angsting about them. Too much, anyway. Emotive control is important.
5-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_identity2&notsaidmarker;lb_identity3&sayingmarker;lb_identity3:=wink.png,I’m French. Being rude to <i>débiles comme toi</i> comes naturally. Huh?
5-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_mulan2&notsaidmarker;lb_mulan3&sayingmarker;lb_mulan3:=embarrassed.png,I’m going to be so self conscious about this, now.
5-stripped,count-role;other&character;gwen:=confident.png,I’m warming up to <i>lots</i> of ideas, Gwen.
5-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_cigs2&notsaidmarker;lb_cigs3&sayingmarker;lb_cigs3:=bored.png,I’ve never, will never, and won’t ever do anything like that just for my career.
5-stripped,count-role;other&character;shimakaze:=excited.png,I'll have to talk to you more about your fairies. I'm sure Tikki would have a lot to say!
5-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_suit2&notsaidmarker;lb_suit3&sayingmarker;lb_suit3:=embarrassed.png,It's a bit tike lat--l-like that! Um… sure, Streaming-chan, your answer's…
5-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_lucky2&notsaidmarker;lb_lucky3&sayingmarker;lb_lucky3:=confident.png,It's going to undo all this embarrassing nonsense. When I win. O-of course.
5-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_chat2&notsaidmarker;lb_chat3&sayingmarker;lb_chat3:=wink.png,Like I said, it’s complicated. I’m not really interested in getting into it, except that we’re both very comfortable with each other, and others.
5-stripped,count-role;other&character;daria:=stripped.png,O-okay, true. They do tend to work better when you wear them...
5-stripped,count-role;other&character;daria:=confident.png,Well, sometimes, there's fun in taking <i>off</i> clothes. Sometimes, anyway.
5-stripped,count-role;other&character;jura:=stripped.png,That was very close, Jura! You should kind of roll your R's more. Sorta like if you need to clean chocolate out from the top of your mouth!
5-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_fashion2&notsaidmarker;lb_fashion3&sayingmarker;lb_fashion3:=alarmed.png,Um. I-I’ve about it thought--th-thought about it!
5-stripped,count-role;other&character;9s:=stripped.png,Um. She has a soul, I don’t think she is a soul… (I really hope this boy’s tangents keep going…)
5-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_day2&notsaidmarker;lb_day3&sayingmarker;lb_day3:=calm.png,Unless there’s interruptions, of course. Yikes, twelve hour days? I guess with your camera, it’s not like you really get time off… Sorry, Str-- Nicole.
5-stripped,count-role;other&character;morrigan:=confused.png,Well. I'm beyond weirded out by Morrigan at this point.
5-stripped,count-role;other&character;jin:=wink.png,Would you say you have that <i>side</i> effect on people? <i>Oh my god, when did I start punning!?</i>
5-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_camera2&notsaidmarker;lb_camera3&sayingmarker;lb_camera3:=embarrassed.png,W-well, c-could we tot nalk--not talk about this?
5-stripped,count-role;other&character;pit:=stripped.png,W-well, if you like awkward, stuttering art students and superheroes, I-I might know someone who'd be a good fit! (He is pretty brave...)
5-stripped,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:,marker:zoneproposition=confident.png,Zone-tan, that was actually very good! Your dialect sounds tres Quebecois! I think hearing my own language makes this a lot less embarrassing.
5-stripped,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;twilight_akuma:,count-role;other&character;twilight&saidmarker;twilight_marinette_akumas:,marker:twilight_akuma=stripped.png,Well, Twilight, akuma are butterflies that posess people's objects of significance when they're feeling strong negative emotions. This turns them evil, and gives them dark superpowers! It's my job to stop them!
5-stripped,count-role;other&character;zizou:,count-male:0-1,marker:jilling=confused.png,Excuse me? Isn't the term Jilling for ladies, Zizou?
5-stripped,count-role;other&character;zizou:,count-male:1-3=alarmed.png,U-uhm, I didn’t think I'd have to do <i>that</i> if I lost! Just… You know, play with myself! Zizou, did you trick Tikki?!
5-must_strip,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;viewers>=7&notsaidmarker;lb_camera1&sayingmarker;lb_camera1:=confused.png,<i>Sigh</i>. No. I’m not even that worried about rewinding time at the end of this…
5-must_strip,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;viewers>=7&notsaidmarker;lb_stress1&sayingmarker;lb_stress1:=confused.png,Ah, <i>oui</i>...?
5-must_strip,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;viewers>=7&notsaidmarker;lb_discomfort1&sayingmarker;lb_discomfort1:=confused.png,Me? I don’t appreciate it when people manipulate others.
5-must_strip,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;viewers<7&notsaidmarker;lb_cigs1&sayingmarker;lb_cigs1:=bored.png,My name is <i>Marinette</i>.
5-must_strip,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;viewers<7&notsaidmarker;lb_paris1&sayingmarker;lb_paris1:=excited.png,Oh, there’s so much! I couldn’t possibly--
5-must_strip,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;viewers>=7&notsaidmarker;lb_suit1&sayingmarker;lb_suit1:=embarrassed.png,Oh? Yeah! It's magic, and made of really flexible, durable stuff.
5-must_strip,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;viewers<7&notsaidmarker;lb_chat1&sayingmarker;lb_chat1:=excited.png,That’s Cat Noir, my partner!
5-must_strip,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;viewers>=7&notsaidmarker;lb_identity1&sayingmarker;lb_identity1:=calm.png,Um. Well, Ladybug is my hero identity. I don’t need a license, I just kind of… do it?
5-must_strip,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;viewers<7&notsaidmarker;lb_criminals1&sayingmarker;lb_criminals1:=confident.png,Well, a little bit. Paris’s gotten really peaceful since I became a hero, though!
5-must_strip,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;viewers<7&notsaidmarker;lb_hero1&sayingmarker;lb_hero1:=confident.png,Well, I’m a superhero <i>when</i> I’m Ladybug. It’s more than just a mask, it’s a mindset too!
5-must_strip,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;viewers>=7&notsaidmarker;lb_fashion1&sayingmarker;lb_fashion1:=embarrassed.png,Well, I’m trying to be one. I still take classes…
5-must_strip,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;viewers>=7&notsaidmarker;lb_lucky1&sayingmarker;lb_lucky1:=wink.png,Well, stayed tuned, chat. You'll see when I win!
5-must_strip,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;viewers<7&notsaidmarker;lb_day1&sayingmarker;lb_day1:=confused.png,Yeah…? Are you sure about that, Streaming-chan?
5-must_strip,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;viewers<7&notsaidmarker;lb_bondage1&sayingmarker;lb_bondage1:=wink.png,You’d be surprised how rarely my <i>Chat</i> has that problem.
5-must_strip,count-akko:1,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&notsaidmarker;lb_akko1&sayingmarker;lb_akko1:=confident.png,Well, I think our magic works a little differently…? Most of my power comes from just having good rapport with TIkki.
5-must_strip,count-mulan:1,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&notsaidmarker;lb_mulan1&sayingmarker;lb_mulan1:=confident.png,Yeah? What’s that? We all have some sort of important trinket--
5-must_strip_winning=must_strip.png,Well, I guess you caught me with my pants down.
5-must_strip_winning=must_strip.png,Everyone else looks... A bit worse. I-I mean, in terms of the game. You all look wonderful!
5-must_strip_winning=must_strip.png,I-I guess at this point I have to lose a bit too.
5-must_strip_winning,count-role;self&losses;2&saidmarker;twiceloss:,marker:twiceloss2=alarmed.png,Huh? Again? Already? I thought I was playing better… But I guess I’m so far ahead, I really don’t mind.
5-must_strip_winning,count-role;self&losses;2&notsaidmarker;twiceloss:,marker:twiceloss=alarmed.png,Wait, two in a row? At least I’m winning...
5-must_strip_winning,count-role;self&losses;3:=embarrassed.png,W-well, even if I’m ahead, this is a bad turn of events.
5-must_strip_winning,count-role;self&losses;3:=embarrassed.png,W-well, even if I’m ahead, this is a <i>Miraculously</i> bad turn of events.
5-must_strip_winning,count-role;self&losses;3:=confident.png,So much and so fast...Normally I don't even undress this quickly for...um...You know.
5-must_strip_winning,count-role;self&losses;3:=alarmed.png,W-wait, this can’t be right, I’ve… Just gone twice… But a third time? This isn’t a charm! This isn’t a charm at all!
5-must_strip_winning,count-role;self&losses;2&saidmarker;twiceloss:,count-role;other&character;ann:,marker:loss2_stage5=alarmed.png,Two in a row <i>again</i>? I’m getting streaks of luck. Bad streaks. I can’t help but wonder if a certain black cat is involved…Er, I don’t mean your pet, Mona, Ann.
5-must_strip_winning,count-role;self&losses;2&saidmarker;twiceloss:,count-role;other&character;futaba:,marker:loss2_stage5=alarmed.png,Two in a row <i>again</i>? I’m getting streaks of luck.

Bad streaks. I can’t help but wonder if a certain black cat is involved…Um. No, Blake, I wasn’t looking at you. Any more than I might usually.
5-must_strip_winning,priority:0,count-role;self&hashand;two pair:=embarrassed.png,A-ah, <i>zut</i>. And I thought I had such a good hand, too!
5-must_strip_winning,priority:0,count-role;self&hashand;two pair:=confused.png,Wow! You <i>all</i> had better hands than mine...? I think I'm not doing something right...
5-must_strip_normal=must_strip.png,I can’t give up my Miraculous no matter what…
5-must_strip_normal=must_strip.png,I should've brought my purse. Now <i>that</i> is a good accessory.
5-must_strip_normal=must_strip.png,Zut. W-well. Hrm. I. Uh. Well. Okay.
5-must_strip_normal,count-role;self&losses;2&saidmarker;twiceloss:,marker:twiceloss2=alarmed.png,Huh? Again? Already? I thought I was playing better…
5-must_strip_normal,count-role;other&character;futaba:=confident.png,It helps to never give up and stay postive, Futaba!
5-must_strip_normal,count-role;self&losses;2&notsaidmarker;twiceloss:,marker:twiceloss=alarmed.png,Wait, two in a row? Really?!
5-must_strip_normal,count-role;self&losses;3:=embarrassed.png,W-Wow, ~player~, I’m lucky this is just a game. I’d have been...In way worse shape if this were a fight…
5-must_strip_normal,count-role;self&losses;3:=embarrassed.png,W-well, even if I was ahead, this is a <i>Miraculously</i> bad turn of events.
5-must_strip_normal,count-role;self&losses;3:=confident.png,So much and so fast...Normally I don't even undress this quickly for...um...You know.

5-must_strip_losing=must_strip.png,Some people say it’s like wearing a swimsuit, but honestly, I’d rather wear my costume than show off this much.
5-must_strip_losing=must_strip.png,T-this might be a bit lewd at this stage.
5-must_strip_losing=must_strip.png,D-don't you dare say my underwear isn't cute. I pick for function and form. Erk.
5-must_strip_losing,count-role;self&losses;2&saidmarker;twiceloss:,marker:loss2_stage5=alarmed.png,Huh? Again? Already? I thought I was playing better…

5-stripping=stripping.png,But I hope my luck turns around because I’m certainly giving away my secret identity otherwise.
5-stripping=stripping.png,I know there's an easy joke about secret identities, but I'd really rather not... Show off anything else.
5-stripping=stripping.png,Uhm. I wish people paid as much attention to my heroism as they do to stuff like this.
5-stripping,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_reveal1&notsaidmarker;lb_reveal2&sayingmarker;lb_reveal2:=stripping.png,<i>Zut</i>, nope! This is not the time for this!
5-stripping,count-role;other&character;morrigan&stage;5-8:=stripping.png,And yet, I'm somehow still ahead of you, Morrigan... What I wouldn't give for my yo-yo right about now...
5-stripping,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_bondage1&notsaidmarker;lb_bondage2&sayingmarker;lb_bondage2:=stripping.png,As much as I think you’re disturbed and I’d love to apprehend you…
5-stripping,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_camera1&notsaidmarker;lb_camera2&sayingmarker;lb_camera2:=stripping.png,But it’s not latex. It’s magic, but… um… I’ve worn similar things.
5-stripping,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_mulan1&notsaidmarker;lb_mulan2&sayingmarker;lb_mulan2:=stripping.png,Er… I suppose that’s true… we seem to have a shared heritage, at least.
5-stripping,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_stress1&notsaidmarker;lb_stress2&sayingmarker;lb_stress2:=stripping.png,I don't appreciate where you're going with this…
5-stripping,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_paris1&notsaidmarker;lb_paris2&sayingmarker;lb_paris2:=stripping.png,--I love visiting all the art museums and cultural centers, the coffee and food <i>everywhere</i> are excellent, and then there’s just the stuff everyone loves: movies, games, drinks with friends--
5-stripping,count-role;other&character;9s:=embarrassed.png,I usually just feed Tikki pastries. Hm… I wonder what the other Miraculous holders do with their kwamis?
5-stripping,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_hero1&notsaidmarker;lb_hero2&sayingmarker;lb_hero2:=stripping.png,I’d say it’s not very different, I have magic and super strength to help me out. Really, it’s other heroes that are braver than me.
5-stripping,count-role;other&character;d.va&stage;3&notsaidmarker;d.va_noobs:=embarrassed.png,I-I don’t really need help, D.Va, b-but if you really wanted…
5-stripping,count-role;other&character;daria:=stripping.png,I-I like polka dots! B-but not everything of mine is Ladybug themed! That'd just be silly!
5-stripping,count-role;other&character;morrigan&stage;0-4:=stripping.png,I'm a little behind, but I'm far from done, Morrigan!
5-stripping,count-role;other&character;jura:=stripping.png,I'm flattered you're so interested in my mother tongue! <i>V-voulez vous de lecons privee?</i>
5-stripping,count-role;other&character;d.va&stage;3&saidmarker;d.va_noobs:=confused.png,It’s okay, D.Va. I have enough skill at undressing myself. Thanks.
5-stripping,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_suit1&notsaidmarker;lb_suit2&sayingmarker;lb_suit2:=stripping.png,It's a bit like… you know that springy feeling you get in spandex, but the safe, comfy feeling of an old sweater?
5-stripping,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_discomfort1&notsaidmarker;lb_discomfort2&sayingmarker;lb_discomfort2:=stripping.png,Like you’re doing now.
5-stripping,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_akko1&notsaidmarker;lb_akko2&sayingmarker;lb_akko2:=stripping.png,Lucky Charm isn’t the <i>exact</i> incantation, but I’m sure Tikki would love to talk to you after the game…
5-stripping,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_chat1&notsaidmarker;lb_chat2&sayingmarker;lb_chat2:=stripping.png,My relationship with Adri-- <i>Cat Noir</i> is complicated, but um. Yes, we <i>are</i> together.
5-stripping,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_lucky1&notsaidmarker;lb_lucky2&sayingmarker;lb_lucky2:=stripping.png,N-no! It's sot the next oy-- not a sex toy! It's my finishing move!
5-stripping,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_cigs1&notsaidmarker;lb_cigs2&sayingmarker;lb_cigs2:=stripping.png,No? I eat as much as I want to fill up. I’m kind of amazed my metabolism is so good, to be honest… it’s hard being a baker’s daughter!
5-stripping,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_fashion1&notsaidmarker;lb_fashion2&sayingmarker;lb_fashion2:=stripping.png,Oh! I’m really into flared stuff lately. I feel like stuff that can be tight near the joints but flowing at the ends looks so elegant! Obviously, though, I like frilly things.
5-stripping,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=stripping.png,Oh, oui, Zone?
5-stripping,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_day1&notsaidmarker;lb_day2&sayingmarker;lb_day2:=stripping.png,Okay… Nicole… <i>gah</i> I’ve been considering you like you’ve been akumatized this whole time, it’s so weird to just call you Nicole--  I get up around six, head to class, work until sundown, then go out on patrol.
5-stripping,count-role;other&character;pit:=stripping.png,O-oh! Well, thank you! They're very comfortable and cute. Um. Do you think I'm comfortable--I mean, cute?
5-stripping,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_identity1&notsaidmarker;lb_identity2&sayingmarker;lb_identity2:=stripping.png,To me, it seems as though you’d have a better time if you just focused on simple ways of helping people.
5-stripping,count-role;other&character;gwen&stage;0-1:=stripping.png,Uh, is that a euphemism, Gwen, or are you just taunting me?
5-stripping,count-role;other&character;gwen&stage;2-8:=stripping.png,Uh, is that a euphemism, Spider-Woman, or are you just taunting me?
5-stripping,count-role;other&character;florina&saidmarker;crash:,marker:pegasusquish=stripping.png,Wait, Florina, THAT WAS YOU?
5-stripping,count-role;other&character;zizou:=stripping.png,Well thanks Zizou! I think they're cute too. You’re almost making me not self conscious!
5-stripping,count-role;self&saidmarker;loss2_stage5:=stripping.png,Well, I don’t usually like just wearing a bra and pants. So this got...comfortable quickly.
5-stripping,count-role;self&saidmarker;loss2_stage5:=stripping.png,U-uhm, was the bra that appealing? Jokes about secret identities aside, did you want to see if they’d match?
5-stripping,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_criminals1&notsaidmarker;lb_criminals2&sayingmarker;lb_criminals2:=stripping.png,Well, I usually turn those types over to the police… can we talk about something else? I’ve seen my share of people being horrible to each other but…
5-stripping,count-gwen:1,count-role;other&character;pit:=stripping.png,Wait, are you and Palutena not... Involved, Pit?

6-stripped=stripped.png,Cat Noir’s humor must be really rubbing off on me. Like he tries to.
6-stripped=stripped.png,Well... I hope everyone gets to enjoy some style I usually don’t share.
6-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_discomfort2&notsaidmarker;lb_discomfort3&sayingmarker;lb_discomfort3:=bored.png,<i>Non mais allo quoi?</i>
6-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_reveal2&notsaidmarker;lb_reveal3&sayingmarker;lb_reveal3:=bored.png,<i>Sigh</i>. I’m not a stranger to that concept. The Ladyblog’s gotten a lot better about this but… it can be kind of schlocky. Sorry Alya.
6-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_bondage2&notsaidmarker;lb_bondage3&sayingmarker;lb_bondage3:=alarmed.png,…I-I don’t want to service you like that-- I mean, I wouldn’t want to-- y-you know!
6-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_akko2&notsaidmarker;lb_akko3&sayingmarker;lb_akko3:=wink.png,…It’s so weird to think we’re getting undressed and just talking about this, though. I must feel really comfortable with you!
6-stripped,count-role;other&character;daria:=alarmed.png,A-ah! N-no, please don't! Don't do that!
6-stripped,count-role;other&character;korra:=embarrassed.png,Can you help another lady hero get over her shame?
6-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_hero2&notsaidmarker;lb_hero3&sayingmarker;lb_hero3:=bored.png,E-er. I’m not sure that’s such a great accomplishment.
6-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_paris2&notsaidmarker;lb_paris3&sayingmarker;lb_paris3:=embarrassed.png,--Er… I just love my city!
6-stripped,count-role;other&character;gwen&stage;4-8:=wink.png,G-gorgeous? <i>Oh, arrete, toi.</i> Hehe, <i>Gwen, je vais devoir commencer a te parler sale si tu ne fais pas attention.</i>
6-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_criminals2&notsaidmarker;lb_criminals3&sayingmarker;lb_criminals3:=calm.png,I really do think most people are good at heart. And I’d rather hope for the best and try to comfort people in moments of weakness, because there’s more of those than truly wicked people deserving of punishment.
6-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_stress2&notsaidmarker;lb_stress3&sayingmarker;lb_stress3:=calm.png,I think you can face problems without angsting about them. Too much, anyway. Emotive control is important.
6-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_identity2&notsaidmarker;lb_identity3&sayingmarker;lb_identity3:=wink.png,I’m French. Being rude to <i>débiles comme toi</i> comes naturally. Huh?
6-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_mulan2&notsaidmarker;lb_mulan3&sayingmarker;lb_mulan3:=embarrassed.png,I’m going to be so self conscious about this, now.

6-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_suit2&notsaidmarker;lb_suit3&sayingmarker;lb_suit3:=embarrassed.png,It's a bit tike lat--l-like that! Um… sure, Streaming-chan, your answer's…

6-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_chat2&notsaidmarker;lb_chat3&sayingmarker;lb_chat3:=wink.png,Like I said, it’s complicated. I’m not really interested in getting into it, except that we’re both very comfortable with each other, and others.
6-stripped,count-role;other&character;9s:=wink.png,Oh, there’s quite a few <i>Miraculouses</i>. The Ladybug Miraculous and Cat Miraculous are the two most powerful though.
6-stripped,count-role;other&character;joey&stage;3-8:=wink.png,Sure, Joey! But learning to use a Miraculous is a really long process! If you're ever in Paris, I'd be happy to talk more about it.
6-stripped,count-role;other&character;jura:=excited.png,That's "would you like private lessons," and I'd love to have an excuse to tour a space ship!
6-stripped,count-role;other&character;elaine&stage;0-5:=stripped.png,They match in color, Elaine! Most of my underwear does, if I'm being honest... Erk.

6-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_day2&notsaidmarker;lb_day3&sayingmarker;lb_day3:=calm.png,Unless there’s interruptions, of course. Yikes, twelve hour days? I guess with your camera, it’s not like you really get time off… Sorry, Str-- Nicole.
6-stripped,count-role;other&character;morrigan&stage;0-4:=stripped.png,U-underwear model? N-no, not thanks you. No thank you!
6-stripped,count-role;other&character;morrigan&stage;0-4:=stripped.png,M-maybe if you said <i>underworld</i> model, I could match your tastes, Morrigan!
6-stripped,count-role;other&character;zizou:=stripped.png,W-well, <i>avec Le Bon Marche,</i> something comfortably and cute but not exorbitant. I'm not really one for lingerie, surprisingly.
6-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_camera2&notsaidmarker;lb_camera3&sayingmarker;lb_camera3:=embarrassed.png,W-well, c-could we tot nalk--not talk about this?
6-stripped,count-role;other&character;morrigan&stage;5-8:=wink.png,You know, I've put <i>serious</i> thought into costume friendly underwear lines. Maybe <i>you</i> could model them, Morrigan!
6-stripped,count-role;other&character;gwen&stage;0-3:=confident.png,You know, when I was in high school, other girls never asked me to dance. Maybe I <i>should</i> broaden my horizons.
6-stripped,count-role;other&character;d.va:=wink.png,Zenyatta? That robot monk? I’ve only had to fight one Akumatized robot… But Zenyatta seems a lot more focused and therefore a lot less scary! I’d love to learn more about him!
6-stripped,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;twilight_akuma:,count-role;other&character;twilight&saidmarker;twilight_marinette_akumas:,marker:twilight_akuma=stripped.png,Well, Twilight, akuma are butterflies that posess people's objects of significance when they're feeling strong negative emotions. This turns them evil, and gives them dark superpowers! It's my job to stop them!
6-stripped,count-korra:1,count-role;other&character;pit&stage;5:=wink.png,We could make a Pit sandwich, if you'd like, Pit. Would that make you feel better?
6-stripped,count-pit:1,count-role;other&character;korra:=alarmed.png,Well, get naked, Pit, and then we'll have something to talk about. Um. Not out of pity, just... Anyway!
6-must_strip,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;viewers>=7&notsaidmarker;lb_camera1&sayingmarker;lb_camera1:=confused.png,<i>Sigh</i>. No. I’m not even that worried about rewinding time at the end of this…

6-must_strip,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;viewers>=7&notsaidmarker;lb_discomfort1&sayingmarker;lb_discomfort1:=confused.png,Me? I don’t appreciate it when people manipulate others.

6-must_strip,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;viewers>=7&notsaidmarker;lb_suit1&sayingmarker;lb_suit1:=embarrassed.png,Oh? Yeah! It's magic, and made of really flexible, durable stuff.
6-must_strip,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;viewers<7&notsaidmarker;lb_chat1&sayingmarker;lb_chat1:=excited.png,That’s Cat Noir, my partner!
6-must_strip,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;viewers>=7&notsaidmarker;lb_identity1&sayingmarker;lb_identity1:=calm.png,Um. Well, Ladybug is my hero identity. I don’t need a license, I just kind of… do it?
6-must_strip,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;viewers<7&notsaidmarker;lb_criminals1&sayingmarker;lb_criminals1:=confident.png,Well, a little bit. Paris’s gotten really peaceful since I became a hero, though!
6-must_strip,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;viewers<7&notsaidmarker;lb_hero1&sayingmarker;lb_hero1:=confident.png,Well, I’m a superhero <i>when</i> I’m Ladybug. It’s more than just a mask, it’s a mindset too!
6-must_strip,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;viewers>=7&notsaidmarker;lb_fashion1&sayingmarker;lb_fashion1:=embarrassed.png,Well, I’m trying to be one. I still take classes…
6-must_strip,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;viewers>=7&notsaidmarker;lb_lucky1&sayingmarker;lb_lucky1:=wink.png,Well, stayed tuned, chat. You'll see when I win!
6-must_strip,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;viewers<7&notsaidmarker;lb_day1&sayingmarker;lb_day1:=confused.png,Yeah…? Are you sure about that, Streaming-chan?
6-must_strip,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;viewers<7&notsaidmarker;lb_bondage1&sayingmarker;lb_bondage1:=wink.png,You’d be surprised how rarely my <i>Chat</i> has that problem.
6-must_strip,count-akko:1,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&notsaidmarker;lb_akko1&sayingmarker;lb_akko1:=confident.png,Well, I think our magic works a little differently…? Most of my power comes from just having good rapport with TIkki.
6-must_strip,count-mulan:1,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&notsaidmarker;lb_mulan1&sayingmarker;lb_mulan1:=confident.png,Yeah? What’s that? We all have some sort of important trinket--
6-must_strip_winning=must_strip.png,This is slightly more ridiculous than the Bubbler.
6-must_strip_winning=must_strip.png,This is like Mr. Pigeon. Kind of annoying, but not threatening.
6-must_strip_winning=must_strip.png,Well... I've come this far. As in journied. I haven't. Uhm. Finished yet.

7-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_reveal2&notsaidmarker;lb_reveal3&sayingmarker;lb_reveal3:=bored.png,<i>Sigh</i>. I’m not a stranger to that concept. The Ladyblog’s gotten a lot better about this but… it can be kind of schlocky. Sorry Alya.
7-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_bondage2&notsaidmarker;lb_bondage3&sayingmarker;lb_bondage3:=alarmed.png,…I-I don’t want to service you like that-- I mean, I wouldn’t want to-- y-you know!

7-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_hero2&notsaidmarker;lb_hero3&sayingmarker;lb_hero3:=bored.png,E-er. I’m not sure that’s such a great accomplishment.
7-stripped,count-role;other&character;jin:=embarrassed.png,Er... well, it's good to see your priorities are in order, Jin... Akumas are evil spirits that give people super powers but put them under the sway of the evil Hawkmoth!

7-stripped,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=confused.png,U-hm. That’s very flattering of you, Zone! Normally all the fruit jokes I hear are jokes about bananas…
7-stripped,count-role;other&character;elizabeth:=stripped.png,I find compliments help. <i>Vous etes tres jolie,</i> means you're pretty.

7-stripped,count-role;other&character;zizou:=stripped.png,I like my chest! It makes apparel easy to work with and simple to borrow shirts! Unlike some people, I can't just use magic for everything!
7-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_criminals2&notsaidmarker;lb_criminals3&sayingmarker;lb_criminals3:=calm.png,I really do think most people are good at heart. And I’d rather hope for the best and try to comfort people in moments of weakness, because there’s more of those than truly wicked people deserving of punishment.
7-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_stress2&notsaidmarker;lb_stress3&sayingmarker;lb_stress3:=calm.png,I think you can face problems without angsting about them. Too much, anyway. Emotive control is important.

7-stripped,count-role;other&character;morrigan:=stripped.png,Pfft. I'm happy with my body, Morrigan. I don't need to have a large chest like yours to be full of heroism!
7-stripped,count-role;other&character;morrigan:=stripped.png,You know, even though you're kind of mean, Morrigan. I do actually feel a lot better. You're kind of vampy, but you aren't so bad. Maybe.

7-must_strip,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;viewers<7&notsaidmarker;lb_criminals1&sayingmarker;lb_criminals1:=confident.png,Well, a little bit. Paris’s gotten really peaceful since I became a hero, though!
7-must_strip,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;viewers<7&notsaidmarker;lb_hero1&sayingmarker;lb_hero1:=confident.png,Well, I’m a superhero <i>when</i> I’m Ladybug. It’s more than just a mask, it’s a mindset too!

7-stripping,count-role;other&character;shimakaze:=stripping.png,Well, Tikki is the kwami of my Miraculous, so she's kind of like a fairy--
7-stripping,count-role;other&character;elaine&stage;0-5:=alarmed.png,W-what? The French win at lots of things! We're a cultural center of the arts, we make some of the best food on the planet--
7-stripping,count-role;self&saidmarker;bodysuit&notsaidmarker;bodysuitsolomarinette:,count-role;other&character;palutena:=stripping.png,Magic has lots of uses for um… Maintainance. Maybe Palutena can teach me a spell? Because otherwise it seems… Inconvenient to assume I’d be bare...

#naked
-3-stripped=stripped.png,Well, I’m half French and half Chinese... and I have blue hair and a red costume, is my body really so surprising?
-3-stripped=stripped.png,Well, this is what a superhero looks like in the nude!
-3-stripped=stripped.png,Looks like I have nothing left to hide, so I may as well go all in!
-3-stripped=stripped.png,Is… Is it weird I kind of find this hot?
-3-stripped,count-role;other&character;elaine&stage;0-5:=stripped.png,<i>Merci,</i> Elaine.
-3-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_discomfort2&notsaidmarker;lb_discomfort3&sayingmarker;lb_discomfort3:=bored.png,<i>Non mais allo quoi?</i>
-3-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_reveal2&notsaidmarker;lb_reveal3&sayingmarker;lb_reveal3:=bored.png,<i>Sigh</i>. I’m not a stranger to that concept. The Ladyblog’s gotten a lot better about this but… it can be kind of schlocky. Sorry Alya.
-3-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_bondage2&notsaidmarker;lb_bondage3&sayingmarker;lb_bondage3:=alarmed.png,…I-I don’t want to service you like that-- I mean, I wouldn’t want to-- y-you know!

-3-stripped,count-role;other&character;morrigan:=embarrassed.png,E-er. A lady--not to mention a ladybug--keeps some things to herself!
-3-stripped,count-role;other&character;morrigan:=stripped.png,I mean... I definitely prefer this look.
-3-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_hero2&notsaidmarker;lb_hero3&sayingmarker;lb_hero3:=bored.png,E-er. I’m not sure that’s such a great accomplishment.
-3-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_paris2&notsaidmarker;lb_paris3&sayingmarker;lb_paris3:=embarrassed.png,--Er… I just love my city!
-3-stripped,count-role;other&character;pit:=alarmed.png,Hawk Moth is super dangerous, Pit! I wouldn't underestimate him, and he's got mind control powers!

-3-stripped,count-role;other&character;kyu:=confused.png,I mean I could see you using your tongue for that but-- Yeah! Using your eyelashes seems... Eww...
-3-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_criminals2&notsaidmarker;lb_criminals3&sayingmarker;lb_criminals3:=calm.png,I really do think most people are good at heart.

-3-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_stress2&notsaidmarker;lb_stress3&sayingmarker;lb_stress3:=calm.png,I think you can face problems without angsting about them. Too much, anyway. Emotive control is important.
-3-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_identity2&notsaidmarker;lb_identity3&sayingmarker;lb_identity3:=wink.png,I’m French. Being rude to <i>débiles comme toi</i> comes naturally. Huh?
-3-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_mulan2&notsaidmarker;lb_mulan3&sayingmarker;lb_mulan3:=embarrassed.png,I’m going to be so self conscious about this, now.

-3-stripped,count-role;other&character;raven:=stripped.png,It looks like it’s time to get really really really serious!
-3-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_suit2&notsaidmarker;lb_suit3&sayingmarker;lb_suit3:=embarrassed.png,It's a bit tike lat--l-like that! Um… sure, Streaming-chan, your answer's…
-3-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_lucky2&notsaidmarker;lb_lucky3&sayingmarker;lb_lucky3:=confident.png,It's going to undo all this embarrassing nonsense. When I win. O-of course.
-3-stripped,count-role;other&character;zizou:=alarmed.png,Ladybottom? Gah! Please don't make this a thing!
-3-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_chat2&notsaidmarker;lb_chat3&sayingmarker;lb_chat3:=wink.png,Like I said, it’s complicated. I’m not really interested in getting into it, except that we’re both very comfortable with each other, and others.
-3-stripped,count-role;other&character;elizabeth:=stripped.png,Oh stop, you're making me blush, Elizabeth! Which is, incidentally, oh, <i>arrete, tu me rends rouge.</i>
-3-stripped,count-role;other&character;buffy:=embarrassed.png,Oh. Um. Well, Buffy, if you wanted to take me out to dinner first, I'd have been okay with that too.
-3-stripped,count-role;other&character;buffy:=wink.png,I-I really appreciate you focusing more on my... lack of skill than appearance, Buffy!
-3-stripped,count-role;other&character;shimakaze:=stripped.png,Tikki, um... Tikki is my spirit guide! My kwami. She's kind of like those fairies you've talked about, Shimakaze. She should be around here <i>somewhere</i>...
-3-stripped,count-role;other&character;shimakaze:=stripped.png,--even if she's not here right now... Do your fairies help you out, Shimakaze? Er... with things like this. Not like <i>help</i> help... er... (<i>Help</i>.)
-3-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_fashion2&notsaidmarker;lb_fashion3&sayingmarker;lb_fashion3:=alarmed.png,Um. I-I’ve about it thought--th-thought about it!
-3-stripped,count-role;other&character;corrin_m:=confident.png,Um... well thank you, Corrin. I do like to keep up appearances... even when nobody's going to um... see it.
-3-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_day2&notsaidmarker;lb_day3&sayingmarker;lb_day3:=calm.png,Unless there’s interruptions, of course. Yikes, twelve hour days? I guess with your camera, it’s not like you really get time off… Sorry, Str-- Nicole.
-3-stripped,count-role;other&character;felicia:=confident.png,Well, I don't really like the shaved look on myself-- um... er, or anyone else, Felicia.
-3-stripped,count-role;other&character;daria:=stripped.png,Well, yes. You're welcome to try French kissing them, Daria. I don't think that's what either of us really want, though.
-3-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;lb_camera2&notsaidmarker;lb_camera3&sayingmarker;lb_camera3:=embarrassed.png,W-well, c-could we tot nalk--not talk about this?
-3-stripped,count-role;self&saidmarker;blake_crush:,count-role;other&character;zizou:=embarrassed.png,Blake, is this what it feels like to get a lewd compliment on your butt? Or...Bellabooty?
-3-stripped,priority:990,count-role;other&character;gwen:=shibari3.png,And… Oh… Why does it.... <i>Oh oui</i> feel so good to… Ah!
-3-stripped,count-palutena:1,count-role;self&saidmarker;bodysuit&notsaidmarker;bodysuitsolomarinette:,count-role;other&character;pit:=alarmed.png,I-I wasn't-- I just, with magic-- Gah! I see <i>someone</i> doesn't mind a little hair, Pit! That's the silver lining, I guess? thought it's um... More blue?
-3-stripped,count-pit:1,count-role;other&character;zizou:=bored.png,I'm speechless. I can't even... Um. I- <i>Ladybottom?</i> Please don't let Alya hear about that <i>ever</i>.




#OPPONENT MUST STRIP
#These lines are spoken when an opponent must strip, but the character does not yet know what they will take off.
#Writing different variations is important here, as these lines will be spoken about thirty times per game.
#The "human" versions of the lines will only be spoken if the human player is stripping.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

0-male_must_strip,count-masked&role;target&stage;0:=confused.png,Did ~name~ also come here on a mission? This feels almost like a trap...
0-male_must_strip,count-masked&role;target&stage;0:=wink.png,I guess those of us with secret identities should stick together, huh, ~name~? Um. Just not in an intimate way.

0-male_must_strip,count-monster&role;target:=excited.png,Pfft. Everyone knows <i>monsters</i> aren’t real. At least if we can get you to settle down, it shouldn’t be too hard to stop the akuma possessing you.

0-male_must_strip,count-silent&role;target&stage;0:=calm.png,~name~, you don’t, or can’t, really talk much, right? I guess actions speak louder than words, though! I’m sure you have quite a voice regardless.
0-male_must_strip,count-spirit&role;target:=confident.png,Huh, do you happen to know Tikki, ~name~? She’s the kwami of my Miraculous, and a really great teacher. I kind of wish she hadn’t um. Informed me of this game, though.

0-male_must_strip,count-weapon&role;target&stage;0:=wink.png,Sorry ~name~, I'll just take that weapon off you!
0-male_must_strip,count-weapon&role;target&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,Er, could you not use that weapon, ~name~?
0-male_must_strip,count-weapon&role;target&stage;0:=wink.png,My yo-yo is kind of a weapon, though it's defensive... so I hope you don't mind disarming <i>yourself</i> please!

0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kim&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,Wow, you really prepared to come! E-erk, came prepared!
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kim&stage;0:=confident.png,I’m impressed by your bravery, Kim! I’m a little more conservative than that...
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;arwen&stage;0:=excited.png,Arwen! You were one of my biggest heroes growing up!
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;0:=excited.png,Aww, come on, Daria. If you're such a sour sport, you'll get Akumatized.
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;5:=wink.png,Based on the way you're playing, Amalia...
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;6:=confident.png,Be brave, Saki! You can do this!
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;4:,marker:bodysuit=wink.png,Be the hero I know you are, Ochako!
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5:=wink.png,By <i>my</i> math, <i>you</i> should be just about done, Vriska.
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;0:=confident.png,Corrin! I love the stories I've heard of you! You're so uplifting!
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;dark_magician_girl&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Do you... Also think girls look cute, by any chance, Dark Magician Girl?
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;0:=alarmed.png,Don’t get too mad, Blackrose! You seem really upset. And well armed. I wouldn’t want Hawk Moth to Akumatize you!
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;4:=confident.png,Don’t worry, Palutena. Even if you do get embarrassed, I can de-Akumatize you really quickly. I mean, I’d have to. A god with akuma powers would be really scary...Especially someone as powerful as you!
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;4:=confident.png,Even if you’re a goddess, you’re still in this Palutena, and I won’t go easy on you!
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;1:=confident.png,Don't worry Elena! I'm doing pretty well so far, so I can protect you!
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;4:=wink.png,Don't worry, Saki! Ladybug has your back! And you're in on a very secret... um. Secret!
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;morrigan&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,E-er... Okay, so you're floating, you look like a demon, and you're getting a little... Aggressive.
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;5:=confused.png,Elena, I... Uhm. Don't think it's right to abuse political power... But... You didn't really ask to be here so...
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,Elena, if you don't want to play-
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;red&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Er. My yo-yo is most ly used to disarm people…
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;0:=bored.png,Er. Okay, you’re just like this, right, Kyu?
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:=confused.png,Er... I guess you didn't transform as much as shot off your clothes.
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;chiaki&stage;0:=bored.png,Er... I know your type, Chiaki. Do you get really embarrassed when you lose?
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;6:=wink.png,Er... If you come to Paris I can definitely get you some new clothes as it seems like you're rubbing out.
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;erufuda&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Er... I'm glad you're so fascinated with um... one aspect of French cuisine, Erufuda, but there's more to it than just fries!
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;revy&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Er... Revy, have you considered putting down the guns?
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;1:=confused.png,Er... what's that sound... Shimakaze?
0-female_must_strip,count-role;other&character;zizou&stage;0:,marker:magicalgirl=confused.png,Er...Zizou, how do you know her breasts are better? Can you use your sorcery to see through clothes?
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;chica&stage;0:=confused.png,Er… Freddy Fazbear’s? I think I’ve heard of that restaurant...
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,Er… Ochako, Hawkmoth kind of does send butterflies after people…
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;1:=wink.png,Er… you’re kinda shy about this, huh, Ochako?
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,Erk, sorry Nagisa. But at least you’re experiencing something new?
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;4:,marker:bun_puns=excited.png,Nagisa, I can smell the bakery on you!
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;felicia&stage;0:=confused.png,Err... N-not really the kitty I normally work with...
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;6:=alarmed.png,Er-Well. Um. I-
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;6:=embarrassed.png,I-Um. Okay! Something!
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;7:=wink.png,Florina… Florina… Hey, Florina… It’s your turn…
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;3:=bored.png,For such elaborate armor and such a striking appearance, I have to say your attire... Uhm. Isn't quite as interesting.
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;6:=embarrassed.png,Gah! Elaine! You shouldn't threaten the dealer like that!
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;6:=confused.png,I know he's kind of shifty, but you shouldn't threaten the dealer, Elaine!
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:,marker:localization=alarmed.png,Gah! I’m not a speed-type hero! I don’t know if I can catch...
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;0:=bored.png,GoGo Tomago? Didn’t your friend just buy you equipment for your powers?
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;1:=excited.png,Great! I know you're quite a skilled warrior, and you definitely don't seem to be having a crisis of confidence.
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Y-you know. I really hope this isn't a tactical maneuver to get at my Miraculous... Hawk Moth's tried that a few times...
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;0:=confused.png,Hey Saki, you look a little tired. Is everything okay?
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;0:=bored.png,Saki, are you doing okay?
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;himeko&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,H-hey! Calm down, Sailor Psycho! This is supposed to be fun!
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;1:=confident.png,Hmm, okay, so you aren’t a swordswoman. Do you manipulate time? Maybe… You have a thing for girls with pink hair?
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;jane&stage;0:=confident.png,Hmm, that’s really well worn! Is it an Agreste?
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;1:=confident.png,Hmm. That’s her last small item...
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sanako&stage;1:=confused.png,Hmm... (I think Sanako knows something I don't...)
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;alpha&stage;0:,marker:alphaplaying=confused.png,Hmm... So you're digital? As in you aren't real?
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;videl&stage;0:=confused.png,Hmm... Where have I seen you before?
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;2:=excited.png,Hmm... You know, I'm not an armorer... But I can see some... Stylistic... Improvements I could make.
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;2:=confused.png,Is all armor from... Hmm... Is it all so complicated?
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;pearl&stage;1:=confused.png,Hmm... You seem a bit... unusual, Pearl.
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sharla&stage;0:=confused.png,Hmm... You seem familiar...
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;3:=confident.png,Hmm...I don’t think anyone will laugh, Nagisa. And that’s a really clever idea!
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;1:=wink.png,Hmm...Palutena, you’re a little bit of a trickster, aren’t you? I bet you and Tikki would get along.
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Hmm… Is this to psyche us out, or to distract us?
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;navi&stage;1:=confused.png,Huh. You know, I've never seen Tikki wear clothes...
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;2:=excited.png,I <i>do</i> really like your clothes. They're so nautical and streamlined! I bet you like to go really fast, huh, Shimakaze?
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kimberly&stage;1:=confident.png,I <i>love</i> your whole aesthetic. To be honest, I think I'd just be giving too much away if I were polka-dotted all the time though.
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;2:=calm.png,I actually think we’d have gotten along well in high school, Daria.
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;mercy&stage;3:=wink.png,I bet Medicens Sans Frontieres would really benefit with you as its face, should Overwatch ever be too much, Mercy.
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;juri&stage;0:=alarmed.png,I can see that you're not exactly a positive sort, are you, Juri?
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;streaming-chan&stage;4:=confused.png,I can’t tell if this is some kind of performance art, Streaming-chan…
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;4:=confused.png,I don't really drink but... Wow, those look tasty.
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,I fight a villain who has… I guess in your terms a Quirk…
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;zelda&stage;3:=calm.png,I have a blonde boy in a weird outfit rescue me on occasion too.
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;1:=wink.png,I have to say, I kind of like your outfit better, Sayaka!
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;navi&stage;2:=confident.png,I liked your flower, Navi!
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;yang&stage;0:,marker:yangplaying=confident.png,I only hope your fighting style is as over-developed as the rest of you.
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;4:=confident.png,I really admire someone who can wear a skirt. I'm... really not a dress type of girl.
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;tracer&stage;3:=wink.png,I see London, I’ve seen France...
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;7:=calm.png,I tend to like more natural looks.
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;5&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=bored.png,I think I get it. You aren't an akuma, even if you're kind of a jerk, huh, Veran? You're sort of like Nayru's Kwami, aren't you?
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;1:=excited.png,I think there's probably a Songbird miraculous to go with your locket! It seems like it's a good fit for you, for some reason, Elizabeth!
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;raven&stage;3:=confident.png,I think we have a lot in common, Raven!
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;2:=wink.png,I thought mercenary-types regularly played cards in seedy bars. A-are you just throwing?
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale&stage;1:=calm.png,I wish my teachers were patient like you, Trainer.
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sayla&stage;2:=confident.png,I’ve never seen a military outfit like that one before, Sayla. I like it, it’s very bright! Judging by your attitude, you’re bright as well!
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;2:=excited.png,If her mech weren’t just technology, I could be convinced that D.Va is Hana’s superhero identity.
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,If it makes you feel better, I think it's a pretty skirt.
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,I-I know this is kind of an odd way to meet, Chun-li, but I want you to know you were a huge inspiration to me when I started hero-ing!
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;0:=alarmed.png,I know this is an odd meet to way-- way to meet but hero you're my Chun-li! An inspiration! G-gah!
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;0:,marker:florinaplaying=embarrassed.png,I-I like your hair, Florina!
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,I-I'd rather not delve into insults, Elaine!
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Um... Could we maybe speak in French instead of Spanish, Elaine?
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,I-I'm a little worried about the continued gunplay, Aimee.
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:=bored.png,Aimee, this is getting really dangerous. Without clothes or armor...
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;3:=bored.png,I'm actually starting to enjoy the fireworks. I'm sorry your stuff's being damaged though...
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4:=confused.png,I'm glad <i>this</i> tasteless display is over. Ugh.
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4:=bored.png,What is <i>wrong</i> with you, Vriska? How tasteless.
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;5:=confused.png,I'm glad the explosions haven't... um... shown your panties... or your... I don't know enough nautical terminology to figure out what you'd call it...
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;2:=bored.png,I'm glad you're still going slow, Ochako.
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,I'm going to assume you'll be keeping the gun...
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;4:=bored.png,Aimee, I'll even help you undress if you just... stop shooting. Please. For goodness sakes.
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;videl&stage;3:=calm.png,I'm not going to try to pick a fight with you, but...
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;4&saidmarker;null_possess:=confident.png,I'm so proud of you, Nayru! I know this isn't easy, but you're sticking with it! That's wonderful!
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;6:=bored.png,I'm still mad you added extra layers, but I suppose I'm not exactly exempt from that...
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;ann&stage;6:=confused.png,Is your hair natural? I've heard you're a quarter American, but...
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;5:=calm.png,It’s okay Nagisa. Sometimes, the people you meet in passing, you get to know far better than you might think.
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;5:=excited.png,Wow Nagisa! You’re really giving it your all now, aren’t you?
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;5:,marker:marinette_ricebun=embarrassed.png,I-I’d offer to let you borrow my bra, if it wasn’t against the rules, we seem like we’re the same size...
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;0:=calm.png,It's a bit vintage but I like the way your outfit comes together.
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kimberly&stage;0:=calm.png,Kimberly, how does your morpher work? You changed out of your costume so fast!
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kyoko&stage;0:=confident.png,Kyoko, I like your outfit!
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3:=confident.png,Looks like you're time's up, Vriska! It's time for you to surrender!
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;weiss&stage;0:=confident.png,Maybe nobody has told you anything because you’re being spoiled brat, Weiss?
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;meg&stage;0:=confident.png,Meg! Don't worry, I can de-Akumatize these "Slasher" villains of yours with no trouble.
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;mei&stage;3:=confident.png,Mei, after this, can you tutor me in Mandarin?
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;mercy&stage;1:=calm.png,Mercy, I can tell by your accent that you’re Swiss, right? My family-- I mean, a friend's family-- uses only the best Swiss chocolate in their baking!
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;revy&stage;0:=confused.png,Must you be so rude and vulgar, Revy?
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;0:=confused.png,Natsuki, if you're going to be upset, it might be best not to play... I'd hate for you to get Akumatized...
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Nayru again? I just <i>love</i> your look! Um. Not that you're looking at me. Or at anyone.
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;2:=wink.png,No need to get worried, Nagisa! I’m right here with you. And friends make it better, right? Or...Um, more tolerable.
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;2:=confident.png,It’s alright, Nagisa. I can definitely tell you’re playing better than last round!
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Now you’re definitely not wearing a superhero costume...
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;neo&stage;4:=bored.png,Oh goodness, you don’t even need an akuma, you have a really vicious aura about you…
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;2:=confused.png,Oh! You worked for REVOCs, right?
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;4:=confused.png,Oh! You've been very self-conscious about this, have you been padding--
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;weiss&stage;0:=bored.png,Oh, poor little rich girl. Truly, life has made it so hard for you.
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;0:=confident.png,Oh, who was your little friend, Shimakaze?
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6b:=wink.png,Oh, you're going to undress <i>again</i>? Playing by the rules is so, so challenging, isn't it, Vriska?
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;ann&stage;0:=excited.png,Ohmygosh, Ann Takamaki!? The model from Japan? We have so much in common!
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;3:=calm.png,Okay, I’ve heard you on TV. Are you that <i>actually</i> that famous japanese runner? Miki Makimura?
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:,marker:localization=alarmed.png,O-oh no! Aimee I warned you!
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,I can probably avoid or ignore the gunfire, but not everyone else can. Please be very careful!
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;6:=alarmed.png,O-oh no, this'll hit all of your exposed skin!
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,O-oh. Well, I’m surprised you kept them on so long!
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;launch&stage;1:=alarmed.png,Please don't sneeze while you have an itchy trigger finger--
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6a:=confused.png,Please tell me you're going to dry off now. I-it's kind of hard to deal with you standing there soaked. M-my innate sense of heroism means I have to care about even <i>you, Vriska</i>.
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;red&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Red! You’re getting really…
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;0:,marker:samusplaying=wink.png,Samus Aran? I’ve heard of you!
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;1:=excited.png,Samus, my powers are kind of similar to yours! I suit up and then have to build my own powerups each time.
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;2:=confident.png,Sayaka, what's a familiar? Is it like an akuma?
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;0:,marker:seiplaying=bored.png,Sei... Asagiri. Asthagiri? Hmm... I can't tell if that's a Japanese or Indian name.
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;0:,marker:seiplaying=confident.png,So, you're another hero! Just... one of the drunker ones, it seems.
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;seven&stage;0:,marker:sevenplaying=bored.png,Seven of Nine? I’m sorry, did something get translated wrong? Sept de Neuf? Mme. Neuf?
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;3:=confident.png,Sheena, you're a summoner, right? Maybe you can help improve my bond with Tikki!
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shego&stage;1:=calm.png,Shego, you should really give up and join the forces of good! You're much to smart to help out... That bad guy you help.
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Sirens are… Kind of magical? Sort of?
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;1:=calm.png,So you and ~player~ came here together...?
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;3:=confused.png,So you can... teleport? Are you sure you don't have some sort of guardian spirit? Wait, his name is Booker? What's a Booker?
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,So, did you pick that outfit for yourself? Tikki more or less picked mine for me, but I'm pretty happy with it... usually.
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;5:=alarmed.png,So, just… Wow, Kyu. I’m not used to someone losing so quickly.
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,So, now that you’re taking off… Um, the rest of your suit, are you going to tell me-- Er, us, the story?
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;5:=bored.png,So, Saki, what would you like to do after this? I have a few ideas, if you'd like!
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;5:,marker:saki_date=excited.png,(She's sure looking at ~player~ a lot...) H-hey! ~player~! A-are you enjoying Saki undressing!
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;5:,marker:saki_date=excited.png,(~player~ and Saki are looking at each other a lot...) Hmm. ~player~, do you think you'd take Saki out on a date after this?
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;1:=confident.png,So... Nayru, can you rewind time? My Miraculous lets me do that!
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;navi&stage;0:=calm.png,Soo... Navi, what's with your light?
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;dawn&stage;0:=confident.png,Sorry about that Dawn, girls with blue hair need to stick together!
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;spooky&stage;0:,marker:spirits=excited.png,Spooky? Y-you’re a ghost? Tikki says hi, from one spirit to another.
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;1:=wink.png,That sweater looks pretty comfortable. And I like the color!
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;lyn&stage;0:,marker:lynplaying=excited.png,That’s a nice sword, but is it a Miraculous or is it possessed by an Akuma?

1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;4:=wink.png,Don't worry, Saki! Ladybug has your back! And you're in on a very secret... um. Secret!
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;morrigan&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,E-er... Okay, so you're floating, you look like a demon, and you're getting a little... Aggressive.
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;5:=confused.png,Elena, I... Uhm. Don't think it's right to abuse political power... But... You didn't really ask to be here so...
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,Elena, if you don't want to play-
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;red&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Er. My yo-yo is most ly used to disarm people…
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;0:=bored.png,Er. Okay, you’re just like this, right, Kyu?
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:=confused.png,Er... I guess you didn't transform as much as shot off your clothes.
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;chiaki&stage;0:=bored.png,Er... I know your type, Chiaki. Do you get really embarrassed when you lose?
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;6:=wink.png,Er... If you come to Paris I can definitely get you some new clothes as it seems like you're rubbing out.
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;erufuda&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Er... I'm glad you're so fascinated with um... one aspect of French cuisine, Erufuda, but there's more to it than just fries!
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;revy&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Er... Revy, have you considered putting down the guns?
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;1:=confused.png,Er... what's that sound... Shimakaze?
1-female_must_strip,count-role;other&character;zizou&stage;0:,marker:magicalgirl=confused.png,Er...Zizou, how do you know her breasts are better? Can you use your sorcery to see through clothes?
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;chica&stage;0:=confused.png,Er… Freddy Fazbear’s? I think I’ve heard of that restaurant...
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,Er… Ochako, Hawkmoth kind of does send butterflies after people…
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;1:=wink.png,Er… you’re kinda shy about this, huh, Ochako?
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,Erk, sorry Nagisa. But at least you’re experiencing something new?
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;4:,marker:bun_puns=excited.png,Nagisa, I can smell the bakery on you!
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;felicia&stage;0:=confused.png,Err... N-not really the kitty I normally work with...
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;6:=alarmed.png,Er-Well. Um. I-
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;6:=embarrassed.png,I-Um. Okay! Something!
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;7:=wink.png,Florina… Florina… Hey, Florina… It’s your turn...
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;3:=bored.png,For such elaborate armor and such a striking appearance, I have to say your attire... Uhm. Isn't quite as interesting.
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;6:=embarrassed.png,Gah! Elaine! You shouldn't threaten the dealer like that!
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;6:=confused.png,I know he's kind of shifty, but you shouldn't threaten the dealer, Elaine!
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:,marker:localization=alarmed.png,Gah! I’m not a speed-type hero! I don’t know if I can catch…
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;0:=bored.png,GoGo Tomago? Didn’t your friend just buy you equipment for your powers?
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;1:=excited.png,Great! I know you're quite a skilled warrior, and you definitely don't seem to be having a crisis of confidence.
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Y-you know. I really hope this isn't a tactical maneuver to get at my Miraculous... Hawk Moth's tried that a few times...
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;0:=confused.png,Hey Saki, you look a little tired. Is everything okay?
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;0:=bored.png,Saki, are you doing okay?
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;himeko&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,H-hey! Calm down, Sailor Psycho! This is supposed to be fun!
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;1:=confident.png,Hmm, okay, so you aren’t a swordswoman. Do you manipulate time? Maybe… You have a thing for girls with pink hair?
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;jane&stage;0:=confident.png,Hmm, that’s really well worn! Is it an Agreste?
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;1:=confident.png,Hmm. That’s her last small item...
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sanako&stage;1:=confused.png,Hmm... (I think Sanako knows something I don't...)
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;alpha&stage;0:,marker:alphaplaying=confused.png,Hmm... So you're digital? As in you aren't real?
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;videl&stage;0:=confused.png,Hmm... Where have I seen you before?
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;2:=excited.png,Hmm... You know, I'm not an armorer... But I can see some... Stylistic... Improvements I could make.
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;2:=confused.png,Is all armor from... Hmm... Is it all so complicated?
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;pearl&stage;1:=confused.png,Hmm... You seem a bit... unusual, Pearl.
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sharla&stage;0:=confused.png,Hmm... You seem familiar...
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;3:=confident.png,Hmm...I don’t think anyone will laugh, Nagisa. And that’s a really clever idea!
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;1:=wink.png,Hmm...Palutena, you’re a little bit of a trickster, aren’t you? I bet you and Tikki would get along.
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Hmm… Is this to psyche us out, or to distract us?
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;navi&stage;1:=confused.png,Huh. You know, I've never seen Tikki wear clothes...
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;2:=excited.png,I <i>do</i> really like your clothes. They're so nautical and streamlined! I bet you like to go really fast, huh, Shimakaze?
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kimberly&stage;1:=confident.png,I <i>love</i> your whole aesthetic. To be honest, I think I'd just be giving too much away if I were polka-dotted all the time though.
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;2:=calm.png,I actually think we’d have gotten along well in high school, Daria.
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;mercy&stage;3:=wink.png,I bet Medicens Sans Frontieres would really benefit with you as its face, should Overwatch ever be too much, Mercy.
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;juri&stage;0:=alarmed.png,I can see that you're not exactly a positive sort, are you, Juri?
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;streaming-chan&stage;4:=confused.png,I can’t tell if this is some kind of performance art, Streaming-chan…
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;4:=confused.png,I don't really drink but... Wow, those look tasty.
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,I fight a villain who has… I guess in your terms a Quirk…
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;zelda&stage;3:=calm.png,I have a blonde boy in a weird outfit rescue me on occasion too.
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;1:=wink.png,I have to say, I kind of like your outfit better, Sayaka!
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;navi&stage;2:=confident.png,I liked your flower, Navi!
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;yang&stage;0:,marker:yangplaying=confident.png,I only hope your fighting style is as over-developed as the rest of you.
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;4:=confident.png,I really admire someone who can wear a skirt. I'm... really not a dress type of girl.
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;tracer&stage;3:=wink.png,I see London, I’ve seen France...
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;7:=calm.png,I tend to like more natural looks.
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;5&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=bored.png,I think I get it. You aren't an akuma, even if you're kind of a jerk, huh, Veran? You're sort of like Nayru's Kwami, aren't you?
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;1:=excited.png,I think there's probably a Songbird miraculous to go with your locket! It seems like it's a good fit for you, for some reason, Elizabeth!
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;raven&stage;3:=confident.png,I think we have a lot in common, Raven!
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;2:=wink.png,I thought mercenary-types regularly played cards in seedy bars. A-are you just throwing?
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale&stage;1:=calm.png,I wish my teachers were patient like you, Trainer.
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sayla&stage;2:=confident.png,I’ve never seen a military outfit like that one before, Sayla. I like it, it’s very bright! Judging by your attitude, you’re bright as well!
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;2:=excited.png,If her mech weren’t just technology, I could be convinced that D.Va is Hana’s superhero identity.
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,If it makes you feel better, I think it's a pretty skirt.
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,I-I know this is kind of an odd way to meet, Chun-li, but I want you to know you were a huge inspiration to me when I started hero-ing!
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;0:=alarmed.png,I know this is an odd meet to way-- way to meet but hero you're my Chun-li! An inspiration! G-gah!
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;0:,marker:florinaplaying=embarrassed.png,I-I like your hair, Florina!
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,I-I'd rather not delve into insults, Elaine!
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Um... Could we maybe speak in French instead of Spanish, Elaine?
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,I-I'm a little worried about the continued gunplay, Aimee.
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:=bored.png,Aimee, this is getting really dangerous. Without clothes or armor...
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;3:=bored.png,I'm actually starting to enjoy the fireworks. I'm sorry your stuff's being damaged though...
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4:=confused.png,I'm glad <i>this</i> tasteless display is over. Ugh.
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4:=bored.png,What is <i>wrong</i> with you, Vriska? How tasteless.
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;5:=confused.png,I'm glad the explosions haven't... um... shown your panties... or your... I don't know enough nautical terminology to figure out what you'd call it...
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;2:=bored.png,I'm glad you're still going slow, Ochako.
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,I'm going to assume you'll be keeping the gun...
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;4:=bored.png,Aimee, I'll even help you undress if you just... stop shooting. Please. For goodness sakes.
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;videl&stage;3:=calm.png,I'm not going to try to pick a fight with you, but...
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;4&saidmarker;null_possess:=confident.png,I'm so proud of you, Nayru! I know this isn't easy, but you're sticking with it! That's wonderful!
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;6:=bored.png,I'm still mad you added extra layers, but I suppose I'm not exactly exempt from that...
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;ann&stage;6:=confused.png,Is your hair natural? I've heard you're a quarter American, but...
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;5:=calm.png,It’s okay Nagisa. Sometimes, the people you meet in passing, you get to know far better than you might think.
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;5:=excited.png,Wow Nagisa! You’re really giving it your all now, aren’t you?
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;5:,marker:marinette_ricebun=embarrassed.png,I-I’d offer to let you borrow my bra, if it wasn’t against the rules, we seem like we’re the same size...
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;0:=calm.png,It's a bit vintage but I like the way your outfit comes together.
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kimberly&stage;0:=calm.png,Kimberly, how does your morpher work? You changed out of your costume so fast!
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kyoko&stage;0:=confident.png,Kyoko, I like your outfit!
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3:=confident.png,Looks like you're time's up, Vriska! It's time for you to surrender!
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;meg&stage;0:=confident.png,Meg! Don't worry, I can de-Akumatize these "Slasher" villains of yours with no trouble.
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;mei&stage;3:=confident.png,Mei, after this, can you tutor me in Mandarin?
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;mercy&stage;1:=calm.png,Mercy, I can tell by your accent that you’re Swiss, right? My family-- I mean, a friend's family-- uses only the best Swiss chocolate in their baking!
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;revy&stage;0:=confused.png,Must you be so rude and vulgar, Revy?
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;0:=confused.png,Natsuki, if you're going to be upset, it might be best not to play... I'd hate for you to get Akumatized...
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Nayru again? I just <i>love</i> your look! Um. Not that you're looking at me. Or at anyone.
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;2:=wink.png,No need to get worried, Nagisa! I’m right here with you. And friends make it better, right? Or...Um, more tolerable.
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;2:=confident.png,It’s alright, Nagisa. I can definitely tell you’re playing better than last round!
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;weiss&stage;0:=bored.png,No, not particularly. I think I have to just treat you with the Chloe protocol...Assume your bad behavior on its own isn’t enough stress to Akumatize you…
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Now you’re definitely not wearing a superhero costume...
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;neo&stage;4:=bored.png,Oh goodness, you don’t even need an akuma, you have a really vicious aura about you…
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;2:=confused.png,Oh! You worked for REVOCs, right?
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;4:=confused.png,Oh! You've been very self-conscious about this, have you been padding--
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;weiss&stage;0:=bored.png,Oh, poor little rich girl. Truly, life has made it so hard for you.
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;0:=confident.png,Oh, who was your little friend, Shimakaze?
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6b:=wink.png,Oh, you're going to undress <i>again</i>? Playing by the rules is so, so challenging, isn't it, Vriska?
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;ann&stage;0:=excited.png,Ohmygosh, Ann Takamaki!? The model from Japan? We have so much in common!
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;3:=calm.png,Okay, I’ve heard you on TV. Are you that <i>actually</i> that famous japanese runner? Miki Makimura?
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:,marker:localization=alarmed.png,O-oh no! Aimee I warned you!
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,I can probably avoid or ignore the gunfire, but not everyone else can. Please be very careful!
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;6:=alarmed.png,O-oh no, this'll hit all of your exposed skin!
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,O-oh. Well, I’m surprised you kept them on so long!
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;launch&stage;1:=alarmed.png,Please don't sneeze while you have an itchy trigger finger--
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6a:=confused.png,Please tell me you're going to dry off now. I-it's kind of hard to deal with you standing there soaked. M-my innate sense of heroism means I have to care about even <i>you, Vriska</i>.
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;red&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Red! You’re getting really…
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;0:,marker:samusplaying=wink.png,Samus Aran? I’ve heard of you!
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;1:=excited.png,Samus, my powers are kind of similar to yours! I suit up and then have to build my own powerups each time.
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;2:=confident.png,Sayaka, what's a familiar? Is it like an akuma?
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;0:,marker:seiplaying=bored.png,Sei... Asagiri. Asthagiri? Hmm... I can't tell if that's a Japanese or Indian name.
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;0:,marker:seiplaying=confident.png,So, you're another hero! Just... one of the drunker ones, it seems.
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;seven&stage;0:,marker:sevenplaying=bored.png,Seven of Nine? I’m sorry, did something get translated wrong? Sept de Neuf? Mme. Neuf?
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;3:=confident.png,Sheena, you're a summoner, right? Maybe you can help improve my bond with Tikki!
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shego&stage;1:=calm.png,Shego, you should really give up and join the forces of good! You're much to smart to help out... That bad guy you help.
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Sirens are… Kind of magical? Sort of?
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;1:=calm.png,So you and ~player~ came here together...?
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;3:=confused.png,So you can... teleport? Are you sure you don't have some sort of guardian spirit? Wait, his name is Booker? What's a Booker?
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,So, did you pick that outfit for yourself? Tikki more or less picked mine for me, but I'm pretty happy with it... usually.
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;5:=alarmed.png,So, just… Wow, Kyu. I’m not used to someone losing so quickly.
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,So, now that you’re taking off… Um, the rest of your suit, are you going to tell me-- Er, us, the story?
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;5:=bored.png,So, Saki, what would you like to do after this? I have a few ideas, if you'd like!
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;5:,marker:saki_date=excited.png,(She's sure looking at ~player~ a lot...) H-hey! ~player~! A-are you enjoying Saki undressing!
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;5:,marker:saki_date=excited.png,(~player~ and Saki are looking at each other a lot...) Hmm. ~player~, do you think you'd take Saki out on a date after this?
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;1:=confident.png,So... Nayru, can you rewind time? My Miraculous lets me do that!
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;navi&stage;0:=calm.png,Soo... Navi, what's with your light?
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;dawn&stage;0:=confident.png,Sorry about that Dawn, girls with blue hair need to stick together!
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;spooky&stage;0:,marker:spirits=excited.png,Spooky? Y-you’re a ghost? Tikki says hi, from one spirit to another.
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;1:=wink.png,That sweater looks pretty comfortable. And I like the color!
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;lyn&stage;0:,marker:lynplaying=excited.png,That’s a nice sword, but is it a Miraculous or is it possessed by an Akuma?
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;zizou&stage;0:=confident.png,That’s a really cool hat, Zizou!
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;daisy&stage;3:=confident.png,That’s clever, Daisy! Got it! So, if you get too rattled, Daisy, I’ll break your crown!
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;4&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=alarmed.png,The akuma! It's got Nayru's--
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;7:=excited.png,The good news, Vriska, is that we could basically see everything so why don't you--
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;7:=calm.png,You know, Vriska, we've already seen your chest, so, really, you could just--
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch&stage;5:=confident.png,The good stuff? Sure! Wait, you aren’t showing the good stuff already?
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,This is why I don't like to wear skirts...
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,You know, I think a skirt looks good on you, but I find pencil skirts really impractical...
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;0:=confident.png,Tikki is telling me you're an oracle, Nayru! What does that mean, though? (Your dress is also <i>super</i> chic!)
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;0:,marker:elaine_puns=confused.png,Ugh, puns. Always the puns.
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;0:=confused.png,You know the dealer, Elaine!?
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;weiss&stage;2:=confused.png,Uh, no, Weiss. Not quite. You’re flaunting your riches.
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Uhm. Sei, you’ve never gone mad with power, right?
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;3:=confused.png,Uhm. With the way things are going, I can see this getting very dangerous when you run out of clothes.

2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;launch&stage;5:=alarmed.png,<i>Oh, Launch! Soyez...</i> Oh. Oh no... I get it--

2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;pearl&stage;2:=excited.png,A chiffon! I would love to talk more about that with you! Such an underused choice of garment!
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,A dango bra? That would be like me wearing something with cinnamon rolls on it... Or cake?
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;4:=bored.png,A superhero has a sense of dignity.
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;5:=alarmed.png,A three headed monkey! <i>an akuma!?</i> I knew it! There's--
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,A-at least you're still losing, Vriska. Trust me. You'll want to get rid of that evil butterfly as soon as possible.
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;4:=wink.png,Agh, Shantae, I give up.
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;0:=confident.png,Ah, don’t worry Nagisa, we’ll see this through together!
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;0:=calm.png,Aimee... I can't quite place your accent... But you sound... American?
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;0:=calm.png,Oh, of course you'll give up the gun first. Then you'll take off the bands one by one.
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;1:=calm.png,Amalia, do you have some sort of Miraculous?
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;1:=wink.png,Hmm... Amalia, I have a feeling you use a Miraculous too, don't you?
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kim&stage;0:,marker:kim_similar=excited.png,An athletic superhero who has to balance her academic life...With great fashion sense! You seem awfully familiar…
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kim&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,Wow, you really prepared to come! E-erk, came prepared!
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kim&stage;0:=confident.png,I’m impressed by your bravery, Kim! I’m a little more conservative than that...
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;arwen&stage;0:=excited.png,Arwen! You were one of my biggest heroes growing up!
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;0:=excited.png,Aww, come on, Daria. If you're such a sour sport, you'll get Akumatized.
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;5:=wink.png,Based on the way you're playing, Amalia...
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;6:=confident.png,Be brave, Saki! You can do this!
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;4:,marker:bodysuit=wink.png,Be the hero I know you are, Ochako!
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,Blackrose! I don’t want you to get too upset.
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5:=wink.png,By <i>my</i> math, <i>you</i> should be just about done, Vriska.
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;0:=confident.png,Corrin! I love the stories I've heard of you! You're so uplifting!

2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;3:=wink.png,Don’t give up Nagisa! You haven’t lost yet!
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;4:=confident.png,Don’t worry, Palutena. Even if you do get embarrassed, I can de-Akumatize you really quickly. I mean, I’d have to. A god with akuma powers would be really scary...Especially someone as powerful as you!
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;4:=confident.png,Even if you’re a goddess, you’re still in this Palutena, and I won’t go easy on you!
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;4:=wink.png,Don't worry, Saki! Ladybug has your back! And you're in on a very secret... um. Secret!
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;morrigan&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,E-er... Okay, so you're floating, you look like a demon, and you're getting a little... Aggressive.
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;1:=bored.png,Elena, I get the feeling you get rushed into things a lot...
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;5:=confused.png,Elena, I... Uhm. Don't think it's right to abuse political power... But... You didn't really ask to be here so...
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;red&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Er. My yo-yo is most ly used to disarm people…
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:=confused.png,Er... I guess you didn't transform as much as shot off your clothes.
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;chiaki&stage;0:=bored.png,Er... I know your type, Chiaki. Do you get really embarrassed when you lose?
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;6:=wink.png,Er... If you come to Paris I can definitely get you some new clothes as it seems like you're rubbing out.
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;erufuda&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Er... I'm glad you're so fascinated with um... one aspect of French cuisine, Erufuda, but there's more to it than just fries!
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;revy&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Er... Revy, have you considered putting down the guns?
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;1:=confused.png,Er... what's that sound... Shimakaze?
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;chica&stage;0:=confused.png,Er… Freddy Fazbear’s? I think I’ve heard of that restaurant...
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,Er… Ochako, Hawkmoth kind of does send butterflies after people…
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;1:=wink.png,Er… you’re kinda shy about this, huh, Ochako?
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,Erk, sorry Nagisa. But at least you’re experiencing something new?
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;4:,marker:bun_puns=excited.png,Nagisa, I can smell the bakery on you!
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;felicia&stage;0:=confused.png,Err... N-not really the kitty I normally work with...
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;6:=alarmed.png,Er-Well. Um. I-
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;6:=embarrassed.png,I-Um. Okay! Something!
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;4:=confused.png,Fairy powers are so weird… Are you sure you’re not a kwami of some sort?
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;7:=wink.png,Florina… Florina… Hey, Florina… It’s your turn...
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;3:=bored.png,For such elaborate armor and such a striking appearance, I have to say your attire... Uhm. Isn't quite as interesting.
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;6:=embarrassed.png,Gah! Elaine! You shouldn't threaten the dealer like that!
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;6:=confused.png,I know he's kind of shifty, but you shouldn't threaten the dealer, Elaine!
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;0:=bored.png,GoGo Tomago? Didn’t your friend just buy you equipment for your powers?
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;1:=excited.png,Great! I know you're quite a skilled warrior, and you definitely don't seem to be having a crisis of confidence.
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Y-you know. I really hope this isn't a tactical maneuver to get at my Miraculous... Hawk Moth's tried that a few times...
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;0:=confused.png,Hey Saki, you look a little tired. Is everything okay?
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;0:=bored.png,Saki, are you doing okay?
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;himeko&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,H-hey! Calm down, Sailor Psycho! This is supposed to be fun!
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;3:=alarmed.png,Hm... That belt is really classic! I love how it tied your outfit together.
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;3:=confused.png,W-who is Esteban and why would he put you up to this?
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;3:=bored.png,Elena! I at least joined this because I was worried about Hawk Moth... I'll take this Esteban down, I promise!
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;1:=confident.png,Hmm, okay, so you aren’t a swordswoman. Do you manipulate time? Maybe… You have a thing for girls with pink hair?
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;jane&stage;0:=confident.png,Hmm, that’s really well worn! Is it an Agreste?
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sanako&stage;1:=confused.png,Hmm... (I think Sanako knows something I don't...)
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;alpha&stage;0:,marker:alphaplaying=confused.png,Hmm... So you're digital? As in you aren't real?
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;2:=excited.png,Hmm... You know, I'm not an armorer... But I can see some... Stylistic... Improvements I could make.
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;2:=confused.png,Is all armor from... Hmm... Is it all so complicated?
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;pearl&stage;1:=confused.png,Hmm... You seem a bit... unusual, Pearl.
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sharla&stage;0:=confused.png,Hmm... You seem familiar...
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;3:=confident.png,Hmm...I don’t think anyone will laugh, Nagisa. And that’s a really clever idea!
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;1:=wink.png,Hmm...Palutena, you’re a little bit of a trickster, aren’t you? I bet you and Tikki would get along.
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Hmm… Is this to psyche us out, or to distract us?
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;navi&stage;1:=confused.png,Huh. You know, I've never seen Tikki wear clothes...
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;2:=excited.png,I <i>do</i> really like your clothes. They're so nautical and streamlined! I bet you like to go really fast, huh, Shimakaze?
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kimberly&stage;1:=confident.png,I <i>love</i> your whole aesthetic. To be honest, I think I'd just be giving too much away if I were polka-dotted all the time though.
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;2:=calm.png,I actually think we’d have gotten along well in high school, Daria.
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;mercy&stage;3:=wink.png,I bet Medicens Sans Frontieres would really benefit with you as its face, should Overwatch ever be too much, Mercy.
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;juri&stage;0:=alarmed.png,I can see that you're not exactly a positive sort, are you, Juri?
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;streaming-chan&stage;4:=confused.png,I can’t tell if this is some kind of performance art, Streaming-chan…
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;4:=confused.png,I don't really drink but... Wow, those look tasty.
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,I fight a villain who has… I guess in your terms a Quirk…
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;0:=confident.png,I guess you're not <i>so</i> lucky after all, Vriska!
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;zelda&stage;3:=calm.png,I have a blonde boy in a weird outfit rescue me on occasion too.
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;1:=wink.png,I have to say, I kind of like your outfit better, Sayaka!
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;navi&stage;2:=confident.png,I liked your flower, Navi!
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;yang&stage;0:,marker:yangplaying=confident.png,I only hope your fighting style is as over-developed as the rest of you.
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;4:=confident.png,I really admire someone who can wear a skirt. I'm... really not a dress type of girl.
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;tracer&stage;3:=wink.png,I see London, I’ve seen France...
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;7:=calm.png,I tend to like more natural looks.
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;5&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=bored.png,I think I get it. You aren't an akuma, even if you're kind of a jerk, huh, Veran? You're sort of like Nayru's Kwami, aren't you?
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;1:=excited.png,I think there's probably a Songbird miraculous to go with your locket! It seems like it's a good fit for you, for some reason, Elizabeth!
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;raven&stage;3:=confident.png,I think we have a lot in common, Raven!
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;2:=wink.png,I thought mercenary-types regularly played cards in seedy bars. A-are you just throwing?
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale&stage;1:=calm.png,I wish my teachers were patient like you, Trainer.
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,I’m amazed you keep those gloves so pristine! Given your, um, personality, Kyu.
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sayla&stage;2:=confident.png,I’ve never seen a military outfit like that one before, Sayla. I like it, it’s very bright! Judging by your attitude, you’re bright as well!
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;2:=excited.png,If her mech weren’t just technology, I could be convinced that D.Va is Hana’s superhero identity.
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,If it makes you feel better, I think it's a pretty skirt.
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,I-I know this is kind of an odd way to meet, Chun-li, but I want you to know you were a huge inspiration to me when I started hero-ing!
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;0:=alarmed.png,I know this is an odd meet to way-- way to meet but hero you're my Chun-li! An inspiration! G-gah!
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;0:,marker:florinaplaying=embarrassed.png,I-I like your hair, Florina!
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,I-I'd rather not delve into insults, Elaine!
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Um... Could we maybe speak in French instead of Spanish, Elaine?
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,I-I'm a little worried about the continued gunplay, Aimee.
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:=bored.png,Aimee, this is getting really dangerous. Without clothes or armor...
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;videl&stage;0:=wink.png,I'll just say it, the clothes are coming off.
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;3:=bored.png,I'm actually starting to enjoy the fireworks. I'm sorry your stuff's being damaged though...
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4:=confused.png,I'm glad <i>this</i> tasteless display is over. Ugh.
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4:=bored.png,What is <i>wrong</i> with you, Vriska? How tasteless.
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;5:=confused.png,I'm glad the explosions haven't... um... shown your panties... or your... I don't know enough nautical terminology to figure out what you'd call it...
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;2:=bored.png,I'm glad you're still going slow, Ochako.
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,I'm going to assume you'll be keeping the gun...
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;4:=bored.png,Aimee, I'll even help you undress if you just... stop shooting. Please. For goodness sakes.
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;4&saidmarker;null_possess:=confident.png,I'm so proud of you, Nayru! I know this isn't easy, but you're sticking with it! That's wonderful!
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1:=confused.png,I'm starting to think that dice of yours is definitely the host of an akuma... Master Fuu wouldn't have trusted a Miraculous to... Er... Someone like <i>you</i>.
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1:=bored.png,I'm really starting to wonder if your dice is just an akuma target and I'm a big idiot for not noticing sooner.
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;6:=bored.png,I'm still mad you added extra layers, but I suppose I'm not exactly exempt from that...
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;ann&stage;6:=confused.png,Is your hair natural? I've heard you're a quarter American, but...
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;3:=bored.png,It looks like Moon isn’t possessed by an akuma… She’s just kind of like this?
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;5:=calm.png,It’s okay Nagisa. Sometimes, the people you meet in passing, you get to know far better than you might think.
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;5:=excited.png,Wow Nagisa! You’re really giving it your all now, aren’t you?
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;5:,marker:marinette_ricebun=embarrassed.png,I-I’d offer to let you borrow my bra, if it wasn’t against the rules, we seem like we’re the same size...
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;0:=calm.png,It's a bit vintage but I like the way your outfit comes together.
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kimberly&stage;0:=calm.png,Kimberly, how does your morpher work? You changed out of your costume so fast!
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kyoko&stage;0:=confident.png,Kyoko, I like your outfit!
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;mei&stage;3:=confident.png,Mei, after this, can you tutor me in Mandarin?
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;mercy&stage;1:=calm.png,Mercy, I can tell by your accent that you’re Swiss, right? My family uses only the best Swiss chocolate in their baking!
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;revy&stage;0:=confused.png,Must you be so rude and vulgar, Revy?
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;0:=confused.png,Natsuki, if you're going to be upset, it might be best not to play... I'd hate for you to get Akumatized...
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Nayru again? I just <i>love</i> your look! Um. Not that you're looking at me. Or at anyone.
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;2:=wink.png,No need to get worried, Nagisa! I’m right here with you. And friends make it better, right? Or...Um, more tolerable.
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;2:=confident.png,It’s alright, Nagisa. I can definitely tell you’re playing better than last round!
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;weiss&stage;0:=bored.png,No, not particularly. I think I have to just treat you with the Chloe protocol...Assume your bad behavior on its own isn’t enough stress to Akumatize you…
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Now you’re definitely not wearing a superhero costume...
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;neo&stage;4:=bored.png,Oh goodness, you don’t even need an akuma, you have a really vicious aura about you…
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;2:=confused.png,Oh! You worked for REVOCs, right?
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;4:=confused.png,Oh! You've been very self-conscious about this, have you been padding--
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;0:=confident.png,Oh, who was your little friend, Shimakaze?
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6b:=wink.png,Oh, you're going to undress <i>again</i>? Playing by the rules is so, so challenging, isn't it, Vriska?
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;ann&stage;0:=excited.png,Ohmygosh, Ann Takamaki!? The model from Japan? We have so much in common!
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;3:=calm.png,Okay, I’ve heard you on TV. Are you that <i>actually</i> that famous japanese runner? Miki Makimura?
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;1:=calm.png,Okay, so no, what’s next?
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;6:=alarmed.png,O-oh no, this'll hit all of your exposed skin!
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;launch&stage;1:=alarmed.png,Please don't sneeze while you have an itchy trigger finger--
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6a:=confused.png,Please tell me you're going to dry off now. I-it's kind of hard to deal with you standing there soaked. M-my innate sense of heroism means I have to care about even <i>you, Vriska</i>.
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;red&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Red! You’re getting really…
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;0:,marker:samusplaying=wink.png,Samus Aran? I’ve heard of you!
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;1:=excited.png,Samus, my powers are kind of similar to yours! I suit up and then have to build my own powerups each time.
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;2:=confident.png,Sayaka, what's a familiar? Is it like an akuma?
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;0:,marker:seiplaying=bored.png,Sei... Asagiri. Asthagiri? Hmm... I can't tell if that's a Japanese or Indian name.
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;0:,marker:seiplaying=confident.png,So, you're another hero! Just... one of the drunker ones, it seems.
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;seven&stage;0:,marker:sevenplaying=bored.png,Seven of Nine? I’m sorry, did something get translated wrong? Sept de Neuf? Mme. Neuf?
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;3:=confident.png,Sheena, you're a summoner, right? Maybe you can help improve my bond with Tikki!
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shego&stage;1:=calm.png,Shego, you should really give up and join the forces of good! You're much to smart to help out... That bad guy you help.
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Sirens are… Kind of magical? Sort of?
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;videl&stage;3:=confident.png,So Videl, it's a shame you're losing but I guess...
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;1:=calm.png,So you and ~player~ came here together...?
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;3:=confused.png,So you can... teleport? Are you sure you don't have some sort of guardian spirit? Wait, his name is Booker? What's a Booker?
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3:=wink.png,So, are you going to stop cheating, Vriska? Maybe you'll pick something tasteful this time?
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,So, did you pick that outfit for yourself? Tikki more or less picked mine for me, but I'm pretty happy with it... usually.
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,So, now that you’re taking off… Um, the rest of your suit, are you going to tell me-- Er, us, the story?
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;5:=bored.png,So, Saki, what would you like to do after this? I have a few ideas, if you'd like!
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;5:,marker:saki_date=excited.png,(She's sure looking at ~player~ a lot...) H-hey! ~player~! A-are you enjoying Saki undressing!
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;5:,marker:saki_date=excited.png,(~player~ and Saki are looking at each other a lot...) Hmm. ~player~, do you think you'd take Saki out on a date after this?
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;0:=confused.png,So, you’re <i>actually</i> some kind of fairy?
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;1:=confident.png,So... Nayru, can you rewind time? My Miraculous lets me do that!
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sola&stage;2:=calm.png,Sola, I really like your hair! What a cool color!
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;navi&stage;0:=calm.png,Soo... Navi, what's with your light?
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;dawn&stage;0:=confident.png,Sorry about that Dawn, girls with blue hair need to stick together!
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;1:=wink.png,That sweater looks pretty comfortable. And I like the color!
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;lyn&stage;0:,marker:lynplaying=excited.png,That’s a nice sword, but is it a Miraculous or is it possessed by an Akuma?
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;zizou&stage;0:=confident.png,That’s a really cool hat, Zizou!
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;daisy&stage;3:=confident.png,That’s clever, Daisy! Got it! So, if you get too rattled, Daisy, I’ll break your crown!
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;4&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=alarmed.png,The akuma! It's got Nayru's--
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;7:=excited.png,The good news, Vriska, is that we could basically see everything so why don't you--
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;7:=calm.png,You know, Vriska, we've already seen your chest, so, really, you could just--
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch&stage;5:=confident.png,The good stuff? Sure! Wait, you aren’t showing the good stuff already?
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,This is why I don't like to wear skirts...
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,You know, I think a skirt looks good on you, but I find pencil skirts really impractical...
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;0:=confident.png,Tikki is telling me you're an oracle, Nayru! What does that mean, though? (Your dress is also <i>super</i> chic!)
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;0:,marker:elaine_puns=confused.png,Ugh, puns. Always the puns.
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;0:=confused.png,You know the dealer, Elaine!?
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;weiss&stage;2:=confused.png,Uh, no, Weiss. Not quite. You’re flaunting your riches.
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Uhm. Sei, you’ve never gone mad with power, right?
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;3:=confused.png,Uhm. With the way things are going, I can see this getting very dangerous when you run out of clothes.
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;3:=confident.png,Okay. Surely you'll part with that incredibly dangerous weapon now, right?
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Um, Lilith, I think your tattoos are really cool!
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;7:=embarrassed.png,Um. I kind of saw a hint of... wour yorking with. You're working with! I-I um.
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,Um... Chun-li, I really don't want to be annoying or overly fangirl...
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Um... I know this is kind of a serious game, Chun-li, but...
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,I know this game is kind of... well, fun it's-- it's fun, but um--
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;launch&stage;7:=embarrassed.png,Um... part of me is curious to see if... you know...
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,Um...Scarlet Witch, that outfit looks… Very… Um. Everyone can almost see your…
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;0:=bored.png,U-uhm. I know you aren't here for the best reasons...
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,U-uhm. I-if it’s for you--oooour value of the <i>international superhero community</i>...
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;4:=confused.png,U-um. Do you mean that we're cheating somehow, Elaine?
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;6&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=alarmed.png,Veran, please don't destroy any more of Nayru's clothes... she might have a very embarrassing time walking home, and once you're out of energy...
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;4:=confident.png,Wait! I remembered the magic words!
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;amy_rose&stage;0:=confused.png,Wait, Amy, are you using the hedgehog Miraculous?
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;0:=alarmed.png,Wait, I think I’ve seen a statue of you. Are you really Palutena?
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;neo&stage;1:=calm.png,Wait, your name is Neopolitan... like the ice cream, or the Italian area? Do you just not speak a language with us?
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;mei&stage;1:=excited.png,Wait, you're Mei Ling, the famous climatologist?
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;meg&stage;5:=wink.png,What does a slasher even do? Reduce prices? Not that scary!
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;lux&stage;4:=confused.png,What's your kwami like, Lux? It must be nice to have so much extra armor over your suit...
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;ann&stage;4:=excited.png,While you're here, we could stop by my parents'?
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika&stage;0:=excited.png,Whoa! You’ve got such a positive spirit, Mika!
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;2:,marker:bodysuit=alarmed.png,Whoa, Gwen, your suit? L-like, the whole thing?
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;0:=wink.png,Whoa, Uravity, you, well, manipulate gravity?
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;z03y&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,Why do I get the feeling you have an... er... intense understanding of the French Revolution?
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;2:=wink.png,Wings always seem really complicated when other heroes use them.
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;0:,marker:d.vaplaying=excited.png,Wow! D.Va! I’m normally a fighting game person but everyone knows who you are!

2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;lyn&stage;4:=excited.png,Wow, where are you from?
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;red&stage;4:=alarmed.png,W-wait, it can talk? Is this like Robustus?
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shego&stage;0:=alarmed.png,W-wait, you're Shego, right? Don't you willingly serve evil?
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;buffy&stage;0:=calm.png,W-well you did say you'd done this before. And you seem really worth getting to know.
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;buffy&stage;0:=excited.png,Hmm... Being a Slayer sounds like you could really benefit from a Miraculous...
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;6&saidmarker;null_possess:=embarrassed.png,W-well, from one magical person to another, I suppose it could be worse. You could've been Akumatized or something!
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;6:=alarmed.png,W-well, Gwen, looks like lit’s lour… looks like it’s your… Um...
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,W-well, I hope that your husband knows you're here... I-I really wouldn't want to stare-- N-not that I'm staring!

2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,W-what's next, Chun-li? Um. Hm.
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika&stage;1:=bored.png,Yikes, and I was worried about losing my costume…
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sayori&stage;0:=confident.png,You and ~player~ seem to know each other really well, Sayori! I hope this is exciting but not embarrassing for you! Um. If it is, don't hesitate to leave!
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;ann&stage;3:=calm.png,You definitely strike me as someone who finds a good balance between hero and renegade.
2-female_must_strip,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=confused.png,You have to be working for Hawk Moth, Zone-tan. Your lust for ~name~... And everyone else is... unnatural.
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;april&stage;1:=calm.png,You know, April, my friend Alya also reports on animal-themed superheroes…
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;arwen&stage;3:=confident.png,You know, Arwen, I really meant it. You were a big inspiration... You come from such a diverse background...
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;felicia&stage;1:=confused.png,You know, I bet some people get really turned on by the whole shaving thing...
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;3:=confident.png,You know, I do have to say I really appreciate the work the police do. I don’t stop criminals of the... normal variety.
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,You know, I feel like it’s a bit rude...
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;6:=calm.png,You know, I have to kind of grapple my way around Paris… (I should try and distract Ochako a little...)
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;red&stage;0:=confused.png,You know, I heard they let people bring weapons to the game… I was a bit surprised...
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika&stage;2:=excited.png,You know, I’m always interested in picking up new fighting techniques…
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;0:=confident.png,You know, Lilith, are the Sirens a band?
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale&stage;0:=confident.png,You know, Trainer, I’m actually in pretty good shape!
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;0:=alarmed.png,You know, without my costume, I feel a bit threatened by something that big.
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;0:=bored.png,I don't really like guns.
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;0:=confident.png,You say you’re not human originally…What were you?
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;0:=excited.png,You seem smart, Annie!
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;0:=confused.png,You sound really familiar, Shantae…
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;2:=wink.png,You speak French too, so it's not that much of a stretch! But it's a bit of a faux pas to use your names and powers at the same time, oui?
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;6:=bored.png,You think love triangles are hard?
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;4:=excited.png,You’re pretty different from the others. More sarcastic than Nino, smarter than Chloe, cuter than Alyx...
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;1:=confident.png,You’re worth lots, Nagisa. Don’t lose heart, everyone can enjoy time with friends!
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Are you in surry to hemove your rocks? Er. A hurry to remove your socks, Nagisa?
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;1:,marker:nagisa_time_travel=calm.png,Hmm… Tarou Urashima… That’s the story about the time traveler… But why would that make you ahead…?
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;yang&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,You're not one for high fashion, are you?
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;7:=alarmed.png,You're so eager to get naked!
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;5&saidmarker;null_possess:=wink.png,You're so gracious, Nayru! I-I wish I were more like you. I'd be a sputtering mess in your place...
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shego&stage;3:=confused.png,Y-you really don't know when to quit, do you, Shego? I'm really not enjoying this game you're making the heroes play!

2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;florina:=alarmed.png,Aimee, how can you scare a sweet and innocent person like Florina? Won’t you think of her?
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;aimee&stage;1-7:=alarmed.png,Between Aimee and Shimakaze, I can see why Tikki wanted me to come here! This is all terribly unsafe!

2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;3:,count-role;other&character;lyn:=confused.png,Hm. You and Lyn both come from the same place, right? Are the Sacean Plains the fashionable part of the world?
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;marceline&stage;0:,count-role;other&character;d.va&stage;1-2:=confused.png,Huh? Bubblegum? Don’t you usually chew that? What does that have to do with Marceline? Does she have a rubber or bubble based akuma power?

2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;weiss:,count-role;other&character;aimee&stage;0:=wink.png,I guess she’s just less attached to her weapon, Aimee. You know, like a reasonable person.
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;3:,count-role;other&character;rinkah:=confused.png,I hope that wasn’t an insulting statement earlier...Red eyes and pale hair are very unusual where I’m from...

I feel like that would be a cool power...Because if it’s limited, you don’t use it for bad purposes!
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;weiss&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;yang:=embarrassed.png,Sorry if I was a bit rude earlier, you and Yang together capture the least favorite parts of my least favorite person.
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;4:,count-role;other&character;rinkah:=embarrassed.png,S-sorry for my earlier comment, the two of you do look kind of similar. And Rinkah’s from the Flame Tribe…
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;lyn&stage;0:,count-role;other&character;florina:=excited.png,That’s a nice sword, but is it a Miraculous or--Oh! I suppose if Florina knows about it, it’s definitely something like that!

3-male_must_strip,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;0:,count-role;other&character;palutena:=embarrassed.png,Palutena! We should be nice to Pit! He should take off as much as he's comfortable with.
3-male_must_strip,count-american&role;target&stage;3:=wink.png,Americans are always pretty brash and loud. Even when you’re getting undressed. I-It’s not a bad thing, it’s just very different!
3-male_must_strip,count-avengers&role;target&stage;2:=wink.png,I sure hope you avenge the last couple hands I've played, ~name~.
3-male_must_strip,count-avengers&role;target&stage;2:=confident.png,Oh! Are you that famous Avenger, ~name~? I'm kind of glad France usually just has street-level heroes like me. But to go on big adventures... Ah, that sounds magical!

3-male_must_strip,count-hispanic&role;target&stage;2:=confident.png,I'm glad <i>French</i> stayed close to its Latin roots. But I'm glad I kinda get what you're saying, ~name~. Spanish accents are cool, too.
3-male_must_strip,count-japanese&role;target&stage;2:=wink.png,Kwami sounds awfully close to kami, don’t you think, ~name~? For spirits that inhabit objects... like... the one you’re taking off now...

3-male_must_strip,count-kalos&role;target&stage;2:=wink.png,You know, the Kalos region and France get conflated a lot! And I can't say it's a terrible comparison!

3-male_must_strip,count-mixed_heritage&role;target&stage;2:=confused.png,Being mixed can be so complicated, huh, ~name~? But I'm happy I get to be French and Chinese without having to be to much of one or the other. How do you feel about it?
3-male_must_strip,count-phantom_thieves&role;target&stage;2:=wink.png,Don't worry, ~name~, I won't take your heart. That's your job, isn't it? Well, unless you get Akumatized. Say, don't suppose you need another member of your team?
3-male_must_strip,count-phantom_thieves&role;target&stage;2:=wink.png,If I were you, I'd skip the calling cards and go right to the de-akumtizing, ~name~.
3-male_must_strip,count-scottish&role;target&stage;2:=wink.png,Is that a <i>Scottish</i> accent, ~name~? I have to say, I'm a big fan of your magic and runes! (The whiskey isn't bad either, but that's between us.)

3-male_must_strip,count-teen_titans&role;target&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,~name~, if you're a Teen Titan, this Inventory situation has to be really dangerous! I wish I hadn't detransformed already!
3-male_must_strip,count-teen_titans&role;target&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=confused.png,T-this is a joke, right? Zone-tan's just filiming some <i>premium video content</i> and I walked on set. Ha, ha. Very funny. I can go now, right? Er-- r-right?
3-male_must_strip,count-ua_academy&role;target&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Are you from UA Academy, by any chance, ~name~? I heard that's a school to train you to fight villains! I sure wish I'd have those kinds of lessons...
3-male_must_strip,count-ua_academy&role;target&stage;2:=bored.png,Oh! You're from UA Academy, right, ~name~? My master thinks your school doesn't take a holistic enough approach...

3-female_human_must_strip=confident.png,There’s nothing to be embarrassed about, ~name~.
3-female_human_must_strip=confused.png,Okay, it’s ~name~’s turn, but I still think the Dealer is the villain here...
3-female_human_must_strip=excited.png,W-well, it looks like my identity’s not so secret, so I guess it’s your turn?
3-female_human_must_strip=calm.png,I think I get the idea of the game, looks like it’s ~name~’s turn.
3-female_human_must_strip,count-role;other&character;weiss&stage;7:=embarrassed.png,Um...I have my doubts that would make you happier, Weiss. (But it might make some of us…)

3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;pearl&stage;2:=excited.png,A chiffon! I would love to talk more about that with you! Such an underused choice of garment!
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,A dango bra? That would be like me wearing something with cinnamon rolls on it... Or cake?

3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;0:=calm.png,Aimee... I can't quite place your accent... But you sound... American?
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;0:=calm.png,Oh, of course you'll give up the gun first. Then you'll take off the bands one by one.
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;1:=calm.png,Amalia, do you have some sort of Miraculous?
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;1:=wink.png,Hmm... Amalia, I have a feeling you use a Miraculous too, don't you?
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kim&stage;0:,marker:kim_similar=excited.png,An athletic superhero who has to balance her academic life...With great fashion sense! You seem awfully familiar…

3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;0:=excited.png,Aww, come on, Daria. If you're such a sour sport, you'll get Akumatized.
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;5:=wink.png,Based on the way you're playing, Amalia...

3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;4:=confident.png,Don’t worry, Palutena. Even if you do get embarrassed, I can de-Akumatize you really quickly. I mean, I’d have to. A god with akuma powers would be really scary...Especially someone as powerful as you!
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;4:=confident.png,Even if you’re a goddess, you’re still in this Palutena, and I won’t go easy on you!

3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;red&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Er. My yo-yo is most ly used to disarm people…
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:=confused.png,Er... I guess you didn't transform as much as shot off your clothes.
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;chiaki&stage;0:=bored.png,Er... I know your type, Chiaki. Do you get really embarrassed when you lose?
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;6:=wink.png,Er... If you come to Paris I can definitely get you some new clothes as it seems like you're rubbing out.
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;erufuda&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Er... I'm glad you're so fascinated with um... one aspect of French cuisine, Erufuda, but there's more to it than just fries!

3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,Erk, sorry Nagisa. But at least you’re experiencing something new?
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;4:,marker:bun_puns=excited.png,Nagisa, I can smell the bakery on you!
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;felicia&stage;0:=confused.png,Err... N-not really the kitty I normally work with...
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;6:=alarmed.png,Er-Well. Um. I-
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;6:=embarrassed.png,I-Um. Okay! Something!

3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;7:=wink.png,Florina… Florina… Hey, Florina… It’s your turn...
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;3:=bored.png,For such elaborate armor and such a striking appearance, I have to say your attire... Uhm. Isn't quite as interesting.
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;6:=embarrassed.png,Gah! Elaine! You shouldn't threaten the dealer like that!
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;6:=confused.png,I know he's kind of shifty, but you shouldn't threaten the dealer, Elaine!
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;0:=bored.png,GoGo Tomago? Didn’t your friend just buy you equipment for your powers?
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;1:=excited.png,Great! I know you're quite a skilled warrior, and you definitely don't seem to be having a crisis of confidence.
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Y-you know. I really hope this isn't a tactical maneuver to get at my Miraculous... Hawk Moth's tried that a few times...
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;0:=confused.png,Hey Saki, you look a little tired. Is everything okay?
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;0:=bored.png,Saki, are you doing okay?
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;himeko&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,H-hey! Calm down, Sailor Psycho! This is supposed to be fun!

3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;3:=confused.png,W-who is Esteban and why would he put you up to this?
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;3:=bored.png,Elena! I at least joined this because I was worried about Hawk Moth... I'll take this Esteban down, I promise!
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;1:=confident.png,Hmm, okay, so you aren’t a swordswoman. Do you manipulate time? Maybe… You have a thing for girls with pink hair?
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;jane&stage;0:=confident.png,Hmm, that’s really well worn! Is it an Agreste?
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sanako&stage;1:=confused.png,Hmm... (I think Sanako knows something I don't...)
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;alpha&stage;0:,marker:alphaplaying=confused.png,Hmm... So you're digital? As in you aren't real?
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;2:=excited.png,Hmm... You know, I'm not an armorer... But I can see some... Stylistic... Improvements I could make.
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;2:=confused.png,Is all armor from... Hmm... Is it all so complicated?
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;pearl&stage;1:=confused.png,Hmm... You seem a bit... unusual, Pearl.

3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;3:=confident.png,Hmm...I don’t think anyone will laugh, Nagisa. And that’s a really clever idea!
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;1:=wink.png,Hmm...Palutena, you’re a little bit of a trickster, aren’t you? I bet you and Tikki would get along.
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Hmm… Is this to psyche us out, or to distract us?
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;navi&stage;1:=confused.png,Huh. You know, I've never seen Tikki wear clothes...
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;2:=excited.png,I <i>do</i> really like your clothes. They're so nautical and streamlined! I bet you like to go really fast, huh, Shimakaze?
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kimberly&stage;1:=confident.png,I <i>love</i> your whole aesthetic. To be honest, I think I'd just be giving too much away if I were polka-dotted all the time though.
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;2:=calm.png,I actually think we’d have gotten along well in high school, Daria.
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;mercy&stage;3:=wink.png,I bet Medicens Sans Frontieres would really benefit with you as its face, should Overwatch ever be too much, Mercy.

3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;4:=confused.png,I don't really drink but... Wow, those look tasty.
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,I fight a villain who has… I guess in your terms a Quirk…
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;0:=confident.png,I guess you're not <i>so</i> lucky after all, Vriska!
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;1:=wink.png,I have to say, I kind of like your outfit better, Sayaka!
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;navi&stage;2:=confident.png,I liked your flower, Navi!
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;yang&stage;0:,marker:yangplaying=confident.png,I only hope your fighting style is as over-developed as the rest of you.
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;4:=confident.png,I really admire someone who can wear a skirt. I'm... really not a dress type of girl.
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;tracer&stage;3:=wink.png,I see London, I’ve seen France...
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;7:=calm.png,I tend to like more natural looks.
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;5&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=bored.png,I think I get it. You aren't an akuma, even if you're kind of a jerk, huh, Veran? You're sort of like Nayru's Kwami, aren't you?
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;1:=excited.png,I think there's probably a Songbird miraculous to go with your locket! It seems like it's a good fit for you, for some reason, Elizabeth!
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;raven&stage;3:=confident.png,I think we have a lot in common, Raven!
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;2:=wink.png,I thought mercenary-types regularly played cards in seedy bars. A-are you just throwing?
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale&stage;1:=calm.png,I wish my teachers were patient like you, Trainer.
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,I’m amazed you keep those gloves so pristine! Given your, um, personality, Kyu.
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sayla&stage;2:=confident.png,I’ve never seen a military outfit like that one before, Sayla. I like it, it’s very bright! Judging by your attitude, you’re bright as well!
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;2:=excited.png,If her mech weren’t just technology, I could be convinced that D.Va is Hana’s superhero identity.
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,If it makes you feel better, I think it's a pretty skirt.
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,I-I know this is kind of an odd way to meet, Chun-li, but I want you to know you were a huge inspiration to me when I started hero-ing!
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;0:=alarmed.png,I know this is an odd meet to way-- way to meet but hero you're my Chun-li! An inspiration! G-gah!
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;0:,marker:florinaplaying=embarrassed.png,I-I like your hair, Florina!
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,I-I'd rather not delve into insults, Elaine!
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Um... Could we maybe speak in French instead of Spanish, Elaine?
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,I-I'm a little worried about the continued gunplay, Aimee.
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:=bored.png,Aimee, this is getting really dangerous. Without clothes or armor...
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;videl&stage;0:=wink.png,I'll just say it, the clothes are coming off.
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;3:=bored.png,I'm actually starting to enjoy the fireworks. I'm sorry your stuff's being damaged though...
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4:=confused.png,I'm glad <i>this</i> tasteless display is over. Ugh.
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4:=bored.png,What is <i>wrong</i> with you, Vriska? How tasteless.
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;5:=confused.png,I'm glad the explosions haven't... um... shown your panties... or your... I don't know enough nautical terminology to figure out what you'd call it...
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;2:=bored.png,I'm glad you're still going slow, Ochako.
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,I'm going to assume you'll be keeping the gun...
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;4:=bored.png,Aimee, I'll even help you undress if you just... stop shooting. Please. For goodness sakes.
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;4&saidmarker;null_possess:=confident.png,I'm so proud of you, Nayru! I know this isn't easy, but you're sticking with it! That's wonderful!
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1:=confused.png,I'm starting to think that dice of yours is definitely the host of an akuma... Master Fuu wouldn't have trusted a Miraculous to... Er... Someone like <i>you</i>.
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1:=bored.png,I'm really starting to wonder if your dice is just an akuma target and I'm a big idiot for not noticing sooner.
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;6:=bored.png,I'm still mad you added extra layers, but I suppose I'm not exactly exempt from that...
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;ann&stage;6:=confused.png,Is your hair natural? I've heard you're a quarter American, but...
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;3:=bored.png,It looks like Moon isn’t possessed by an akuma… She’s just kind of like this?
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;5:=calm.png,It’s okay Nagisa. Sometimes, the people you meet in passing, you get to know far better than you might think.
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;5:=excited.png,Wow Nagisa! You’re really giving it your all now, aren’t you?
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;5:,marker:marinette_ricebun=embarrassed.png,I-I’d offer to let you borrow my bra, if it wasn’t against the rules, we seem like we’re the same size...
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;0:=calm.png,It's a bit vintage but I like the way your outfit comes together.
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kimberly&stage;0:=calm.png,Kimberly, how does your morpher work? You changed out of your costume so fast!
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kyoko&stage;0:=confident.png,Kyoko, I like your outfit!
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;mei&stage;3:=confident.png,Mei, after this, can you tutor me in Mandarin?
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;mercy&stage;1:=calm.png,Mercy, I can tell by your accent that you’re Swiss, right? My family uses only the best Swiss chocolate in their baking!
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;revy&stage;0:=confused.png,Must you be so rude and vulgar, Revy?
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;0:=confused.png,Natsuki, if you're going to be upset, it might be best not to play... I'd hate for you to get Akumatized...
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Nayru again? I just <i>love</i> your look! Um. Not that you're looking at me. Or at anyone.
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;2:=wink.png,No need to get worried, Nagisa! I’m right here with you. And friends make it better, right? Or...Um, more tolerable.
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;2:=confident.png,It’s alright, Nagisa. I can definitely tell you’re playing better than last round!
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;weiss&stage;0:=bored.png,No, not particularly. I think I have to just treat you with the Chloe protocol...Assume your bad behavior on its own isn’t enough stress to Akumatize you…
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Now you’re definitely not wearing a superhero costume...
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;neo&stage;4:=bored.png,Oh goodness, you don’t even need an akuma, you have a really vicious aura about you…
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;2:=confused.png,Oh! You worked for REVOCs, right?
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;4:=confused.png,Oh! You've been very self-conscious about this, have you been padding--
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;0:=confident.png,Oh, who was your little friend, Shimakaze?
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6b:=wink.png,Oh, you're going to undress <i>again</i>? Playing by the rules is so, so challenging, isn't it, Vriska?
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;ann&stage;0:=excited.png,Ohmygosh, Ann Takamaki!? The model from Japan? We have so much in common!
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;3:=calm.png,Okay, I’ve heard you on TV. Are you that <i>actually</i> that famous japanese runner? Miki Makimura?
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;1:=calm.png,Okay, so no, what’s next?
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;6:=alarmed.png,O-oh no, this'll hit all of your exposed skin!
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;launch&stage;1:=alarmed.png,Please don't sneeze while you have an itchy trigger finger--
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6a:=confused.png,Please tell me you're going to dry off now. I-it's kind of hard to deal with you standing there soaked. M-my innate sense of heroism means I have to care about even <i>you, Vriska</i>.
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;red&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Red! You’re getting really…
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;0:,marker:samusplaying=wink.png,Samus Aran? I’ve heard of you!
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;1:=excited.png,Samus, my powers are kind of similar to yours! I suit up and then have to build my own powerups each time.
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;2:=confident.png,Sayaka, what's a familiar? Is it like an akuma?
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;0:,marker:seiplaying=bored.png,Sei... Asagiri. Asthagiri? Hmm... I can't tell if that's a Japanese or Indian name.
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;0:,marker:seiplaying=confident.png,So, you're another hero! Just... one of the drunker ones, it seems.
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;seven&stage;0:,marker:sevenplaying=bored.png,Seven of Nine? I’m sorry, did something get translated wrong? Sept de Neuf? Mme. Neuf?
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;3:=confident.png,Sheena, you're a summoner, right? Maybe you can help improve my bond with Tikki!
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shego&stage;1:=calm.png,Shego, you should really give up and join the forces of good! You're much to smart to help out... That bad guy you help.
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Sirens are… Kind of magical? Sort of?
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;videl&stage;3:=confident.png,So Videl, it's a shame you're losing but I guess...
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;1:=calm.png,So you and ~player~ came here together...?
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;3:=confused.png,So you can... teleport? Are you sure you don't have some sort of guardian spirit? Wait, his name is Booker? What's a Booker?
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3:=wink.png,So, are you going to stop cheating, Vriska? Maybe you'll pick something tasteful this time?
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,So, did you pick that outfit for yourself? Tikki more or less picked mine for me, but I'm pretty happy with it... usually.
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,So, now that you’re taking off… Um, the rest of your suit, are you going to tell me-- Er, us, the story?
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;5:=bored.png,So, Saki, what would you like to do after this? I have a few ideas, if you'd like!
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;5:,marker:saki_date=excited.png,(She's sure looking at ~player~ a lot...) H-hey! ~player~! A-are you enjoying Saki undressing!
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;5:,marker:saki_date=excited.png,(~player~ and Saki are looking at each other a lot...) Hmm. ~player~, do you think you'd take Saki out on a date after this?
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;0:=confused.png,So, you’re <i>actually</i> some kind of fairy?
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;1:=confident.png,So... Nayru, can you rewind time? My Miraculous lets me do that!
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sola&stage;2:=calm.png,Sola, I really like your hair! What a cool color!
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;navi&stage;0:=calm.png,Soo... Navi, what's with your light?
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;dawn&stage;0:=confident.png,Sorry about that Dawn, girls with blue hair need to stick together!
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;1:=wink.png,That sweater looks pretty comfortable. And I like the color!
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;lyn&stage;0:,marker:lynplaying=excited.png,That’s a nice sword, but is it a Miraculous or is it possessed by an Akuma?
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;zizou&stage;0:=confident.png,That’s a really cool hat, Zizou!
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;daisy&stage;3:=confident.png,That’s clever, Daisy! Got it! So, if you get too rattled, Daisy, I’ll break your crown!
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;4&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=alarmed.png,The akuma! It's got Nayru's--
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;7:=excited.png,The good news, Vriska, is that we could basically see everything so why don't you--
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;7:=calm.png,You know, Vriska, we've already seen your chest, so, really, you could just--
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch&stage;5:=confident.png,The good stuff? Sure! Wait, you aren’t showing the good stuff already?
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,This is why I don't like to wear skirts...
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,You know, I think a skirt looks good on you, but I find pencil skirts really impractical...
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;0:=confident.png,Tikki is telling me you're an oracle, Nayru! What does that mean, though? (Your dress is also <i>super</i> chic!)
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;0:,marker:elaine_puns=confused.png,Ugh, puns. Always the puns.
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;0:=confused.png,You know the dealer, Elaine!?
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;weiss&stage;2:=confused.png,Uh, no, Weiss. Not quite. You’re flaunting your riches.
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Uhm. Sei, you’ve never gone mad with power, right?
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;3:=confused.png,Uhm. With the way things are going, I can see this getting very dangerous when you run out of clothes.
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;3:=confident.png,Okay. Surely you'll part with that incredibly dangerous weapon now, right?
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Um, Lilith, I think your tattoos are really cool!
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;7:=embarrassed.png,Um. I kind of saw a hint of... wour yorking with. You're working with! I-I um.
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,Um... Chun-li, I really don't want to be annoying or overly fangirl...
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Um... I know this is kind of a serious game, Chun-li, but...
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,I know this game is kind of... well, fun it's-- it's fun, but um--
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;launch&stage;7:=embarrassed.png,Um... part of me is curious to see if... you know...
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,Um...Scarlet Witch, that outfit looks… Very… Um. Everyone can almost see your…
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;0:=bored.png,U-uhm. I know you aren't here for the best reasons...
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,U-uhm. I-if it’s for you--oooour value of the <i>international superhero community</i>...
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;4:=confused.png,U-um. Do you mean that we're cheating somehow, Elaine?
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;6&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=alarmed.png,Veran, please don't destroy any more of Nayru's clothes... she might have a very embarrassing time walking home, and once you're out of energy...
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;4:=confident.png,Wait! I remembered the magic words!
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;amy_rose&stage;0:=confused.png,Wait, Amy, are you using the hedgehog Miraculous?
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;0:=alarmed.png,Wait, I think I’ve seen a statue of you. Are you really Palutena?
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;neo&stage;1:=calm.png,Wait, your name is Neopolitan... like the ice cream, or the Italian area? Do you just not speak a language with us?
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;mei&stage;1:=excited.png,Wait, you're Mei Ling, the famous climatologist?
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;meg&stage;5:=wink.png,What does a slasher even do? Reduce prices? Not that scary!
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;lux&stage;4:=confused.png,What's your kwami like, Lux? It must be nice to have so much extra armor over your suit...
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;ann&stage;4:=excited.png,While you're here, we could stop by my parents'?
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika&stage;0:=excited.png,Whoa! You’ve got such a positive spirit, Mika!
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;2:,marker:bodysuit=alarmed.png,Whoa, Gwen, your suit? L-like, the whole thing?
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;0:=wink.png,Whoa, Uravity, you, well, manipulate gravity?
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;z03y&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,Why do I get the feeling you have an... er... intense understanding of the French Revolution?
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;2:=wink.png,Wings always seem really complicated when other heroes use them.
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;0:,marker:d.vaplaying=excited.png,Wow! D.Va! I’m normally a fighting game person but everyone knows who you are!
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;dark_magician_girl&stage;0:=excited.png,Wow! I love your fashion sense...
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&timeinstage;6:=excited.png,Wow, ~name~, you haven’t gone in a while. You’re really playing well!
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;asuna&stage;4:=alarmed.png,Wow, Asuna! You have so much enchanted equipment!
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;lyn&stage;4:=excited.png,Wow, where are you from?
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;red&stage;4:=alarmed.png,W-wait, it can talk? Is this like Robustus?
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shego&stage;0:=alarmed.png,W-wait, you're Shego, right? Don't you willingly serve evil?
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;buffy&stage;0:=calm.png,W-well you did say you'd done this before. And you seem really worth getting to know.
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;buffy&stage;0:=excited.png,Hmm... Being a Slayer sounds like you could really benefit from a Miraculous...
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;6&saidmarker;null_possess:=embarrassed.png,W-well, from one magical person to another, I suppose it could be worse. You could've been Akumatized or something!
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;6:=alarmed.png,W-well, Gwen, looks like lit’s lour… looks like it’s your… Um...
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,W-well, I hope that your husband knows you're here... I-I really wouldn't want to stare-- N-not that I'm staring!
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sanako&stage;0:=confident.png,W-well, if you insist, Sanako.
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,W-what's next, Chun-li? Um. Hm.
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika&stage;1:=bored.png,Yikes, and I was worried about losing my costume…
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sayori&stage;0:=confident.png,You and ~player~ seem to know each other really well, Sayori! I hope this is exciting but not embarrassing for you! Um. If it is, don't hesitate to leave!
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;ann&stage;3:=calm.png,You definitely strike me as someone who finds a good balance between hero and renegade.
3-female_must_strip,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=confused.png,You have to be working for Hawk Moth, Zone-tan. Your lust for ~name~... And everyone else is... unnatural.
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;april&stage;1:=calm.png,You know, April, my friend Alya also reports on animal-themed superheroes…
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;arwen&stage;3:=confident.png,You know, Arwen, I really meant it. You were a big inspiration... You come from such a diverse background...
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;felicia&stage;1:=confused.png,You know, I bet some people get really turned on by the whole shaving thing...
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;3:=confident.png,You know, I do have to say I really appreciate the work the police do. I don’t stop criminals of the... normal variety.
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,You know, I feel like it’s a bit rude...
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;6:=calm.png,You know, I have to kind of grapple my way around Paris… (I should try and distract Ochako a little...)
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;red&stage;0:=confused.png,You know, I heard they let people bring weapons to the game… I was a bit surprised...
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika&stage;2:=excited.png,You know, I’m always interested in picking up new fighting techniques…
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;0:=confident.png,You know, Lilith, are the Sirens a band?
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale&stage;0:=confident.png,You know, Trainer, I’m actually in pretty good shape!
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;0:=alarmed.png,You know, without my costume, I feel a bit threatened by something that big.
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;0:=bored.png,I don't really like guns.
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;0:=confident.png,You say you’re not human originally…What were you?
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;0:=excited.png,You seem smart, Annie!
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;0:=confused.png,You sound really familiar, Shantae…
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;2:=wink.png,You speak French too, so it's not that much of a stretch! But it's a bit of a faux pas to use your names and powers at the same time, oui?
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;6:=bored.png,You think love triangles are hard?
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;4:=excited.png,You’re pretty different from the others. More sarcastic than Nino, smarter than Chloe, cuter than Alyx...
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;1:=confident.png,You’re worth lots, Nagisa. Don’t lose heart, everyone can enjoy time with friends!
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Are you in surry to hemove your rocks? Er. A hurry to remove your socks, Nagisa?
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;1:,marker:nagisa_time_travel=calm.png,Hmm… Tarou Urashima… That’s the story about the time traveler… But why would that make you ahead…?
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;yang&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,You're not one for high fashion, are you?
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;7:=alarmed.png,You're so eager to get naked!
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;5&saidmarker;null_possess:=wink.png,You're so gracious, Nayru! I-I wish I were more like you. I'd be a sputtering mess in your place...

4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;4:=confused.png,Fairy powers are so weird… Are you sure you’re not a kwami of some sort?
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;7:=wink.png,Florina… Florina… Hey, Florina… It’s your turn...
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;3:=bored.png,For such elaborate armor and such a striking appearance, I have to say your attire... Uhm. Isn't quite as interesting.
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;6:=embarrassed.png,Gah! Elaine! You shouldn't threaten the dealer like that!
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;6:=confused.png,I know he's kind of shifty, but you shouldn't threaten the dealer, Elaine!
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;0:=bored.png,GoGo Tomago? Didn’t your friend just buy you equipment for your powers?
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;1:=excited.png,Great! I know you're quite a skilled warrior, and you definitely don't seem to be having a crisis of confidence.
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Y-you know. I really hope this isn't a tactical maneuver to get at my Miraculous... Hawk Moth's tried that a few times...
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;0:=confused.png,Hey Saki, you look a little tired. Is everything okay?
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;0:=bored.png,Saki, are you doing okay?
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;himeko&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,H-hey! Calm down, Sailor Psycho! This is supposed to be fun!
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;3:=alarmed.png,Hm... That belt is really classic! I love how it tied your outfit together.
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;3:=confused.png,W-who is Esteban and why would he put you up to this?
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;3:=bored.png,Elena! I at least joined this because I was worried about Hawk Moth... I'll take this Esteban down, I promise!
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;1:=confident.png,Hmm, okay, so you aren’t a swordswoman. Do you manipulate time? Maybe… You have a thing for girls with pink hair?
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;jane&stage;0:=confident.png,Hmm, that’s really well worn! Is it an Agreste?
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sanako&stage;1:=confused.png,Hmm... (I think Sanako knows something I don't...)
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;alpha&stage;0:,marker:alphaplaying=confused.png,Hmm... So you're digital? As in you aren't real?
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;2:=excited.png,Hmm... You know, I'm not an armorer... But I can see some... Stylistic... Improvements I could make.
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;2:=confused.png,Is all armor from... Hmm... Is it all so complicated?
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;pearl&stage;1:=confused.png,Hmm... You seem a bit... unusual, Pearl.
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sharla&stage;0:=confused.png,Hmm... You seem familiar...
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;3:=confident.png,Hmm...I don’t think anyone will laugh, Nagisa. And that’s a really clever idea!
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;1:=wink.png,Hmm...Palutena, you’re a little bit of a trickster, aren’t you? I bet you and Tikki would get along.
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Hmm… Is this to psyche us out, or to distract us?
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;navi&stage;1:=confused.png,Huh. You know, I've never seen Tikki wear clothes...
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;2:=excited.png,I <i>do</i> really like your clothes. They're so nautical and streamlined! I bet you like to go really fast, huh, Shimakaze?
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kimberly&stage;1:=confident.png,I <i>love</i> your whole aesthetic. To be honest, I think I'd just be giving too much away if I were polka-dotted all the time though.
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;2:=calm.png,I actually think we’d have gotten along well in high school, Daria.
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;mercy&stage;3:=wink.png,I bet Medicens Sans Frontieres would really benefit with you as its face, should Overwatch ever be too much, Mercy.
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;juri&stage;0:=alarmed.png,I can see that you're not exactly a positive sort, are you, Juri?
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;streaming-chan&stage;4:=confused.png,I can’t tell if this is some kind of performance art, Streaming-chan…
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;4:=confused.png,I don't really drink but... Wow, those look tasty.
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,I fight a villain who has… I guess in your terms a Quirk…
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;0:=confident.png,I guess you're not <i>so</i> lucky after all, Vriska!
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;1:=wink.png,I have to say, I kind of like your outfit better, Sayaka!
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;navi&stage;2:=confident.png,I liked your flower, Navi!
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;yang&stage;0:,marker:yangplaying=confident.png,I only hope your fighting style is as over-developed as the rest of you.
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;4:=confident.png,I really admire someone who can wear a skirt. I'm... really not a dress type of girl.
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;tracer&stage;3:=wink.png,I see London, I’ve seen France...
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;7:=calm.png,I tend to like more natural looks.
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;5&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=bored.png,I think I get it. You aren't an akuma, even if you're kind of a jerk, huh, Veran? You're sort of like Nayru's Kwami, aren't you?
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;1:=excited.png,I think there's probably a Songbird miraculous to go with your locket! It seems like it's a good fit for you, for some reason, Elizabeth!
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;raven&stage;3:=confident.png,I think we have a lot in common, Raven!
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;2:=wink.png,I thought mercenary-types regularly played cards in seedy bars. A-are you just throwing?
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale&stage;1:=calm.png,I wish my teachers were patient like you, Trainer.
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,I’m amazed you keep those gloves so pristine! Given your, um, personality, Kyu.
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sayla&stage;2:=confident.png,I’ve never seen a military outfit like that one before, Sayla. I like it, it’s very bright! Judging by your attitude, you’re bright as well!
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;2:=excited.png,If her mech weren’t just technology, I could be convinced that D.Va is Hana’s superhero identity.
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,If it makes you feel better, I think it's a pretty skirt.
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,I-I know this is kind of an odd way to meet, Chun-li, but I want you to know you were a huge inspiration to me when I started hero-ing!
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;0:=alarmed.png,I know this is an odd meet to way-- way to meet but hero you're my Chun-li! An inspiration! G-gah!
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;0:,marker:florinaplaying=embarrassed.png,I-I like your hair, Florina!
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,I-I'd rather not delve into insults, Elaine!
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Um... Could we maybe speak in French instead of Spanish, Elaine?
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,I-I'm a little worried about the continued gunplay, Aimee.
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:=bored.png,Aimee, this is getting really dangerous. Without clothes or armor...
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;videl&stage;0:=wink.png,I'll just say it, the clothes are coming off.
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;3:=bored.png,I'm actually starting to enjoy the fireworks. I'm sorry your stuff's being damaged though...
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4:=confused.png,I'm glad <i>this</i> tasteless display is over. Ugh.
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4:=bored.png,What is <i>wrong</i> with you, Vriska? How tasteless.
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;5:=confused.png,I'm glad the explosions haven't... um... shown your panties... or your... I don't know enough nautical terminology to figure out what you'd call it...
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;2:=bored.png,I'm glad you're still going slow, Ochako.
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,I'm going to assume you'll be keeping the gun...
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;4:=bored.png,Aimee, I'll even help you undress if you just... stop shooting. Please. For goodness sakes.
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;4&saidmarker;null_possess:=confident.png,I'm so proud of you, Nayru! I know this isn't easy, but you're sticking with it! That's wonderful!
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1:=confused.png,I'm starting to think that dice of yours is definitely the host of an akuma... Master Fuu wouldn't have trusted a Miraculous to... Er... Someone like <i>you</i>.
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1:=bored.png,I'm really starting to wonder if your dice is just an akuma target and I'm a big idiot for not noticing sooner.
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;6:=bored.png,I'm still mad you added extra layers, but I suppose I'm not exactly exempt from that...
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;ann&stage;6:=confused.png,Is your hair natural? I've heard you're a quarter American, but...
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;3:=bored.png,It looks like Moon isn’t possessed by an Akuma… She’s just kind of like this?
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;5:=calm.png,It’s okay Nagisa. Sometimes, the people you meet in passing, you get to know far better than you might think.
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;5:=excited.png,Wow Nagisa! You’re really giving it your all now, aren’t you?
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;5:,marker:marinette_ricebun=embarrassed.png,I-I’d offer to let you borrow my bra, if it wasn’t against the rules, we seem like we’re the same size...
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;0:=calm.png,It's a bit vintage but I like the way your outfit comes together.
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kimberly&stage;0:=calm.png,Kimberly, how does your morpher work? You changed out of your costume so fast!
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kyoko&stage;0:=confident.png,Kyoko, I like your outfit!
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;mei&stage;3:=confident.png,Mei, after this, can you tutor me in Mandarin?
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;mercy&stage;1:=calm.png,Mercy, I can tell by your accent that you’re Swiss, right? My family uses only the best Swiss chocolate in their baking!
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;revy&stage;0:=confused.png,Must you be so rude and vulgar, Revy?
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;0:=confused.png,Natsuki, if you're going to be upset, it might be best not to play... I'd hate for you to get Akumatized...
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Nayru again? I just <i>love</i> your look! Um. Not that you're looking at me. Or at anyone.
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;2:=wink.png,No need to get worried, Nagisa! I’m right here with you. And friends make it better, right? Or...Um, more tolerable.
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;2:=confident.png,It’s alright, Nagisa. I can definitely tell you’re playing better than last round!
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;weiss&stage;0:=bored.png,No, not particularly. I think I have to just treat you with the Chloe protocol...Assume your bad behavior on its own isn’t enough stress to Akumatize you…
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Now you’re definitely not wearing a superhero costume...
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;neo&stage;4:=bored.png,Oh goodness, you don’t even need an akuma, you have a really vicious aura about you…
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;2:=confused.png,Oh! You worked for REVOCs, right?
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;4:=confused.png,Oh! You've been very self-conscious about this, have you been padding--
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;0:=confident.png,Oh, who was your little friend, Shimakaze?
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6b:=wink.png,Oh, you're going to undress <i>again</i>? Playing by the rules is so, so challenging, isn't it, Vriska?
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;ann&stage;0:=excited.png,Ohmygosh, Ann Takamaki!? The model from Japan? We have so much in common!
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;3:=calm.png,Okay, I’ve heard you on TV. Are you that <i>actually</i> that famous japanese runner? Miki Makimura?
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;1:=calm.png,Okay, so no, what’s next?
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;6:=alarmed.png,O-oh no, this'll hit all of your exposed skin!
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;launch&stage;1:=alarmed.png,Please don't sneeze while you have an itchy trigger finger--
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6a:=confused.png,Please tell me you're going to dry off now. I-it's kind of hard to deal with you standing there soaked. M-my innate sense of heroism means I have to care about even <i>you, Vriska</i>.
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;red&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Red! You’re getting really…
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;0:,marker:samusplaying=wink.png,Samus Aran? I’ve heard of you!
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;1:=excited.png,Samus, my powers are kind of similar to yours! I suit up and then have to build my own powerups each time.
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;2:=confident.png,Sayaka, what's a familiar? Is it like an akuma?
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;0:,marker:seiplaying=bored.png,Sei... Asagiri. Asthagiri? Hmm... I can't tell if that's a Japanese or Indian name.
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;0:,marker:seiplaying=confident.png,So, you're another hero! Just... one of the drunker ones, it seems.
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;seven&stage;0:,marker:sevenplaying=bored.png,Seven of Nine? I’m sorry, did something get translated wrong? Sept de Neuf? Mme. Neuf?
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;3:=confident.png,Sheena, you're a summoner, right? Maybe you can help improve my bond with Tikki!
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shego&stage;1:=calm.png,Shego, you should really give up and join the forces of good! You're much to smart to help out... That bad guy you help.
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Sirens are… Kind of magical? Sort of?
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;videl&stage;3:=confident.png,So Videl, it's a shame you're losing but I guess...
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;1:=calm.png,So you and ~player~ came here together...?
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;3:=confused.png,So you can... teleport? Are you sure you don't have some sort of guardian spirit? Wait, his name is Booker? What's a Booker?
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3:=wink.png,So, are you going to stop cheating, Vriska? Maybe you'll pick something tasteful this time?
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,So, did you pick that outfit for yourself? Tikki more or less picked mine for me, but I'm pretty happy with it... usually.
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,So, now that you’re taking off… Um, the rest of your suit, are you going to tell me-- Er, us, the story?
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;5:=bored.png,So, Saki, what would you like to do after this? I have a few ideas, if you'd like!
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;5:,marker:saki_date=excited.png,(She's sure looking at ~player~ a lot...) H-hey! ~player~! A-are you enjoying Saki undressing!
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;5:,marker:saki_date=excited.png,(~player~ and Saki are looking at each other a lot...) Hmm. ~player~, do you think you'd take Saki out on a date after this?
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;0:=confused.png,So, you’re <i>actually</i> some kind of fairy?
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;1:=confident.png,So... Nayru, can you rewind time? My Miraculous lets me do that!
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sola&stage;2:=calm.png,Sola, I really like your hair! What a cool color!
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;navi&stage;0:=calm.png,Soo... Navi, what's with your light?
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;dawn&stage;0:=confident.png,Sorry about that Dawn, girls with blue hair need to stick together!
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;1:=wink.png,That sweater looks pretty comfortable. And I like the color!
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;lyn&stage;0:,marker:lynplaying=excited.png,That’s a nice sword, but is it a Miraculous or is it possessed by an Akuma?
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;zizou&stage;0:=confident.png,That’s a really cool hat, Zizou!
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;daisy&stage;3:=confident.png,That’s clever, Daisy! Got it! So, if you get too rattled, Daisy, I’ll break your crown!
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;4&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=alarmed.png,The akuma! It's got Nayru's--
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;7:=excited.png,The good news, Vriska, is that we could basically see everything so why don't you--
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;7:=calm.png,You know, Vriska, we've already seen your chest, so, really, you could just--
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,The good stuff? Y-you mean...
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,This is why I don't like to wear skirts...
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,You know, I think a skirt looks good on you, but I find pencil skirts really impractical...
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;0:=confident.png,Tikki is telling me you're an oracle, Nayru! What does that mean, though? (Your dress is also <i>super</i> chic!)
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;0:,marker:elaine_puns=confused.png,Ugh, puns. Always the puns.
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;0:=confused.png,You know the dealer, Elaine!?
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;weiss&stage;2:=confused.png,Uh, no, Weiss. Not quite. You’re flaunting your riches.
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Uhm. Sei, you’ve never gone mad with power, right?
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;3:=confused.png,Uhm. With the way things are going, I can see this getting very dangerous when you run out of clothes.
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;3:=confident.png,Okay. Surely you'll part with that incredibly dangerous weapon now, right?
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Um, Lilith, I think your tattoos are really cool!
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;7:=embarrassed.png,Um. I kind of saw a hint of... wour yorking with. You're working with! I-I um.
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,Um... Chun-li, I really don't want to be annoying or overly fangirl...
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Um... I know this is kind of a serious game, Chun-li, but...
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,I know this game is kind of... well, fun it's-- it's fun, but um--
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;launch&stage;7:=embarrassed.png,Um... part of me is curious to see if... you know...
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,Um...Scarlet Witch, that outfit looks… Very… Um. Everyone can almost see your…
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;0:=bored.png,U-uhm. I know you aren't here for the best reasons...
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,U-uhm. I-if it’s for you--oooour value of the <i>international superhero community</i>...
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;4:=confused.png,U-um. Do you mean that we're cheating somehow, Elaine?
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;6&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=alarmed.png,Veran, please don't destroy any more of Nayru's clothes... she might have a very embarrassing time walking home, and once you're out of energy...
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;4:=confident.png,Wait! I remembered the magic words!
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;amy_rose&stage;0:=confused.png,Wait, Amy, are you using the hedgehog Miraculous?
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;0:=alarmed.png,Wait, I think I’ve seen a statue of you. Are you really Palutena?
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;neo&stage;1:=calm.png,Wait, your name is Neopolitan... like the ice cream, or the Italian area? Do you just not speak a language with us?
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;mei&stage;1:=excited.png,Wait, you're Mei Ling, the famous climatologist?
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;meg&stage;5:=wink.png,What does a slasher even do? Reduce prices? Not that scary!
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;lux&stage;4:=confused.png,What's your kwami like, Lux? It must be nice to have so much extra armor over your suit...

5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;6:=alarmed.png,Er-Well. Um. I-
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;6:=embarrassed.png,I-Um. Okay! Something!
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;4:=confused.png,Fairy powers are so weird… Are you sure you’re not a kwami of some sort?
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;7:=wink.png,Florina… Florina… Hey, Florina… It’s your turn...
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;3:=bored.png,For such elaborate armor and such a striking appearance, I have to say your attire... Uhm. Isn't quite as interesting.
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;6:=embarrassed.png,Gah! Elaine! You shouldn't threaten the dealer like that!
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;6:=confused.png,I know he's kind of shifty, but you shouldn't threaten the dealer, Elaine!
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;0:=bored.png,GoGo Tomago? Didn’t your friend just buy you equipment for your powers?
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;1:=excited.png,Great! I know you're quite a skilled warrior, and you definitely don't seem to be having a crisis of confidence.
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Y-you know. I really hope this isn't a tactical maneuver to get at my Miraculous... Hawk Moth's tried that a few times...
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;0:=confused.png,Hey Saki, you look a little tired. Is everything okay?
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;0:=bored.png,Saki, are you doing okay?
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;himeko&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,H-hey! Calm down, Sailor Psycho! This is supposed to be fun!
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;3:=alarmed.png,Hm... That belt is really classic! I love how it tied your outfit together.
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;3:=confused.png,W-who is Esteban and why would he put you up to this?
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;3:=bored.png,Elena! I at least joined this because I was worried about Hawk Moth... I'll take this Esteban down, I promise!
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;1:=confident.png,Hmm, okay, so you aren’t a swordswoman. Do you manipulate time? Maybe… You have a thing for girls with pink hair?
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;jane&stage;0:=confident.png,Hmm, that’s really well worn! Is it an Agreste?
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sanako&stage;1:=confused.png,Hmm... (I think Sanako knows something I don't...)
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;alpha&stage;0:,marker:alphaplaying=confused.png,Hmm... So you're digital? As in you aren't real?
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;2:=excited.png,Hmm... You know, I'm not an armorer... But I can see some... Stylistic... Improvements I could make.
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;2:=confused.png,Is all armor from... Hmm... Is it all so complicated?
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;pearl&stage;1:=confused.png,Hmm... You seem a bit... unusual, Pearl.
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sharla&stage;0:=confused.png,Hmm... You seem familiar...
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;3:=confident.png,Hmm...I don’t think anyone will laugh, Nagisa. And that’s a really clever idea!
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;1:=wink.png,Hmm...Palutena, you’re a little bit of a trickster, aren’t you? I bet you and Tikki would get along.
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Hmm… Is this to psyche us out, or to distract us?
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;navi&stage;1:=confused.png,Huh. You know, I've never seen Tikki wear clothes...
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;2:=excited.png,I <i>do</i> really like your clothes. They're so nautical and streamlined! I bet you like to go really fast, huh, Shimakaze?
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kimberly&stage;1:=confident.png,I <i>love</i> your whole aesthetic. To be honest, I think I'd just be giving too much away if I were polka-dotted all the time though.
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;2:=calm.png,I actually think we’d have gotten along well in high school, Daria.
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;mercy&stage;3:=wink.png,I bet Medicens Sans Frontieres would really benefit with you as its face, should Overwatch ever be too much, Mercy.
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;juri&stage;0:=alarmed.png,I can see that you're not exactly a positive sort, are you, Juri?
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;streaming-chan&stage;4:=confused.png,I can’t tell if this is some kind of performance art, Streaming-chan…
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;4:=confused.png,I don't really drink but... Wow, those look tasty.
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,I fight a villain who has… I guess in your terms a Quirk…
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;0:=confident.png,I guess you're not <i>so</i> lucky after all, Vriska!
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;1:=wink.png,I have to say, I kind of like your outfit better, Sayaka!
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;navi&stage;2:=confident.png,I liked your flower, Navi!
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;yang&stage;0:,marker:yangplaying=confident.png,I only hope your fighting style is as over-developed as the rest of you.
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;4:=confident.png,I really admire someone who can wear a skirt. I'm... really not a dress type of girl.
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;tracer&stage;3:=wink.png,I see London, I’ve seen France...
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;7:=calm.png,I tend to like more natural looks.
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;5&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=bored.png,I think I get it. You aren't an akuma, even if you're kind of a jerk, huh, Veran? You're sort of like Nayru's Kwami, aren't you?
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;1:=excited.png,I think there's probably a Songbird miraculous to go with your locket! It seems like it's a good fit for you, for some reason, Elizabeth!
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;raven&stage;3:=confident.png,I think we have a lot in common, Raven!
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;2:=wink.png,I thought mercenary-types regularly played cards in seedy bars. A-are you just throwing?
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale&stage;1:=calm.png,I wish my teachers were patient like you, Trainer.
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,I’m amazed you keep those gloves so pristine! Given your, um, personality, Kyu.
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sayla&stage;2:=confident.png,I’ve never seen a military outfit like that one before, Sayla. I like it, it’s very bright! Judging by your attitude, you’re bright as well!
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;2:=excited.png,If her mech weren’t just technology, I could be convinced that D.Va is Hana’s superhero identity.
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,If it makes you feel better, I think it's a pretty skirt.
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,I-I know this is kind of an odd way to meet, Chun-li, but I want you to know you were a huge inspiration to me when I started hero-ing!
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;0:=alarmed.png,I know this is an odd meet to way-- way to meet but hero you're my Chun-li! An inspiration! G-gah!
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;0:,marker:florinaplaying=embarrassed.png,I-I like your hair, Florina!
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,I-I'd rather not delve into insults, Elaine!
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Um... Could we maybe speak in French instead of Spanish, Elaine?
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,I-I'm a little worried about the continued gunplay, Aimee.
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:=bored.png,Aimee, this is getting really dangerous. Without clothes or armor...
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;videl&stage;0:=wink.png,I'll just say it, the clothes are coming off.
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;3:=bored.png,I'm actually starting to enjoy the fireworks. I'm sorry your stuff's being damaged though...
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4:=confused.png,I'm glad <i>this</i> tasteless display is over. Ugh.
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4:=bored.png,What is <i>wrong</i> with you, Vriska? How tasteless.
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;5:=confused.png,I'm glad the explosions haven't... um... shown your panties... or your... I don't know enough nautical terminology to figure out what you'd call it...
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;2:=bored.png,I'm glad you're still going slow, Ochako.
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,I'm going to assume you'll be keeping the gun...
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;4:=bored.png,Aimee, I'll even help you undress if you just... stop shooting. Please. For goodness sakes.
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;4&saidmarker;null_possess:=confident.png,I'm so proud of you, Nayru! I know this isn't easy, but you're sticking with it! That's wonderful!
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1:=confused.png,I'm starting to think that dice of yours is definitely the host of an akuma... Master Fuu wouldn't have trusted a Miraculous to... Er... Someone like <i>you</i>.
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1:=bored.png,I'm really starting to wonder if your dice is just an akuma target and I'm a big idiot for not noticing sooner.
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;6:=bored.png,I'm still mad you added extra layers, but I suppose I'm not exactly exempt from that...
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;ann&stage;6:=confused.png,Is your hair natural? I've heard you're a quarter American, but...
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;3:=bored.png,It looks like Moon isn’t possessed by an Akuma… She’s just kind of like this?
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;5:=calm.png,It’s okay Nagisa. Sometimes, the people you meet in passing, you get to know far better than you might think.
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;5:=excited.png,Wow Nagisa! You’re really giving it your all now, aren’t you?
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;5:,marker:marinette_ricebun=embarrassed.png,I-I’d offer to let you borrow my bra, if it wasn’t against the rules, we seem like we’re the same size...
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;0:=calm.png,It's a bit vintage but I like the way your outfit comes together.
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kimberly&stage;0:=calm.png,Kimberly, how does your morpher work? You changed out of your costume so fast!
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kyoko&stage;0:=confident.png,Kyoko, I like your outfit!
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;mei&stage;3:=confident.png,Mei, after this, can you tutor me in Mandarin?
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;mercy&stage;1:=calm.png,Mercy, I can tell by your accent that you’re Swiss, right? My family uses only the best Swiss chocolate in their baking!
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;revy&stage;0:=confused.png,Must you be so rude and vulgar, Revy?
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;0:=confused.png,Natsuki, if you're going to be upset, it might be best not to play... I'd hate for you to get Akumatized...
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Nayru again? I just <i>love</i> your look! Um. Not that you're looking at me. Or at anyone.
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;2:=wink.png,No need to get worried, Nagisa! I’m right here with you. And friends make it better, right? Or...Um, more tolerable.
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;2:=confident.png,It’s alright, Nagisa. I can definitely tell you’re playing better than last round!
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;weiss&stage;0:=bored.png,No, not particularly. I think I have to just treat you with the Chloe protocol...Assume your bad behavior on its own isn’t enough stress to Akumatize you…
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Now you’re definitely not wearing a superhero costume...
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;neo&stage;4:=bored.png,Oh goodness, you don’t even need an akuma, you have a really vicious aura about you…
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;2:=confused.png,Oh! You worked for REVOCs, right?
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;4:=confused.png,Oh! You've been very self-conscious about this, have you been padding--
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;0:=confident.png,Oh, who was your little friend, Shimakaze?
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6b:=wink.png,Oh, you're going to undress <i>again</i>? Playing by the rules is so, so challenging, isn't it, Vriska?
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;ann&stage;0:=excited.png,Ohmygosh, Ann Takamaki!? The model from Japan? We have so much in common!
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;3:=calm.png,Okay, I’ve heard you on TV. Are you that <i>actually</i> that famous japanese runner? Miki Makimura?
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;1:=calm.png,Okay, so no, what’s next?
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;6:=alarmed.png,O-oh no, this'll hit all of your exposed skin!
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;launch&stage;1:=alarmed.png,Please don't sneeze while you have an itchy trigger finger--
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6a:=confused.png,Please tell me you're going to dry off now. I-it's kind of hard to deal with you standing there soaked. M-my innate sense of heroism means I have to care about even <i>you, Vriska</i>.
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;red&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Red! You’re getting really…
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;0:,marker:samusplaying=wink.png,Samus Aran? I’ve heard of you!
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;1:=excited.png,Samus, my powers are kind of similar to yours! I suit up and then have to build my own powerups each time.
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;2:=confident.png,Sayaka, what's a familiar? Is it like an akuma?
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;0:,marker:seiplaying=bored.png,Sei... Asagiri. Asthagiri? Hmm... I can't tell if that's a Japanese or Indian name.
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;0:,marker:seiplaying=confident.png,So, you're another hero! Just... one of the drunker ones, it seems.
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;seven&stage;0:,marker:sevenplaying=bored.png,Seven of Nine? I’m sorry, did something get translated wrong? Sept de Neuf? Mme. Neuf?
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;3:=confident.png,Sheena, you're a summoner, right? Maybe you can help improve my bond with Tikki!
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shego&stage;1:=calm.png,Shego, you should really give up and join the forces of good! You're much to smart to help out... That bad guy you help.
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Sirens are… Kind of magical? Sort of?
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;videl&stage;3:=confident.png,So Videl, it's a shame you're losing but I guess...
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;1:=calm.png,So you and ~player~ came here together...?
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;3:=confused.png,So you can... teleport? Are you sure you don't have some sort of guardian spirit? Wait, his name is Booker? What's a Booker?
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3:=wink.png,So, are you going to stop cheating, Vriska? Maybe you'll pick something tasteful this time?
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,So, did you pick that outfit for yourself? Tikki more or less picked mine for me, but I'm pretty happy with it... usually.
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,So, now that you’re taking off… Um, the rest of your suit, are you going to tell me-- Er, us, the story?
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;5:=bored.png,So, Saki, what would you like to do after this? I have a few ideas, if you'd like!
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;5:,marker:saki_date=excited.png,(She's sure looking at ~player~ a lot...) H-hey! ~player~! A-are you enjoying Saki undressing!
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;5:,marker:saki_date=excited.png,(~player~ and Saki are looking at each other a lot...) Hmm. ~player~, do you think you'd take Saki out on a date after this?
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;0:=confused.png,So, you’re <i>actually</i> some kind of fairy?
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;1:=confident.png,So... Nayru, can you rewind time? My Miraculous lets me do that!
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;navi&stage;0:=calm.png,Soo... Navi, what's with your light?
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;dawn&stage;0:=confident.png,Sorry about that Dawn, girls with blue hair need to stick together!
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;1:=wink.png,That sweater looks pretty comfortable. And I like the color!
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;lyn&stage;0:,marker:lynplaying=excited.png,That’s a nice sword, but is it a Miraculous or is it possessed by an Akuma?
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;zizou&stage;0:=confident.png,That’s a really cool hat, Zizou!
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;4&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=alarmed.png,The akuma! It's got Nayru's--
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;7:=excited.png,The good news, Vriska, is that we could basically see everything so why don't you--
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;7:=calm.png,You know, Vriska, we've already seen your chest, so, really, you could just--
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,The good stuff? Y-you mean...
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,This is why I don't like to wear skirts...
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,You know, I think a skirt looks good on you, but I find pencil skirts really impractical...
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;0:=confident.png,Tikki is telling me you're an oracle, Nayru! What does that mean, though? (Your dress is also <i>super</i> chic!)
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;0:,marker:elaine_puns=confused.png,Ugh, puns. Always the puns.
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;0:=confused.png,You know the dealer, Elaine!?
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;weiss&stage;2:=confused.png,Uh, no, Weiss. Not quite. You’re flaunting your riches.
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Uhm. Sei, you’ve never gone mad with power, right?
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;3:=confused.png,Uhm. With the way things are going, I can see this getting very dangerous when you run out of clothes.
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;3:=confident.png,Okay. Surely you'll part with that incredibly dangerous weapon now, right?
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Um, Lilith, I think your tattoos are really cool!
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;7:=embarrassed.png,Um. I kind of saw a hint of... wour yorking with. You're working with! I-I um.
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,Um... Chun-li, I really don't want to be annoying or overly fangirl...
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Um... I know this is kind of a serious game, Chun-li, but...
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,I know this game is kind of... well, fun it's-- it's fun, but um--
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;launch&stage;7:=embarrassed.png,Um... part of me is curious to see if... you know...
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,Um...Scarlet Witch, that outfit looks… Very… Um. Everyone can almost see your…
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;0:=bored.png,U-uhm. I know you aren't here for the best reasons...
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,U-uhm. I-if it’s for you--oooour value of the <i>international superhero community</i>...
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;4:=confused.png,U-um. Do you mean that we're cheating somehow, Elaine?
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;6&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=alarmed.png,Veran, please don't destroy any more of Nayru's clothes... she might have a very embarrassing time walking home, and once you're out of energy...
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;4:=confident.png,Wait! I remembered the magic words!
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;amy_rose&stage;0:=confused.png,Wait, Amy, are you using the hedgehog Miraculous?
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;0:=alarmed.png,Wait, I think I’ve seen a statue of you. Are you really Palutena?
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;neo&stage;1:=calm.png,Wait, your name is Neopolitan... like the ice cream, or the Italian area? Do you just not speak a language with us?
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;mei&stage;1:=excited.png,Wait, you're Mei Ling, the famous climatologist?
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;meg&stage;5:=wink.png,What does a slasher even do? Reduce prices? Not that scary!
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;lux&stage;4:=confused.png,What's your kwami like, Lux? It must be nice to have so much extra armor over your suit...
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;ann&stage;4:=excited.png,While you're here, we could stop by my parents'?

6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;6:=confused.png,I know he's kind of shifty, but you shouldn't threaten the dealer, Elaine!
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;0:=bored.png,GoGo Tomago? Didn’t your friend just buy you equipment for your powers?
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;1:=excited.png,Great! I know you're quite a skilled warrior, and you definitely don't seem to be having a crisis of confidence.
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Y-you know. I really hope this isn't a tactical maneuver to get at my Miraculous... Hawk Moth's tried that a few times...

6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sanako&stage;1:=confused.png,Hmm... (I think Sanako knows something I don't...)
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;alpha&stage;0:,marker:alphaplaying=confused.png,Hmm... So you're digital? As in you aren't real?
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;2:=excited.png,Hmm... You know, I'm not an armorer... But I can see some... Stylistic... Improvements I could make.
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;2:=confused.png,Is all armor from... Hmm... Is it all so complicated?
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;pearl&stage;1:=confused.png,Hmm... You seem a bit... unusual, Pearl.

6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;1:=wink.png,Hmm...Palutena, you’re a little bit of a trickster, aren’t you? I bet you and Tikki would get along.
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Hmm… Is this to psyche us out, or to distract us?
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;navi&stage;1:=confused.png,Huh. You know, I've never seen Tikki wear clothes...

6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;5&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=bored.png,I think I get it. You aren't an akuma, even if you're kind of a jerk, huh, Veran? You're sort of like Nayru's Kwami, aren't you?
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;1:=excited.png,I think there's probably a Songbird miraculous to go with your locket! It seems like it's a good fit for you, for some reason, Elizabeth!
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;raven&stage;3:=confident.png,I think we have a lot in common, Raven!
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;2:=wink.png,I thought mercenary-types regularly played cards in seedy bars. A-are you just throwing?
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale&stage;1:=calm.png,I wish my teachers were patient like you, Trainer.
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sayla&stage;2:=confident.png,I’ve never seen a military outfit like that one before, Sayla. I like it, it’s very bright! Judging by your attitude, you’re bright as well!
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;2:=excited.png,If her mech weren’t just technology, I could be convinced that D.Va is Hana’s superhero identity.
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,If it makes you feel better, I think it's a pretty skirt.
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,I-I can’t tell if I’ve been working too hard.
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,I-I know this is kind of an odd way to meet, Chun-li, but I want you to know you were a huge inspiration to me when I started hero-ing!
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;0:=alarmed.png,I know this is an odd meet to way-- way to meet but hero you're my Chun-li! An inspiration! G-gah!
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;0:,marker:florinaplaying=embarrassed.png,I-I like your hair, Florina!
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,I-I'd rather not delve into insults, Elaine!
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Um... Could we maybe speak in French instead of Spanish, Elaine?
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,I-I'm a little worried about the continued gunplay, Aimee.
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:=bored.png,Aimee, this is getting really dangerous. Without clothes or armor...
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;videl&stage;0:=wink.png,I'll just say it, the clothes are coming off.
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;3:=bored.png,I'm actually starting to enjoy the fireworks. I'm sorry your stuff's being damaged though...
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4:=confused.png,I'm glad <i>this</i> tasteless display is over. Ugh.
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4:=bored.png,What is <i>wrong</i> with you, Vriska? How tasteless.
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;5:=confused.png,I'm glad the explosions haven't... um... shown your panties... or your... I don't know enough nautical terminology to figure out what you'd call it...
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;2:=bored.png,I'm glad you're still going slow, Ochako.
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,I'm going to assume you'll be keeping the gun...
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;4:=bored.png,Aimee, I'll even help you undress if you just... stop shooting. Please. For goodness sakes.
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;4&saidmarker;null_possess:=confident.png,I'm so proud of you, Nayru! I know this isn't easy, but you're sticking with it! That's wonderful!
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1:=confused.png,I'm starting to think that dice of yours is definitely the host of an akuma... Master Fuu wouldn't have trusted a Miraculous to... Er... Someone like <i>you</i>.
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1:=bored.png,I'm really starting to wonder if your dice is just an akuma target and I'm a big idiot for not noticing sooner.
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;6:=bored.png,I'm still mad you added extra layers, but I suppose I'm not exactly exempt from that...
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;ann&stage;6:=confused.png,Is your hair natural? I've heard you're a quarter American, but...
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;3:=bored.png,It looks like Moon isn’t possessed by an Akuma… She’s just kind of like this?
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;5:=calm.png,It’s okay Nagisa. Sometimes, the people you meet in passing, you get to know far better than you might think.
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;5:=excited.png,Wow Nagisa! You’re really giving it your all now, aren’t you?
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;5:,marker:marinette_ricebun=embarrassed.png,I-I’d offer to let you borrow my bra, if it wasn’t against the rules, we seem like we’re the same size...
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;0:=calm.png,It's a bit vintage but I like the way your outfit comes together.
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kimberly&stage;0:=calm.png,Kimberly, how does your morpher work? You changed out of your costume so fast!
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kyoko&stage;0:=confident.png,Kyoko, I like your outfit!
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;mei&stage;3:=confident.png,Mei, after this, can you tutor me in Mandarin?
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;mercy&stage;1:=calm.png,Mercy, I can tell by your accent that you’re Swiss, right? My family uses only the best Swiss chocolate in their baking!
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;revy&stage;0:=confused.png,Must you be so rude and vulgar, Revy?
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;0:=confused.png,Natsuki, if you're going to be upset, it might be best not to play... I'd hate for you to get Akumatized...
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Nayru again? I just <i>love</i> your look! Um. Not that you're looking at me. Or at anyone.
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;2:=wink.png,No need to get worried, Nagisa! I’m right here with you. And friends make it better, right? Or...Um, more tolerable.
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;2:=confident.png,It’s alright, Nagisa. I can definitely tell you’re playing better than last round!
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;weiss&stage;0:=bored.png,No, not particularly. I think I have to just treat you with the Chloe protocol...Assume your bad behavior on its own isn’t enough stress to Akumatize you…
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Now you’re definitely not wearing a superhero costume...
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;neo&stage;4:=bored.png,Oh goodness, you don’t even need an akuma, you have a really vicious aura about you…
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;2:=confused.png,Oh! You worked for REVOCs, right?
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;4:=confused.png,Oh! You've been very self-conscious about this, have you been padding--
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;0:=confident.png,Oh, who was your little friend, Shimakaze?
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6b:=wink.png,Oh, you're going to undress <i>again</i>? Playing by the rules is so, so challenging, isn't it, Vriska?
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;ann&stage;0:=excited.png,Ohmygosh, Ann Takamaki!? The model from Japan? We have so much in common!
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;3:=calm.png,Okay, I’ve heard you on TV. Are you that <i>actually</i> that famous japanese runner? Miki Makimura?
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;6:=alarmed.png,O-oh no, this'll hit all of your exposed skin!
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;launch&stage;1:=alarmed.png,Please don't sneeze while you have an itchy trigger finger--
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6a:=confused.png,Please tell me you're going to dry off now. I-it's kind of hard to deal with you standing there soaked. M-my innate sense of heroism means I have to care about even <i>you, Vriska</i>.
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;red&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Red! You’re getting really…
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;0:,marker:samusplaying=wink.png,Samus Aran? I’ve heard of you!
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;1:=excited.png,Samus, my powers are kind of similar to yours! I suit up and then have to build my own powerups each time.
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;2:=confident.png,Sayaka, what's a familiar? Is it like an akuma?
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;0:,marker:seiplaying=bored.png,Sei... Asagiri. Asthagiri? Hmm... I can't tell if that's a Japanese or Indian name.
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;0:,marker:seiplaying=confident.png,So, you're another hero! Just... one of the drunker ones, it seems.
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;seven&stage;0:,marker:sevenplaying=bored.png,Seven of Nine? I’m sorry, did something get translated wrong? Sept de Neuf? Mme. Neuf?
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;3:=confident.png,Sheena, you're a summoner, right? Maybe you can help improve my bond with Tikki!
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shego&stage;1:=calm.png,Shego, you should really give up and join the forces of good! You're much to smart to help out... That bad guy you help.
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Sirens are… Kind of magical? Sort of?
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;videl&stage;3:=confident.png,So Videl, it's a shame you're losing but I guess...
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;1:=confused.png,So why a collar? Is that like… A sex thing?
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;1:=calm.png,So you and ~player~ came here together...?
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;3:=confused.png,So you can... teleport? Are you sure you don't have some sort of guardian spirit? Wait, his name is Booker? What's a Booker?
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,So, did you pick that outfit for yourself? Tikki more or less picked mine for me, but I'm pretty happy with it... usually.
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,So, now that you’re taking off… Um, the rest of your suit, are you going to tell me-- Er, us, the story?
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;5:=bored.png,So, Saki, what would you like to do after this? I have a few ideas, if you'd like!
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;5:,marker:saki_date=excited.png,(She's sure looking at ~player~ a lot...) H-hey! ~player~! A-are you enjoying Saki undressing!
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;5:,marker:saki_date=excited.png,(~player~ and Saki are looking at each other a lot...) Hmm. ~player~, do you think you'd take Saki out on a date after this?
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;1:=confident.png,So... Nayru, can you rewind time? My Miraculous lets me do that!
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;navi&stage;0:=calm.png,Soo... Navi, what's with your light?
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;dawn&stage;0:=confident.png,Sorry about that Dawn, girls with blue hair need to stick together!
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;1:=wink.png,That sweater looks pretty comfortable. And I like the color!
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;lyn&stage;0:,marker:lynplaying=excited.png,That’s a nice sword, but is it a Miraculous or is it possessed by an Akuma?
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;zizou&stage;0:=confident.png,That’s a really cool hat, Zizou!
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;4&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=alarmed.png,The akuma! It's got Nayru's--
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;7:=excited.png,The good news, Vriska, is that we could basically see everything so why don't you--
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;7:=calm.png,You know, Vriska, we've already seen your chest, so, really, you could just--
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,The good stuff? Y-you mean...
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,This is why I don't like to wear skirts...
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,You know, I think a skirt looks good on you, but I find pencil skirts really impractical...
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;0:=confident.png,Tikki is telling me you're an oracle, Nayru! What does that mean, though? (Your dress is also <i>super</i> chic!)
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;0:,marker:elaine_puns=confused.png,Ugh, puns. Always the puns.
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;0:=confused.png,You know the dealer, Elaine!?
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;weiss&stage;2:=confused.png,Uh, no, Weiss. Not quite. You’re flaunting your riches.
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Uhm. Sei, you’ve never gone mad with power, right?
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;3:=confused.png,Uhm. With the way things are going, I can see this getting very dangerous when you run out of clothes.
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;3:=confident.png,Okay. Surely you'll part with that incredibly dangerous weapon now, right?
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Um, Lilith, I think your tattoos are really cool!
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;7:=embarrassed.png,Um. I kind of saw a hint of... wour yorking with. You're working with! I-I um.
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,Um... Chun-li, I really don't want to be annoying or overly fangirl...
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Um... I know this is kind of a serious game, Chun-li, but...
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,I know this game is kind of... well, fun it's-- it's fun, but um--
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;launch&stage;7:=embarrassed.png,Um... part of me is curious to see if... you know...
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,Um...Scarlet Witch, that outfit looks… Very… Um. Everyone can almost see your…
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;0:=bored.png,U-uhm. I know you aren't here for the best reasons...
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,U-uhm. I-if it’s for you--oooour value of the <i>international superhero community</i>...
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;4:=confused.png,U-um. Do you mean that we're cheating somehow, Elaine?
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;6&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=alarmed.png,Veran, please don't destroy any more of Nayru's clothes... she might have a very embarrassing time walking home, and once you're out of energy...
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;4:=confident.png,Wait! I remembered the magic words!
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;amy_rose&stage;0:=confused.png,Wait, Amy, are you using the hedgehog Miraculous?
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;0:=alarmed.png,Wait, I think I’ve seen a statue of you. Are you really Palutena?
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;neo&stage;1:=calm.png,Wait, your name is Neopolitan... like the ice cream, or the Italian area? Do you just not speak a language with us?
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;mei&stage;1:=excited.png,Wait, you're Mei Ling, the famous climatologist?
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;3:=wink.png,Well, Elena, how does a Princess of Avalor undress? You seem to be enjoying yourself, just a little.
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,Well, I’d say you’re a Copycat but you’re really not that kind of extra character…
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;meg&stage;5:=wink.png,What does a slasher even do? Reduce prices? Not that scary!
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;lux&stage;4:=confused.png,What's your kwami like, Lux? It must be nice to have so much extra armor over your suit...
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;ann&stage;4:=excited.png,While you're here, we could stop by my parents'?
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika&stage;0:=excited.png,Whoa! You’ve got such a positive spirit, Mika!
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;2:,marker:bodysuit=alarmed.png,Whoa, Gwen, your suit? L-like, the whole thing?
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;0:=wink.png,Whoa, Uravity, you, well, manipulate gravity?
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;z03y&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,Why do I get the feeling you have an... er... intense understanding of the French Revolution?
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;2:=wink.png,Wings always seem really complicated when other heroes use them.
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;0:,marker:d.vaplaying=excited.png,Wow! D.Va! I’m normally a fighting game person but everyone knows who you are!
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;dark_magician_girl&stage;0:=excited.png,Wow! I love your fashion sense...
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&timeinstage;6:=excited.png,Wow, ~name~, you haven’t gone in a while. You’re really playing well!
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;asuna&stage;4:=alarmed.png,Wow, Asuna! You have so much enchanted equipment!
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;lyn&stage;4:=excited.png,Wow, where are you from?
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;red&stage;4:=alarmed.png,W-wait, it can talk? Is this like Robustus?
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shego&stage;0:=alarmed.png,W-wait, you're Shego, right? Don't you willingly serve evil?
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;buffy&stage;0:=calm.png,W-well you did say you'd done this before. And you seem really worth getting to know.
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;buffy&stage;0:=excited.png,Hmm... Being a Slayer sounds like you could really benefit from a Miraculous...
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;6&saidmarker;null_possess:=embarrassed.png,W-well, from one magical person to another, I suppose it could be worse. You could've been Akumatized or something!
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;6:=alarmed.png,W-well, Gwen, looks like lit’s lour… looks like it’s your… Um...
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,W-well, I hope that your husband knows you're here... I-I really wouldn't want to stare-- N-not that I'm staring!
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sanako&stage;0:=confident.png,W-well, if you insist, Sanako.
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,W-what's next, Chun-li? Um. Hm.
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika&stage;1:=bored.png,Yikes, and I was worried about losing my costume…
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sayori&stage;0:=confident.png,You and ~player~ seem to know each other really well, Sayori! I hope this is exciting but not embarrassing for you! Um. If it is, don't hesitate to leave!
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;ann&stage;3:=calm.png,You definitely strike me as someone who finds a good balance between hero and renegade.
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;april&stage;1:=calm.png,You know, April, my friend Alya also reports on animal-themed superheroes…
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;arwen&stage;3:=confident.png,You know, Arwen, I really meant it. You were a big inspiration... You come from such a diverse background...
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;felicia&stage;1:=confused.png,You know, I bet some people get really turned on by the whole shaving thing...
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;3:=confident.png,You know, I do have to say I really appreciate the work the police do. I don’t stop criminals of the... normal variety.
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;6:=calm.png,You know, I have to kind of grapple my way around Paris… (I should try and distract Ochako a little...)
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;red&stage;0:=confused.png,You know, I heard they let people bring weapons to the game… I was a bit surprised...
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika&stage;2:=excited.png,You know, I’m always interested in picking up new fighting techniques…
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;0:=confident.png,You know, Lilith, are the Sirens a band?
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale&stage;0:=confident.png,You know, Trainer, I’m actually in pretty good shape!
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;0:=confident.png,You say you’re not human originally…What were you?
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;0:=excited.png,You seem smart, Annie!
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;0:=confused.png,You sound really familiar, Shantae…
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;2:=wink.png,You speak French too, so it's not that much of a stretch! But it's a bit of a faux pas to use your names and powers at the same time, oui?
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;6:=bored.png,You think love triangles are hard?
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;4:=excited.png,You’re pretty different from the others. More sarcastic than Nino, smarter than Chloe, cuter than Alyx...
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;1:=confident.png,You’re worth lots, Nagisa. Don’t lose heart, everyone can enjoy time with friends!
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Are you in surry to hemove your rocks? Er. A hurry to remove your socks, Nagisa?
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;1:,marker:nagisa_time_travel=calm.png,Hmm… Tarou Urashima… That’s the story about the time traveler… But why would that make you ahead…?
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;7:=alarmed.png,You're so eager to get naked!
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;5&saidmarker;null_possess:=wink.png,You're so gracious, Nayru! I-I wish I were more like you. I'd be a sputtering mess in your place...
6-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shego&stage;3:=confused.png,Y-you really don't know when to quit, do you, Shego? I'm really not enjoying this game you're making the heroes play!

7-female_human_must_strip=confused.png,Yeah! Check out ~name~! I-I’m sorry, I just don’t want to take these off.
7-female_human_must_strip=excited.png,Even though you’re... like <i>that</i>, is it rude or a compliment to say I’m a bit... excited?
7-female_human_must_strip=confident.png,Don’t worry, ~name~, our luck will turn around, I’m sure!

7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;1:=calm.png,(I should really make sure Saki knows I'm here to support her!) I know this isn't easy, Saki, but don't get too embarrassed! I promise if you just relax a little bit, this'll be... kind of fun?
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&timeinstage;12:=bored.png,~name~? I-I wasn’t sure if you had quit and were just observing.

7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;pearl&stage;2:=excited.png,A chiffon! I would love to talk more about that with you! Such an underused choice of garment!

7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;4:=wink.png,Agh, Shantae, I give up.

7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;0:=calm.png,Aimee... I can't quite place your accent... But you sound... American?
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;0:=calm.png,Oh, of course you'll give up the gun first. Then you'll take off the bands one by one.
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;1:=calm.png,Amalia, do you have some sort of Miraculous?
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;1:=wink.png,Hmm... Amalia, I have a feeling you use a Miraculous too, don't you?
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kim&stage;0:,marker:kim_similar=excited.png,An athletic superhero who has to balance her academic life...With great fashion sense! You seem awfully familiar…

7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;5:=wink.png,Based on the way you're playing, Amalia...
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;6:=confident.png,Be brave, Saki! You can do this!

7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;4:=confident.png,Don’t worry, Palutena. Even if you do get embarrassed, I can de-Akumatize you really quickly. I mean, I’d have to. A god with akuma powers would be really scary...Especially someone as powerful as you!
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;4:=confident.png,Even if you’re a goddess, you’re still in this Palutena, and I won’t go easy on you!
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;3:=confident.png,Don't worry Elena! At least we're in this together.
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;3:=wink.png,You seem like a lady who doesn't go nude under her clothes, so you shouldn't get too embarrassed...

7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;1:=bored.png,Elena, I get the feeling you get rushed into things a lot...
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;5:=confused.png,Elena, I... Uhm. Don't think it's right to abuse political power... But... You didn't really ask to be here so...
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;red&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Er. My yo-yo is most ly used to disarm people…
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:=confused.png,Er... I guess you didn't transform as much as shot off your clothes.
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;chiaki&stage;0:=bored.png,Er... I know your type, Chiaki. Do you get really embarrassed when you lose?
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;6:=wink.png,Er... If you come to Paris I can definitely get you some new clothes as it seems like you're rubbing out.
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;erufuda&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Er... I'm glad you're so fascinated with um... one aspect of French cuisine, Erufuda, but there's more to it than just fries!
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;revy&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Er... Revy, have you considered putting down the guns?
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;1:=confused.png,Er... what's that sound... Shimakaze?
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;0:=confused.png,Er...I’m here...Like this and you’re getting so upset over...Erk.
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;chica&stage;0:=confused.png,Er… Freddy Fazbear’s? I think I’ve heard of that restaurant...
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,Er… Ochako, Hawkmoth kind of does send butterflies after people…
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;1:=wink.png,Er… you’re kinda shy about this, huh, Ochako?
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,Erk, sorry Nagisa. But at least you’re experiencing something new?
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;4:,marker:bun_puns=excited.png,Nagisa, I can smell the bakery on you!
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;felicia&stage;0:=confused.png,Err... N-not really the kitty I normally work with...
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;6:=alarmed.png,Er-Well. Um. I-
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;6:=embarrassed.png,I-Um. Okay! Something!
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;7:=wink.png,Florina… Florina… Hey, Florina… It’s your turn...
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;3:=bored.png,For such elaborate armor and such a striking appearance, I have to say your attire... Uhm. Isn't quite as interesting.
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;6:=embarrassed.png,Gah! Elaine! You shouldn't threaten the dealer like that!
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;6:=confused.png,I know he's kind of shifty, but you shouldn't threaten the dealer, Elaine!
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;0:=bored.png,GoGo Tomago? Didn’t your friend just buy you equipment for your powers?
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;1:=excited.png,Great! I know you're quite a skilled warrior, and you definitely don't seem to be having a crisis of confidence.
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Y-you know. I really hope this isn't a tactical maneuver to get at my Miraculous... Hawk Moth's tried that a few times...
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;0:=confused.png,Hey Saki, you look a little tired. Is everything okay?
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;0:=bored.png,Saki, are you doing okay?
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;himeko&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,H-hey! Calm down, Sailor Psycho! This is supposed to be fun!
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;2:=bored.png,Hm? Kyu is...?
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;1:=confident.png,Hmm, okay, so you aren’t a swordswoman. Do you manipulate time? Maybe… You have a thing for girls with pink hair?
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;jane&stage;0:=confident.png,Hmm, that’s really well worn! Is it an Agreste?
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sanako&stage;1:=confused.png,Hmm... (I think Sanako knows something I don't...)
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;alpha&stage;0:,marker:alphaplaying=confused.png,Hmm... So you're digital? As in you aren't real?
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;2:=excited.png,Hmm... You know, I'm not an armorer... But I can see some... Stylistic... Improvements I could make.
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;2:=confused.png,Is all armor from... Hmm... Is it all so complicated?
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;pearl&stage;1:=confused.png,Hmm... You seem a bit... unusual, Pearl.
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sharla&stage;0:=confused.png,Hmm... You seem familiar...
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;3:=confident.png,Hmm...I don’t think anyone will laugh, Nagisa. And that’s a really clever idea!
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;1:=wink.png,Hmm...Palutena, you’re a little bit of a trickster, aren’t you? I bet you and Tikki would get along.
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Hmm… Is this to psyche us out, or to distract us?
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;navi&stage;1:=confused.png,Huh. You know, I've never seen Tikki wear clothes...
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;2:=excited.png,I <i>do</i> really like your clothes. They're so nautical and streamlined! I bet you like to go really fast, huh, Shimakaze?
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kimberly&stage;1:=confident.png,I <i>love</i> your whole aesthetic. To be honest, I think I'd just be giving too much away if I were polka-dotted all the time though.
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;2:=calm.png,I actually think we’d have gotten along well in high school, Daria.
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;mercy&stage;3:=wink.png,I bet Medicens Sans Frontieres would really benefit with you as its face, should Overwatch ever be too much, Mercy.
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;juri&stage;0:=alarmed.png,I can see that you're not exactly a positive sort, are you, Juri?
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;streaming-chan&stage;4:=confused.png,I can’t tell if this is some kind of performance art, Streaming-chan…
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;4:=confused.png,I don't really drink but... Wow, those look tasty.
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;5:=wink.png,I feel like you have a lot to teach me, Kyu! Um. If you’re willing to teach in a less-than-embarrassing way.
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,I fight a villain who has… I guess in your terms a Quirk…
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;0:=confident.png,I guess you're not <i>so</i> lucky after all, Vriska!
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;1:=wink.png,I have to say, I kind of like your outfit better, Sayaka!
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;navi&stage;2:=confident.png,I liked your flower, Navi!
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;yang&stage;0:,marker:yangplaying=confident.png,I only hope your fighting style is as over-developed as the rest of you.
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;4:=confident.png,I really admire someone who can wear a skirt. I'm... really not a dress type of girl.
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;tracer&stage;3:=wink.png,I see London, I’ve seen France...
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;7:=calm.png,I tend to like more natural looks.
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;5&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=bored.png,I think I get it. You aren't an akuma, even if you're kind of a jerk, huh, Veran? You're sort of like Nayru's Kwami, aren't you?
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;1:=excited.png,I think there's probably a Songbird miraculous to go with your locket! It seems like it's a good fit for you, for some reason, Elizabeth!
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;raven&stage;3:=confident.png,I think we have a lot in common, Raven!
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;2:=wink.png,I thought mercenary-types regularly played cards in seedy bars. A-are you just throwing?
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale&stage;1:=calm.png,I wish my teachers were patient like you, Trainer.
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sayla&stage;2:=confident.png,I’ve never seen a military outfit like that one before, Sayla. I like it, it’s very bright! Judging by your attitude, you’re bright as well!
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;2:=excited.png,If her mech weren’t just technology, I could be convinced that D.Va is Hana’s superhero identity.
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,If it makes you feel better, I think it's a pretty skirt.
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,I-I can’t tell if I’ve been working too hard.
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,I-I know this is kind of an odd way to meet, Chun-li, but I want you to know you were a huge inspiration to me when I started hero-ing!
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;0:=alarmed.png,I know this is an odd meet to way-- way to meet but hero you're my Chun-li! An inspiration! G-gah!
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;0:,marker:florinaplaying=embarrassed.png,I-I like your hair, Florina!
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,I-I'd rather not delve into insults, Elaine!
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Um... Could we maybe speak in French instead of Spanish, Elaine?
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,I-I'm a little worried about the continued gunplay, Aimee.
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:=bored.png,Aimee, this is getting really dangerous. Without clothes or armor...
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;videl&stage;0:=wink.png,I'll just say it, the clothes are coming off.
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;3:=bored.png,I'm actually starting to enjoy the fireworks. I'm sorry your stuff's being damaged though...
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4:=confused.png,I'm glad <i>this</i> tasteless display is over. Ugh.
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4:=bored.png,What is <i>wrong</i> with you, Vriska? How tasteless.
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;5:=confused.png,I'm glad the explosions haven't... um... shown your panties... or your... I don't know enough nautical terminology to figure out what you'd call it...
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;2:=bored.png,I'm glad you're still going slow, Ochako.
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,I'm going to assume you'll be keeping the gun...
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;4:=bored.png,Aimee, I'll even help you undress if you just... stop shooting. Please. For goodness sakes.
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;4&saidmarker;null_possess:=confident.png,I'm so proud of you, Nayru! I know this isn't easy, but you're sticking with it! That's wonderful!
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1:=confused.png,I'm starting to think that dice of yours is definitely the host of an akuma... Master Fuu wouldn't have trusted a Miraculous to... Er... Someone like <i>you</i>.
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1:=bored.png,I'm really starting to wonder if your dice is just an akuma target and I'm a big idiot for not noticing sooner.
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;6:=bored.png,I'm still mad you added extra layers, but I suppose I'm not exactly exempt from that...
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;ann&stage;6:=confused.png,Is your hair natural? I've heard you're a quarter American, but...
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;3:=bored.png,It looks like Moon isn’t possessed by an Akuma… She’s just kind of like this?
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;5:=calm.png,It’s okay Nagisa. Sometimes, the people you meet in passing, you get to know far better than you might think.
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;5:=excited.png,Wow Nagisa! You’re really giving it your all now, aren’t you?
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;5:,marker:marinette_ricebun=embarrassed.png,I-I’d offer to let you borrow my bra, if it wasn’t against the rules, we seem like we’re the same size...
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;0:=calm.png,It's a bit vintage but I like the way your outfit comes together.
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kimberly&stage;0:=calm.png,Kimberly, how does your morpher work? You changed out of your costume so fast!
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kyoko&stage;0:=confident.png,Kyoko, I like your outfit!
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;mei&stage;3:=confident.png,Mei, after this, can you tutor me in Mandarin?
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;mercy&stage;1:=calm.png,Mercy, I can tell by your accent that you’re Swiss, right? My family uses only the best Swiss chocolate in their baking!
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;revy&stage;0:=confused.png,Must you be so rude and vulgar, Revy?
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;0:=confused.png,Natsuki, if you're going to be upset, it might be best not to play... I'd hate for you to get Akumatized...
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Nayru again? I just <i>love</i> your look! Um. Not that you're looking at me. Or at anyone.
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;2:=wink.png,No need to get worried, Nagisa! I’m right here with you. And friends make it better, right? Or...Um, more tolerable.
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;2:=confident.png,It’s alright, Nagisa. I can definitely tell you’re playing better than last round!
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;weiss&stage;0:=bored.png,No, not particularly. I think I have to just treat you with the Chloe protocol...Assume your bad behavior on its own isn’t enough stress to Akumatize you…
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Now you’re definitely not wearing a superhero costume...
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;neo&stage;4:=bored.png,Oh goodness, you don’t even need an akuma, you have a really vicious aura about you…
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;2:=confused.png,Oh! You worked for REVOCs, right?
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;4:=confused.png,Oh! You've been very self-conscious about this, have you been padding--
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;0:=confident.png,Oh, who was your little friend, Shimakaze?
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6b:=wink.png,Oh, you're going to undress <i>again</i>? Playing by the rules is so, so challenging, isn't it, Vriska?
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;ann&stage;0:=excited.png,Ohmygosh, Ann Takamaki!? The model from Japan? We have so much in common!
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;3:=calm.png,Okay, I’ve heard you on TV. Are you that <i>actually</i> that famous japanese runner? Miki Makimura?
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;6:=alarmed.png,O-oh no, this'll hit all of your exposed skin!
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;launch&stage;1:=alarmed.png,Please don't sneeze while you have an itchy trigger finger--
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6a:=confused.png,Please tell me you're going to dry off now. I-it's kind of hard to deal with you standing there soaked. M-my innate sense of heroism means I have to care about even <i>you, Vriska</i>.
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;red&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Red! You’re getting really…
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;0:,marker:samusplaying=wink.png,Samus Aran? I’ve heard of you!
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;1:=excited.png,Samus, my powers are kind of similar to yours! I suit up and then have to build my own powerups each time.
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;2:=confident.png,Sayaka, what's a familiar? Is it like an akuma?
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;0:,marker:seiplaying=bored.png,Sei... Asagiri. Asthagiri? Hmm... I can't tell if that's a Japanese or Indian name.
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;0:,marker:seiplaying=confident.png,So, you're another hero! Just... one of the drunker ones, it seems.
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;seven&stage;0:,marker:sevenplaying=bored.png,Seven of Nine? I’m sorry, did something get translated wrong? Sept de Neuf? Mme. Neuf?
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;3:=confident.png,Sheena, you're a summoner, right? Maybe you can help improve my bond with Tikki!
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shego&stage;1:=calm.png,Shego, you should really give up and join the forces of good! You're much to smart to help out... That bad guy you help.
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Sirens are… Kind of magical? Sort of?
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;videl&stage;3:=confident.png,So Videl, it's a shame you're losing but I guess...
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;1:=confused.png,So why a collar? Is that like… A sex thing?
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;1:=calm.png,So you and ~player~ came here together...?
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;3:=confused.png,So you can... teleport? Are you sure you don't have some sort of guardian spirit? Wait, his name is Booker? What's a Booker?
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,So, did you pick that outfit for yourself? Tikki more or less picked mine for me, but I'm pretty happy with it... usually.
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,So, now that you’re taking off… Um, the rest of your suit, are you going to tell me-- Er, us, the story?
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;5:=bored.png,So, Saki, what would you like to do after this? I have a few ideas, if you'd like!
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;5:,marker:saki_date=excited.png,(She's sure looking at ~player~ a lot...) H-hey! ~player~! A-are you enjoying Saki undressing!
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;5:,marker:saki_date=excited.png,(~player~ and Saki are looking at each other a lot...) Hmm. ~player~, do you think you'd take Saki out on a date after this?
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;1:=confident.png,So... Nayru, can you rewind time? My Miraculous lets me do that!
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;navi&stage;0:=calm.png,Soo... Navi, what's with your light?
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;dawn&stage;0:=confident.png,Sorry about that Dawn, girls with blue hair need to stick together!
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;1:=wink.png,That sweater looks pretty comfortable. And I like the color!
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;lyn&stage;0:,marker:lynplaying=excited.png,That’s a nice sword, but is it a Miraculous or is it possessed by an Akuma?
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;zizou&stage;0:=confident.png,That’s a really cool hat, Zizou!
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;4&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=alarmed.png,The akuma! It's got Nayru's--
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;7:=excited.png,The good news, Vriska, is that we could basically see everything so why don't you--
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;7:=calm.png,You know, Vriska, we've already seen your chest, so, really, you could just--
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,This is why I don't like to wear skirts...
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,You know, I think a skirt looks good on you, but I find pencil skirts really impractical...
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;0:=confident.png,Tikki is telling me you're an oracle, Nayru! What does that mean, though? (Your dress is also <i>super</i> chic!)
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;0:,marker:elaine_puns=confused.png,Ugh, puns. Always the puns.
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;0:=confused.png,You know the dealer, Elaine!?
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;weiss&stage;2:=confused.png,Uh, no, Weiss. Not quite. You’re flaunting your riches.
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Uhm. Sei, you’ve never gone mad with power, right?
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;3:=confused.png,Uhm. With the way things are going, I can see this getting very dangerous when you run out of clothes.
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;3:=confident.png,Okay. Surely you'll part with that incredibly dangerous weapon now, right?
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Um, Lilith, I think your tattoos are really cool!
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;7:=embarrassed.png,Um. I kind of saw a hint of... wour yorking with. You're working with! I-I um.
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch&stage;5:=wink.png,Um. I think people are already doing that, Wanda.
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,Um... Chun-li, I really don't want to be annoying or overly fangirl...
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Um... I know this is kind of a serious game, Chun-li, but...
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,I know this game is kind of... well, fun it's-- it's fun, but um--
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;launch&stage;7:=embarrassed.png,Um... part of me is curious to see if... you know...
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,Um...Scarlet Witch, that outfit looks… Very… Um. Everyone can almost see your…
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;0:=bored.png,U-uhm. I know you aren't here for the best reasons...
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;4:=confused.png,U-um. Do you mean that we're cheating somehow, Elaine?
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;6&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=alarmed.png,Veran, please don't destroy any more of Nayru's clothes... she might have a very embarrassing time walking home, and once you're out of energy...
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;4:=confident.png,Wait! I remembered the magic words!
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;amy_rose&stage;0:=confused.png,Wait, Amy, are you using the hedgehog Miraculous?
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;0:=alarmed.png,Wait, I think I’ve seen a statue of you. Are you really Palutena?
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;neo&stage;1:=calm.png,Wait, your name is Neopolitan... like the ice cream, or the Italian area? Do you just not speak a language with us?
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;mei&stage;1:=excited.png,Wait, you're Mei Ling, the famous climatologist?
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;3:=wink.png,Well, Elena, how does a Princess of Avalor undress? You seem to be enjoying yourself, just a little.
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,Well, I’d say you’re a Copycat but you’re really not that kind of extra character…
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;meg&stage;5:=wink.png,What does a slasher even do? Reduce prices? Not that scary!
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;lux&stage;4:=confused.png,What's your kwami like, Lux? It must be nice to have so much extra armor over your suit...
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;ann&stage;4:=excited.png,While you're here, we could stop by my parents'?
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika&stage;0:=excited.png,Whoa! You’ve got such a positive spirit, Mika!
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;2:,marker:bodysuit=alarmed.png,Whoa, Gwen, your suit? L-like, the whole thing?
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;0:=wink.png,Whoa, Uravity, you, well, manipulate gravity?
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;z03y&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,Why do I get the feeling you have an... er... intense understanding of the French Revolution?
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;0:,marker:d.vaplaying=excited.png,Wow! D.Va! I’m normally a fighting game person but everyone knows who you are!
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;dark_magician_girl&stage;0:=excited.png,Wow! I love your fashion sense...
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&timeinstage;6:=excited.png,Wow, ~name~, you haven’t gone in a while. You’re really playing well!
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;asuna&stage;4:=alarmed.png,Wow, Asuna! You have so much enchanted equipment!
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;lyn&stage;4:=excited.png,Wow, where are you from?
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;red&stage;4:=alarmed.png,W-wait, it can talk? Is this like Robustus?
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shego&stage;0:=alarmed.png,W-wait, you're Shego, right? Don't you willingly serve evil?
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;buffy&stage;0:=calm.png,W-well you did say you'd done this before. And you seem really worth getting to know.
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;buffy&stage;0:=excited.png,Hmm... Being a Slayer sounds like you could really benefit from a Miraculous...
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;6&saidmarker;null_possess:=embarrassed.png,W-well, from one magical person to another, I suppose it could be worse. You could've been Akumatized or something!
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;6:=alarmed.png,W-well, Gwen, looks like lit’s lour… looks like it’s your… Um...
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,W-well, I hope that your husband knows you're here... I-I really wouldn't want to stare-- N-not that I'm staring!
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sanako&stage;0:=confident.png,W-well, if you insist, Sanako.
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,W-well, it's Vriska's turn, but at least she's actually starting to show off more.
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,W-what's next, Chun-li? Um. Hm.
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika&stage;1:=bored.png,Yikes, and I was worried about losing my costume…
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sayori&stage;0:=confident.png,You and ~player~ seem to know each other really well, Sayori! I hope this is exciting but not embarrassing for you! Um. If it is, don't hesitate to leave!
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;ann&stage;3:=calm.png,You definitely strike me as someone who finds a good balance between hero and renegade.
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;april&stage;1:=calm.png,You know, April, my friend Alya also reports on animal-themed superheroes…
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;arwen&stage;3:=confident.png,You know, Arwen, I really meant it. You were a big inspiration... You come from such a diverse background...
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;felicia&stage;1:=confused.png,You know, I bet some people get really turned on by the whole shaving thing...
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;3:=confident.png,You know, I do have to say I really appreciate the work the police do. I don’t stop criminals of the... normal variety.
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;6:=calm.png,You know, I have to kind of grapple my way around Paris… (I should try and distract Ochako a little...)
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;red&stage;0:=confused.png,You know, I heard they let people bring weapons to the game… I was a bit surprised...
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika&stage;2:=excited.png,You know, I’m always interested in picking up new fighting techniques…
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;0:=confident.png,You know, Lilith, are the Sirens a band?
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale&stage;0:=confident.png,You know, Trainer, I’m actually in pretty good shape!
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;0:=alarmed.png,You know, without my costume, I feel a bit threatened by something that big.
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;0:=bored.png,I don't really like guns.
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;0:=confident.png,You say you’re not human originally…What were you?
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;0:=excited.png,You seem smart, Annie!
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;0:=confused.png,You sound really familiar, Shantae…
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;2:=wink.png,You speak French too, so it's not that much of a stretch! But it's a bit of a faux pas to use your names and powers at the same time, oui?
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;6:=bored.png,You think love triangles are hard?
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;4:=excited.png,You’re pretty different from the others. More sarcastic than Nino, smarter than Chloe, cuter than Alyx...
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;1:=confident.png,You’re worth lots, Nagisa. Don’t lose heart, everyone can enjoy time with friends!
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Are you in surry to hemove your rocks? Er. A hurry to remove your socks, Nagisa?
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;1:,marker:nagisa_time_travel=calm.png,Hmm… Tarou Urashima… That’s the story about the time traveler… But why would that make you ahead…?
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;7:=alarmed.png,You're so eager to get naked!
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;5&saidmarker;null_possess:=wink.png,You're so gracious, Nayru! I-I wish I were more like you. I hope I wasn't <i>too</i> much of a sputtering mess when it was my turn to... show my...
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shego&stage;3:=confused.png,Y-you really don't know when to quit, do you, Shego? I'm really not enjoying this game you're making the heroes play!
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;juri:=calm.png,(Whoa! Chun-Li is so cool! Juri's taunting her and she just keeps her composure! She really <i>is</i> a hero!)
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;futaba:,marker:saki_befriend_mariba=embarrassed.png,<i>Psst</i>! Futaba! <i>Psst!</i>

7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;florina:=alarmed.png,Aimee, how can you scare a sweet and innocent person like Florina? Won’t you think of her?
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;aimee&stage;1-7:=alarmed.png,Between Aimee and Shimakaze, I can see why Tikki wanted me to come here! This is all terribly unsafe!

7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;3:,count-role;other&character;lyn:=confused.png,Hm. You and Lyn both come from the same place, right? Are the Sacean Plains the fashionable part of the world?
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;natsuki:,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;viewers>=8&notsaidmarker;nat_apron1&sayingmarker;nat_apron1:=excited.png,I bet you’re really good at baking, too, Natsuki!
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;weiss:,count-role;other&character;aimee&stage;0:=wink.png,I guess she’s just less attached to her weapon, Aimee. You know, like a reasonable person.
7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;3:,count-role;other&character;rinkah:=confused.png,I hope that wasn’t an insulting statement earlier...Red eyes and pale hair are very unusual where I’m from...

7-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&saidmarker;smallcount:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;smallcount0:,marker:smallcount0=embarrassed.png,I-I mean if giving up small stuff protects you from feeling poorly, then it definitely counts!

-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;erufuda&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Er... I'm glad you're so fascinated with um... one aspect of French cuisine, Erufuda, but there's more to it than just fries!
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;revy&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Er... Revy, have you considered putting down the guns?
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;1:=confused.png,Er... what's that sound... Shimakaze?
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;chica&stage;0:=confused.png,Er… Freddy Fazbear’s? I think I’ve heard of that restaurant...
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,Er… Ochako, Hawkmoth kind of does send butterflies after people…
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;1:=wink.png,Er… you’re kinda shy about this, huh, Ochako?
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,Erk, sorry Nagisa. But at least you’re experiencing something new?
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;4:,marker:bun_puns=excited.png,Nagisa, I can smell the bakery on you!
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;felicia&stage;0:=confused.png,Err... N-not really the kitty I normally work with...
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;6:=alarmed.png,Er-Well. Um. I-
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;6:=embarrassed.png,I-Um. Okay! Something!
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;7:=wink.png,Florina… Florina… Hey, Florina… It’s your turn...
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;3:=bored.png,For such elaborate armor and such a striking appearance, I have to say your attire... Uhm. Isn't quite as interesting.
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;6:=embarrassed.png,Gah! Elaine! You shouldn't threaten the dealer like that!
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;6:=confused.png,I know he's kind of shifty, but you shouldn't threaten the dealer, Elaine!
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;0:=bored.png,GoGo Tomago? Didn’t your friend just buy you equipment for your powers?
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;1:=excited.png,Great! I know you're quite a skilled warrior, and you definitely don't seem to be having a crisis of confidence.
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Y-you know. I really hope this isn't a tactical maneuver to get at my Miraculous... Hawk Moth's tried that a few times...
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;0:=confused.png,Hey Saki, you look a little tired. Is everything okay?
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;0:=bored.png,Saki, are you doing okay?
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;himeko&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,H-hey! Calm down, Sailor Psycho! This is supposed to be fun!
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;2:=bored.png,Hm? Kyu is...?
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;1:=confident.png,Hmm, okay, so you aren’t a swordswoman. Do you manipulate time? Maybe… You have a thing for girls with pink hair?
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;jane&stage;0:=confident.png,Hmm, that’s really well worn! Is it an Agreste?
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sanako&stage;1:=confused.png,Hmm... (I think Sanako knows something I don't...)
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;alpha&stage;0:,marker:alphaplaying=confused.png,Hmm... So you're digital? As in you aren't real?
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;2:=excited.png,Hmm... You know, I'm not an armorer... But I can see some... Stylistic... Improvements I could make.
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;2:=confused.png,Is all armor from... Hmm... Is it all so complicated?
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;pearl&stage;1:=confused.png,Hmm... You seem a bit... unusual, Pearl.
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sharla&stage;0:=confused.png,Hmm... You seem familiar...
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;3:=confident.png,Hmm...I don’t think anyone will laugh, Nagisa. And that’s a really clever idea!
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;1:=wink.png,Hmm...Palutena, you’re a little bit of a trickster, aren’t you? I bet you and Tikki would get along.
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Hmm… Is this to psyche us out, or to distract us?
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;navi&stage;1:=confused.png,Huh. You know, I've never seen Tikki wear clothes...
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;2:=excited.png,I <i>do</i> really like your clothes. They're so nautical and streamlined! I bet you like to go really fast, huh, Shimakaze?
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kimberly&stage;1:=confident.png,I <i>love</i> your whole aesthetic. To be honest, I think I'd just be giving too much away if I were polka-dotted all the time though.
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;2:=calm.png,I actually think we’d have gotten along well in high school, Daria.
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;mercy&stage;3:=wink.png,I bet Medicens Sans Frontieres would really benefit with you as its face, should Overwatch ever be too much, Mercy.
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;juri&stage;0:=alarmed.png,I can see that you're not exactly a positive sort, are you, Juri?
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;streaming-chan&stage;4:=confused.png,I can’t tell if this is some kind of performance art, Streaming-chan…
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;4:=confused.png,I don't really drink but... Wow, those look tasty.
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;5:=wink.png,I feel like you have a lot to teach me, Kyu! Um. If you’re willing to teach in a less-than-embarrassing way.
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,I fight a villain who has… I guess in your terms a Quirk…
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;0:=confident.png,I guess you're not <i>so</i> lucky after all, Vriska!
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;1:=wink.png,I have to say, I kind of like your outfit better, Sayaka!
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;tracer:=calm.png,I hear you like to zip around…
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;navi&stage;2:=confident.png,I liked your flower, Navi!
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;yang&stage;0:,marker:yangplaying=confident.png,I only hope your fighting style is as over-developed as the rest of you.
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;4:=confident.png,I really admire someone who can wear a skirt. I'm... really not a dress type of girl.
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;tracer&stage;3:=wink.png,I see London, I’ve seen France...
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;7:=calm.png,I tend to like more natural looks.
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;5&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=bored.png,I think I get it. You aren't an akuma, even if you're kind of a jerk, huh, Veran? You're sort of like Nayru's Kwami, aren't you?
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;1:=excited.png,I think there's probably a Songbird miraculous to go with your locket! It seems like it's a good fit for you, for some reason, Elizabeth!
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;raven&stage;3:=confident.png,I think we have a lot in common, Raven!
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;2:=wink.png,I thought mercenary-types regularly played cards in seedy bars. A-are you just throwing?
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sayla&stage;2:=confident.png,I’ve never seen a military outfit like that one before, Sayla. I like it, it’s very bright! Judging by your attitude, you’re bright as well!
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;2:=excited.png,If her mech weren’t just technology, I could be convinced that D.Va is Hana’s superhero identity.
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,If it makes you feel better, I think it's a pretty skirt.
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,I-I can’t tell if I’ve been working too hard.
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,I-I know this is kind of an odd way to meet, Chun-li, but I want you to know you were a huge inspiration to me when I started hero-ing!
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;0:=alarmed.png,I know this is an odd meet to way-- way to meet but hero you're my Chun-li! An inspiration! G-gah!
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;0:,marker:florinaplaying=embarrassed.png,I-I like your hair, Florina!
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,I-I'd rather not delve into insults, Elaine!
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Um... Could we maybe speak in French instead of Spanish, Elaine?
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,I-I'm a little worried about the continued gunplay, Aimee.
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:=bored.png,Aimee, this is getting really dangerous. Without clothes or armor...
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;3:=bored.png,I'm actually starting to enjoy the fireworks. I'm sorry your stuff's being damaged though...
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4:=confused.png,I'm glad <i>this</i> tasteless display is over. Ugh.
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4:=bored.png,What is <i>wrong</i> with you, Vriska? How tasteless.
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;5:=confused.png,I'm glad the explosions haven't... um... shown your panties... or your... I don't know enough nautical terminology to figure out what you'd call it...
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;2:=bored.png,I'm glad you're still going slow, Ochako.
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,I'm going to assume you'll be keeping the gun...
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;4:=bored.png,Aimee, I'll even help you undress if you just... stop shooting. Please. For goodness sakes.
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;4&saidmarker;null_possess:=confident.png,I'm so proud of you, Nayru! I know this isn't easy, but you're sticking with it! That's wonderful!
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1:=confused.png,I'm starting to think that dice of yours is definitely the host of an akuma... Master Fuu wouldn't have trusted a Miraculous to... Er... Someone like <i>you</i>.
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1:=bored.png,I'm really starting to wonder if your dice is just an akuma target and I'm a big idiot for not noticing sooner.
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;6:=bored.png,I'm still mad you added extra layers, but I suppose I'm not exactly exempt from that...
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;ann&stage;6:=confused.png,Is your hair natural? I've heard you're a quarter American, but...
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;3:=bored.png,It looks like Moon isn’t possessed by an Akuma… She’s just kind of like this?
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;5:=calm.png,It’s okay Nagisa. Sometimes, the people you meet in passing, you get to know far better than you might think.
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;5:=excited.png,Wow Nagisa! You’re really giving it your all now, aren’t you?
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;5:,marker:marinette_ricebun=embarrassed.png,I-I’d offer to let you borrow my bra, if it wasn’t against the rules, we seem like we’re the same size...
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;0:=calm.png,It's a bit vintage but I like the way your outfit comes together.
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kimberly&stage;0:=calm.png,Kimberly, how does your morpher work? You changed out of your costume so fast!
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kyoko&stage;0:=confident.png,Kyoko, I like your outfit!
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;mei&stage;3:=confident.png,Mei, after this, can you tutor me in Mandarin?
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;mercy&stage;1:=calm.png,Mercy, I can tell by your accent that you’re Swiss, right? My family uses only the best Swiss chocolate in their baking!
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;revy&stage;0:=confused.png,Must you be so rude and vulgar, Revy?
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;0:=confused.png,Natsuki, if you're going to be upset, it might be best not to play... I'd hate for you to get Akumatized...
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Nayru again? I just <i>love</i> your look! Um. Not that you're looking at me. Or at anyone.
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;2:=wink.png,No need to get worried, Nagisa! I’m right here with you. And friends make it better, right? Or...Um, more tolerable.
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;2:=confident.png,It’s alright, Nagisa. I can definitely tell you’re playing better than last round!
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;weiss&stage;0:=bored.png,No, not particularly. I think I have to just treat you with the Chloe protocol...Assume your bad behavior on its own isn’t enough stress to Akumatize you…
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Now you’re definitely not wearing a superhero costume...
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;neo&stage;4:=bored.png,Oh goodness, you don’t even need an akuma, you have a really vicious aura about you…
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;2:=confused.png,Oh! You worked for REVOCs, right?
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;4:=confused.png,Oh! You've been very self-conscious about this, have you been padding--
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;0:=confident.png,Oh, who was your little friend, Shimakaze?
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6b:=wink.png,Oh, you're going to undress <i>again</i>? Playing by the rules is so, so challenging, isn't it, Vriska?
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;ann&stage;0:=excited.png,Ohmygosh, Ann Takamaki!? The model from Japan? We have so much in common!
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;3:=calm.png,Okay, I’ve heard you on TV. Are you that <i>actually</i> that famous japanese runner? Miki Makimura?
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;6:=alarmed.png,O-oh no, this'll hit all of your exposed skin!
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;launch&stage;1:=alarmed.png,Please don't sneeze while you have an itchy trigger finger--
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6a:=confused.png,Please tell me you're going to dry off now. I-it's kind of hard to deal with you standing there soaked. M-my innate sense of heroism means I have to care about even <i>you, Vriska</i>.
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;red&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Red! You’re getting really…
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;0:,marker:samusplaying=wink.png,Samus Aran? I’ve heard of you!
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;1:=excited.png,Samus, my powers are kind of similar to yours! I suit up and then have to build my own powerups each time.
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;2:=confident.png,Sayaka, what's a familiar? Is it like an akuma?
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;0:,marker:seiplaying=bored.png,Sei... Asagiri. Asthagiri? Hmm... I can't tell if that's a Japanese or Indian name.
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;0:,marker:seiplaying=confident.png,So, you're another hero! Just... one of the drunker ones, it seems.
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;seven&stage;0:,marker:sevenplaying=bored.png,Seven of Nine? I’m sorry, did something get translated wrong? Sept de Neuf? Mme. Neuf?
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;3:=confident.png,Sheena, you're a summoner, right? Maybe you can help improve my bond with Tikki!
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shego&stage;1:=calm.png,Shego, you should really give up and join the forces of good! You're much to smart to help out... That bad guy you help.
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;5:=confused.png,Show yours…? <i>Gwen,</i> <i>tu m'as donne un nouveau fetiche devant tou le monde. </i>
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Sirens are… Kind of magical? Sort of?
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;1:=confused.png,So why a collar? Is that like… A sex thing?
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;1:=calm.png,So you and ~player~ came here together...?
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;3:=confused.png,So you can... teleport? Are you sure you don't have some sort of guardian spirit? Wait, his name is Booker? What's a Booker?
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,So, did you pick that outfit for yourself? Tikki more or less picked mine for me, but I'm pretty happy with it... usually.
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,So, now that you’re taking off… Um, the rest of your suit, are you going to tell me-- Er, us, the story?
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;5:=bored.png,So, Saki, what would you like to do after this? I have a few ideas, if you'd like!
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;5:,marker:saki_date=excited.png,(She's sure looking at ~player~ a lot...) H-hey! ~player~! A-are you enjoying Saki undressing!
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;5:,marker:saki_date=excited.png,(~player~ and Saki are looking at each other a lot...) Hmm. ~player~, do you think you'd take Saki out on a date after this?
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;1:=confident.png,So... Nayru, can you rewind time? My Miraculous lets me do that!
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;navi&stage;0:=calm.png,Soo... Navi, what's with your light?
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;dawn&stage;0:=confident.png,Sorry about that Dawn, girls with blue hair need to stick together!
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;1:=wink.png,That sweater looks pretty comfortable. And I like the color!
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;zizou&stage;0:=confident.png,That’s a really cool hat, Zizou!
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;4&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=alarmed.png,The akuma! It's got Nayru's--
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;7:=excited.png,The good news, Vriska, is that we could basically see everything so why don't you--
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;7:=calm.png,You know, Vriska, we've already seen your chest, so, really, you could just--
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,This is why I don't like to wear skirts...
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,You know, I think a skirt looks good on you, but I find pencil skirts really impractical...
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;0:=confident.png,Tikki is telling me you're an oracle, Nayru! What does that mean, though? (Your dress is also <i>super</i> chic!)
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;0:,marker:elaine_puns=confused.png,Ugh, puns. Always the puns.
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;0:=confused.png,You know the dealer, Elaine!?
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;weiss&stage;2:=confused.png,Uh, no, Weiss. Not quite. You’re flaunting your riches.
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Uhm. Sei, you’ve never gone mad with power, right?
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;3:=confused.png,Uhm. With the way things are going, I can see this getting very dangerous when you run out of clothes.
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;3:=confident.png,Okay. Surely you'll part with that incredibly dangerous weapon now, right?
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Um, Lilith, I think your tattoos are really cool!
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;7:=embarrassed.png,Um. I kind of saw a hint of... wour yorking with. You're working with! I-I um.
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch&stage;5:=wink.png,Um. I think people are already doing that, Wanda.
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,Um. I'd be a LOT more comfortable if you put away your gun.
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,Um... Chun-li, I really don't want to be annoying or overly fangirl...
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Um... I know this is kind of a serious game, Chun-li, but...
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,I know this game is kind of... well, fun it's-- it's fun, but um--
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;launch&stage;7:=embarrassed.png,Um... part of me is curious to see if... you know...
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,Um...Scarlet Witch, that outfit looks… Very… Um. Everyone can almost see your…
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;0:=bored.png,U-uhm. I know you aren't here for the best reasons...
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;4:=confused.png,U-um. Do you mean that we're cheating somehow, Elaine?
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;6&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=alarmed.png,Veran, please don't destroy any more of Nayru's clothes... she might have a very embarrassing time walking home, and once you're out of energy...
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;4:=confident.png,Wait! I remembered the magic words!
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;amy_rose&stage;0:=confused.png,Wait, Amy, are you using the hedgehog Miraculous?
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;0:=alarmed.png,Wait, I think I’ve seen a statue of you. Are you really Palutena?
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;neo&stage;1:=calm.png,Wait, your name is Neopolitan... like the ice cream, or the Italian area? Do you just not speak a language with us?

-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,I-I'm a little worried about the continued gunplay, Aimee.
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:=bored.png,Aimee, this is getting really dangerous. Without clothes or armor...
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;3:=bored.png,I'm actually starting to enjoy the fireworks. I'm sorry your stuff's being damaged though...
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4:=confused.png,I'm glad <i>this</i> tasteless display is over. Ugh.
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4:=bored.png,What is <i>wrong</i> with you, Vriska? How tasteless.
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;5:=confused.png,I'm glad the explosions haven't... um... shown your panties... or your... I don't know enough nautical terminology to figure out what you'd call it...
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;2:=bored.png,I'm glad you're still going slow, Ochako.
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,I'm going to assume you'll be keeping the gun...
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;4:=bored.png,Aimee, I'll even help you undress if you just... stop shooting. Please. For goodness sakes.
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;4&saidmarker;null_possess:=confident.png,I'm so proud of you, Nayru! I know this isn't easy, but you're sticking with it! That's wonderful!
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1:=confused.png,I'm starting to think that dice of yours is definitely the host of an akuma... Master Fuu wouldn't have trusted a Miraculous to... Er... Someone like <i>you</i>.
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1:=bored.png,I'm really starting to wonder if your dice is just an akuma target and I'm a big idiot for not noticing sooner.
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;6:=bored.png,I'm still mad you added extra layers, but I suppose I'm not exactly exempt from that...
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;ann&stage;6:=confused.png,Is your hair natural? I've heard you're a quarter American, but...
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;5:=calm.png,It’s okay Nagisa. Sometimes, the people you meet in passing, you get to know far better than you might think.
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;5:=excited.png,Wow Nagisa! You’re really giving it your all now, aren’t you?
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;5:,marker:marinette_ricebun=embarrassed.png,I-I’d offer to let you borrow my bra, if it wasn’t against the rules, we seem like we’re the same size...
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;0:=calm.png,It's a bit vintage but I like the way your outfit comes together.
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kyoko&stage;0:=confident.png,Kyoko, I like your outfit!
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;mei&stage;3:=confident.png,Mei, after this, can you tutor me in Mandarin?
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;revy&stage;0:=confused.png,Must you be so rude and vulgar, Revy?
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;0:=confused.png,Natsuki, if you're going to be upset, it might be best not to play... I'd hate for you to get Akumatized...
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Nayru again? I just <i>love</i> your look! Um. Not that you're looking at me. Or at anyone.
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;2:=wink.png,No need to get worried, Nagisa! I’m right here with you. And friends make it better, right? Or...Um, more tolerable.
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;2:=confident.png,It’s alright, Nagisa. I can definitely tell you’re playing better than last round!
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;weiss&stage;0:=bored.png,No, not particularly. I think I have to just treat you with the Chloe protocol...Assume your bad behavior on its own isn’t enough stress to Akumatize you…
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Now you’re definitely not wearing a superhero costume...
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;neo&stage;4:=bored.png,Oh goodness, you don’t even need an akuma, you have a really vicious aura about you…
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;2:=confused.png,Oh! You worked for REVOCs, right?
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;4:=confused.png,Oh! You've been very self-conscious about this, have you been padding--
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;0:=confident.png,Oh, who was your little friend, Shimakaze?
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6b:=wink.png,Oh, you're going to undress <i>again</i>? Playing by the rules is so, so challenging, isn't it, Vriska?
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;ann&stage;0:=excited.png,Ohmygosh, Ann Takamaki!? The model from Japan? We have so much in common!
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;3:=calm.png,Okay, I’ve heard you on TV. Are you that <i>actually</i> that famous japanese runner? Miki Makimura?
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;6:=alarmed.png,O-oh no, this'll hit all of your exposed skin!
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;launch&stage;1:=alarmed.png,Please don't sneeze while you have an itchy trigger finger--
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6a:=confused.png,Please tell me you're going to dry off now. I-it's kind of hard to deal with you standing there soaked. M-my innate sense of heroism means I have to care about even <i>you, Vriska</i>.
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;red&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Red! You’re getting really…
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;0:,marker:samusplaying=wink.png,Samus Aran? I’ve heard of you!
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;1:=excited.png,Samus, my powers are kind of similar to yours! I suit up and then have to build my own powerups each time.
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;2:=confident.png,Sayaka, what's a familiar? Is it like an akuma?
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;0:,marker:seiplaying=bored.png,Sei... Asagiri. Asthagiri? Hmm... I can't tell if that's a Japanese or Indian name.
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;0:,marker:seiplaying=confident.png,So, you're another hero! Just... one of the drunker ones, it seems.
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;seven&stage;0:,marker:sevenplaying=bored.png,Seven of Nine? I’m sorry, did something get translated wrong? Sept de Neuf? Mme. Neuf?
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;3:=confident.png,Sheena, you're a summoner, right? Maybe you can help improve my bond with Tikki!
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shego&stage;1:=calm.png,Shego, you should really give up and join the forces of good! You're much to smart to help out... That bad guy you help.
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;5:=confused.png,Show yours…? <i>Gwen,</i> <i>tu m'as donne un nouveau fetiche devant tou le monde. </i>
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Sirens are… Kind of magical? Sort of?
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;1:=confused.png,So why a collar? Is that like… A sex thing?
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;1:=calm.png,So you and ~player~ came here together...?
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;3:=confused.png,So you can... teleport? Are you sure you don't have some sort of guardian spirit? Wait, his name is Booker? What's a Booker?
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,So, did you pick that outfit for yourself? Tikki more or less picked mine for me, but I'm pretty happy with it... usually.
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,So, now that you’re taking off… Um, the rest of your suit, are you going to tell me-- Er, us, the story?
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;5:=bored.png,So, Saki, what would you like to do after this? I have a few ideas, if you'd like!
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;5:,marker:saki_date=excited.png,(She's sure looking at ~player~ a lot...) H-hey! ~player~! A-are you enjoying Saki undressing!
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;5:,marker:saki_date=excited.png,(~player~ and Saki are looking at each other a lot...) Hmm. ~player~, do you think you'd take Saki out on a date after this?
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;1:=confident.png,So... Nayru, can you rewind time? My Miraculous lets me do that!
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;navi&stage;0:=calm.png,Soo... Navi, what's with your light?
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;dawn&stage;0:=confident.png,Sorry about that Dawn, girls with blue hair need to stick together!
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;1:=wink.png,That sweater looks pretty comfortable. And I like the color!
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;zizou&stage;0:=confident.png,That’s a really cool hat, Zizou!
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;4&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=alarmed.png,The akuma! It's got Nayru's--
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;7:=excited.png,The good news, Vriska, is that we could basically see everything so why don't you--
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;7:=calm.png,You know, Vriska, we've already seen your chest, so, really, you could just--
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,This is why I don't like to wear skirts...
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,You know, I think a skirt looks good on you, but I find pencil skirts really impractical...
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;0:=confident.png,Tikki is telling me you're an oracle, Nayru! What does that mean, though? (Your dress is also <i>super</i> chic!)
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;0:,marker:elaine_puns=confused.png,Ugh, puns. Always the puns.
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;0:=confused.png,You know the dealer, Elaine!?
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;weiss&stage;2:=confused.png,Uh, no, Weiss. Not quite. You’re flaunting your riches.
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Uhm. Sei, you’ve never gone mad with power, right?
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;3:=confused.png,Uhm. With the way things are going, I can see this getting very dangerous when you run out of clothes.
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;3:=confident.png,Okay. Surely you'll part with that incredibly dangerous weapon now, right?
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Um, Lilith, I think your tattoos are really cool!
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;7:=embarrassed.png,Um. I kind of saw a hint of... wour yorking with. You're working with! I-I um.
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch&stage;5:=wink.png,Um. I think people are already doing that, Wanda.
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,Um. I'd be a LOT more comfortable if you put away your gun.
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,Um... Chun-li, I really don't want to be annoying or overly fangirl...
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Um... I know this is kind of a serious game, Chun-li, but...
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,I know this game is kind of... well, fun it's-- it's fun, but um--
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;launch&stage;7:=embarrassed.png,Um... part of me is curious to see if... you know...
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,Um...Scarlet Witch, that outfit looks… Very… Um. Everyone can almost see your…
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;0:=bored.png,U-uhm. I know you aren't here for the best reasons...
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;4:=confused.png,U-um. Do you mean that we're cheating somehow, Elaine?
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;6&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=alarmed.png,Veran, please don't destroy any more of Nayru's clothes... she might have a very embarrassing time walking home, and once you're out of energy...
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;amy_rose&stage;0:=confused.png,Wait, Amy, are you using the hedgehog Miraculous?
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;0:=alarmed.png,Wait, I think I’ve seen a statue of you. Are you really Palutena?
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;neo&stage;1:=calm.png,Wait, your name is Neopolitan... like the ice cream, or the Italian area? Do you just not speak a language with us?
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;mei&stage;1:=excited.png,Wait, you're Mei Ling, the famous climatologist?
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;3:=wink.png,Well, Elena, how does a Princess of Avalor undress? You seem to be enjoying yourself, just a little.
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,Well, I’d say you’re a Copycat but you’re really not that kind of extra character…
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;lux&stage;4:=confused.png,What's your kwami like, Lux? It must be nice to have so much extra armor over your suit...
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;ann&stage;4:=excited.png,While you're here, we could stop by my parents'?
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika&stage;0:=excited.png,Whoa! You’ve got such a positive spirit, Mika!
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;2:,marker:bodysuit=alarmed.png,Whoa, Gwen, your suit? L-like, the whole thing?
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;0:=wink.png,Whoa, Uravity, you, well, manipulate gravity?
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;z03y&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,Why do I get the feeling you have an... er... intense understanding of the French Revolution?
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;0:,marker:d.vaplaying=excited.png,Wow! D.Va! I’m normally a fighting game person but everyone knows who you are!
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;dark_magician_girl&stage;0:=excited.png,Wow! I love your fashion sense...
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&timeinstage;6:=excited.png,Wow, ~name~, you haven’t gone in a while. You’re really playing well!
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;asuna&stage;4:=alarmed.png,Wow, Asuna! You have so much enchanted equipment!
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;lyn&stage;4:=excited.png,Wow, where are you from?
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;red&stage;4:=alarmed.png,W-wait, it can talk? Is this like Robustus?
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shego&stage;0:=alarmed.png,W-wait, you're Shego, right? Don't you willingly serve evil?
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;buffy&stage;0:=calm.png,W-well you did say you'd done this before. And you seem really worth getting to know.
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;buffy&stage;0:=excited.png,Hmm... Being a Slayer sounds like you could really benefit from a Miraculous...
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;6&saidmarker;null_possess:=embarrassed.png,W-well, from one magical person to another, I suppose it could be worse. You could've been Akumatized or something!
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;6:=alarmed.png,W-well, Gwen, looks like lit’s lour… looks like it’s your… Um...
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,W-well, I hope that your husband knows you're here... I-I really wouldn't want to stare-- N-not that I'm staring!
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sanako&stage;0:=confident.png,W-well, if you insist, Sanako.
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,W-well, it's Vriska's turn, but at least she's actually starting to show off more.
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;3:=alarmed.png,W-well. Sorry Elena. Maybe you should ask your spirit guide for help? Tikki <i>usually</i> has good advice...
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,Elena, it's... Uhm. Bad luck to assume you don't need to prepare...
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,W-what's next, Chun-li? Um. Hm.
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika&stage;1:=bored.png,Yikes, and I was worried about losing my costume…
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sayori&stage;0:=confident.png,You and ~player~ seem to know each other really well, Sayori! I hope this is exciting but not embarrassing for you! Um. If it is, don't hesitate to leave!
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;ann&stage;3:=calm.png,You definitely strike me as someone who finds a good balance between hero and renegade.
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;april&stage;1:=calm.png,You know, April, my friend Alya also reports on animal-themed superheroes…
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;arwen&stage;3:=confident.png,You know, Arwen, I really meant it. You were a big inspiration... You come from such a diverse background...
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;felicia&stage;1:=confused.png,You know, I bet some people get really turned on by the whole shaving thing...
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;3:=confident.png,You know, I do have to say I really appreciate the work the police do. I don’t stop criminals of the... normal variety.
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;6:=calm.png,You know, I have to kind of grapple my way around Paris… (I should try and distract Ochako a little...)
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;red&stage;0:=confused.png,You know, I heard they let people bring weapons to the game… I was a bit surprised...
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika&stage;2:=excited.png,You know, I’m always interested in picking up new fighting techniques…
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;0:=confident.png,You know, Lilith, are the Sirens a band?
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale&stage;0:=confident.png,You know, Trainer, I’m actually in pretty good shape!
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;0:=confident.png,You say you’re not human originally…What were you?
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;0:=excited.png,You seem smart, Annie!
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;0:=confused.png,You sound really familiar, Shantae…
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;2:=wink.png,You speak French too, so it's not that much of a stretch! But it's a bit of a faux pas to use your names and powers at the same time, oui?
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;6:=bored.png,You think love triangles are hard?
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;4:=excited.png,You’re pretty different from the others. More sarcastic than Nino, smarter than Chloe, cuter than Alyx...
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;1:=confident.png,You’re worth lots, Nagisa. Don’t lose heart, everyone can enjoy time with friends!
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Are you in surry to hemove your rocks? Er. A hurry to remove your socks, Nagisa?
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;1:,marker:nagisa_time_travel=calm.png,Hmm… Tarou Urashima… That’s the story about the time traveler… But why would that make you ahead…?
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;1:=alarmed.png,Your shoes? I'm well past shoes, Princess. Maybe you aren't so different from Chloe.
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;7:=alarmed.png,You're so eager to get naked!
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;5&saidmarker;null_possess:=wink.png,You're so gracious, Nayru! I-I wish I were more like you. I hope I wasn't <i>too</i> much of a sputtering mess when it was my turn to... show my...
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shego&stage;3:=confused.png,Y-you really don't know when to quit, do you, Shego? I'm really not enjoying this game you're making the heroes play!
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;juri:=calm.png,(Whoa! Chun-Li is so cool! Juri's taunting her and she just keeps her composure! She really <i>is</i> a hero!)

-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;florina:=alarmed.png,Aimee, how can you scare a sweet and innocent person like Florina? Won’t you think of her?
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;aimee&stage;1-7:=alarmed.png,Between Aimee and Shimakaze, I can see why Tikki wanted me to come here! This is all terribly unsafe!

-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;0:=confident.png,Ah, don’t worry Nagisa, we’ll see this through together!
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;0:=calm.png,Aimee... I can't quite place your accent... But you sound... American?

-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;chiaki&stage;0:=bored.png,Er... I know your type, Chiaki. Do you get really embarrassed when you lose?
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;6:=wink.png,Er... If you come to Paris I can definitely get you some new clothes as it seems like you're rubbing out.
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;erufuda&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Er... I'm glad you're so fascinated with um... one aspect of French cuisine, Erufuda, but there's more to it than just fries!

-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;6:=confused.png,I know he's kind of shifty, but you shouldn't threaten the dealer, Elaine!
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;0:=bored.png,GoGo Tomago? Didn’t your friend just buy you equipment for your powers?
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;1:=excited.png,Great! I know you're quite a skilled warrior, and you definitely don't seem to be having a crisis of confidence.
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Y-you know. I really hope this isn't a tactical maneuver to get at my Miraculous... Hawk Moth's tried that a few times...

-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;1:=confident.png,Hmm, okay, so you aren’t a swordswoman. Do you manipulate time? Maybe… You have a thing for girls with pink hair?
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;jane&stage;0:=confident.png,Hmm, that’s really well worn! Is it an Agreste?
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sanako&stage;1:=confused.png,Hmm... (I think Sanako knows something I don't...)

-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;pearl&stage;1:=confused.png,Hmm... You seem a bit... unusual, Pearl.
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sharla&stage;0:=confused.png,Hmm... You seem familiar...
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;3:=confident.png,Hmm...I don’t think anyone will laugh, Nagisa. And that’s a really clever idea!
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;1:=wink.png,Hmm...Palutena, you’re a little bit of a trickster, aren’t you? I bet you and Tikki would get along.
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Hmm… Is this to psyche us out, or to distract us?
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;navi&stage;1:=confused.png,Huh. You know, I've never seen Tikki wear clothes...
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;2:=excited.png,I <i>do</i> really like your clothes. They're so nautical and streamlined! I bet you like to go really fast, huh, Shimakaze?
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kimberly&stage;1:=confident.png,I <i>love</i> your whole aesthetic. To be honest, I think I'd just be giving too much away if I were polka-dotted all the time though.
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;2:=calm.png,I actually think we’d have gotten along well in high school, Daria.
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;mercy&stage;3:=wink.png,I bet Medicens Sans Frontieres would really benefit with you as its face, should Overwatch ever be too much, Mercy.
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;juri&stage;0:=alarmed.png,I can see that you're not exactly a positive sort, are you, Juri?
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;streaming-chan&stage;4:=confused.png,I can’t tell if this is some kind of performance art, Streaming-chan…
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;4:=confused.png,I don't really drink but... Wow, those look tasty.
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;5:=wink.png,I feel like you have a lot to teach me, Kyu! Um. If you’re willing to teach in a less-than-embarrassing way.
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,I fight a villain who has… I guess in your terms a Quirk…
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;0:=confident.png,I guess you're not <i>so</i> lucky after all, Vriska!
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;1:=wink.png,I have to say, I kind of like your outfit better, Sayaka!
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;navi&stage;2:=confident.png,I liked your flower, Navi!

-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;4:=confident.png,I really admire someone who can wear a skirt. I'm... really not a dress type of girl.

-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;7:=calm.png,I tend to like more natural looks.
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;5&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=bored.png,I think I get it. You aren't an akuma, even if you're kind of a jerk, huh, Veran? You're sort of like Nayru's Kwami, aren't you?
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;1:=excited.png,I think there's probably a Songbird miraculous to go with your locket! It seems like it's a good fit for you, for some reason, Elizabeth!
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;raven&stage;3:=confident.png,I think we have a lot in common, Raven!
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;2:=wink.png,I thought mercenary-types regularly played cards in seedy bars. A-are you just throwing?
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sayla&stage;2:=confident.png,I’ve never seen a military outfit like that one before, Sayla. I like it, it’s very bright! Judging by your attitude, you’re bright as well!
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;2:=excited.png,If her mech weren’t just technology, I could be convinced that D.Va is Hana’s superhero identity.
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,I-I can’t tell if I’ve been working too hard.
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,I-I know this is kind of an odd way to meet, Chun-li, but I want you to know you were a huge inspiration to me when I started hero-ing!

-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;0:,marker:florinaplaying=embarrassed.png,I-I like your hair, Florina!
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,I-I'd rather not delve into insults, Elaine!
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Um... Could we maybe speak in French instead of Spanish, Elaine?
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,I-I'm a little worried about the continued gunplay, Aimee.
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:=bored.png,Aimee, this is getting really dangerous. Without clothes or armor...
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;3:=bored.png,I'm actually starting to enjoy the fireworks. I'm sorry your stuff's being damaged though...
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4:=confused.png,I'm glad <i>this</i> tasteless display is over. Ugh.
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4:=bored.png,What is <i>wrong</i> with you, Vriska? How tasteless.
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;5:=confused.png,I'm glad the explosions haven't... um... shown your panties... or your... I don't know enough nautical terminology to figure out what you'd call it...
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;2:=bored.png,I'm glad you're still going slow, Ochako.
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,I'm going to assume you'll be keeping the gun...
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;4:=bored.png,Aimee, I'll even help you undress if you just... stop shooting. Please. For goodness sakes.
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;4&saidmarker;null_possess:=confident.png,I'm so proud of you, Nayru! I know this isn't easy, but you're sticking with it! That's wonderful!
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1:=confused.png,I'm starting to think that dice of yours is definitely the host of an akuma... Master Fuu wouldn't have trusted a Miraculous to... Er... Someone like <i>you</i>.
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1:=bored.png,I'm really starting to wonder if your dice is just an akuma target and I'm a big idiot for not noticing sooner.
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;6:=bored.png,I'm still mad you added extra layers, but I suppose I'm not exactly exempt from that...
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;ann&stage;6:=confused.png,Is your hair natural? I've heard you're a quarter American, but...
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;5:=calm.png,It’s okay Nagisa. Sometimes, the people you meet in passing, you get to know far better than you might think.
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;5:=excited.png,Wow Nagisa! You’re really giving it your all now, aren’t you?
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;5:,marker:marinette_ricebun=embarrassed.png,I-I’d offer to let you borrow my bra, if it wasn’t against the rules, we seem like we’re the same size...
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;0:=calm.png,It's a bit vintage but I like the way your outfit comes together.
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kyoko&stage;0:=confident.png,Kyoko, I like your outfit!
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;mei&stage;3:=confident.png,Mei, after this, can you tutor me in Mandarin?
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;mercy&stage;1:=calm.png,Mercy, I can tell by your accent that you’re Swiss, right? My family uses only the best Swiss chocolate in their baking!
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;revy&stage;0:=confused.png,Must you be so rude and vulgar, Revy?
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;0:=confused.png,Natsuki, if you're going to be upset, it might be best not to play... I'd hate for you to get Akumatized...
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Nayru again? I just <i>love</i> your look! Um. Not that you're looking at me. Or at anyone.
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;2:=wink.png,No need to get worried, Nagisa! I’m right here with you. And friends make it better, right? Or...Um, more tolerable.
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;2:=confident.png,It’s alright, Nagisa. I can definitely tell you’re playing better than last round!
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;weiss&stage;0:=bored.png,No, not particularly. I think I have to just treat you with the Chloe protocol...Assume your bad behavior on its own isn’t enough stress to Akumatize you…
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Now you’re definitely not wearing a superhero costume...
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;neo&stage;4:=bored.png,Oh goodness, you don’t even need an akuma, you have a really vicious aura about you…
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;2:=confused.png,Oh! You worked for REVOCs, right?
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;4:=confused.png,Oh! You've been very self-conscious about this, have you been padding--

-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6b:=wink.png,Oh, you're going to undress <i>again</i>? Playing by the rules is so, so challenging, isn't it, Vriska?
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;ann&stage;0:=excited.png,Ohmygosh, Ann Takamaki!? The model from Japan? We have so much in common!
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;3:=calm.png,Okay, I’ve heard you on TV. Are you that <i>actually</i> that famous japanese runner? Miki Makimura?
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;6:=alarmed.png,O-oh no, this'll hit all of your exposed skin!
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;launch&stage;1:=alarmed.png,Please don't sneeze while you have an itchy trigger finger--
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6a:=confused.png,Please tell me you're going to dry off now. I-it's kind of hard to deal with you standing there soaked. M-my innate sense of heroism means I have to care about even <i>you, Vriska</i>.
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;red&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Red! You’re getting really…
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;0:,marker:samusplaying=wink.png,Samus Aran? I’ve heard of you!
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;1:=excited.png,Samus, my powers are kind of similar to yours! I suit up and then have to build my own powerups each time.
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;2:=confident.png,Sayaka, what's a familiar? Is it like an akuma?
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;0:,marker:seiplaying=bored.png,Sei... Asagiri. Asthagiri? Hmm... I can't tell if that's a Japanese or Indian name.
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;0:,marker:seiplaying=confident.png,So, you're another hero! Just... one of the drunker ones, it seems.
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;seven&stage;0:,marker:sevenplaying=bored.png,Seven of Nine? I’m sorry, did something get translated wrong? Sept de Neuf? Mme. Neuf?
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;3:=confident.png,Sheena, you're a summoner, right? Maybe you can help improve my bond with Tikki!
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shego&stage;1:=calm.png,Shego, you should really give up and join the forces of good! You're much to smart to help out... That bad guy you help.

-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Sirens are… Kind of magical? Sort of?
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;1:=confused.png,So why a collar? Is that like… A sex thing?
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;1:=calm.png,So you and ~player~ came here together...?
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;3:=confused.png,So you can... teleport? Are you sure you don't have some sort of guardian spirit? Wait, his name is Booker? What's a Booker?
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,So, did you pick that outfit for yourself? Tikki more or less picked mine for me, but I'm pretty happy with it... usually.
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,So, now that you’re taking off… Um, the rest of your suit, are you going to tell me-- Er, us, the story?
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;5:=bored.png,So, Saki, what would you like to do after this? I have a few ideas, if you'd like!
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;5:,marker:saki_date=excited.png,(She's sure looking at ~player~ a lot...) H-hey! ~player~! A-are you enjoying Saki undressing!

-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;1:=confident.png,So... Nayru, can you rewind time? My Miraculous lets me do that!
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;navi&stage;0:=calm.png,Soo... Navi, what's with your light?
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;dawn&stage;0:=confident.png,Sorry about that Dawn, girls with blue hair need to stick together!

-1-female_must_strip,count-cheater:1,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,I kind of agree, Elaine. It seems like people here are cheating! E-er, not you though. (Except maybe on your husband... which is weird...)
-1-female_must_strip,count-journalist&role;target&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,~name~, you remind of me of my friend Alya, always trying the bottom of things. Er! To get to the bottom! Not butt... things…(But Alya did say…)

#OPPONENT REMOVING ACCESSORY
#These lines are spoken when an opponent removes a small item that does not cover any skin.
#Typically, characters are fine with this when they are fully dressed but less satisfied as they become more naked.
#Note that all "removing" lines are NOT spoken to human players. Characters will skip straight from "6-male_human_must_strip" to "6-male_removed_accessory", for example.

#fully clothed
0-male_removing_accessory=confident.png,Surely that’s the host of the akuma possessing you?
0-male_removing_accessory=bored.png,Aren't you going to take off something... with more flourish?
0-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;0:=bored.png,E-er, unless you actually have wings? Are you some kind of...
0-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;corrin_m&stage;0:=calm.png,Hmm... how very stylish, Corrin!
0-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,N-not that I mind. But that belt seems full of cool stuff!
0-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;1:=confident.png,Oh! A sash! Very Roman of you! Are you dressed up like some kind of war god? Oh, that's a cool motif for sure!
0-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;0:=confused.png,Oh! Do you have experience de-akumatizing people too? Er... or did you mean something else by neighbors?
0-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;1:,marker:modern_usa_heroes=excited.png,Parisians have a lot of fondness for you, especially. Even if more… <i>modern</i> American heroes aren’t everyone’s favorites.
0-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Um, in the game, obviously.
0-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;corrin_m&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,You're very gentle, Corrin...
0-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;0:,count-role;other&character;palutena:=confused.png,(I could learn a lot from how Palutena pushes Pit! Maybe even Cat Noir would listen...)
0-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;palutena:=wink.png,I can't tell if you're flirting with him or not, Palutena... Isn't Hades super scary, Pit?
0-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;weiss:=bored.png,Really Weiss? Beautiful skin? Can you even handle sunlight? Ugh. You are <i>frustratingly</i> hard to advocate for.
0-male_removing_accessory,count-overwatch&role;target:=calm.png,I can get around with my yo-yo, strip people... of their weapons... You know, maybe not just yet. You aren't really accepting magic-users.
0-male_removing_accessory,count-villain&role;target&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,I prefer gentlemen, so definitely not on me.
0-male_removed_accessory=embarrassed.png,Oh... I guess not.
0-male_removed_accessory=alarmed.png,Um…~name~, take it slow, okay? Don’t get too alarmed…
0-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;2:=alarmed.png,Can that Side Effect of yours tell you exactly when I'm going to act like an idiot, or is it just a good chance?
0-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;2:,marker:cat_smash=excited.png,That actually sounds a lot more useful than Cat Noir's Cataclysm. He has to get really close to smash.
0-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;4:=wink.png,Do you use gadgets and all that? I’m really fortunate in that my yo-yo usually has just what I need in it for my Lucky Charm!
0-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;corrin_m&stage;2:=bored.png,I like that in men. Just not married ones.
0-male_removed_accessory,count-role;other&character;d.va&stage;3:=wink.png,I make it a point not to sign things when I’m suited up, D.Va. You should save your hands for piloting and gaming!
0-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;2:=excited.png,Pit, could I actually see that? I could definitely use this to design something cool! You have good fashion sense!
0-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;1:=bored.png,Um. I usually have to remove evil spirits from people in Paris, so I figured you meant...
0-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;1:=wink.png,Well, whatever you are, you look like you're going to be fun to play with! In this game! Not- um. Hi!
0-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,W-well! The gloves are off, but you should know there’s a lot to… Um. A lot of good to do in Paris, if you wanted! (<i>Qu'est-ce que je fais?</i>)
0-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;corrin_m&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,You remind me... kind of about a boy I know...
0-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;palutena:=confident.png,I guess you help put the Pal in Palutena, huh, Pit?
0-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;palutena:=alarmed.png,W-wait, did you bring a firearm in here? I don't see your guns, Pit. Please tell me this isn't divine magic invisibility!
0-male_removed_accessory,count-palutena:1,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;aimee:=alarmed.png,W-wait, you snuck a gun in here? Please let's not.
0-female_removing_accessory=wink.png,I figured since you go to a school for heroes, all of us can give you some extra insight!
0-female_removing_accessory=confident.png,Time to de-evilize!
0-female_removing_accessory=excited.png,Thanks for telling us about how sentimental that is, surely it's where evil powers are coming from!
0-female_removing_accessory=confident.png,Surely that’s the host of the akuma possessing you?
0-female_removing_accessory=bored.png,Aren't you going to take off something... with more flourish?
0-female_removing_accessory=calm.png,Hmm... I think I know someone who'd love to talk to you about that choice of ~clothing~, ~name~.
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;1:=confident.png,<i>Ils pillent toujours le cul!</i>
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;other&character;elizabeth&stage;3:=wink.png,A lady has to have her secrets, <i>oui</i>?
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;dark_magician_girl&stage;1:=confident.png,A lucky necklace? Well, it's lucky I got to meet you today, Dark Magician Girl!
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch&stage;0:=confident.png,Agreed. Capes aren’t quite as good as a heavy cloak. But there’s something debonair about it!
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Ah, <i>zut</i>, the purple hair made me imagine…
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;lyn&stage;4:=excited.png,All of your things are so finely made, I could learn a lot based on your taste!
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;zizou&stage;0:=excited.png,And your hair does look pretty! It’s a very cool texture and color.
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sharla&stage;0:=bored.png,Are you... wait... no... that's not right...
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2c:=embarrassed.png,At least you finally settled on some casualwear... Why are you transforming again?
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;2:=confident.png,At least you have two rounds of small stuff left!
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;daisy&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,Because it has special value...Um...I’ll fix it after? Just trust me.
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;3:=confident.png,Belts? Oh! You’re rocking the “many belts” look. Befitting of a goddess.
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;3:=wink.png,Why limit yourself to conventional aesthetics, Palutena?
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;buffy&stage;3:=bored.png,Buffy, you shouldn't so easily part with objects of fate...
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,But I don’t think they really know this much…
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;3:=confused.png,But you <i>are</i> really cute.
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;cammy&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Cammy! S-shoot! Here I go--
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;0:=confident.png,Costume aside, I'm more of a fan of pink than red. A pink ladybug would look kind of weird, don't you think?
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;2:=confident.png,D.Va, have you looked into DJ Wayzz’s new album? I hear he’s got some good tunes when you need to turtle.
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;1:=confident.png,Don’t be so hard on yourself! Dealing with spirits is really challenging, and you do that really well!
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;1:=wink.png,Sometimes you lose a few hands, Sheena. Don’t worry. I’ll make sure you stay safe. From one spirit person to another.
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;weiss&stage;0:=wink.png,Don't worry though! It'll be just like saving another Chloe.
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2b:=embarrassed.png,E-er, I'm <i>definitely</i> not into the whole maid thing, so I'm hoping whatever comes next is... A bit better.
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;1:=confused.png,Er. I can owl you chocolate-- call you Ochako, right?
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;revy&stage;0:=bored.png,Er... won't you at least part with your guns...?
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;1:=bored.png,Fortunately, um, it looks like you don't really need to rewind since it's just your sandals...
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;2:=wink.png,Gracious of you to include the part actually keeping that on, Palutena.
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;2:=confident.png,Third time’s the charm, it just doesn’t seem to be a lucky one for you.
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;0:=bored.png,Hm… Are you a swordswoman seeking redemption? Maybe you have a broken sword of some sort?
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1b:=confused.png,Hmm... I'm normally really good at this, but I can't figure out what kind of creature the Tron-motif is associated with...
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;0:=calm.png,Hmm... Yeah, that's a good question. It's not like my costume really ever gets damaged...
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;launch&stage;1:=confused.png,Huh? What? Where'd... Is this... did I de-Akumatize Launch or something?
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;0:=wink.png,I bet we’re going to have a lot of fun tonight.
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;2:=confident.png,I don’t want another Rogercop. It looks like you’re almost pre-loaded for that kind of thing…
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;1:=excited.png,I guess you’re clean, Kyu!
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;1:=confused.png,I just can't stop geeking out over you! You're an awesome fighter, you're an acclaimed interpol agent--!
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;daisy&stage;1:=confident.png,I know a lot of people who’d want to come after my earrings, Daisy!
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;morrigan&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,I know an Akumatized person when I see one... But I'm not sure I can see an accessory...
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nugi-chan&stage;0:=confident.png,I like your ribbons! Mine are way cooler in my costume than out, but I’d love to try yours on!
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;arwen&stage;0:=confident.png,I never thought I'd actually meet you, but you did so much during the War of the Ring!
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;amy_rose&stage;0:=bored.png,I suppose it could be a ring...
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;red&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,I think this is, a, um. Bad idea. My yo-yo doesn’t count!
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;other&character;kimberly&stage;0:=wink.png,I transform by... well, why don't we wait and see!
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,I’m still not quite sure you’re not an agent of Hawk Moth who was… Er…
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;2:=confident.png,I’ve never seen a bunny miraculous, and it would explain your awesome reflexes! Just not at cards.
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;0:=confused.png,If you’re who I think you are, this akuma situation must be really serious for you to get involved!
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;2:=confused.png,If your angst didn’t turn you into a villain, that is.
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,W-wait, are there people that are into <i>feet</i>!?
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;ann&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,I-I mean, they have a bakery and I think you'd like something sweet.
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;1:=excited.png,I'm kind of like a magical royal guard for a magical royal princess, huh?
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;0:=confused.png,I'm... not sure what a waifu is. Like a crush? Oh! Like a crush. No he's-- er...
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;0:=excited.png,In Japan, you have multiple pairs of shoes for school, for your house, and outside, right? That must be nice to have so many opportunities to express yourself!
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;0:=confident.png,They’re nice shoes, Nagisa! The style seems maybe a year or two out of date, though.
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;jane&stage;0:=calm.png,It’s definitely well loved and tailored. I can tell you care a lot about it.
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;mei&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,I've actually heard a lot about you! How you got lost in a Blizzard once...
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;korra&stage;3:=calm.png,Korra, I can understand being insecure…
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;0:=wink.png,Like what? Being sassy and obnoxious?
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;0:=wink.png,Such as what? A weak sense of style and a weaker sense of honor?
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2a:=wink.png,Looks like you've been plundered, Vriska.
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1c:=confident.png,Maybe you have the Lion Miraculous, given how bright and regal your costume is!
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1a:=confused.png,Maybe... Hm... Something like a sprite? No... That's not an animal...
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;revy&stage;1:=confused.png,N-no...? Er... I've yet to solve a problem that needed a gun...
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;weiss&stage;1:=wink.png,Not all wealth is material, Weiss.
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;other&character;cammy&stage;2:=confused.png,Oh no! She's getting attacked again! Here, let me help--
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;0:=excited.png,Oh! Smart! Avalor must be really fortunate to have a leader like you.

0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,O-oh, sorry. I can look away if you’d like?
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;2:=alarmed.png,Oh! I’m sorry, Nagisa. It’s just a very cool jacket!
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,O-oh. Daria <i>c'est une dominatrice.</i> That makes sense.
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;chiaki&stage;0:=confident.png,Or do you just seem a little... bored? I really hope it’s boredom rather than stress!
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kimberly:=bored.png,Say, I have to ask, from one suit-wearing hero to another, where does your stuff <i>go</i> while you're transformed?
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;neo&stage;1:=excited.png,So Neopolitan like the ice cream... and you’re short. Oh you’re pint-sized! I get it!
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3:=calm.png,So, what'll it be <i>this</i> time, Vriska? Some sort of "goddess of <i>luck</i>" outfit?
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3:=calm.png,So, what'll it be <i>this</i> time, Vriska? Some sort of "wandering martial artist" look?
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;spooky&stage;0:=alarmed.png,Spooky? Give me the knife, please. Let’s put away our weapons.
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;2:=confident.png,That famous fashion company some girl managed to destroy?
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;dark_magician_girl&stage;0:=confident.png,That hat was so cute though! It's <i>tres</i> stylish. Where'd you get it?
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;3:=alarmed.png,That lets him give people superpowers but also brings out their worst feelings.
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;jane&stage;1:=confused.png,That seems… Very difficult, Jane.
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,That’s not nice, Hana! Everyone starts somewhere… And bad behavior will just get you banned. Or Akumatized. Let’s hope the former.
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;0:=confident.png,That’s super cool! Do you have a Miraculous or is this kind of power innate to you?
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyoko&stage;0:=wink.png,The gloves are especially classy touch.
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;0:=excited.png,They say you can stand up to any challenge, no matter however demanding, and that your courage is amazing and…

0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;1:=excited.png,I’m glad you don’t get too caught up in your worries, Nagisa!
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,It’s just the first round, Nagisa. Don’t worry! E-er, as in  no reason to get down! Not that you’ll--Erk.
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;chiaki&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,If so, do you have any particular trophy or device you like to play games with? Just curious, in case I have to free you from Hawk Moth.
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;1:=confident.png,If you ever visit Paris, I'm sure we'd have a great time!
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,I-I have to admit, I feel really bad that you didn't choose to be here...
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;2:=confused.png,I-I mean I hope you are. Of akuma. Not only akuma but physically! I mean-! (Okay I’m going to stop.)
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:=alarmed.png,I-I mean your panties looked fretty passionable to me-- O-oh erm. Pretty fashionable. A-and you were talking about your shoes. Erk. O-okay then.
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:=alarmed.png,I thought those panties looked fretty passionable though! I-I mean, um. Pretty fashionable. W-wait, you were talking about your shoes?
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;lyn&stage;5:=alarmed.png,I-I mean, your taste in fashion. Not... you know…
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,I-it was a pretty bandana, anyway...
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,You're really quite foxy, Elaine!
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;2:=excited.png,I'm just happy you're having a good time! It would be a shame if you were the one the akuma was targeting!
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;1:=wink.png,I'm kind of a dork with how into pink I actually am. I bet you'd look really good in it too! Though your tie matched your glasses and eyes in a really cool way!
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;1:=wink.png,I'm kind of interested to see what you'd look like with a nice fluffy scarf. It's doesn't match as well as your tie, but I bet it'd be really comforting.
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;sharla&stage;1:=confident.png,I'm sure I'll figure it out.
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;daisy&stage;2:=wink.png,It’s kind of important I keep mine on though. They’re not coming off this whole game, I promise.
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;daisy&stage;4:=alarmed.png,It’s… Um… Complicated. Superhero stuff. (I really should probably preface my goals… Or not tell people before the get Akumatized…)
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;1&saidmarker;fled:=confident.png,Ladybug is here to keep you safe, Florina! Don’t get too worried!
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;1&saidmarker;fled:=confused.png,I… Hm… You know, I never really considered the option of running away.
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;2:=wink.png,Maybe you can show me more later! I mean, of your magic! N-not, but if you wanted to... Um!
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;1:=calm.png,Most Miraculouses aren't weapons until they transform, but...
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;1:=confident.png,Hmm... It's a good thing I have my yo-yo, Elena...
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,Natsuki, being a woman is about being proud of who you are and the things you like. If ~player~ is the right person for you, they'll just appreciate you more! Um. The personality. Less the encroaching nudity...
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;red&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,N-no?
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,No? Hmm… Shantae, you just sound really familiar…
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;1:=excited.png,No…? Weird, I had a feeling… Let me try again…
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;spooky&stage;1:=wink.png,Of course. And you’re definitely not the cute type of ghost, Spooky. Just the scary kind.
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;spooky&stage;1:=excited.png,Of course Spooky! We all know better than to toy with spirits. Er. I at least hope we do.
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;3:=excited.png,Oh! It’s magic too? And fine gold? It’s a little gaudy, to be honest, but if it keeps people safe!
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,W-well normally I’d say it’s how you present yourself, but I think it’d be rude to say a goddess’s… Assets aren’t something heavenly!
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;amy_rose&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Oh! It's not a Miraculous. You're just like this!
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2c:=confident.png,Oh! Well. That was kind of weird, but at least you're in normal clothes now...
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;4:=excited.png,Oh! You’re not counting them individually. How graceful, Palutena.
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;kim&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,Oh, I definitely would--Um. Is what someone who found you cute would say.
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;kim&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,Oh! Well if you’re offering--Um. I know magic, Kim! And that’s not a real place!
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;april&stage;1:=bored.png,Oh. Not anymore, huh? Well, the jumpsuit looks nice...
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;4&saidmarker;dizzy:=alarmed.png,O-oh no! Shimakaze, be safe! Do I need to call you a doctor? Or... er... a mechanic, I suppose?
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;2:=bored.png,O-oh. It was a joke. W-well, maybe that's a profession you should follow-up on, Daria?
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;mei&stage;2:=calm.png,Or maybe that was Li-Meng, the wizard? Either way, it's exciting to see you here!
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;1:=confused.png,Repairs? Ash? A-are you okay? You seem awfully resilient to harm... but... er... I'm confused now.
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;1:=alarmed.png,Sexually frustrated before Akumatization, so I’ll keep an eye on you.
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,S-so, just stay confident, okay!
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;1:=confident.png,That’s the spirit, Florina! Be brave!
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;1:=wink.png,You did! Sorry you lost, but… Good job staying in the game!
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pearl&stage;1:=excited.png,This is going to be a lot more interesting than I thought! I-I mean, not you specifically Pearl b-but...
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3:=bored.png,This seems awfully familiar...
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;launch&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Um... I don't quite know who you are, but I think putting the gun away is a good idea.
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,U-um. You’re good at games, right, Blackrose? Let’s just keep playing, don’t get down!
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,I have to say, I don’t know what a GP is. But wherever you’re from, the style is very special!
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;1:=confident.png,Well! You seem like you're having fun!
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Well, I guess we didn't have to worry about that tonight...
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;2:=wink.png,Well... your outfit's so cute and while you may be a little... different, I'll go with it for now!
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Um... well, let's see, I suppose.
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;arwen&stage;1:=calm.png,What brings you to a game like this, I wonder? Y-you know, from your storybook? Magic is such an interesting thing...
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;other&character;cammy&stage;3:=calm.png,Wow! She's amazing! Um. I tope hey--hope they don't keep taking off her clothes though...
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;cammy&stage;2:=confident.png,Wow! You handled yourself so well, Cammy. Guess it's a good thing I didn't need to use my yo-yo, huh?
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;alpha&stage;1:=confident.png,Wow! You're super animated too! You're awesome, Alpha!
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4a:=alarmed.png,W-what? What is this? M-my earrings are still attached so at least...
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4a:=alarmed.png,I-I what!? H-how did you? W-what kind of akuma trickery is this!?
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4a:=confused.png,E-excuse you!? How <i>dare</i> you copy my costume, Vriska! This is <i>far</i> worse than Chloe that one time!

0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;3:=confident.png,You are <i>quite</i> strange, Daria. But in a very likable way! I can see us being great friends!
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;3:,marker:coldfloor=confident.png,You did say you were worried about the floor being cold...It’s okay to be a warm person but sensitive to cold. You dress well for all environments!
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;3:=excited.png,I’m sure you have lots of other clothes, but if you wanted to go shopping after this, Nagisa, I’m sure we could find something cute!
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;2:=confused.png,You sound <i>so</i> familiar! I can’t quite pin down why!
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;1:=bored.png,Your attitude is really bad. Hawk Moth will Akumatize you in no time if you keep being rude.
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,S-sorry, GoGo. I don't know why I'm being so mean... You're being more than a little rude, though...
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;1:=alarmed.png,K-kinky? J-just because I have a very form fitting costume and a-- You know what, let's not follow this line of thought.
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;1:=alarmed.png,Y-you're beautiful in your own way, Daria, y-yut boo-- but you don't resemble him!

0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;alice:=embarrassed.png,Alice, do you think she means pounds? She doesn’t seem to mean Euro or francs…
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;boundaries:,count-role;other&character;zoey:,marker:boundaries=wink.png,Don’t worry, Zoey, I think everyone’s being very accepting of other’s boundaries. That makes for a good game, right?
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;daria:=embarrassed.png,Er. Nothing! Uravity! Wust jut wou yer... um... j-just what you were saying! About debris. And stuff.

0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;4:,count-role;other&character;corrin_f:=confident.png,Hmm...Palutena, Corrin might use the most tactical choice, but fashion requires a certain economy. I’d be happy to help, as a hero to a goddess of heroes.
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;daria:=excited.png,I'm glad you think so, Daria! I think Uravity and Ladybug would make a great team!

0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;tracer:=embarrassed.png,Um. Did you mean a GBP? I think Tracer knows about that.

1-male_removing_accessory=calm.png,Well that’s certainly a nice ~clothing~.
1-male_removing_accessory=excited.png,One less thing for me to fight against.
1-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;0:=bored.png,E-er, unless you actually have wings? Are you some kind of...
1-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;corrin_m&stage;0:=calm.png,Hmm... how very stylish, Corrin!
1-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,N-not that I mind. But that belt seems full of cool stuff!
1-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;1:=confident.png,Oh! A sash! Very Roman of you! Are you dressed up like some kind of war god? Oh, that's a cool motif for sure!
1-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;0:=confused.png,Oh! Do you have experience de-akumatizing people too? Er... or did you mean something else by neighbors?
1-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;1:,marker:modern_usa_heroes=excited.png,Parisians have a lot of fondness for you, especially. Even if more… <i>modern</i> American heroes aren’t everyone’s favorites.
1-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Um, in the game, obviously.
1-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;corrin_m&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,You're very gentle, Corrin...
1-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;0:,count-role;other&character;palutena:=confused.png,(I could learn a lot from how Palutena pushes Pit! Maybe even Cat Noir would listen...)
1-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;palutena:=wink.png,I can't tell if you're flirting with him or not, Palutena... Isn't Hades super scary, Pit?
1-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;weiss:=bored.png,Really Weiss? Beautiful skin? Can you even handle sunlight? Ugh. You are <i>frustratingly</i> hard to advocate for.
1-male_removing_accessory,count-overwatch&role;target:=calm.png,I can get around with my yo-yo, strip people... of their weapons... You know, maybe not just yet. You aren't really accepting magic-users.

1-female_removing_accessory=confident.png,That has to have the akuma in it!
1-female_removing_accessory=calm.png,Well that’s certainly a nice ~clothing~.
1-female_removing_accessory=excited.png,One less thing for me to fight against.
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;1:=confident.png,<i>Ils pillent toujours le cul!</i>
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;other&character;elizabeth&stage;3:=wink.png,A lady has to have her secrets, <i>oui</i>?
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;dark_magician_girl&stage;1:=confident.png,A lucky necklace? Well, it's lucky I got to meet you today, Dark Magician Girl!
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch&stage;0:=confident.png,Agreed. Capes aren’t quite as good as a heavy cloak. But there’s something debonair about it!
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;0:=wink.png,Ah! I'm glad you picked that trick up from me.
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Ah, <i>zut</i>, the purple hair made me imagine…
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;lyn&stage;4:=excited.png,All of your things are so finely made, I could learn a lot based on your taste!
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;zizou&stage;0:=excited.png,And your hair does look pretty! It’s a very cool texture and color.
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sharla&stage;0:=bored.png,Are you... wait... no... that's not right...
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2c:=embarrassed.png,At least you finally settled on some casualwear... Why are you transforming again?
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;2:=confident.png,At least you have two rounds of small stuff left!
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;daisy&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,Because it has special value...Um...I’ll fix it after? Just trust me.
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;3:=confident.png,Belts? Oh! You’re rocking the “many belts” look. Befitting of a goddess.
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;3:=wink.png,Why limit yourself to conventional aesthetics, Palutena?
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;buffy&stage;3:=bored.png,Buffy, you shouldn't so easily part with objects of fate...
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,But I don’t think they really know this much…
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;3:=confused.png,But you <i>are</i> really cute.
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;cammy&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Cammy! S-shoot! Here I go--
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;0:=confident.png,Costume aside, I'm more of a fan of pink than red. A pink ladybug would look kind of weird, don't you think?
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;2:=confident.png,D.Va, have you looked into DJ Wayzz’s new album? I hear he’s got some good tunes when you need to turtle.
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;1:=confident.png,Don’t be so hard on yourself! Dealing with spirits is really challenging, and you do that really well!
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;1:=wink.png,Sometimes you lose a few hands, Sheena. Don’t worry. I’ll make sure you stay safe. From one spirit person to another.
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;weiss&stage;0:=wink.png,Don't worry though! It'll be just like saving another Chloe.
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2b:=embarrassed.png,E-er, I'm <i>definitely</i> not into the whole maid thing, so I'm hoping whatever comes next is... A bit better.
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;1:=confused.png,Er. I can owl you chocolate-- call you Ochako, right?
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;revy&stage;0:=bored.png,Er... won't you at least part with your guns...?
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;1:=bored.png,Fortunately, um, it looks like you don't really need to rewind since it's just your sandals...
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;2:=wink.png,Gracious of you to include the part actually keeping that on, Palutena.
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;2:=confident.png,Third time’s the charm, it just doesn’t seem to be a lucky one for you.
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;0:=bored.png,Hm… Are you a swordswoman seeking redemption? Maybe you have a broken sword of some sort?
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1b:=confused.png,Hmm... I'm normally really good at this, but I can't figure out what kind of creature the Tron-motif is associated with...
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;0:=calm.png,Hmm... Yeah, that's a good question. It's not like my costume really ever gets damaged...
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;launch&stage;1:=confused.png,Huh? What? Where'd... Is this... did I de-Akumatize Launch or something?
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;0:=wink.png,I bet we’re going to have a lot of fun tonight.
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;2:=confident.png,I don’t want another Rogercop. It looks like you’re almost pre-loaded for that kind of thing…
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;1:=excited.png,I guess you’re clean, Kyu!
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;1:=confused.png,I just can't stop geeking out over you! You're an awesome fighter, you're an acclaimed interpol agent--!
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;daisy&stage;1:=confident.png,I know a lot of people who’d want to come after my earrings, Daisy!
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;morrigan&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,I know an Akumatized person when I see one... But I'm not sure I can see an accessory...
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nugi-chan&stage;0:=confident.png,I like your ribbons! Mine are way cooler in my costume than out, but I’d love to try yours on!
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;arwen&stage;0:=confident.png,I never thought I'd actually meet you, but you did so much during the War of the Ring!
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;amy_rose&stage;0:=bored.png,I suppose it could be a ring...
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;red&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,I think this is, a, um. Bad idea. My yo-yo doesn’t count!
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;other&character;kimberly&stage;0:=wink.png,I transform by... well, why don't we wait and see!
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,I’m still not quite sure you’re not an agent of Hawk Moth who was… Er…
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;2:=confident.png,I’ve never seen a bunny miraculous, and it would explain your awesome reflexes! Just not at cards.
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;0:=confused.png,If you’re who I think you are, this akuma situation must be really serious for you to get involved!
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;2:=confused.png,If your angst didn’t turn you into a villain, that is.
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,W-wait, are there people that are into <i>feet</i>!?
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;ann&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,I-I mean, they have a bakery and I think you'd like something sweet.
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;1:=excited.png,I'm kind of like a magical royal guard for a magical royal princess, huh?
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;0:=confused.png,I'm... not sure what a waifu is. Like a crush? Oh! Like a crush. No he's-- er...
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;0:=excited.png,In Japan, you have multiple pairs of shoes for school, for your house, and outside, right? That must be nice to have so many opportunities to express yourself!
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;0:=confident.png,They’re nice shoes, Nagisa! The style seems maybe a year or two out of date, though.
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;jane&stage;0:=calm.png,It’s definitely well loved and tailored. I can tell you care a lot about it.
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;mei&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,I've actually heard a lot about you! How you got lost in a Blizzard once...
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;korra&stage;3:=calm.png,Korra, I can understand being insecure…
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;0:=wink.png,Like what? Being sassy and obnoxious?
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;0:=wink.png,Such as what? A weak sense of style and a weaker sense of honor?
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2a:=wink.png,Looks like you've been plundered, Vriska.
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1c:=confident.png,Maybe you have the Lion Miraculous, given how bright and regal your costume is!
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1a:=confused.png,Maybe... Hm... Something like a sprite? No... That's not an animal...
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;revy&stage;1:=confused.png,N-no...? Er... I've yet to solve a problem that needed a gun...
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;weiss&stage;1:=wink.png,Not all wealth is material, Weiss.
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;other&character;cammy&stage;2:=confused.png,Oh no! She's getting attacked again! Here, let me help--
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;0:=wink.png,Oh! Your French is coming along well, Elizabeth. You have a wonderful accent!
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;0:=confident.png,Oh! Your shoes and socks at the same time! I was worried over nothing. You're pretty brave, aren't you?
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;videl&stage;0:=excited.png,Oh! You're Videl Satan! You're a really good fighter!
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;dawn&stage;1:=calm.png,Oh, that’s why you have such a fluffy scarf, because of the weather!
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,O-oh, sorry. I can look away if you’d like?
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;2:=alarmed.png,Oh! I’m sorry, Nagisa. It’s just a very cool jacket!
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,O-oh. Daria <i>c'est une dominatrice.</i> That makes sense.
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;chiaki&stage;0:=confident.png,Or do you just seem a little... bored? I really hope it’s boredom rather than stress!
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kimberly:=bored.png,Say, I have to ask, from one suit-wearing hero to another, where does your stuff <i>go</i> while you're transformed?
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;neo&stage;1:=excited.png,So Neopolitan like the ice cream... and you’re short. Oh you’re pint-sized! I get it!
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3:=calm.png,So, what'll it be <i>this</i> time, Vriska? Some sort of "goddess of <i>luck</i>" outfit?
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3:=calm.png,So, what'll it be <i>this</i> time, Vriska? Some sort of "wandering martial artist" look?
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;spooky&stage;0:=alarmed.png,Spooky? Give me the knife, please. Let’s put away our weapons.
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;2:=confident.png,That famous fashion company some girl managed to destroy?
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;dark_magician_girl&stage;0:=confident.png,That hat was so cute though! It's <i>tres</i> stylish. Where'd you get it?
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;3:=alarmed.png,That lets him give people superpowers but also brings out their worst feelings.
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;jane&stage;1:=confused.png,That seems… Very difficult, Jane.
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,That’s not nice, Hana! Everyone starts somewhere… And bad behavior will just get you banned. Or Akumatized. Let’s hope the former.
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;0:=confident.png,That’s super cool! Do you have a Miraculous or is this kind of power innate to you?
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyoko&stage;0:=wink.png,The gloves are especially classy touch.
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;0:=excited.png,They say you can stand up to any challenge, no matter however demanding, and that your courage is amazing and…
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;1:=confident.png,Those boots look really well worn, Blackrose! Were they expensive? They seem well-loved!
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;1:=confident.png,Wow! I bet you’ve kicked a lot of butt with those. Figurative and otherwise!
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;0:=bored.png,Though um, based on your ears, you're not really from around France, are you?
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,Um. Do those bracelets really weigh 8kg each, Chun-li?
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;0:=confident.png,Those bracelets of yours have to be <i>amazing</i> for training, Chun-li!
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;red&stage;2:=wink.png,Um. Exposed. Maybe it’s time for you to put away that sword?
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;0:=confused.png,Um. I don't mean to be critical, but the belts for your belts look is a bit too recent to be vintage...
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,U-uhm. Are you sober enough to be playing, Sei? I'd hate for you to regret this.
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;0:=alarmed.png,Wait! Are you using a Miraculous?!
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;0:=alarmed.png,Wait, are you using a Miraculous!? Was that your outfit?
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;0:=alarmed.png,H-hey! You can't use a Miraculous, can you!?
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;april&stage;0:=excited.png,Wait, didn't you used to have magic ninja bracelets? Like a Miraculous of some sort?
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;0:=bored.png,Was the choker that valuable? Did someone important give it to you? I’m sorry Blackrose.
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nugi-chan&stage;0:=confused.png,Webmaster? Have I fought that villain before…?
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;1:=confident.png,Well, considering some of the others we’re playing with, I suppose I can trust in that.
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;alpha&stage;0:=excited.png,Well, you are a really good singer... Can you play Wonderwall?
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&stage;2:=calm.png,What high coutoure, ~name~, please keep good care of it!
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;pearl&stage;0:=alarmed.png,Whoa! I'm the only one who's supposed to transform!
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;yo_yo_forget:,marker:yo_yo_forget=alarmed.png,Whoa, careful. I'll just use my yo-yo to make sure it stays clean and off the floor!
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;1:=alarmed.png,W-wait, your stockings? Annie! You’re flashing everyone! C-come on!
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,W-well, it's nice to see you like pink stuff too, Saki. B-but you're-- you're flashing us!
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;0:=alarmed.png,W-what? A-are you okay?! Someone get a fire extinguisher!
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;weiss&stage;0:=confused.png,Yes, Weiss. We know how rich you are. Your father owns a hotel and is a mayor or something, blah blah blah…
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;0:=confident.png,You are well adorned! Both in accessories and otherwise.
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;0:=wink.png,Those are really cool armbands. I’m glad my costume normally works as armor, though. That seems a lot heavier. It’s such a relief to see you lose them, though.
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;0:,marker:blake_crush=bored.png,You know Blake, there’s something about you I can’t put my finger in…
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Your rudders... I'm not sure if you've been Akumatized, or this is a Miraculous, or something stranger...
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Oh no, not <i>again!</i> Shimakaze, are you okay?
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;3:=alarmed.png,Y-you know, maybe this can wait until after the game. Don't you use card-like seals? You're a bit... behind right now.
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;0&saidmarker;fled:,count-role;other&character;aimee:=alarmed.png,Aimee, don’t shoot her!
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;jane&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;amalia&stage;4-9:=confident.png,Amalia did show us how to be clever with attire, so I shouldn’t discount anything you have hidden up your sleeve! Or… Erk, pants.
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;weiss&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;blake:=bored.png,Blake, is Weiss always this… Bourgeois?
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;0:,count-role;other&character;red:=embarrassed.png,Costume aside, I'm more of a fan of pink than red. E-er. N-not the Red here, I mean like the color! Kind of like Red's red hair!
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;0:,count-role;other&character;daria:=embarrassed.png,Godzilla? Oh, if it's a big enemy, I'd probably try to evacuate an area, then figure out what part of him was Akumatized.
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose:,count-role;other&character;elizabeth&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,Hm...You and Elizabeth seem to have a lot of sentimental value for your necklaces, Blackrose. You also must have gotten yours from someone important, huh?
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1b:,count-role;other&character;futaba:=excited.png,I mean <i>Alya</i> got Akumatized into a cyber-villain. If I could save her, beating you--er, saving you--should be easy!
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;5:,count-role;other&character;yang:=wink.png,If the two of you aren’t open about this, you really should be! It’s too cute! O-oh. Your ears are… <i>That’s</i> your secret?
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;0:,count-role;self&saidmarker;elaine_puns:=bored.png,It feels like Cat Noir is here, and not in a good way.
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;0:,count-role;other&character;rinkah:=confident.png,Oh! Rinkah and Blackrose, are you from the same place?
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;3:,count-role;other&character;sei:=excited.png,Oh! You and Sei have something in common, with all of your belts. I’m surprised, given that they don’t seem to be keeping anything loose down.
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sharla&stage;0:,count-role;other&character;shazza:=embarrassed.png,Oh! You're Shazza, right! W-wait...
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;daria:=confused.png,Oh, don't be rude, Daria! I'm sure what Ochako does on her knees is-- um... h-her business. (Just play it cool. You can act like nothing was said.)
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;0:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;elaine_puns:=bored.png,That seems a little unfair, Elaine...
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;ryuko:=wink.png,The one that Ryuko has some history with, right?
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;3:,count-role;other&character;rinkah:=confused.png,Unless you’ve been Akumatized...Which I hope isn’t the case!
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&saidmarker;strategyguide:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;strategyguide0:,marker:strategyguide0=confused.png,Wait, you’re using a guide for this? It’s... really pretty simple, I thought?
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose:,count-role;other&character;zoey&stage;0-2:=confident.png,What do they say about girls who wear chokers, Zoey?
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;weiss&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;ruby:=bored.png,Yang, is Weiss always like this… Repugnant?
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;weiss&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;yang:=bored.png,Yang, is Weiss always this… Yawn-inducing?
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;1:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_ladity:,count-role;other&character;uravity&saidmarker;saki_befriend_ladity:=confident.png,Between the two of us lady heroes, we should be able to make sure this is at least <i>tolerable</i> for Saki, you know?
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;meia&stage;0:,count-role;self&saidmarker;corrin_meia_hair:,count-role;other&character;corrin_m:=embarrassed.png,Um. You and him… Pull it off really well! You know. For something so… Universal!
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;1:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_mariba:,count-role;other&character;futaba&saidmarker;saki_befriend_mariba:=confident.png,We should take care of Saki somehow! We don't want her to get Akumatized or feel ashamed!

1-female_removing_accessory,count-creepy&role;target&stage;1:=confused.png,~name~, don't worry, I'll fix this soon! Don't give in to evil!
1-female_removing_accessory,count-goth&role;target&stage;0:=bored.png,Hmm... I never really found the appeal of so much gloomy apparel. But if it works for you!
1-female_removing_accessory,count-overwatch&role;target&stage;0:=calm.png,I can get around with my yo-yo, strip people... of their weapons... You know, maybe not just yet. You aren't really accepting magic-users.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0,count-overwatch:1=wink.png,I figured since you go to a school for heroes, all of us can give you some extra insight!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0,count-phantom_thieves:1=wink.png,I figured since you go to a school for heroes, all of us can give you some extra insight!
1-female_removing_accessory,count-rwby&role;target&stage;1:=calm.png,And Team RWBY in particular! I wonder how much better equipped my team would be if we'd spent our school hours training.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0,count-rwby:1=wink.png,I figured since you go to a school for heroes, all of us can give you some extra insight!

1-female_removing_accessory,count-yandere&role;target:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;ayano_stripping:,marker:ayano_suspicious=confident.png,Hmm. Ms. ~name~, that’s a small piece, and all jokes aside, you’re acting quite strangely.
1-female_removing_accessory,count-yandere&role;target:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_stripping:=confused.png,This somehow gets weirder and weirder...
1-female_removing_accessory,priority:0,count-yandere:1-3,count-role;target&stage;3-5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=confident.png,~name~ is brave. Or she wouldn’t have stayed here.

1-female_removing_accessory,priority:0,count-yandere:1-3,count-bi-curious&role;target&stage;3-5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=wink.png,~name~ is willing to explore all kinds of people’s love.

1-female_removing_accessory,priority:0,count-yandere:1-3,count-bisexual&role;target&stage;3-5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=wink.png,~name~ is willing to explore all kinds of people’s love. That’s an incredible thing, that some people could learn a lot from!

1-female_removing_accessory,priority:0,count-yandere:1-3,count-fashionable&role;target&stage;3-5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=wink.png,~name~ has killer fashion sense. Believe me. I’d know.

1-female_removing_accessory,priority:0,count-yandere:1-3,count-mean&role;target&stage;3-5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=confused.png,You know, I don't agree with her on much, but she does have a point, ~name~...

1-female_removing_accessory,priority:0,count-yandere:1-3,count-video_game&role;target&stage;3-5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=wink.png,~name~ is adored by her fans, and is used to facing danger. You better watch your threats!
1-female_removing_accessory,priority:0,count-yandere:1-3,count-villain&role;target&stage;3-5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=wink.png,Just because ~name~ is misguided, doesn’t mean that she doesn’t have redeeming qualities. Maybe if you didn’t pick on her, she wouldn’t do what she does?
1-female_removing_accessory,count-yandere:1-3,count-yandere&role;target:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=bored.png,What are we to do with you, ~name~?
1-female_removing_accessory,count-yandere:1-3,count-yandere&role;target:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=bored.png,I hope you really get your act together...

1-female_removing_accessory,count-yandere:1-3,count-yandere&role;target:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=embarrassed.png,You should be ashamed of how you've been treating other people, ~name~.
1-female_removing_accessory,count-yandere:1-3,count-yandere&role;target:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=confident.png,This serves you right.
1-female_removing_accessory,count-yandere:1-3,count-yandere&role;target:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=alarmed.png,T-there's no akuma here, is there, just ~name~ and her whole yandere stuff!
1-female_removed_accessory=confused.png,Shoot, I don’t have my yo-yo anymore. Good thing that wasn’t cursed by Hawk Moth.
1-female_removed_accessory=confident.png,Now that you’re disarmed, I guess we’ll have to start working through your other objects!
1-female_removed_accessory=confident.png,I guess that's all right... I'm used to the small stuff having an akuma in it, so no problem, ~name~!
1-female_removed_accessory=confident.png,This should be a hint to some of our other companions at the table to part with their weapons.
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,(I really hope this place is secure from Hawkmoth… I’m worried about Uravity!)
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;kimberly&stage;1:=wink.png,<i>Cute</i> accessories, though. <i>Tres annes des quatre vingt dix.</i>.
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;revy&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,<i>Gosh</i> you have so many euphemisms for promiscuity...
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2:=confused.png,<i>Zut!</i> You've been Akumatized! But how!? No wonder you're acting so mean, Vriska!
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Ack! <i>You</i> were Akumatized! I have to stop you!
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;2:=alarmed.png,A jacquin? What's that? If it's anything like a panther, I really can't say I've had good experiences...
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;2:=confident.png,A Lucky Charm, you say? I can definitely relate to that.
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;1&saidmarker;harped:=excited.png,A magic harp! <i>You</i> must have a Miraculous, right, Naryu? What's your Kwami's name?
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;seven&stage;1:=wink.png,Accessories are important, Seven! In fact, some of the most powerful things in your arsenal might be accessories!
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;dark_magician_girl&stage;1:=wink.png,And what's your name? I can't help but feel like there's something darkly magical about you...
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;2:=calm.png,Aren’t you supposed to be the smart one?
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;1:=wink.png,Awww, don't give up! You're just starting to have fun... (<i>You're one to talk, Marinette! You're only here to protect these people, remember that!</i>)
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,B-but still, we should really try to win. A lot of people look up to us.
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;red&stage;1:=alarmed.png,B-but that huge thing… Can you really carry that?
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;ann&stage;5:=alarmed.png,Because I'm sweet on you! Er. No, I mean, you're a sweetheart.
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;korra&stage;4:=confident.png,But a hero has to persevere and keep moving forward, no matter what happens.
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;zizou&stage;1:=wink.png,Do you dye it, or is it natural?
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;buffy&stage;4:=calm.png,Drive me crazy as in... upset? Because that's not happening...
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;buffy&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,Drive me crazy as in... aroused... Uhm. Well.
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;kimberly&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,E-er, sorry if that's weird! I just never feel my clothes and kind of have to trust they're just there...
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;2:=confused.png,E-er. I think that may translate more sensibly in English...
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,E-er... unless you remove your necklaces too. How'd you even get that on...?
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Er. I mean. I’m saying it from an aesthetic point of you. Point of view. Not that--Uhm. Back to the game!
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,B-but you’re definitely still a goddess and I don’t mean to imply anything too torward fowards you. Forward towards you!
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;4&notsaidmarker;dizzy:=alarmed.png,Er... <i>SHIMAKAZE, ARE YOU OKAY!? Can you hear me?</i>
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Erm. I heard that in a song.
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;revy&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,F-fine. Be that way.
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;1:=alarmed.png,Finger on! I-I would never unless you really wanted me to b-but-
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Hey! That's cheating! You're not supposed to put on <i>more</i> clothes!
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1:=confused.png,I mean, I'm wearing clothes <i>under</i> my costume, but this seems like cheating...
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Er... It seems not.
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;4:=bored.png,Hmm, lots of belts, Palutena. What are you trying so hard to keep secret?
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;2:=calm.png,Hmm... That belt looks familiar... Maruvian symbols, maybe? Tikki said something about that.
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;1:=calm.png,Hmm... Well, it's nice to have such a powerful Oracle here with me today! Let's keep an eye out for the akuma, shall we?
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;6:=confident.png,Huh, so that’s your secret! I have a weird feeling about Cat Noir right now…
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;self&timeinstage;3:=embarrassed.png,I feel a little tricked… Are any of you actually… You know, on a rampage? About to be?
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;morrigan&stage;1:=confident.png,I guess I'll just have to wait and see!
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;videl&stage;1:=wink.png,I hope you're going to put up more of a fight than this!
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;2:=alarmed.png,I just wanted to let you know that it's nice to see, you know, someone who's similar to me go so far. You're a big hero to me. E-even though, you know, we're at this game.
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;2:=alarmed.png,It's-- I mean, most of the people around me in Paris. Um. Come from a different type of background. But you're a hero worldwide, so you, you know?
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;1:=calm.png,I kind of have to rely on my Miraculous for most of my powers... I'd like to think I'm pretty athletic, but you're next level!
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;1:=wink.png,I may not be the strongest woman in the world, but I'm actually a pretty good fighter, Chun-li!
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;1:=confident.png,I may be an art student, but that doesn’t mean I’m not clever, Annie! Let's see what you've got!
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;1:=excited.png,I mean, I have some friends that say I’m pretty quirky… oh! I get it. Superpowers are called Quirks where you’re from, aren’t they?
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;2:=wink.png,I much prefer ribbons to keep my hair back, but hairbands can definitely be more fashionable for long hair like yours.
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;jane&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,I was about to say...
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;1:=excited.png,I’m glad you don’t get too caught up in your worries, Nagisa!
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,It’s just the first round, Nagisa. Don’t worry! E-er, as in  no reason to get down! Not that you’ll--Erk.
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;chiaki&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,If so, do you have any particular trophy or device you like to play games with? Just curious, in case I have to free you from Hawk Moth.
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;1:=confident.png,If you ever visit Paris, I'm sure we'd have a great time!
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,I-I have to admit, I feel really bad that you didn't choose to be here...
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;2:=confused.png,I-I mean I hope you are. Of akuma. Not only akuma but physically! I mean-! (Okay I’m going to stop.)
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:=alarmed.png,I-I mean your panties looked fretty passionable to me-- O-oh erm. Pretty fashionable. A-and you were talking about your shoes. Erk. O-okay then.
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:=alarmed.png,I thought those panties looked fretty passionable though! I-I mean, um. Pretty fashionable. W-wait, you were talking about your shoes?
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;lyn&stage;5:=alarmed.png,I-I mean, your taste in fashion. Not... you know…
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,I-it was a pretty bandana, anyway...
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,You're really quite foxy, Elaine!
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;2:=excited.png,I'm just happy you're having a good time! It would be a shame if you were the one the akuma was targeting!
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;1:=wink.png,I'm kind of a dork with how into pink I actually am. I bet you'd look really good in it too! Though your tie matched your glasses and eyes in a really cool way!
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;1:=wink.png,I'm kind of interested to see what you'd look like with a nice fluffy scarf. It's doesn't match as well as your tie, but I bet it'd be really comforting.
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;sharla&stage;1:=confident.png,I'm sure I'll figure it out.
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;daisy&stage;2:=wink.png,It’s kind of important I keep mine on though. They’re not coming off this whole game, I promise.
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;daisy&stage;4:=alarmed.png,It’s… Um… Complicated. Superhero stuff. (I really should probably preface my goals… Or not tell people before the get Akumatized…)
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;1&saidmarker;fled:=confident.png,Ladybug is here to keep you safe, Florina! Don’t get too worried!
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;1&saidmarker;fled:=confused.png,I… Hm… You know, I never really considered the option of running away.
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;2:=wink.png,Maybe you can show me more later! I mean, of your magic! N-not, but if you wanted to... Um!
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,Natsuki, being a woman is about being proud of who you are and the things you like. If ~player~ is the right person for you, they'll just appreciate you more! Um. The personality. Less the encroaching nudity...
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;red&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,N-no?
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,No? Hmm… Shantae, you just sound really familiar…
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;1:=excited.png,No…? Weird, I had a feeling… Let me try again…
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;spooky&stage;1:=wink.png,Of course. And you’re definitely not the cute type of ghost, Spooky. Just the scary kind.
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;spooky&stage;1:=excited.png,Of course Spooky! We all know better than to toy with spirits. Er. I at least hope we do.
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;3:=excited.png,Oh! It’s magic too? And fine gold? It’s a little gaudy, to be honest, but if it keeps people safe!
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,W-well normally I’d say it’s how you present yourself, but I think it’d be rude to say a goddess’s… Assets aren’t something heavenly!
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;amy_rose&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Oh! It's not a Miraculous. You're just like this!
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2c:=confident.png,Oh! Well. That was kind of weird, but at least you're in normal clothes now...
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;kim&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,Oh, I definitely would--Um. Is what someone who found you cute would say.
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;kim&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,Oh! Well if you’re offering--Um. I know magic, Kim! And that’s not a real place!
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;april&stage;1:=bored.png,Oh. Not anymore, huh? Well, the jumpsuit looks nice...
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;4&saidmarker;dizzy:=alarmed.png,O-oh no! Shimakaze, be safe! Do I need to call you a doctor? Or... er... a mechanic, I suppose?
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;2:=bored.png,O-oh. It was a joke. W-well, maybe that's a profession you should follow-up on, Daria?
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;mei&stage;2:=calm.png,Or maybe that was Li-Meng, the wizard? Either way, it's exciting to see you here!
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;1:=confused.png,Repairs? Ash? A-are you okay? You seem awfully resilient to harm... but... er... I'm confused now.
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;1:=alarmed.png,Sexually frustrated before Akumatization, so I’ll keep an eye on you.
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,S-so, just stay confident, okay!
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;1:=confident.png,That’s the spirit, Florina! Be brave!
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;1:=wink.png,You did! Sorry you lost, but… Good job staying in the game!
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pearl&stage;1:=excited.png,This is going to be a lot more interesting than I thought! I-I mean, not you specifically Pearl b-but...
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3:=bored.png,This seems awfully familiar...
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;launch&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Um... I don't quite know who you are, but I think putting the gun away is a good idea.
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,U-um. You’re good at games, right, Blackrose? Let’s just keep playing, don’t get down!
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,I have to say, I don’t know what a GP is. But wherever you’re from, the style is very special!
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;1:=confident.png,Well! You seem like you're having fun!
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Well, I guess we didn't have to worry about that tonight...
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;2:=wink.png,Well... your outfit's so cute and while you may be a little... different, I'll go with it for now!
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Um... well, let's see, I suppose.
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;arwen&stage;1:=calm.png,What brings you to a game like this, I wonder? Y-you know, from your storybook? Magic is such an interesting thing...
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;other&character;cammy&stage;3:=calm.png,Wow! She's amazing! Um. I tope hey--hope they don't keep taking off her clothes though...
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;cammy&stage;2:=confident.png,Wow! You handled yourself so well, Cammy. Guess it's a good thing I didn't need to use my yo-yo, huh?
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;alpha&stage;1:=confident.png,Wow! You're super animated too! You're awesome, Alpha!
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4a:=alarmed.png,W-what? What is this? M-my earrings are still attached so at least...
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4a:=alarmed.png,I-I what!? H-how did you? W-what kind of akuma trickery is this!?
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4a:=confused.png,E-excuse you!? How <i>dare</i> you copy my costume, Vriska! This is <i>far</i> worse than Chloe that one time!
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;dawn&stage;2:=alarmed.png,W-wow, you’re certainly forward about enjoying this, Dawn!
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;morrigan&stage;2:=confused.png,W-w-wait!? Where'd all the bats come from!?
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;3:=confident.png,You are <i>quite</i> strange, Daria. But in a very likable way! I can see us being great friends!
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;3:,marker:coldfloor=confident.png,You did say you were worried about the floor being cold...It’s okay to be a warm person but sensitive to cold. You dress well for all environments!

1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;2:=confused.png,You sound <i>so</i> familiar! I can’t quite pin down why!
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;1:=bored.png,Your attitude is really bad. Hawk Moth will Akumatize you in no time if you keep being rude.

1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;alice:=embarrassed.png,Alice, do you think she means pounds? She doesn’t seem to mean Euro or francs…

1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;jane&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;twilight&stage;1-10:=embarrassed.png,Twilight has, um, however, disregarded normal social conventions. So if you wanted to, Jane, you definitely could?
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;tracer:=embarrassed.png,Um. Did you mean a GBP? I think Tracer knows about that.

#lost costume
2-male_removing_accessory=calm.png,Where did you get that?
2-male_removing_accessory=bored.png,Hmm... I think I could knit you something that might go better with your outfit than ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~.
2-male_removing_accessory=calm.png,Huh, I think I've seen someone I know wear that before.
2-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,<i>Qu'est-ce que je fais?</i>
2-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,And your weapon has a name... are you sure you don't have like... a cockMiraculous or something, Jin?
2-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;captain_falcon&stage;3:=alarmed.png,Because I really don't want to find out what your Akumatized form is like!
2-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;0:=bored.png,E-er, unless you actually have wings? Are you some kind of...
2-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;corrin_m&stage;0:=calm.png,Hmm... how very stylish, Corrin!
2-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,N-not that I mind. But that belt seems full of cool stuff!
2-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;1:=confident.png,Oh! A sash! Very Roman of you! Are you dressed up like some kind of war god? Oh, that's a cool motif for sure!
2-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;0:=wink.png,They're not half bad, Jin, but your eyes are better without them, I think.
2-male_removing_accessory,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;hotstuff:,marker:hotstuff=calm.png,What? What did you expect me to say? 'Hey, hot stuff, this is Marinette. I'd ask you on a date to a movie, but…
2-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;corrin_m&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,You're very gentle, Corrin...
2-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;0:,count-role;other&character;palutena:=confused.png,(I could learn a lot from how Palutena pushes Pit! Maybe even Cat Noir would listen...)
2-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;palutena:=wink.png,I can't tell if you're flirting with him or not, Palutena... Isn't Hades super scary, Pit?
2-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;weiss:=bored.png,Really Weiss? Beautiful skin? Can you even handle sunlight? Ugh. You are <i>frustratingly</i> hard to advocate for.
2-male_removed_accessory=confused.png,It seems like something Cat Noir would like, so I’m glad you’ve ditched it.
2-male_removed_accessory=wink.png,One of the nice things about being Marinette is that I can still help people out of costume, too.
2-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;2:=alarmed.png,A rooster! I forget that the word has different meanings in English! Rooster Miraculous, I mean, we already knew you have a cock--- Ahh!!
2-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;2:=alarmed.png,I mean, it's certainly something to see naked... Er...
2-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;4:=wink.png,Do you use gadgets and all that? I’m really fortunate in that my yo-yo usually has just what I need in it for my Lucky Charm!
2-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;corrin_m&stage;2:=bored.png,I like that in men. Just not married ones.
2-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;2:=alarmed.png,I-I’m not staring at those big strong hands. Nope! Not me! I-I’m just studying the stitching of those villain-fighting gloves well-worn by… Um… Proficient use.
2-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,I'm glad you aren't super attached to those... It's not like it's a Miraculous or part of your costume or something... T-the glasses, not the eyeballs.
2-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;2:=excited.png,Pit, could I actually see that? I could definitely use this to design something cool! You have good fashion sense!
2-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;1:=wink.png,Well, whatever you are, you look like you're going to be fun to play with! In this game! Not- um. Hi!
2-male_removed_accessory,count-role;other&character;d.va&stage;3:=wink.png,You know, I like to incorporate my signatures into my designs, but I, um. Usually do outerwear.
2-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;corrin_m&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,You remind me... kind of about a boy I know...
2-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;palutena:=confident.png,I guess you help put the Pal in Palutena, huh, Pit?
2-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;palutena:=alarmed.png,W-wait, did you bring a firearm in here? I don't see your guns, Pit. Please tell me this isn't divine magic invisibility!
2-male_removed_accessory,priority:99,count-role;self&saidmarker;hotstuff&notsaidmarker;hotstuff1:,marker:hotstuff1=confused.png,...I've got such a crazy crush on you that the only way I can talk to you without foaming at the mouth is over this stupid game.' Pretty ridiculous, right?
2-male_removed_accessory,count-palutena:1,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;aimee:=alarmed.png,W-wait, you snuck a gun in here? Please let's not.
2-female_removing_accessory=wink.png,I figured since you go to a school for heroes, all of us can give you some extra insight!
2-female_removing_accessory=confident.png,Oh! ~name~! I can make you something a little nicer.
2-female_removing_accessory=excited.png,Hmm... I think I could knit you something that might go better with your outfit than ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~.
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;1:=confident.png,<i>Ils pillent toujours le cul!</i>
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;other&character;elizabeth&stage;3:=wink.png,A lady has to have her secrets, <i>oui</i>?
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;dark_magician_girl&stage;1:=confident.png,A lucky necklace? Well, it's lucky I got to meet you today, Dark Magician Girl!
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch&stage;0:=confident.png,Agreed. Capes aren’t quite as good as a heavy cloak. But there’s something debonair about it!
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;0:=wink.png,Ah! I'm glad you picked that trick up from me.
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Ah, <i>zut</i>, the purple hair made me imagine…
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;lyn&stage;4:=excited.png,All of your things are so finely made, I could learn a lot based on your taste!
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;zizou&stage;0:=excited.png,And your hair does look pretty! It’s a very cool texture and color.
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sharla&stage;0:=bored.png,Are you... wait... no... that's not right...
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1a:=wink.png,At least that was a cool outfit. Definitely not stolen. *Cough* Pot *cough* meet *cough* kettle *cough*.
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2c:=embarrassed.png,At least you finally settled on some casualwear... Why are you transforming again?
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;2:=confident.png,At least you have two rounds of small stuff left!
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;daisy&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,Because it has special value...Um...I’ll fix it after? Just trust me.
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;3:=confident.png,Belts? Oh! You’re rocking the “many belts” look. Befitting of a goddess.
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;3:=wink.png,Why limit yourself to conventional aesthetics, Palutena?
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;buffy&stage;3:=bored.png,Buffy, you shouldn't so easily part with objects of fate...
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,But I don’t think they really know this much…
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;3:=confused.png,But Juleka once said there were some magic words if I ever found Chloe being too forward to Adrien…
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;3:=confused.png,But you <i>are</i> really cute.
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;cammy&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Cammy! S-shoot! Here I go--
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sola&stage;0:=alarmed.png,Cool because it's a calming color. Also because it's interesting! It raises so many questions like if it's dyed or not!
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;0:=confident.png,Costume aside, I'm more of a fan of pink than red. A pink ladybug would look kind of weird, don't you think?
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;2:=wink.png,D.Va, could you sign my friend Nino’s album? He’s a big fan!
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;2:=wink.png,Lucio is pretty good for electronica… I’m more of a Jagged Stone girl, myself.
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;1:=confident.png,Don’t be so hard on yourself! Dealing with spirits is really challenging, and you do that really well!
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;1:=wink.png,Sometimes you lose a few hands, Sheena. Don’t worry. I’ll make sure you stay safe. From one spirit person to another.
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2b:=embarrassed.png,E-er, I'm <i>definitely</i> not into the whole maid thing, so I'm hoping whatever comes next is... A bit better.
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;1:=confident.png,Elena, I'd love to learn more about Avalor after this. It seems like a lively place!
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;1:=confused.png,Er. I can owl you chocolate-- call you Ochako, right?
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;revy&stage;0:=bored.png,Er... won't you at least part with your guns...?
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;0:=bored.png,For a love fairy you certainly seem focused on physical stuff…
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;1:=bored.png,Fortunately, um, it looks like you don't really need to rewind since it's just your sandals...
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;videl&stage;0:=confused.png,Gloves! Gloves are coming off!
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;2:=wink.png,Gracious of you to include the part actually keeping that on, Palutena.
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;2:=confident.png,Third time’s the charm, it just doesn’t seem to be a lucky one for you.
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;0:=alarmed.png,H-hey! What are you doing!? Are you copying my Miraculous?
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,What magic is this?! Did you have a Miraculous this whole time!?
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;0:=confident.png,Whoa! You're going to detransform too right--
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;0:=bored.png,Hm… Are you a swordswoman seeking redemption? Maybe you have a broken sword of some sort?
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;0:=calm.png,Hmm... Yeah, that's a good question. It's not like my costume really ever gets damaged...
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;launch&stage;1:=confused.png,Huh? What? Where'd... Is this... did I de-Akumatize Launch or something?
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;0:=wink.png,I bet we’re going to have a lot of fun tonight.
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;2:=confident.png,I don’t want another Rogercop. It looks like you’re almost pre-loaded for that kind of thing…
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;1:=confused.png,I just can't stop geeking out over you! You're an awesome fighter, you're an acclaimed interpol agent--!
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;morrigan&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,I know an Akumatized person when I see one... But I'm not sure I can see an accessory...
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;arwen&stage;0:=confident.png,I never thought I'd actually meet you, but you did so much during the War of the Ring!
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;amy_rose&stage;0:=bored.png,I suppose it could be a ring...
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;red&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,I think this is, a, um. Bad idea. My yo-yo doesn’t count!
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;videl&stage;0:=confident.png,I’m glad to see the senzu bean grows far from the vine, Videl!
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;2:=confident.png,I’ve never seen a bunny miraculous, and it would explain your awesome reflexes! Just not at cards.
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;0:=confused.png,If you’re who I think you are, this akuma situation must be really serious for you to get involved!
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;2:=confused.png,If your angst didn’t turn you into a villain, that is.
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,W-wait, are there people that are into <i>feet</i>!?
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;ann&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,I-I mean, they have a bakery and I think you'd like something sweet.
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;0:=confused.png,I'm... not sure what a waifu is. Like a crush? Oh! Like a crush. No he's-- er...
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;0:=excited.png,In Japan, you have multiple pairs of shoes for school, for your house, and outside, right? That must be nice to have so many opportunities to express yourself!
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;0:=confident.png,They’re nice shoes, Nagisa! The style seems maybe a year or two out of date, though.
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;jane&stage;0:=calm.png,It’s definitely well loved and tailored. I can tell you care a lot about it.
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;mei&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,I've actually heard a lot about you! How you got lost in a Blizzard once...
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;korra&stage;3:=calm.png,Korra, I can understand being insecure…
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;0:=wink.png,Like what? Being sassy and obnoxious?
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;0:=wink.png,Such as what? A weak sense of style and a weaker sense of honor?
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2a:=wink.png,Looks like you've been plundered, Vriska.
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;mercy&stage;1:=calm.png,Mercy, Switzerland has lots of things I find super interesting. The fashion, the languages, and the baking are all wonderful! And the people...
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;revy&stage;1:=confused.png,N-no...? Er... I've yet to solve a problem that needed a gun...

2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;0:=wink.png,Oh! Your French is coming along well, Elizabeth. You have a wonderful accent!
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;0:=confident.png,Oh! Your shoes and socks at the same time! I was worried over nothing. You're pretty brave, aren't you?
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;dawn&stage;1:=excited.png,Oh, you’re from a colder part of the world? I thought it was because people there were stylish, since… You’re in a skirt.
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,O-oh, sorry. I can look away if you’d like?
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;2:=alarmed.png,Oh! I’m sorry, Nagisa. It’s just a very cool jacket!
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,O-oh. Daria <i>c'est une dominatrice.</i> That makes sense.
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;chiaki&stage;0:=confident.png,Or do you just seem a little... bored? I really hope it’s boredom rather than stress!
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1b:=confident.png,Say, Futaba, is Vriska's outfit like that Tron movie? Could you help me out with this?
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kimberly:=bored.png,Say, I have to ask, from one suit-wearing hero to another, where does your stuff <i>go</i> while you're transformed?
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;neo&stage;1:=excited.png,So Neopolitan like the ice cream... and you’re short. Oh you’re pint-sized! I get it!
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3:=calm.png,So, what'll it be <i>this</i> time, Vriska? Some sort of "goddess of <i>luck</i>" outfit?
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3:=calm.png,So, what'll it be <i>this</i> time, Vriska? Some sort of "wandering martial artist" look?
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;spooky&stage;0:=alarmed.png,Spooky? Give me the knife, please. Let’s put away our weapons.
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;2:=confident.png,That famous fashion company some girl managed to destroy?
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;dark_magician_girl&stage;0:=confident.png,That hat was so cute though! It's <i>tres</i> stylish. Where'd you get it?
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;3:=alarmed.png,That lets him give people superpowers but also brings out their worst feelings.
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;jane&stage;1:=confused.png,That seems… Very difficult, Jane.
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,That’s not nice, Hana! Everyone starts somewhere… And bad behavior will just get you banned. Or Akumatized. Let’s hope the former.
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;0:=confident.png,That’s super cool! Do you have a Miraculous or is this kind of power innate to you?
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;1:=excited.png,The collar? Hmm… I’ll admit, I was… Um. <i>Interested</i> to see more.
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyoko&stage;0:=wink.png,The gloves are especially classy touch.
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;0:=excited.png,They say you can stand up to any challenge, no matter however demanding, and that your courage is amazing and…
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;1:=confident.png,Those boots look really well worn, Blackrose! Were they expensive? They seem well-loved!
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;1:=confident.png,Wow! I bet you’ve kicked a lot of butt with those. Figurative and otherwise!
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1c:=wink.png,Though maybe you have the Lion Miraculous, given how overconfident and prideful you're acting.
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;0:=bored.png,Though um, based on your ears, you're not really from around France, are you?
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,Um. Do those bracelets really weigh 8kg each, Chun-li?
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;0:=confident.png,Those bracelets of yours have to be <i>amazing</i> for training, Chun-li!
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;red&stage;2:=wink.png,Um. Exposed. Maybe it’s time for you to put away that sword?
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;0:=confused.png,Um. I don't mean to be critical, but the belts for your belts look is a bit too recent to be vintage...
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,U-uhm. Are you sober enough to be playing, Sei? I'd hate for you to regret this.
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;april&stage;0:=excited.png,Wait, didn't you used to have magic ninja bracelets? Like a Miraculous of some sort?
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;0:=bored.png,Was the choker that valuable? Did someone important give it to you? I’m sorry Blackrose.
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nugi-chan&stage;0:=confused.png,Webmaster? Have I fought that villain before…?
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;1:=confident.png,Well, considering some of the others we’re playing with, I suppose I can trust in that.
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kimberly&stage;0:=wink.png,Well, my Miraculous has a guardian spirit. Her name is Tikki, but even if you can't see her, she's right here...
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;alpha&stage;0:=excited.png,Well, you are a really good singer... Can you play Wonderwall?
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;hotstuff:,marker:hotstuff=calm.png,What? What did you expect me to say? 'Hey, hot stuff, this is Marinette. I'd ask you on a date to a movie, but…
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;pearl&stage;0:=alarmed.png,Whoa! I'm the only one who's supposed to transform!
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;1:=alarmed.png,W-wait, your stockings? Annie! You’re flashing everyone! C-come on!
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,W-well, it's nice to see you like pink stuff too, Saki. B-but you're-- you're flashing us!
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;0:=alarmed.png,W-what? A-are you okay?! Someone get a fire extinguisher!
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;weiss&stage;0:=confused.png,Yes, Weiss. We know how rich you are. Your father owns a hotel and is a mayor or something, blah blah blah…
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;0:=confident.png,You are well adorned! Both in accessories and otherwise.
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;0:=wink.png,Those are really cool armbands. I’m glad my costume normally works as armor, though. That seems a lot heavier. It’s such a relief to see you lose them, though.
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;0:,marker:blake_crush=bored.png,You know Blake, there’s something about you I can’t put my finger in…
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Your rudders... I'm not sure if you've been Akumatized, or this is a Miraculous, or something stranger...
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Oh no, not <i>again!</i> Shimakaze, are you okay?
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;3:=alarmed.png,Y-you know, maybe this can wait until after the game. Don't you use card-like seals? You're a bit... behind right now.
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;0&saidmarker;fled:,count-role;other&character;aimee:=alarmed.png,Aimee, don’t shoot her!
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;jane&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;amalia&stage;4-9:=confident.png,Amalia did show us how to be clever with attire, so I shouldn’t discount anything you have hidden up your sleeve! Or… Erk, pants.
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;weiss&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;blake:=bored.png,Blake, is Weiss always this… Bourgeois?
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;0:,count-role;other&character;red:=embarrassed.png,Costume aside, I'm more of a fan of pink than red. E-er. N-not the Red here, I mean like the color! Kind of like Red's red hair!
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;0:,count-role;other&character;daria:=embarrassed.png,Godzilla? Oh, if it's a big enemy, I'd probably try to evacuate an area, then figure out what part of him was Akumatized.
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose:,count-role;other&character;elizabeth&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,Hm...You and Elizabeth seem to have a lot of sentimental value for your necklaces, Blackrose. You also must have gotten yours from someone important, huh?
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1b:,count-role;other&character;futaba:=excited.png,I mean <i>Alya</i> got Akumatized into a cyber-villain. If I could save her, beating you--er, saving you--should be easy!
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;5:,count-role;other&character;yang:=wink.png,If the two of you aren’t open about this, you really should be! It’s too cute! O-oh. Your ears are… <i>That’s</i> your secret?
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;0:,count-role;self&saidmarker;elaine_puns:=bored.png,It feels like Cat Noir is here, and not in a good way.
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;0:,count-role;other&character;rinkah:=confident.png,Oh! Rinkah and Blackrose, are you from the same place?
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;3:,count-role;other&character;sei:=excited.png,Oh! You and Sei have something in common, with all of your belts. I’m surprised, given that they don’t seem to be keeping anything loose down.
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sharla&stage;0:,count-role;other&character;shazza:=embarrassed.png,Oh! You're Shazza, right! W-wait...
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;daria:=confused.png,Oh, don't be rude, Daria! I'm sure what Ochako does on her knees is-- um... h-her business. (Just play it cool. You can act like nothing was said.)
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;0:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;elaine_puns:=bored.png,That seems a little unfair, Elaine...
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;ryuko:=wink.png,The one that Ryuko has some history with, right?
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;alpha:=embarrassed.png,Um, D.Va, if you asked nicely, I’m sure Alpha would be happy to sing what you were listening to for all of us!
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;3:,count-role;other&character;rinkah:=confused.png,Unless you’ve been Akumatized...Which I hope isn’t the case!
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&saidmarker;strategyguide:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;strategyguide0:,marker:strategyguide0=confused.png,Wait, you’re using a guide for this? It’s... really pretty simple, I thought?
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose:,count-role;other&character;zoey&stage;0-2:=confident.png,What do they say about girls who wear chokers, Zoey?
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;weiss&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;ruby:=bored.png,Yang, is Weiss always like this… Repugnant?
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;weiss&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;yang:=bored.png,Yang, is Weiss always this… Yawn-inducing?

2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,B-but you’re definitely still a goddess and I don’t mean to imply anything too torward fowards you. Forward towards you!
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;4&notsaidmarker;dizzy:=alarmed.png,Er... <i>SHIMAKAZE, ARE YOU OKAY!? Can you hear me?</i>
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Erm. I heard that in a song.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;revy&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,F-fine. Be that way.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;1:=alarmed.png,Finger on! I-I would never unless you really wanted me to b-but-
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;4:=bored.png,Hmm, lots of belts, Palutena. What are you trying so hard to keep secret?
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;alpha&stage;4:=confident.png,Hmm... Okay, Alpha, can you do... Born to be Free, by X Japan?
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;1:=calm.png,Hmm... Well, it's nice to have such a powerful Oracle here with me today! Let's keep an eye out for the akuma, shall we?
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;6:=confident.png,Huh, so that’s your secret! I have a weird feeling about Cat Noir right now…
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyu:=calm.png,I get the feeling that you’re nicer than you let on, Kyu! Just a bit vulgar for my tastes. I think.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;morrigan&stage;1:=confident.png,I guess I'll just have to wait and see!
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;2:=alarmed.png,I just wanted to let you know that it's nice to see, you know, someone who's similar to me go so far. You're a big hero to me. E-even though, you know, we're at this game.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;2:=alarmed.png,It's-- I mean, most of the people around me in Paris. Um. Come from a different type of background. But you're a hero worldwide, so you, you know?
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;1:=calm.png,I kind of have to rely on my Miraculous for most of my powers... I'd like to think I'm pretty athletic, but you're next level!
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;1:=wink.png,I may not be the strongest woman in the world, but I'm actually a pretty good fighter, Chun-li!
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;1:=confident.png,I may be an art student, but that doesn’t mean I’m not clever, Annie! Let's see what you've got!
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;1:=excited.png,I mean, I have some friends that say I’m pretty quirky… oh! I get it. Superpowers are called Quirks where you’re from, aren’t they?
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;2:=wink.png,I much prefer ribbons to keep my hair back, but hairbands can definitely be more fashionable for long hair like yours.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;jane&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,I was about to say...
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;daisy&stage;2:=wink.png,I’d love to try yours, but I’m a one-set kind of girl.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;1:=excited.png,I’m glad you don’t get too caught up in your worries, Nagisa!
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,It’s just the first round, Nagisa. Don’t worry! E-er, as in  no reason to get down! Not that you’ll--Erk.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;chiaki&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,If so, do you have any particular trophy or device you like to play games with? Just curious, in case I have to free you from Hawk Moth.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;1:=confident.png,If you ever visit Paris, I'm sure we'd have a great time!
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,I-I have to admit, I feel really bad that you didn't choose to be here...
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;mercy&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,I-I mean they’re pretty wonderful too, just looking at you. Not you specifically, I mean generally, but you’re nice too, I’m just going to stop now.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:=alarmed.png,I-I mean your panties looked fretty passionable to me-- O-oh erm. Pretty fashionable. A-and you were talking about your shoes. Erk. O-okay then.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:=alarmed.png,I thought those panties looked fretty passionable though! I-I mean, um. Pretty fashionable. W-wait, you were talking about your shoes?
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;lyn&stage;5:=alarmed.png,I-I mean, your taste in fashion. Not... you know…
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,I-it was a pretty bandana, anyway...
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,You're really quite foxy, Elaine!
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;2:=excited.png,I'm just happy you're having a good time! It would be a shame if you were the one the akuma was targeting!
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;1:=wink.png,I'm kind of a dork with how into pink I actually am. I bet you'd look really good in it too! Though your tie matched your glasses and eyes in a really cool way!
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;1:=wink.png,I'm kind of interested to see what you'd look like with a nice fluffy scarf. It's doesn't match as well as your tie, but I bet it'd be really comforting.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;yang&stage;3:=confused.png,I'm not calling you fat, just top heavy... I'll stop talking now.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;sharla&stage;1:=confident.png,I'm sure I'll figure it out.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;videl&stage;1:=wink.png,It’s good to see you have an honorable spirit about you. You’re definitely not like Chloe.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;daisy&stage;4:=alarmed.png,It’s… Um… Complicated. Superhero stuff. (I really should probably preface my goals… Or not tell people before the get Akumatized…)
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;1&saidmarker;fled:=confident.png,Ladybug is here to keep you safe, Florina! Don’t get too worried!
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;1&saidmarker;fled:=confused.png,I… Hm… You know, I never really considered the option of running away.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;2:=wink.png,Maybe you can show me more later! I mean, of your magic! N-not, but if you wanted to... Um!
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,Natsuki, being a woman is about being proud of who you are and the things you like. If ~player~ is the right person for you, they'll just appreciate you more! Um. The personality. Less the encroaching nudity...
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;red&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,N-no?
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,No? Hmm… Shantae, you just sound really familiar…
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;1:=excited.png,No…? Weird, I had a feeling… Let me try again…
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;spooky&stage;1:=wink.png,Of course. And you’re definitely not the cute type of ghost, Spooky. Just the scary kind.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;spooky&stage;1:=excited.png,Of course Spooky! We all know better than to toy with spirits. Er. I at least hope we do.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;3:=excited.png,Oh! It’s magic too? And fine gold? It’s a little gaudy, to be honest, but if it keeps people safe!
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,W-well normally I’d say it’s how you present yourself, but I think it’d be rude to say a goddess’s… Assets aren’t something heavenly!
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;amy_rose&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Oh! It's not a Miraculous. You're just like this!
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2c:=confident.png,Oh! Well. That was kind of weird, but at least you're in normal clothes now...
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;kim&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,Oh, I definitely would--Um. Is what someone who found you cute would say.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;kim&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,Oh! Well if you’re offering--Um. I know magic, Kim! And that’s not a real place!
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;april&stage;1:=bored.png,Oh. Not anymore, huh? Well, the jumpsuit looks nice...
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;4&saidmarker;dizzy:=alarmed.png,O-oh no! Shimakaze, be safe! Do I need to call you a doctor? Or... er... a mechanic, I suppose?
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;2:=bored.png,O-oh. It was a joke. W-well, maybe that's a profession you should follow-up on, Daria?
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;mei&stage;2:=calm.png,Or maybe that was Li-Meng, the wizard? Either way, it's exciting to see you here!
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;1:=confused.png,Repairs? Ash? A-are you okay? You seem awfully resilient to harm... but... er... I'm confused now.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;seven&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Seven… Mme. Nine? Um. My earrings are an accessory, and they’re the one thing I almost never take off. Accessories can be really important for an outfit or a person!
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,S-so, just stay confident, okay!
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;1:=confident.png,That’s the spirit, Florina! Be brave!
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;1:=wink.png,You did! Sorry you lost, but… Good job staying in the game!
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pearl&stage;1:=excited.png,This is going to be a lot more interesting than I thought! I-I mean, not you specifically Pearl b-but...
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3:=bored.png,This seems awfully familiar...
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;4:=bored.png,Um. What were those magic words…?
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;launch&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Um... I don't quite know who you are, but I think putting the gun away is a good idea.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,U-um. You’re good at games, right, Blackrose? Let’s just keep playing, don’t get down!
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,I have to say, I don’t know what a GP is. But wherever you’re from, the style is very special!
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;1:=wink.png,Well! I’m always happy to make new friends.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;1:=confident.png,Well! You seem like you're having fun!
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Well, I guess we don't have to worry about that tonight...
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;2:=wink.png,Well... your outfit's so cute and while you may be a little... different, I'll go with it for now!
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Um... well, let's see, I suppose.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;arwen&stage;1:=calm.png,What brings you to a game like this, I wonder? Y-you know, from your storybook? Magic is such an interesting thing...
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;other&character;cammy&stage;3:=calm.png,Wow! She's amazing! Um. I tope hey--hope they don't keep taking off her clothes though...
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;cammy&stage;2:=confident.png,Wow! You handled yourself so well, Cammy. Guess it's a good thing I didn't need to use my yo-yo, huh?
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;alpha&stage;1:=confident.png,Wow! You're super animated too! You're awesome, Alpha!
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,W-wait a second! You aren't supposed to transform as part of a loss! O-or-- D-did I play this wrong?
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2:=alarmed.png,W-wait! Again!? Y-you have to be using an akuma! I can't transform more than once... And definitely not in such weird ways!
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2:=alarmed.png,S-shoot! You are using some kind of evil magic! A-and er. I haven't fed Tikki yet, so this might be a while before I can fix this...
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4a:=alarmed.png,W-what? What is this? M-my earrings are still attached so at least...
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4a:=alarmed.png,I-I what!? H-how did you? W-what kind of akuma trickery is this!?
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4a:=confused.png,E-excuse you!? How <i>dare</i> you copy my costume, Vriska! This is <i>far</i> worse than Chloe that one time!
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;dawn&stage;2:=alarmed.png,W-wow, you’re certainly forward about enjoying this, Dawn!
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;morrigan&stage;2:=confused.png,W-w-wait!? Where'd all the bats come from!?
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;3:=confident.png,You are <i>quite</i> strange, Daria. But in a very likable way! I can see us being great friends!
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;3:,marker:coldfloor=confident.png,You did say you were worried about the floor being cold...It’s okay to be a warm person but sensitive to cold. You dress well for all environments!
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;3:=excited.png,I’m sure you have lots of other clothes, but if you wanted to go shopping after this, Nagisa, I’m sure we could find something cute!
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;alpha&stage;3:=confident.png,You know, I did do a cover... Of the artistic variety! I'm not a great singer... For Jagged Stone. Maybe I could do one for you too?
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;2:=confused.png,You sound <i>so</i> familiar! I can’t quite pin down why!
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;1:=bored.png,Your attitude is really bad. Hawk Moth will Akumatize you in no time if you keep being rude.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,S-sorry, GoGo. I don't know why I'm being so mean... You're being more than a little rude, though...
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;1:=alarmed.png,K-kinky? J-just because I have a very form fitting costume and a-- You know what, let's not follow this line of thought.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;1:=alarmed.png,Y-you're beautiful in your own way, Daria, y-yut boo-- but you don't resemble him!
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;videl&stage;1:=alarmed.png,Zut, don't make fun of my costume Videl!
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&stage;5:,count-role;other&character;weiss:=alarmed.png,A doll? Weiss, <i>please</i> don’t make this any weirder.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;alice:=embarrassed.png,Alice, do you think she means pounds? She doesn’t seem to mean Euro or francs…
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;boundaries:,count-role;other&character;zoey:,marker:boundaries=wink.png,Don’t worry, Zoey, I think everyone’s being very accepting of other’s boundaries. That makes for a good game, right?
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;daria:=embarrassed.png,Er. Nothing! Uravity! Wust jut wou yer... um... j-just what you were saying! About debris. And stuff.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3b:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=alarmed.png,G-gah! I really hope you just aren't copying people's outfits, Vriska! W-wait, a-are you going to be as lewd as Zone-tan now!?
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;weiss:=confused.png,GP? Does she mean Lien, like you have over in Vale?
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;meia:,count-role;self&saidmarker;corrin_meia_hair:=wink.png,He certainly manages to make a woman’s hairstyle work, <i>oui</i>, Meia?
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;4:,count-role;other&character;corrin_f:=confident.png,Hmm...Palutena, Corrin might use the most tactical choice, but fashion requires a certain economy. I’d be happy to help, as a hero to a goddess of heroes.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;daria:=excited.png,I'm glad you think so, Daria! I think Uravity and Ladybug would make a great team!
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;ann:=wink.png,Is that like a panther of some sort? I bet Ann knows a thing about that.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;4:,count-role;other&character;sei:=embarrassed.png,Just fiven that your stuff is gorn fitting, I mean form fitting! Given form fitting! Erk. Both of you… Belts, right?

2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;ann:=wink.png,Though I think an elegant coat or something like that would be something to see too, wouldn’t you agree Ann?
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;futaba:=wink.png,Though I think an elegant coat or something like that would be something to see too, wouldn’t you agree Futaba?
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;jane&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;moon&stage;1-10:=embarrassed.png,Though I wouldn’t expect you to mimic her for anything else, I thought maybe Moon might have a trick to pull off that zipless undressing!
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;jane&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;buffy&stage;5-10:=wink.png,Though, Buffy did already show us how to take her bra off under her clothes...
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;jane&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;twilight&stage;1-10:=embarrassed.png,Twilight has, um, however, disregarded normal social conventions. So if you wanted to, Jane, you definitely could?

3-male_removing_accessory=embarrassed.png,Not sorry that I’m really good at this. I-I mean, I just practiced a lot-!
3-male_removing_accessory=confident.png,Oh, I've played a lot of card games, so I know when to make good plays, I can show you tricks I'd you'd like, ~name~.
3-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,<i>Qu'est-ce que je fais?</i>
3-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,And your weapon has a name... are you sure you don't have like... a cockMiraculous or something, Jin?
3-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;captain_falcon&stage;3:=alarmed.png,Because I really don't want to find out what your Akumatized form is like!
3-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;0:=bored.png,E-er, unless you actually have wings? Are you some kind of...
3-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;corrin_m&stage;0:=calm.png,Hmm... how very stylish, Corrin!
3-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,N-not that I mind. But that belt seems full of cool stuff!
3-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;1:=confident.png,Oh! A sash! Very Roman of you! Are you dressed up like some kind of war god? Oh, that's a cool motif for sure!
3-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;0:=wink.png,They're not half bad, Jin, but your eyes are better without them, I think.
3-male_removing_accessory,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;hotstuff:,marker:hotstuff=calm.png,What? What did you expect me to say? 'Hey, hot stuff, this is Marinette. I'd ask you on a date to a movie, but…
3-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;corrin_m&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,You're very gentle, Corrin...
3-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;0:,count-role;other&character;palutena:=confused.png,(I could learn a lot from how Palutena pushes Pit! Maybe even Cat Noir would listen...)
3-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;palutena:=wink.png,I can't tell if you're flirting with him or not, Palutena... Isn't Hades super scary, Pit?
3-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;weiss:=bored.png,Really Weiss? Beautiful skin? Can you even handle sunlight? Ugh. You are <i>frustratingly</i> hard to advocate for.
3-male_removing_accessory,count-overwatch&role;target&stage;2:=bored.png,You know Amelie Lacroix, right? The famous ballet dancer? I heard she was involved with Overwatch.
3-male_removed_accessory=alarmed.png,Argh, not strip poker though!
3-male_removed_accessory=confident.png,I'm into creating, crafting, sewing, and that kind of thing, ~name~. Maybe I could make you a hat, or some clothes to replace your ~clothing~?
3-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;2:=alarmed.png,A rooster! I forget that the word has different meanings in English! Rooster Miraculous, I mean, we already knew you have a cock--- Ahh!!
3-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;2:=alarmed.png,I mean, it's certainly something to see naked... Er...
3-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;ryuji&stage;4:=confident.png,Akuma are like... evil magic spirits that take over people and make them do cruel things.
3-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;ryuji&stage;4:=bored.png,Hmm... I think it might be Japanese, but my teacher is Chinese... I'm not really sure where the word comes from, Ryuji!
3-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;4:=wink.png,Do you use gadgets and all that? I’m really fortunate in that my yo-yo usually has just what I need in it for my Lucky Charm!
3-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;corrin_m&stage;2:=bored.png,I like that in men. Just not married ones.
3-male_removed_accessory,count-role;other&character;human:=alarmed.png,I’ve played a bunch of card games, which must be why I’m good at this! Argh, not strip poker though!
3-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;2:=alarmed.png,I-I’m not staring at those big strong hands. Nope! Not me! I-I’m just studying the stitching of those villain-fighting gloves well-worn by… Um… Proficient use.
3-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,I'm glad you aren't super attached to those... It's not like it's a Miraculous or part of your costume or something... T-the glasses, not the eyeballs.
3-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;2:=excited.png,Pit, could I actually see that? I could definitely use this to design something cool! You have good fashion sense!
3-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;1:=wink.png,Well, whatever you are, you look like you're going to be fun to play with! In this game! Not- um. Hi!
3-male_removed_accessory,count-role;other&character;d.va&stage;3:=wink.png,You know, I like to incorporate my signatures into my designs, but I, um. Usually do outerwear.
3-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;corrin_m&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,You remind me... kind of about a boy I know...
3-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;palutena:=confident.png,I guess you help put the Pal in Palutena, huh, Pit?
3-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;palutena:=alarmed.png,W-wait, did you bring a firearm in here? I don't see your guns, Pit. Please tell me this isn't divine magic invisibility!
3-male_removed_accessory,priority:99,count-role;self&saidmarker;hotstuff&notsaidmarker;hotstuff1:,marker:hotstuff1=confused.png,...I've got such a crazy crush on you that the only way I can talk to you without foaming at the mouth is over this stupid game.' Pretty ridiculous, right?
3-male_removed_accessory,priority:0,count-aggressive&role;target:=wink.png,Maybe you don't have to be so aggressive, ~name~. No akuma here and I'd like to keep it that way.
3-male_removed_accessory,priority:0,count-cheerful&role;target:=confident.png,I'm glad you're staying cheery, ~name~. Don't give up yet!
3-male_removed_accessory,priority:0,count-ditzy&role;target:=confused.png,E-er, ~name~, s-shouldn't you maybe pay a bit more attention?
3-male_removed_accessory,priority:0,count-fancy&role;target:=bored.png,It's a shame you dressed <i>so nicely,</i> ~name~, only to lose. I'll shed a tear for you.
3-male_removed_accessory,priority:0,count-fashionable&role;target:=excited.png,That's an awesome ~clothing~, ~name~! You dressed really well today.
3-male_removed_accessory,priority:0,count-fashionable&role;target:=confident.png,Um, I know you just lost your ~clothing~, but just about everything you're wearing is <i>tres</i> stylish, ~name~.
3-male_removed_accessory,priority:0,count-gloomy&role;target:=calm.png,Don't worry ~name~, let's cheer up! I want to see you smile.
3-male_removed_accessory,priority:0,count-innocent&role;target:=confident.png,I'll kick anyone's butt who's mean to ~name~. Don't worry, ~name~, I've got your back!
3-male_removed_accessory,priority:0,count-innocent&role;target:=embarrassed.png,E-er, even though this is kind of new for ~name~, we should all be nice.
3-male_removed_accessory,priority:0,count-nerdy&role;target:=confident.png,Hmm... ~Clothing~? You seem like you're into all kinds of interesting hobbies, ~name~. Would you like me to maybe customize that with some gaming or science motifs?
3-male_removed_accessory,count-palutena:1,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;aimee:=alarmed.png,W-wait, you snuck a gun in here? Please let's not.
3-male_removed_accessory,priority:0,count-sarcastic&role;target:=bored.png,You know, I think sarcasm is a bit like salt. You can use it in small amounts, but too much and you've ruined the whole meal, ~name~.
3-male_removed_accessory,priority:0,count-slutty&role;target:=bored.png,I'm all for being empowered with your sexuality, ~name~, but... Er. I guess this <i>is</i> kind of the place for it.
3-male_removed_accessory,priority:0,count-slutty&role;target:=alarmed.png,I-I'd really prefer if ~name~ would tone down the innuendos... I-it's a little embarrassing.
3-male_removed_accessory,priority:0,count-smart&role;target:=calm.png,~name~'s pretty smart, huh? I guess ~clothing~ was a good choice.
3-female_removing_accessory=wink.png,I figured since you go to a school for heroes, all of us can give you some extra insight!
3-female_removing_accessory=calm.png,Oh, ~clothing.ifPlural(those are cute|that’s a cute)~ ~clothing~.
3-female_removing_accessory=calm.png,I like ~name~’s ~clothing~! did you make it yourself?
3-female_removing_accessory=embarrassed.png,Not sorry that I’m really good at this. I-I mean, I just practiced a lot-!
3-female_removing_accessory=confident.png,Oh, I've played a lot of card games, so I know when to make good plays, I can show you tricks I'd you'd like, ~name~.
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;self&saidmarker;hotstuff&notsaidmarker;hotstuff1:,marker:hotstuff1=confused.png,...I've got such a crazy crush on you that the only way I can talk to you without foaming at the mouth is over this stupid game.' Pretty ridiculous, right?
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;1:=confident.png,<i>Ils pillent toujours le cul!</i>
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;other&character;elizabeth&stage;3:=wink.png,A lady has to have her secrets, <i>oui</i>?
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;dark_magician_girl&stage;1:=confident.png,A lucky necklace? Well, it's lucky I got to meet you today, Dark Magician Girl!
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch&stage;0:=confident.png,Agreed. Capes aren’t quite as good as a heavy cloak. But there’s something debonair about it!
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;0:=wink.png,Ah! I'm glad you picked that trick up from me.
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Ah, <i>zut</i>, the purple hair made me imagine…
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;lyn&stage;4:=excited.png,All of your things are so finely made, I could learn a lot based on your taste!
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;zizou&stage;0:=excited.png,And your hair does look pretty! It’s a very cool texture and color.
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sharla&stage;0:=bored.png,Are you... wait... no... that's not right...
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1a:=wink.png,At least that was a cool outfit. Definitely not stolen. *Cough* Pot *cough* meet *cough* kettle *cough*.
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2c:=embarrassed.png,At least you finally settled on some casualwear... Why are you transforming again?
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;2:=confident.png,At least you have two rounds of small stuff left!
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;daisy&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,Because it has special value...Um...I’ll fix it after? Just trust me.
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;3:=confident.png,Belts? Oh! You’re rocking the “many belts” look. Befitting of a goddess.
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;3:=wink.png,Why limit yourself to conventional aesthetics, Palutena?
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;buffy&stage;3:=bored.png,Buffy, you shouldn't so easily part with objects of fate...
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,But I don’t think they really know this much…
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;3:=confused.png,But Juleka once said there were some magic words if I ever found Chloe being too forward to Adrien…
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;3:=confused.png,But you <i>are</i> really cute.
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;cammy&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Cammy! S-shoot! Here I go--
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sola&stage;0:=alarmed.png,Cool because it's a calming color. Also because it's interesting! It raises so many questions like if it's dyed or not!
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;0:=confident.png,Costume aside, I'm more of a fan of pink than red. A pink ladybug would look kind of weird, don't you think?
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;2:=wink.png,D.Va, could you sign my friend Nino’s album? He’s a big fan!
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;2:=wink.png,Lucio is pretty good for electronica… I’m more of a Jagged Stone girl, myself.
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;1:=confident.png,Don’t be so hard on yourself! Dealing with spirits is really challenging, and you do that really well!
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;1:=wink.png,Sometimes you lose a few hands, Sheena. Don’t worry. I’ll make sure you stay safe. From one spirit person to another.
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2b:=embarrassed.png,E-er, I'm <i>definitely</i> not into the whole maid thing, so I'm hoping whatever comes next is... A bit better.
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;1:=confident.png,Elena, I'd love to learn more about Avalor after this. It seems like a lively place!
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;1:=confused.png,Er. I can owl you chocolate-- call you Ochako, right?
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;revy&stage;0:=bored.png,Er... won't you at least part with your guns...?
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;0:=bored.png,For a love fairy you certainly seem focused on physical stuff…
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;1:=bored.png,Fortunately, um, it looks like you don't really need to rewind since it's just your sandals...
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;videl&stage;0:=confused.png,Gloves! Gloves are coming off!
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;2:=wink.png,Gracious of you to include the part actually keeping that on, Palutena.
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;2:=confident.png,Third time’s the charm, it just doesn’t seem to be a lucky one for you.
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;0:=alarmed.png,H-hey! What are you doing!? Are you copying my Miraculous?
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,What magic is this?! Did you have a Miraculous this whole time!?
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;0:=confident.png,Whoa! You're going to detransform too right--
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;0:=bored.png,Hm… Are you a swordswoman seeking redemption? Maybe you have a broken sword of some sort?
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;0:=calm.png,Hmm... Yeah, that's a good question. It's not like my costume really ever gets damaged...
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;launch&stage;1:=confused.png,Huh? What? Where'd... Is this... did I de-Akumatize Launch or something?
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;0:=wink.png,I bet we’re going to have a lot of fun tonight.
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;2:=confident.png,I don’t want another Rogercop. It looks like you’re almost pre-loaded for that kind of thing…
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;1:=confused.png,I just can't stop geeking out over you! You're an awesome fighter, you're an acclaimed interpol agent--!
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;morrigan&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,I know an Akumatized person when I see one... But I'm not sure I can see an accessory...
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;arwen&stage;0:=confident.png,I never thought I'd actually meet you, but you did so much during the War of the Ring!
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;amy_rose&stage;0:=bored.png,I suppose it could be a ring...
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;red&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,I think this is, a, um. Bad idea. My yo-yo doesn’t count!
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;videl&stage;0:=confident.png,I’m glad to see the senzu bean grows far from the vine, Videl!
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;2:=confident.png,I’ve never seen a bunny miraculous, and it would explain your awesome reflexes! Just not at cards.
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;0:=confused.png,If you’re who I think you are, this akuma situation must be really serious for you to get involved!
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;2:=confused.png,If your angst didn’t turn you into a villain, that is.
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,W-wait, are there people that are into <i>feet</i>!?
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;ann&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,I-I mean, they have a bakery and I think you'd like something sweet.
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;0:=confused.png,I'm... not sure what a waifu is. Like a crush? Oh! Like a crush. No he's-- er...
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;0:=excited.png,In Japan, you have multiple pairs of shoes for school, for your house, and outside, right? That must be nice to have so many opportunities to express yourself!
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;0:=confident.png,They’re nice shoes, Nagisa! The style seems maybe a year or two out of date, though.
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;jane&stage;0:=calm.png,It’s definitely well loved and tailored. I can tell you care a lot about it.
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;mei&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,I've actually heard a lot about you! How you got lost in a Blizzard once...
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;korra&stage;3:=calm.png,Korra, I can understand being insecure…
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;0:=wink.png,Like what? Being sassy and obnoxious?
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;0:=wink.png,Such as what? A weak sense of style and a weaker sense of honor?
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2a:=wink.png,Looks like you've been plundered, Vriska.
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;mercy&stage;1:=calm.png,Mercy, Switzerland has lots of things I find super interesting. The fashion, the languages, and the baking are all wonderful! And the people...
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;revy&stage;1:=confused.png,N-no...? Er... I've yet to solve a problem that needed a gun...
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;yang&stage;2:=alarmed.png,N-not to insult your choice of apparel, just that it has to be awfully hard to find clothes that fit...
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;weiss&stage;1:=wink.png,Not all wealth is material, Weiss.
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;other&character;cammy&stage;2:=confused.png,Oh no! She's getting attacked again! Here, let me help--
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;daisy&stage;1:=excited.png,Oh! Those are cute earrings, Daisy! They match your outfit just like mine!
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;0:=wink.png,Oh! Your French is coming along well, Elizabeth. You have a wonderful accent!
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;0:=confident.png,Oh! Your shoes and socks at the same time! I was worried over nothing. You're pretty brave, aren't you?
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;dawn&stage;1:=excited.png,Oh, you’re from a colder part of the world? I thought it was because people there were stylish, since… You’re in a skirt.
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,O-oh, sorry. I can look away if you’d like?
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;2:=alarmed.png,Oh! I’m sorry, Nagisa. It’s just a very cool jacket!
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,O-oh. Daria <i>c'est une dominatrice.</i> That makes sense.
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;chiaki&stage;0:=confident.png,Or do you just seem a little... bored? I really hope it’s boredom rather than stress!
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1b:=confident.png,Say, Futaba, is Vriska's outfit like that Tron movie? Could you help me out with this?
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kimberly:=bored.png,Say, I have to ask, from one suit-wearing hero to another, where does your stuff <i>go</i> while you're transformed?
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;neo&stage;1:=excited.png,So Neopolitan like the ice cream... and you’re short. Oh you’re pint-sized! I get it!
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3:=calm.png,So, what'll it be <i>this</i> time, Vriska? Some sort of "goddess of <i>luck</i>" outfit?
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3:=calm.png,So, what'll it be <i>this</i> time, Vriska? Some sort of "wandering martial artist" look?
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;spooky&stage;0:=alarmed.png,Spooky? Give me the knife, please. Let’s put away our weapons.
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;2:=confident.png,That famous fashion company some girl managed to destroy?
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;dark_magician_girl&stage;0:=confident.png,That hat was so cute though! It's <i>tres</i> stylish. Where'd you get it?
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;3:=alarmed.png,That lets him give people superpowers but also brings out their worst feelings.
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;jane&stage;1:=confused.png,That seems… Very difficult, Jane.
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,That’s not nice, Hana! Everyone starts somewhere… And bad behavior will just get you banned. Or Akumatized. Let’s hope the former.
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;0:=confident.png,That’s super cool! Do you have a Miraculous or is this kind of power innate to you?
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;1:=excited.png,The collar? Hmm… I’ll admit, I was… Um. <i>Interested</i> to see more.
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyoko&stage;0:=wink.png,The gloves are especially classy touch.
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;0:=excited.png,They say you can stand up to any challenge, no matter however demanding, and that your courage is amazing and…
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;1:=confident.png,Those boots look really well worn, Blackrose! Were they expensive? They seem well-loved!
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;1:=confident.png,Wow! I bet you’ve kicked a lot of butt with those. Figurative and otherwise!
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1c:=wink.png,Though maybe you have the Lion Miraculous, given how overconfident and prideful you're acting.
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;0:=bored.png,Though um, based on your ears, you're not really from around France, are you?
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,Um. Do those bracelets really weigh 8kg each, Chun-li?
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;0:=confident.png,Those bracelets of yours have to be <i>amazing</i> for training, Chun-li!
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;red&stage;2:=wink.png,Um. Exposed. Maybe it’s time for you to put away that sword?
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;0:=confused.png,Um. I don't mean to be critical, but the belts for your belts look is a bit too recent to be vintage...
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,U-uhm. Are you sober enough to be playing, Sei? I'd hate for you to regret this.
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;april&stage;0:=excited.png,Wait, didn't you used to have magic ninja bracelets? Like a Miraculous of some sort?
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;0:=bored.png,Was the choker that valuable? Did someone important give it to you? I’m sorry Blackrose.
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nugi-chan&stage;0:=confused.png,Webmaster? Have I fought that villain before…?
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;1:=confident.png,Well, considering some of the others we’re playing with, I suppose I can trust in that.
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kimberly&stage;0:=wink.png,Well, my Miraculous has a guardian spirit. Her name is Tikki, but even if you can't see her, she's right here...
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;alpha&stage;0:=excited.png,Well, you are a really good singer... Can you play Wonderwall?

3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;weiss&stage;0:=confused.png,Yes, Weiss. We know how rich you are. Your father owns a hotel and is a mayor or something, blah blah blah…
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;0:=confident.png,You are well adorned! Both in accessories and otherwise.
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;0:=wink.png,Those are really cool armbands. I’m glad my costume normally works as armor, though. That seems a lot heavier. It’s such a relief to see you lose them, though.
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;0:,marker:blake_crush=bored.png,You know Blake, there’s something about you I can’t put my finger in…
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Your rudders... I'm not sure if you've been Akumatized, or this is a Miraculous, or something stranger...
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Oh no, not <i>again!</i> Shimakaze, are you okay?
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;3:=alarmed.png,Y-you know, maybe this can wait until after the game. Don't you use card-like seals? You're a bit... behind right now.
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;0&saidmarker;fled:,count-role;other&character;aimee:=alarmed.png,Aimee, don’t shoot her!

3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;weiss&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;blake:=bored.png,Blake, is Weiss always this… Bourgeois?
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;0:,count-role;other&character;red:=embarrassed.png,Costume aside, I'm more of a fan of pink than red. E-er. N-not the Red here, I mean like the color! Kind of like Red's red hair!
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;0:,count-role;other&character;daria:=embarrassed.png,Godzilla? Oh, if it's a big enemy, I'd probably try to evacuate an area, then figure out what part of him was Akumatized.
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose:,count-role;other&character;elizabeth&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,Hm...You and Elizabeth seem to have a lot of sentimental value for your necklaces, Blackrose. You also must have gotten yours from someone important, huh?
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1b:,count-role;other&character;futaba:=excited.png,I mean <i>Alya</i> got Akumatized into a cyber-villain. If I could save her, beating you--er, saving you--should be easy!
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;5:,count-role;other&character;yang:=wink.png,If the two of you aren’t open about this, you really should be! It’s too cute! O-oh. Your ears are… <i>That’s</i> your secret?

3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;0:,count-role;other&character;rinkah:=confident.png,Oh! Rinkah and Blackrose, are you from the same place?
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;3:,count-role;other&character;sei:=excited.png,Oh! You and Sei have something in common, with all of your belts. I’m surprised, given that they don’t seem to be keeping anything loose down.
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sharla&stage;0:,count-role;other&character;shazza:=embarrassed.png,Oh! You're Shazza, right! W-wait...
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;daria:=confused.png,Oh, don't be rude, Daria! I'm sure what Ochako does on her knees is-- um... h-her business. (Just play it cool. You can act like nothing was said.)
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;0:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;elaine_puns:=bored.png,That seems a little unfair, Elaine...
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;ryuko:=wink.png,The one that Ryuko has some history with, right?
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;alpha:=embarrassed.png,Um, D.Va, if you asked nicely, I’m sure Alpha would be happy to sing what you were listening to for all of us!
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;3:,count-role;other&character;rinkah:=confused.png,Unless you’ve been Akumatized...Which I hope isn’t the case!
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&saidmarker;strategyguide:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;strategyguide0:,marker:strategyguide0=confused.png,Wait, you’re using a guide for this? It’s... really pretty simple, I thought?
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose:,count-role;other&character;zoey&stage;0-2:=confident.png,What do they say about girls who wear chokers, Zoey?
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;weiss&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;ruby:=bored.png,Yang, is Weiss always like this… Repugnant?
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;weiss&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;yang:=bored.png,Yang, is Weiss always this… Yawn-inducing?

3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;1:=wink.png,I'm kind of a dork with how into pink I actually am. I bet you'd look really good in it too! Though your tie matched your glasses and eyes in a really cool way!
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;1:=wink.png,I'm kind of interested to see what you'd look like with a nice fluffy scarf. It's doesn't match as well as your tie, but I bet it'd be really comforting.
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;yang&stage;3:=confused.png,I'm not calling you fat, just top heavy... I'll stop talking now.
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;sharla&stage;1:=confident.png,I'm sure I'll figure it out.
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;videl&stage;1:=wink.png,It’s good to see you have an honorable spirit about you. You’re definitely not like Chloe.
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;daisy&stage;4:=alarmed.png,It’s… Um… Complicated. Superhero stuff. (I really should probably preface my goals… Or not tell people before the get Akumatized…)
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;1&saidmarker;fled:=confident.png,Ladybug is here to keep you safe, Florina! Don’t get too worried!
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;1&saidmarker;fled:=confused.png,I… Hm… You know, I never really considered the option of running away.
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;2:=wink.png,Maybe you can show me more later! I mean, of your magic! N-not, but if you wanted to... Um!
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,Natsuki, being a woman is about being proud of who you are and the things you like. If ~player~ is the right person for you, they'll just appreciate you more! Um. The personality. Less the encroaching nudity...
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;red&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,N-no?
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,No? Hmm… Shantae, you just sound really familiar…
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;1:=excited.png,No…? Weird, I had a feeling… Let me try again…
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;spooky&stage;1:=wink.png,Of course. And you’re definitely not the cute type of ghost, Spooky. Just the scary kind.
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;spooky&stage;1:=excited.png,Of course Spooky! We all know better than to toy with spirits. Er. I at least hope we do.
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;3:=excited.png,Oh! It’s magic too? And fine gold? It’s a little gaudy, to be honest, but if it keeps people safe!
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,W-well normally I’d say it’s how you present yourself, but I think it’d be rude to say a goddess’s… Assets aren’t something heavenly!
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;amy_rose&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Oh! It's not a Miraculous. You're just like this!
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2c:=confident.png,Oh! Well. That was kind of weird, but at least you're in normal clothes now...
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;kim&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,Oh, I definitely would--Um. Is what someone who found you cute would say.
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;kim&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,Oh! Well if you’re offering--Um. I know magic, Kim! And that’s not a real place!
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;april&stage;1:=bored.png,Oh. Not anymore, huh? Well, the jumpsuit looks nice...
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;4&saidmarker;dizzy:=alarmed.png,O-oh no! Shimakaze, be safe! Do I need to call you a doctor? Or... er... a mechanic, I suppose?
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;2:=bored.png,O-oh. It was a joke. W-well, maybe that's a profession you should follow-up on, Daria?
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;mei&stage;2:=calm.png,Or maybe that was Li-Meng, the wizard? Either way, it's exciting to see you here!
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;1:=confused.png,Repairs? Ash? A-are you okay? You seem awfully resilient to harm... but... er... I'm confused now.
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;seven&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Seven… Mme. Nine? Um. My earrings are an accessory, and they’re the one thing I almost never take off. Accessories can be really important for an outfit or a person!
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,S-so, just stay confident, okay!
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;1:=confident.png,That’s the spirit, Florina! Be brave!
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;1:=wink.png,You did! Sorry you lost, but… Good job staying in the game!
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pearl&stage;1:=excited.png,This is going to be a lot more interesting than I thought! I-I mean, not you specifically Pearl b-but...
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3:=bored.png,This seems awfully familiar...
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;4:=bored.png,Um. What were those magic words…?
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;launch&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Um... I don't quite know who you are, but I think putting the gun away is a good idea.
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,U-um. You’re good at games, right, Blackrose? Let’s just keep playing, don’t get down!
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,I have to say, I don’t know what a GP is. But wherever you’re from, the style is very special!
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;1:=wink.png,Well! I’m always happy to make new friends.
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;1:=confident.png,Well! You seem like you're having fun!
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Well, I guess we don't have to worry about that tonight...
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;2:=wink.png,Well... your outfit's so cute and while you may be a little... different, I'll go with it for now!
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Um... well, let's see, I suppose.
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;arwen&stage;1:=calm.png,What brings you to a game like this, I wonder? Y-you know, from your storybook? Magic is such an interesting thing...
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;hotstuff:,marker:hotstuff=calm.png,What? What did you expect me to say? 'Hey, hot stuff, this is Marinette. I'd ask you on a date to a movie, but…
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;other&character;cammy&stage;3:=calm.png,Wow! She's amazing! Um. I tope hey--hope they don't keep taking off her clothes though...
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;cammy&stage;2:=confident.png,Wow! You handled yourself so well, Cammy. Guess it's a good thing I didn't need to use my yo-yo, huh?
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;alpha&stage;1:=confident.png,Wow! You're super animated too! You're awesome, Alpha!
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,W-wait a second! You aren't supposed to transform as part of a loss! O-or-- D-did I play this wrong?
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2:=alarmed.png,W-wait! Again!? Y-you have to be using an akuma! I can't transform more than once... And definitely not in such weird ways!
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2:=alarmed.png,S-shoot! You are using some kind of evil magic! A-and er. I haven't fed Tikki yet, so this might be a while before I can fix this...
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4a:=alarmed.png,W-what? What is this? M-my earrings are still attached so at least...
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4a:=alarmed.png,I-I what!? H-how did you? W-what kind of akuma trickery is this!?
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4a:=confused.png,E-excuse you!? How <i>dare</i> you copy my costume, Vriska! This is <i>far</i> worse than Chloe that one time!
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;dawn&stage;2:=alarmed.png,W-wow, you’re certainly forward about enjoying this, Dawn!
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;morrigan&stage;2:=confused.png,W-w-wait!? Where'd all the bats come from!?
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;3:=confident.png,You are <i>quite</i> strange, Daria. But in a very likable way! I can see us being great friends!
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;3:,marker:coldfloor=confident.png,You did say you were worried about the floor being cold...It’s okay to be a warm person but sensitive to cold. You dress well for all environments!
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;3:=excited.png,I’m sure you have lots of other clothes, but if you wanted to go shopping after this, Nagisa, I’m sure we could find something cute!
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;alpha&stage;3:=confident.png,You know, I did do a cover... Of the artistic variety! I'm not a great singer... For Jagged Stone. Maybe I could do one for you too?
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;2:=confused.png,You sound <i>so</i> familiar! I can’t quite pin down why!
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;1:=bored.png,Your attitude is really bad. Hawk Moth will Akumatize you in no time if you keep being rude.
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,S-sorry, GoGo. I don't know why I'm being so mean... You're being more than a little rude, though...
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;1:=alarmed.png,K-kinky? J-just because I have a very form fitting costume and a-- You know what, let's not follow this line of thought.
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;1:=alarmed.png,Y-you're beautiful in your own way, Daria, y-yut boo-- but you don't resemble him!
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;videl&stage;1:=alarmed.png,Zut, don't make fun of my costume Videl!
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&stage;5:,count-role;other&character;weiss:=alarmed.png,A doll? Weiss, <i>please</i> don’t make this any weirder.
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;alice:=embarrassed.png,Alice, do you think she means pounds? She doesn’t seem to mean Euro or francs…
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;boundaries:,count-role;other&character;zoey:,marker:boundaries=wink.png,Don’t worry, Zoey, I think everyone’s being very accepting of other’s boundaries. That makes for a good game, right?
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;daria:=embarrassed.png,Er. Nothing! Uravity! Wust jut wou yer... um... j-just what you were saying! About debris. And stuff.
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3b:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=alarmed.png,G-gah! I really hope you just aren't copying people's outfits, Vriska! W-wait, a-are you going to be as lewd as Zone-tan now!?
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;weiss:=confused.png,GP? Does she mean Lien, like you have over in Vale?
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;meia:,count-role;self&saidmarker;corrin_meia_hair:=wink.png,He certainly manages to make a woman’s hairstyle work, <i>oui</i>, Meia?
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;4:,count-role;other&character;corrin_f:=confident.png,Hmm...Palutena, Corrin might use the most tactical choice, but fashion requires a certain economy. I’d be happy to help, as a hero to a goddess of heroes.
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;daria:=excited.png,I'm glad you think so, Daria! I think Uravity and Ladybug would make a great team!
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;ann:=wink.png,Is that like a panther of some sort? I bet Ann knows a thing about that.
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;4:,count-role;other&character;sei:=embarrassed.png,Just fiven that your stuff is gorn fitting, I mean form fitting! Given form fitting! Erk. Both of you… Belts, right?

3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;sharla&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;shazza:=bored.png,No, Shazza is the blonde Australian... Hm... I'm sorry, I keep forgetting your name.
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3a:,count-role;other&character;ruby:=embarrassed.png,This seems awfully familiar... Like something Ruby might wear... Oh no! You aren't copying people's outfits, are you!?
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;ann:=wink.png,Though I think an elegant coat or something like that would be something to see too, wouldn’t you agree Ann?
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;futaba:=wink.png,Though I think an elegant coat or something like that would be something to see too, wouldn’t you agree Futaba?
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;jane&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;moon&stage;1-10:=embarrassed.png,Though I wouldn’t expect you to mimic her for anything else, I thought maybe Moon might have a trick to pull off that zipless undressing!
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;jane&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;buffy&stage;5-10:=wink.png,Though, Buffy did already show us how to take her bra off under her clothes...
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;jane&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;twilight&stage;1-10:=embarrassed.png,Twilight has, um, however, disregarded normal social conventions. So if you wanted to, Jane, you definitely could?
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;tracer:=embarrassed.png,Um. Did you mean a GBP? I think Tracer knows about that.
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan:=alarmed.png,Wait, Streaming-chan has a real name? And you know each other? And... <i>my,</i> you have stories.
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;2:,count-role;self&saidmarker;d.va_competition:=wink.png,We'll just have to see h-how the rest goes, don't we, Hana?
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;futaba:,marker:french=bored.png,What was that, Futaba? <i>Grossier.</i>
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;zizou&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;sola:=confident.png,You and Sola know each other, right Zizou? Do all of your friends have such cool hairstyles?

3-female_removed_accessory,priority:0,count-aggressive&role;target:=wink.png,Maybe you don't have to be so aggressive, ~name~. No akuma here and I'd like to keep it that way.
3-female_removed_accessory,priority:0,count-aggressive&role;target:=embarrassed.png,You know, maybe you shouldn't be so angry, ~name~. We're all here together, after all...

4-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;2:=alarmed.png,A rooster! I forget that the word has different meanings in English! Rooster Miraculous, I mean, we already knew you have a cock--- Ahh!!
4-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;2:=alarmed.png,I mean, it's certainly something to see naked... Er...
4-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;ryuji&stage;4:=confident.png,Akuma are like... evil magic spirits that take over people and make them do cruel things.
4-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;ryuji&stage;4:=bored.png,Hmm... I think it might be Japanese, but my teacher is Chinese... I'm not really sure where the word comes from, Ryuji!
4-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;4:=wink.png,Do you use gadgets and all that? I’m really fortunate in that my yo-yo usually has just what I need in it for my Lucky Charm!
4-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;corrin_m&stage;2:=bored.png,I like that in men. Just not married ones.
4-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;2:=alarmed.png,I-I’m not staring at those big strong hands. Nope! Not me! I-I’m just studying the stitching of those villain-fighting gloves well-worn by… Um… Proficient use.
4-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,I'm glad you aren't super attached to those... It's not like it's a Miraculous or part of your costume or something... T-the glasses, not the eyeballs.
4-male_removed_accessory,count-role;self&saidmarker;physio:=alarmed.png,N-not that I mean physiologically. I mean physically. Zut.
4-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;2:=excited.png,Pit, could I actually see that? I could definitely use this to design something cool! You have good fashion sense!
4-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;1:=wink.png,Well, whatever you are, you look like you're going to be fun to play with! In this game! Not- um. Hi!
4-male_removed_accessory,count-role;other&character;d.va&stage;3:=wink.png,You know, I like to incorporate my signatures into my designs, but I, um. Usually do outerwear.
4-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;corrin_m&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,You remind me... kind of about a boy I know...
4-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;palutena:=confident.png,I guess you help put the Pal in Palutena, huh, Pit?
4-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;palutena:=alarmed.png,W-wait, did you bring a firearm in here? I don't see your guns, Pit. Please tell me this isn't divine magic invisibility!
4-male_removed_accessory,count-palutena:1,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;aimee:=alarmed.png,W-wait, you snuck a gun in here? Please let's not.
4-female_removing_accessory=wink.png,I figured since you go to a school for heroes, all of us can give you some extra insight!
4-female_removing_accessory=excited.png,Would you hand that to me? It definitely has some unique designs.
4-female_removing_accessory=bored.png,I don't really think I like the aesthetics of your  ~clothing~, ~name~.
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&stage;2:=calm.png,~Clothing~... Hm... Are those markings Agreste? A Revocs or Ray=Out maybe?
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;1:=confident.png,<i>Ils pillent toujours le cul!</i>
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;other&character;elizabeth&stage;3:=wink.png,A lady has to have her secrets, <i>oui</i>?
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;dark_magician_girl&stage;1:=confident.png,A lucky necklace? Well, it's lucky I got to meet you today, Dark Magician Girl!
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch&stage;0:=confident.png,Agreed. Capes aren’t quite as good as a heavy cloak. But there’s something debonair about it!
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;0:=wink.png,Ah! I'm glad you picked that trick up from me.
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Ah, <i>zut</i>, the purple hair made me imagine…
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;lyn&stage;4:=excited.png,All of your things are so finely made, I could learn a lot based on your taste!
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;zizou&stage;0:=excited.png,And your hair does look pretty! It’s a very cool texture and color.
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sharla&stage;0:=bored.png,Are you... wait... no... that's not right...
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1a:=wink.png,At least that was a cool outfit. Definitely not stolen. *Cough* Pot *cough* meet *cough* kettle *cough*.
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2c:=embarrassed.png,At least you finally settled on some casualwear... Why are you transforming again?
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;2:=confident.png,At least you have two rounds of small stuff left!
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;daisy&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,Because it has special value...Um...I’ll fix it after? Just trust me.
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;3:=confident.png,Belts? Oh! You’re rocking the “many belts” look. Befitting of a goddess.
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;3:=wink.png,Why limit yourself to conventional aesthetics, Palutena?
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;buffy&stage;3:=bored.png,Buffy, you shouldn't so easily part with objects of fate...
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,But I don’t think they really know this much…
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;3:=confused.png,But Juleka once said there were some magic words if I ever found Chloe being too forward to Adrien…
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;3:=confused.png,But you <i>are</i> really cute.
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;cammy&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Cammy! S-shoot! Here I go--
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sola&stage;0:=alarmed.png,Cool because it's a calming color. Also because it's interesting! It raises so many questions like if it's dyed or not!
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;0:=confident.png,Costume aside, I'm more of a fan of pink than red. A pink ladybug would look kind of weird, don't you think?
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;2:=wink.png,D.Va, could you sign my friend Nino’s album? He’s a big fan!
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;2:=wink.png,Lucio is pretty good for electronica… I’m more of a Jagged Stone girl, myself.
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;1:=confident.png,Don’t be so hard on yourself! Dealing with spirits is really challenging, and you do that really well!
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;1:=wink.png,Sometimes you lose a few hands, Sheena. Don’t worry. I’ll make sure you stay safe. From one spirit person to another.
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2b:=embarrassed.png,E-er, I'm <i>definitely</i> not into the whole maid thing, so I'm hoping whatever comes next is... A bit better.
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;1:=confident.png,Elena, I'd love to learn more about Avalor after this. It seems like a lively place!
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;1:=confused.png,Er. I can owl you chocolate-- call you Ochako, right?
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;revy&stage;0:=bored.png,Er... won't you at least part with your guns...?
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;0:=bored.png,For a love fairy you certainly seem focused on physical stuff…
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;1:=bored.png,Fortunately, um, it looks like you don't really need to rewind since it's just your sandals...
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;videl&stage;0:=confused.png,Gloves! Gloves are coming off!
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;2:=wink.png,Gracious of you to include the part actually keeping that on, Palutena.
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;2:=confident.png,Third time’s the charm, it just doesn’t seem to be a lucky one for you.
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;0:=alarmed.png,H-hey! What are you doing!? Are you copying my Miraculous?
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,What magic is this?! Did you have a Miraculous this whole time!?
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;0:=confident.png,Whoa! You're going to detransform too right--
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;0:=bored.png,Hm… Are you a swordswoman seeking redemption? Maybe you have a broken sword of some sort?
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;0:=calm.png,Hmm... Yeah, that's a good question. It's not like my costume really ever gets damaged...
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;launch&stage;1:=confused.png,Huh? What? Where'd... Is this... did I de-Akumatize Launch or something?
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;0:=wink.png,I bet we’re going to have a lot of fun tonight.
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;2:=confident.png,I don’t want another Rogercop. It looks like you’re almost pre-loaded for that kind of thing…
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;1:=confused.png,I just can't stop geeking out over you! You're an awesome fighter, you're an acclaimed interpol agent--!
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;morrigan&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,I know an Akumatized person when I see one... But I'm not sure I can see an accessory...
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;arwen&stage;0:=confident.png,I never thought I'd actually meet you, but you did so much during the War of the Ring!
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;amy_rose&stage;0:=bored.png,I suppose it could be a ring...
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;red&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,I think this is, a, um. Bad idea. My yo-yo doesn’t count!
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;videl&stage;0:=confident.png,I’m glad to see the senzu bean grows far from the vine, Videl!
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;2:=confident.png,I’ve never seen a bunny miraculous, and it would explain your awesome reflexes! Just not at cards.
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;2:=confused.png,If your angst didn’t turn you into a villain, that is.
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,W-wait, are there people that are into <i>feet</i>!?
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;ann&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,I-I mean, they have a bakery and I think you'd like something sweet.
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;0:=confused.png,I'm... not sure what a waifu is. Like a crush? Oh! Like a crush. No he's-- er...
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;0:=excited.png,In Japan, you have multiple pairs of shoes for school, for your house, and outside, right? That must be nice to have so many opportunities to express yourself!
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;0:=confident.png,They’re nice shoes, Nagisa! The style seems maybe a year or two out of date, though.
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;jane&stage;0:=calm.png,It’s definitely well loved and tailored. I can tell you care a lot about it.
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;mei&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,I've actually heard a lot about you! How you got lost in a Blizzard once...
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;korra&stage;3:=calm.png,Korra, I can understand being insecure…
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;0:=wink.png,Like what? Being sassy and obnoxious?
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;0:=wink.png,Such as what? A weak sense of style and a weaker sense of honor?
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2a:=wink.png,Looks like you've been plundered, Vriska.
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;mercy&stage;1:=calm.png,Mercy, Switzerland has lots of things I find super interesting. The fashion, the languages, and the baking are all wonderful! And the people...
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;mercy&stage;1:=calm.png,Mercy, Switzerland has lots of things I find super interesting. The fashion, the languages, and the baking are all wonderful! And the people…
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;revy&stage;1:=confused.png,N-no...? Er... I've yet to solve a problem that needed a gun...
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;yang&stage;2:=alarmed.png,N-not to insult your choice of apparel, just that it has to be awfully hard to find clothes that fit...
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;weiss&stage;1:=wink.png,Not all wealth is material, Weiss.
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;other&character;cammy&stage;2:=confused.png,Oh no! She's getting attacked again! Here, let me help--
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;daisy&stage;1:=excited.png,Oh! Those are cute earrings, Daisy! They match your outfit just like mine!
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;0:=wink.png,Oh! Your French is coming along well, Elizabeth. You have a wonderful accent!
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;0:=confident.png,Oh! Your shoes and socks at the same time! I was worried over nothing. You're pretty brave, aren't you?
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;dawn&stage;1:=excited.png,Oh, you’re from a colder part of the world? I thought it was because people there were stylish, since… You’re in a skirt.
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,O-oh, sorry. I can look away if you’d like?
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;2:=alarmed.png,Oh! I’m sorry, Nagisa. It’s just a very cool jacket!
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,O-oh. Daria <i>c'est une dominatrice.</i> That makes sense.
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;chiaki&stage;0:=confident.png,Or do you just seem a little... bored? I really hope it’s boredom rather than stress!
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1b:=confident.png,Say, Futaba, is Vriska's outfit like that Tron movie? Could you help me out with this?
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kimberly:=bored.png,Say, I have to ask, from one suit-wearing hero to another, where does your stuff <i>go</i> while you're transformed?
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;neo&stage;1:=excited.png,So Neopolitan like the ice cream... and you’re short. Oh you’re pint-sized! I get it!
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3:=calm.png,So, what'll it be <i>this</i> time, Vriska? Some sort of "goddess of <i>luck</i>" outfit?
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3:=calm.png,So, what'll it be <i>this</i> time, Vriska? Some sort of "wandering martial artist" look?
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;spooky&stage;0:=alarmed.png,Spooky? Give me the knife, please. Let’s put away our weapons.
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;2:=confident.png,That famous fashion company some girl managed to destroy?
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;dark_magician_girl&stage;0:=confident.png,That hat was so cute though! It's <i>tres</i> stylish. Where'd you get it?
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;3:=alarmed.png,That lets him give people superpowers but also brings out their worst feelings.
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;jane&stage;1:=confused.png,That seems… Very difficult, Jane.
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,That’s not nice, Hana! Everyone starts somewhere… And bad behavior will just get you banned. Or Akumatized. Let’s hope the former.
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;0:=confident.png,That’s super cool! Do you have a Miraculous or is this kind of power innate to you?
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;1:=excited.png,The collar? Hmm… I’ll admit, I was… Um. <i>Interested</i> to see more.
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyoko&stage;0:=wink.png,The gloves are especially classy touch.
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;0:=excited.png,They say you can stand up to any challenge, no matter however demanding, and that your courage is amazing and…
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;1:=confident.png,Those boots look really well worn, Blackrose! Were they expensive? They seem well-loved!
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;1:=confident.png,Wow! I bet you’ve kicked a lot of butt with those. Figurative and otherwise!
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1c:=wink.png,Though maybe you have the Lion Miraculous, given how overconfident and prideful you're acting.
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;0:=bored.png,Though um, based on your ears, you're not really from around France, are you?
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,Um. Do those bracelets really weigh 8kg each, Chun-li?
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;0:=confident.png,Those bracelets of yours have to be <i>amazing</i> for training, Chun-li!
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;red&stage;2:=wink.png,Um. Exposed. Maybe it’s time for you to put away that sword?
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;0:=confused.png,Um. I don't mean to be critical, but the belts for your belts look is a bit too recent to be vintage...
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,U-uhm. Are you sober enough to be playing, Sei? I'd hate for you to regret this.
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;april&stage;0:=excited.png,Wait, didn't you used to have magic ninja bracelets? Like a Miraculous of some sort?
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;0:=bored.png,Was the choker that valuable? Did someone important give it to you? I’m sorry Blackrose.
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nugi-chan&stage;0:=confused.png,Webmaster? Have I fought that villain before…?
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;1:=confident.png,Well, considering some of the others we’re playing with, I suppose I can trust in that.
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kimberly&stage;0:=wink.png,Well, my Miraculous has a guardian spirit. Her name is Tikki, but even if you can't see her, she's right here...
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;alpha&stage;0:=excited.png,Well, you are a really good singer... Can you play Wonderwall?
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;pearl&stage;0:=alarmed.png,Whoa! I'm the only one who's supposed to transform!
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;1:=alarmed.png,W-wait, your stockings? Annie! You’re flashing everyone! C-come on!
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,W-well, it's nice to see you like pink stuff too, Saki. B-but you're-- you're flashing us!
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;0:=alarmed.png,W-what? A-are you okay?! Someone get a fire extinguisher!
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;weiss&stage;0:=confused.png,Yes, Weiss. We know how rich you are. Your father owns a hotel and is a mayor or something, blah blah blah…
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;0:=confident.png,You are well adorned! Both in accessories and otherwise.
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;0:=wink.png,Those are really cool armbands. I’m glad my costume normally works as armor, though. That seems a lot heavier. It’s such a relief to see you lose them, though.
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;0:,marker:blake_crush=bored.png,You know Blake, there’s something about you I can’t put my finger in…
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Your rudders... I'm not sure if you've been Akumatized, or this is a Miraculous, or something stranger...
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Oh no, not <i>again!</i> Shimakaze, are you okay?
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;3:=alarmed.png,Y-you know, maybe this can wait until after the game. Don't you use card-like seals? You're a bit... behind right now.
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;0&saidmarker;fled:,count-role;other&character;aimee:=alarmed.png,Aimee, don’t shoot her!
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;jane&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;amalia&stage;4-9:=confident.png,Amalia did show us how to be clever with attire, so I shouldn’t discount anything you have hidden up your sleeve! Or… Erk, pants.
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;weiss&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;blake:=bored.png,Blake, is Weiss always this… Bourgeois?
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;0:,count-role;other&character;red:=embarrassed.png,Costume aside, I'm more of a fan of pink than red. E-er. N-not the Red here, I mean like the color! Kind of like Red's red hair!
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;0:,count-role;other&character;daria:=embarrassed.png,Godzilla? Oh, if it's a big enemy, I'd probably try to evacuate an area, then figure out what part of him was Akumatized.
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose:,count-role;other&character;elizabeth&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,Hm...You and Elizabeth seem to have a lot of sentimental value for your necklaces, Blackrose. You also must have gotten yours from someone important, huh?
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1b:,count-role;other&character;futaba:=excited.png,I mean <i>Alya</i> got Akumatized into a cyber-villain. If I could save her, beating you--er, saving you--should be easy!
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;5:,count-role;other&character;yang:=wink.png,If the two of you aren’t open about this, you really should be! It’s too cute! O-oh. Your ears are… <i>That’s</i> your secret?
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;0:,count-role;self&saidmarker;elaine_puns:=bored.png,It feels like Cat Noir is here, and not in a good way.
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;0:,count-role;other&character;rinkah:=confident.png,Oh! Rinkah and Blackrose, are you from the same place?
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;3:,count-role;other&character;sei:=excited.png,Oh! You and Sei have something in common, with all of your belts. I’m surprised, given that they don’t seem to be keeping anything loose down.
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sharla&stage;0:,count-role;other&character;shazza:=embarrassed.png,Oh! You're Shazza, right! W-wait...
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;daria:=confused.png,Oh, don't be rude, Daria! I'm sure what Ochako does on her knees is-- um... h-her business. (Just play it cool. You can act like nothing was said.)
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;0:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;elaine_puns:=bored.png,That seems a little unfair, Elaine...
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;ryuko:=wink.png,The one that Ryuko has some history with, right?

4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;1:=calm.png,I kind of have to rely on my Miraculous for most of my powers... I'd like to think I'm pretty athletic, but you're next level!

4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;1:=excited.png,I mean, I have some friends that say I’m pretty quirky… oh! I get it. Superpowers are called Quirks where you’re from, aren’t they?
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;2:=wink.png,I much prefer ribbons to keep my hair back, but hairbands can definitely be more fashionable for long hair like yours.

4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;daisy&stage;2:=wink.png,I’d love to try yours, but I’m a one-set kind of girl.
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;1:=excited.png,I’m glad you don’t get too caught up in your worries, Nagisa!
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,It’s just the first round, Nagisa. Don’t worry! E-er, as in  no reason to get down! Not that you’ll--Erk.
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;chiaki&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,If so, do you have any particular trophy or device you like to play games with? Just curious, in case I have to free you from Hawk Moth.
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;1:=confident.png,If you ever visit Paris, I'm sure we'd have a great time!
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,I-I have to admit, I feel really bad that you didn't choose to be here...
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;mercy&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,I-I mean they’re pretty wonderful too, just looking at you. Not you specifically, I mean generally, but you’re nice too, I’m just going to stop now.
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:=alarmed.png,I-I mean your panties looked fretty passionable to me-- O-oh erm. Pretty fashionable. A-and you were talking about your shoes. Erk. O-okay then.
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:=alarmed.png,I thought those panties looked fretty passionable though! I-I mean, um. Pretty fashionable. W-wait, you were talking about your shoes?

4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,I-it was a pretty bandana, anyway...
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,You're really quite foxy, Elaine!
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;2:=excited.png,I'm just happy you're having a good time! It would be a shame if you were the one the akuma was targeting!
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;1:=wink.png,I'm kind of a dork with how into pink I actually am. I bet you'd look really good in it too! Though your tie matched your glasses and eyes in a really cool way!
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;1:=wink.png,I'm kind of interested to see what you'd look like with a nice fluffy scarf. It's doesn't match as well as your tie, but I bet it'd be really comforting.
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;yang&stage;3:=confused.png,I'm not calling you fat, just top heavy... I'll stop talking now.
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;sharla&stage;1:=confident.png,I'm sure I'll figure it out.
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;videl&stage;1:=wink.png,It’s good to see you have an honorable spirit about you. You’re definitely not like Chloe.
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;daisy&stage;4:=alarmed.png,It’s… Um… Complicated. Superhero stuff. (I really should probably preface my goals… Or not tell people before the get Akumatized…)

4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;2:=wink.png,Maybe you can show me more later! I mean, of your magic! N-not, but if you wanted to... Um!
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,Natsuki, being a woman is about being proud of who you are and the things you like. If ~player~ is the right person for you, they'll just appreciate you more! Um. The personality. Less the encroaching nudity...
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;red&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,N-no?
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,No? Hmm… Shantae, you just sound really familiar…
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;1:=excited.png,No…? Weird, I had a feeling… Let me try again…
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;spooky&stage;1:=wink.png,Of course. And you’re definitely not the cute type of ghost, Spooky. Just the scary kind.
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;spooky&stage;1:=excited.png,Of course Spooky! We all know better than to toy with spirits. Er. I at least hope we do.
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;3:=excited.png,Oh! It’s magic too? And fine gold? It’s a little gaudy, to be honest, but if it keeps people safe!
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,W-well normally I’d say it’s how you present yourself, but I think it’d be rude to say a goddess’s… Assets aren’t something heavenly!
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;amy_rose&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Oh! It's not a Miraculous. You're just like this!
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2c:=confident.png,Oh! Well. That was kind of weird, but at least you're in normal clothes now...
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;kim&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,Oh, I definitely would--Um. Is what someone who found you cute would say.
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;kim&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,Oh! Well if you’re offering--Um. I know magic, Kim! And that’s not a real place!
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;april&stage;1:=bored.png,Oh. Not anymore, huh? Well, the jumpsuit looks nice...
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;4&saidmarker;dizzy:=alarmed.png,O-oh no! Shimakaze, be safe! Do I need to call you a doctor? Or... er... a mechanic, I suppose?
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;2:=bored.png,O-oh. It was a joke. W-well, maybe that's a profession you should follow-up on, Daria?
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;mei&stage;2:=calm.png,Or maybe that was Li-Meng, the wizard? Either way, it's exciting to see you here!
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;1:=confused.png,Repairs? Ash? A-are you okay? You seem awfully resilient to harm... but... er... I'm confused now.
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;seven&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Seven… Mme. Nine? Um. My earrings are an accessory, and they’re the one thing I almost never take off. Accessories can be really important for an outfit or a person!
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,S-so, just stay confident, okay!
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;1:=confident.png,That’s the spirit, Florina! Be brave!
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;1:=wink.png,You did! Sorry you lost, but… Good job staying in the game!
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pearl&stage;1:=excited.png,This is going to be a lot more interesting than I thought! I-I mean, not you specifically Pearl b-but...
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3:=bored.png,This seems awfully familiar...
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;4:=bored.png,Um. What were those magic words…?
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;launch&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Um... I don't quite know who you are, but I think putting the gun away is a good idea.
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,U-um. You’re good at games, right, Blackrose? Let’s just keep playing, don’t get down!
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,I have to say, I don’t know what a GP is. But wherever you’re from, the style is very special!
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;1:=wink.png,Well! I’m always happy to make new friends.
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;1:=confident.png,Well! You seem like you're having fun!
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Well, I guess we don't have to worry about that tonight...
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;2:=wink.png,Well... your outfit's so cute and while you may be a little... different, I'll go with it for now!
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Um... well, let's see, I suppose.
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;arwen&stage;1:=calm.png,What brings you to a game like this, I wonder? Y-you know, from your storybook? Magic is such an interesting thing...
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;other&character;cammy&stage;3:=calm.png,Wow! She's amazing! Um. I tope hey--hope they don't keep taking off her clothes though...
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;cammy&stage;2:=confident.png,Wow! You handled yourself so well, Cammy. Guess it's a good thing I didn't need to use my yo-yo, huh?
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;alpha&stage;1:=confident.png,Wow! You're super animated too! You're awesome, Alpha!
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,W-wait a second! You aren't supposed to transform as part of a loss! O-or-- D-did I play this wrong?
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2:=alarmed.png,W-wait! Again!? Y-you have to be using an akuma! I can't transform more than once... And definitely not in such weird ways!
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2:=alarmed.png,S-shoot! You are using some kind of evil magic! A-and er. I haven't fed Tikki yet, so this might be a while before I can fix this...
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4a:=alarmed.png,W-what? What is this? M-my earrings are still attached so at least...
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4a:=alarmed.png,I-I what!? H-how did you? W-what kind of akuma trickery is this!?
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4a:=confused.png,E-excuse you!? How <i>dare</i> you copy my costume, Vriska! This is <i>far</i> worse than Chloe that one time!
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;dawn&stage;2:=alarmed.png,W-wow, you’re certainly forward about enjoying this, Dawn!
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;morrigan&stage;2:=confused.png,W-w-wait!? Where'd all the bats come from!?
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;3:=confident.png,You are <i>quite</i> strange, Daria. But in a very likable way! I can see us being great friends!
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;3:,marker:coldfloor=confident.png,You did say you were worried about the floor being cold...It’s okay to be a warm person but sensitive to cold. You dress well for all environments!
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;3:=excited.png,I’m sure you have lots of other clothes, but if you wanted to go shopping after this, Nagisa, I’m sure we could find something cute!
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;alpha&stage;3:=confident.png,You know, I did do a cover... Of the artistic variety! I'm not a great singer... For Jagged Stone. Maybe I could do one for you too?
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;2:=confused.png,You sound <i>so</i> familiar! I can’t quite pin down why!
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;1:=bored.png,Your attitude is really bad. Hawk Moth will Akumatize you in no time if you keep being rude.
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,S-sorry, GoGo. I don't know why I'm being so mean... You're being more than a little rude, though...
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;1:=alarmed.png,K-kinky? J-just because I have a very form fitting costume and a-- You know what, let's not follow this line of thought.
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;1:=alarmed.png,Y-you're beautiful in your own way, Daria, y-yut boo-- but you don't resemble him!
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;videl&stage;1:=alarmed.png,Zut, don't make fun of my costume Videl!
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&stage;5:,count-role;other&character;weiss:=alarmed.png,A doll? Weiss, <i>please</i> don’t make this any weirder.
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;alice:=embarrassed.png,Alice, do you think she means pounds? She doesn’t seem to mean Euro or francs…
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;boundaries:,count-role;other&character;zoey:,marker:boundaries=wink.png,Don’t worry, Zoey, I think everyone’s being very accepting of other’s boundaries. That makes for a good game, right?
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;daria:=embarrassed.png,Er. Nothing! Uravity! Wust jut wou yer... um... j-just what you were saying! About debris. And stuff.
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3b:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=alarmed.png,G-gah! I really hope you just aren't copying people's outfits, Vriska! W-wait, a-are you going to be as lewd as Zone-tan now!?
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;weiss:=confused.png,GP? Does she mean Lien, like you have over in Vale?
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;meia:,count-role;self&saidmarker;corrin_meia_hair:=wink.png,He certainly manages to make a woman’s hairstyle work, <i>oui</i>, Meia?
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;4:,count-role;other&character;corrin_f:=confident.png,Hmm...Palutena, Corrin might use the most tactical choice, but fashion requires a certain economy. I’d be happy to help, as a hero to a goddess of heroes.
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;daria:=excited.png,I'm glad you think so, Daria! I think Uravity and Ladybug would make a great team!
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;ann:=wink.png,Is that like a panther of some sort? I bet Ann knows a thing about that.
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;4:,count-role;other&character;sei:=embarrassed.png,Just fiven that your stuff is gorn fitting, I mean form fitting! Given form fitting! Erk. Both of you… Belts, right?
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;rinkah:=embarrassed.png,N-no? Oh. I seem...You just look...I promise I didn’t mean to imply--
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;sharla&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;shazza:=bored.png,No, Shazza is the blonde Australian... Hm... I'm sorry, I keep forgetting your name.
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3a:,count-role;other&character;ruby:=embarrassed.png,This seems awfully familiar... Like something Ruby might wear... Oh no! You aren't copying people's outfits, are you!?
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;ann:=wink.png,Though I think an elegant coat or something like that would be something to see too, wouldn’t you agree Ann?
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;futaba:=wink.png,Though I think an elegant coat or something like that would be something to see too, wouldn’t you agree Futaba?
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;jane&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;moon&stage;1-10:=embarrassed.png,Though I wouldn’t expect you to mimic her for anything else, I thought maybe Moon might have a trick to pull off that zipless undressing!
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;jane&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;buffy&stage;5-10:=wink.png,Though, Buffy did already show us how to take her bra off under her clothes...
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;jane&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;twilight&stage;1-10:=embarrassed.png,Twilight has, um, however, disregarded normal social conventions. So if you wanted to, Jane, you definitely could?
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;tracer:=embarrassed.png,Um. Did you mean a GBP? I think Tracer knows about that.
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan:=alarmed.png,Wait, Streaming-chan has a real name? And you know each other? And... <i>my,</i> you have stories.
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;2:,count-role;self&saidmarker;d.va_competition:=wink.png,We'll just have to see h-how the rest goes, don't we, Hana?
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;futaba:,marker:french=bored.png,What was that, Futaba? <i>Grossier.</i>
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;zizou&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;sola:=confident.png,You and Sola know each other, right Zizou? Do all of your friends have such cool hairstyles?
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_mariba&notsaidmarker;saki_befriend_furavity:,count-role;other&character;futaba&saidmarker;saki_befriend_mariba:=alarmed.png,F-Futaba, not like that, like... er... hi, Saki, would you want to hang out with Futaba and I after this?
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_mariba&notsaidmarker;saki_befriend_furavity:,count-role;other&character;futaba&saidmarker;saki_befriend_mariba:=alarmed.png,Futaba, that'll just wake it morse--make it worse! Like this! <i>Saki!</i> Hey! Let's hang out with Futaba after this!
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_ladity&notsaidmarker;saki_befriend_furavity:,count-role;other&character;uravity&saidmarker;saki_befriend_ladity:=wink.png,It's not like I could loan out a Miraculous, but I'm sure Saki would love to talk about what kinds of superpowers she'd like.
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_ladity&notsaidmarker;saki_befriend_furavity:,count-role;other&character;uravity&saidmarker;saki_befriend_ladity:=wink.png,<i>Everyone</i> would love to have a superpower. Saki, if you could have some kind of special ability, what would you want?
4-female_removed_accessory,priority:500,count-role;target&character;meia&stage;1:,count-role;self&saidmarker;corrins_meia_hair:=confused.png,The… Er. Boy Corrin.
4-female_removed_accessory,count-korean&role;target:=excited.png,Korean fashion is always super interesting, ~name~, but the makeup is really spectacular. Wow, I can definitely see your influences!
4-female_removed_accessory,count-korean&role;target:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;kpop:,marker:kpop=excited.png,Korean fashion is always super interesting, ~name~, but the music is my favorite part. ♪I want it real love (real love)!♪
4-female_removed_accessory,count-medic:1-3,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;4&saidmarker;dizzy:=alarmed.png,O-oh no! Shimakaze, be safe! Can one of the medics here come treat her? She doesn't seem to be having bad feelings, but... a possessed warship would be awful!
4-female_removed_accessory,count-uravity:1,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_furavity:,count-role;other&character;futaba&stage;2:=excited.png,You're gonna be in great hands with Futaba and Ochako, Saki! Think of this like a girls night out where we talk about boys, and makeup, and um. Getting naked and comfy and stuff!
4-female_removed_accessory,count-weapon:2,count-weapon:3,count-role;target&character;red&stage;3:=calm.png,What is with you and Aimee and the others and your weapons? You’re so reliant on things beyond your own wits.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:aimee=confident.png,This should be a hint to some of our other companions at the table to part with their weapons.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0=confident.png,This should be a hint to some of our other companions at the table to part with their weapons.

5-male_removing_accessory=calm.png,If that’s all you’re taking off, can you hand it to me?
5-male_removing_accessory=confused.png,That's all you're taking off? I feel really behind...
5-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,<i>Qu'est-ce que je fais?</i>
5-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,And your weapon has a name... are you sure you don't have like... a cockMiraculous or something, Jin?
5-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;0:=bored.png,E-er, unless you actually have wings? Are you some kind of...
5-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;corrin_m&stage;0:=calm.png,Hmm... how very stylish, Corrin!
5-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,N-not that I mind. But that belt seems full of cool stuff!
5-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;1:=confident.png,Oh! A sash! Very Roman of you! Are you dressed up like some kind of war god? Oh, that's a cool motif for sure!
5-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;0:=wink.png,They're not half bad, Jin, but your eyes are better without them, I think.
5-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;corrin_m&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,You're very gentle, Corrin...
5-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;0:,count-role;other&character;palutena:=confused.png,(I could learn a lot from how Palutena pushes Pit! Maybe even Cat Noir would listen...)
5-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;palutena:=wink.png,I can't tell if you're flirting with him or not, Palutena... Isn't Hades super scary, Pit?
5-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;weiss:=bored.png,Really Weiss? Beautiful skin? Can you even handle sunlight? Ugh. You are <i>frustratingly</i> hard to advocate for.
5-male_removing_accessory,count-overwatch&role;target&stage;2:=bored.png,You know Amelie Lacroix, right? The famous ballet dancer? I heard she was involved with Overwatch.
5-male_removed_accessory=bored.png,I feel like I need it to cover up, given how you seem to have extra.
5-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;2:=alarmed.png,A rooster! I forget that the word has different meanings in English! Rooster Miraculous, I mean, we already knew you have a cock--- Ahh!!
5-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;2:=alarmed.png,I mean, it's certainly something to see naked... Er...
5-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;ryuji&stage;4:=confident.png,Akuma are like... evil magic spirits that take over people and make them do cruel things.
5-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;ryuji&stage;4:=bored.png,Hmm... I think it might be Japanese, but my teacher is Chinese... I'm not really sure where the word comes from, Ryuji!
5-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;4:=wink.png,Do you use gadgets and all that? I’m really fortunate in that my yo-yo usually has just what I need in it for my Lucky Charm!
5-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;corrin_m&stage;2:=bored.png,I like that in men. Just not married ones.
5-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;2:=alarmed.png,I-I’m not staring at those big strong hands. Nope! Not me! I-I’m just studying the stitching of those villain-fighting gloves well-worn by… Um… Proficient use.
5-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,I'm glad you aren't super attached to those... It's not like it's a Miraculous or part of your costume or something... T-the glasses, not the eyeballs.
5-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;2:=excited.png,Pit, could I actually see that? I could definitely use this to design something cool! You have good fashion sense!
5-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;1:=wink.png,Well, whatever you are, you look like you're going to be fun to play with! In this game! Not- um. Hi!
5-male_removed_accessory,count-role;other&character;d.va&stage;3:=wink.png,You know, I like to incorporate my signatures into my designs, but I, um. Usually do outerwear.
5-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;corrin_m&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,You remind me... kind of about a boy I know...
5-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;palutena:=confident.png,I guess you help put the Pal in Palutena, huh, Pit?
5-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;palutena:=alarmed.png,W-wait, did you bring a firearm in here? I don't see your guns, Pit. Please tell me this isn't divine magic invisibility!
5-male_removed_accessory,count-palutena:1,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;aimee:=alarmed.png,W-wait, you snuck a gun in here? Please let's not.
5-female_removing_accessory=wink.png,I figured since you go to a school for heroes, all of us can give you some extra insight!
5-female_removing_accessory=bored.png,Would you please go a little faster?
5-female_removing_accessory=excited.png,I definitely think a frilly ~clothing~ is more your taste. You should take the one you're wearing off.
5-female_removing_accessory=confused.png,That's all you're taking off? I feel really behind...
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;1:=confident.png,<i>Ils pillent toujours le cul!</i>
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;other&character;elizabeth&stage;3:=wink.png,A lady has to have her secrets, <i>oui</i>?
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;dark_magician_girl&stage;1:=confident.png,A lucky necklace? Well, it's lucky I got to meet you today, Dark Magician Girl!
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch&stage;0:=confident.png,Agreed. Capes aren’t quite as good as a heavy cloak. But there’s something debonair about it!
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;0:=wink.png,Ah! I'm glad you picked that trick up from me.
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Ah, <i>zut</i>, the purple hair made me imagine…
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;lyn&stage;4:=excited.png,All of your things are so finely made, I could learn a lot based on your taste!
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;zizou&stage;0:=excited.png,And your hair does look pretty! It’s a very cool texture and color.
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sharla&stage;0:=bored.png,Are you... wait... no... that's not right...
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1a:=wink.png,At least that was a cool outfit. Definitely not stolen. *Cough* Pot *cough* meet *cough* kettle *cough*.
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2c:=embarrassed.png,At least you finally settled on some casualwear... Why are you transforming again?
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;2:=confident.png,At least you have two rounds of small stuff left!
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;3:=confident.png,Belts? Oh! You’re rocking the “many belts” look. Befitting of a goddess.
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;3:=wink.png,Why limit yourself to conventional aesthetics, Palutena?
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;buffy&stage;3:=bored.png,Buffy, you shouldn't so easily part with objects of fate...
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,But I don’t think they really know this much…
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;3:=confused.png,But Juleka once said there were some magic words if I ever found Chloe being too forward to Adrien…
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;3:=confused.png,But you <i>are</i> really cute.
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;cammy&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Cammy! S-shoot! Here I go--
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;0:=confident.png,Costume aside, I'm more of a fan of pink than red. A pink ladybug would look kind of weird, don't you think?
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;2:=wink.png,D.Va, could you sign my friend Nino’s album? He’s a big fan!
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;2:=wink.png,Lucio is pretty good for electronica… I’m more of a Jagged Stone girl, myself.
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;1:=confident.png,Don’t be so hard on yourself! Dealing with spirits is really challenging, and you do that really well!
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;1:=wink.png,Sometimes you lose a few hands, Sheena. Don’t worry. I’ll make sure you stay safe. From one spirit person to another.
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2b:=embarrassed.png,E-er, I'm <i>definitely</i> not into the whole maid thing, so I'm hoping whatever comes next is... A bit better.
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;1:=confused.png,Er. I can owl you chocolate-- call you Ochako, right?
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;revy&stage;0:=bored.png,Er... won't you at least part with your guns...?
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;0:=bored.png,For a love fairy you certainly seem focused on physical stuff…
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;1:=bored.png,Fortunately, um, it looks like you don't really need to rewind since it's just your sandals...
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;videl&stage;0:=confused.png,Gloves! Gloves are coming off!
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;2:=wink.png,Gracious of you to include the part actually keeping that on, Palutena.
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;2:=confident.png,Third time’s the charm, it just doesn’t seem to be a lucky one for you.
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;0:=alarmed.png,H-hey! What are you doing!? Are you copying my Miraculous?
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,What magic is this?! Did you have a Miraculous this whole time!?
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;0:=confident.png,Whoa! You're going to detransform too right--
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;0:=bored.png,Hm… Are you a swordswoman seeking redemption? Maybe you have a broken sword of some sort?
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;0:=calm.png,Hmm... Yeah, that's a good question. It's not like my costume really ever gets damaged...
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;launch&stage;1:=confused.png,Huh? What? Where'd... Is this... did I de-Akumatize Launch or something?
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;0:=wink.png,I bet we’re going to have a lot of fun tonight.
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;2:=confident.png,I don’t want another Rogercop. It looks like you’re almost pre-loaded for that kind of thing…
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;1:=confused.png,I just can't stop geeking out over you! You're an awesome fighter, you're an acclaimed interpol agent--!
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;morrigan&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,I know an Akumatized person when I see one... But I'm not sure I can see an accessory...

5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;amy_rose&stage;0:=bored.png,I suppose it could be a ring...
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;red&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,I think this is, a, um. Bad idea. My yo-yo doesn’t count!

5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;chiaki&stage;0:=confident.png,Or do you just seem a little... bored? I really hope it’s boredom rather than stress!
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1b:=confident.png,Say, Futaba, is Vriska's outfit like that Tron movie? Could you help me out with this?
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kimberly:=bored.png,Say, I have to ask, from one suit-wearing hero to another, where does your stuff <i>go</i> while you're transformed?

5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3:=calm.png,So, what'll it be <i>this</i> time, Vriska? Some sort of "goddess of <i>luck</i>" outfit?
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3:=calm.png,So, what'll it be <i>this</i> time, Vriska? Some sort of "wandering martial artist" look?
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;spooky&stage;0:=alarmed.png,Spooky? Give me the knife, please. Let’s put away our weapons.
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;2:=confident.png,That famous fashion company some girl managed to destroy?
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;dark_magician_girl&stage;0:=confident.png,That hat was so cute though! It's <i>tres</i> stylish. Where'd you get it?
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;3:=alarmed.png,That lets him give people superpowers but also brings out their worst feelings.
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;jane&stage;1:=confused.png,That seems… Very difficult, Jane.
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,That’s not nice, Hana! Everyone starts somewhere… And bad behavior will just get you banned. Or Akumatized. Let’s hope the former.
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;0:=confident.png,That’s super cool! Do you have a Miraculous or is this kind of power innate to you?
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;1:=excited.png,The collar? Hmm… I’ll admit, I was… Um. <i>Interested</i> to see more.
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyoko&stage;0:=wink.png,The gloves are especially classy touch.

5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;1:=confident.png,Wow! I bet you’ve kicked a lot of butt with those. Figurative and otherwise!
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1c:=wink.png,Though maybe you have the Lion Miraculous, given how overconfident and prideful you're acting.
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;0:=bored.png,Though um, based on your ears, you're not really from around France, are you?
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,Um. Do those bracelets really weigh 8kg each, Chun-li?
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;0:=confident.png,Those bracelets of yours have to be <i>amazing</i> for training, Chun-li!
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;red&stage;2:=wink.png,Um. Exposed. Maybe it’s time for you to put away that sword?
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;0:=confused.png,Um. I don't mean to be critical, but the belts for your belts look is a bit too recent to be vintage...
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,U-uhm. Are you sober enough to be playing, Sei? I'd hate for you to regret this.
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;april&stage;0:=excited.png,Wait, didn't you used to have magic ninja bracelets? Like a Miraculous of some sort?
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;0:=bored.png,Was the choker that valuable? Did someone important give it to you? I’m sorry Blackrose.
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nugi-chan&stage;0:=confused.png,Webmaster? Have I fought that villain before…?
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;1:=confident.png,Well, considering some of the others we’re playing with, I suppose I can trust in that.
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kimberly&stage;0:=wink.png,Well, my Miraculous has a guardian spirit. Her name is Tikki, but even if you can't see her, she's right here...
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;alpha&stage;0:=excited.png,Well, you are a really good singer... Can you play Wonderwall?
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;pearl&stage;0:=alarmed.png,Whoa! I'm the only one who's supposed to transform!
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;1:=alarmed.png,W-wait, your stockings? Annie! You’re flashing everyone! C-come on!
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,W-well, it's nice to see you like pink stuff too, Saki. B-but you're-- you're flashing us!
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;0:=alarmed.png,W-what? A-are you okay?! Someone get a fire extinguisher!
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;weiss&stage;0:=confused.png,Yes, Weiss. We know how rich you are. Your father owns a hotel and is a mayor or something, blah blah blah…
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;0:=confident.png,You are well adorned! Both in accessories and otherwise.
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;0:=wink.png,Those are really cool armbands. I’m glad my costume normally works as armor, though. That seems a lot heavier. It’s such a relief to see you lose them, though.
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;0:,marker:blake_crush=bored.png,You know Blake, there’s something about you I can’t put my finger in…
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&stage;2:=calm.png,You know, I used to read this magazine called Bleach... The models wore something fancy like that!
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Your rudders... I'm not sure if you've been Akumatized, or this is a Miraculous, or something stranger...
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Oh no, not <i>again!</i> Shimakaze, are you okay?
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;3:=alarmed.png,Y-you know, maybe this can wait until after the game. Don't you use card-like seals? You're a bit... behind right now.
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;1:=confused.png,Y-you're a princess wearing sandals? Doesn't that seem to be a bit... ?
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;0&saidmarker;fled:,count-role;other&character;aimee:=alarmed.png,Aimee, don’t shoot her!
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;jane&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;amalia&stage;4-9:=confident.png,Amalia did show us how to be clever with attire, so I shouldn’t discount anything you have hidden up your sleeve! Or… Erk, pants.
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;weiss&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;blake:=bored.png,Blake, is Weiss always this… Bourgeois?
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;0:,count-role;other&character;red:=embarrassed.png,Costume aside, I'm more of a fan of pink than red. E-er. N-not the Red here, I mean like the color! Kind of like Red's red hair!
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;0:,count-role;other&character;daria:=embarrassed.png,Godzilla? Oh, if it's a big enemy, I'd probably try to evacuate an area, then figure out what part of him was Akumatized.
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose:,count-role;other&character;elizabeth&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,Hm...You and Elizabeth seem to have a lot of sentimental value for your necklaces, Blackrose. You also must have gotten yours from someone important, huh?
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1b:,count-role;other&character;futaba:=excited.png,I mean <i>Alya</i> got Akumatized into a cyber-villain. If I could save her, beating you--er, saving you--should be easy!
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;5:,count-role;other&character;yang:=wink.png,If the two of you aren’t open about this, you really should be! It’s too cute! O-oh. Your ears are… <i>That’s</i> your secret?
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;0:,count-role;self&saidmarker;elaine_puns:=bored.png,It feels like Cat Noir is here, and not in a good way.
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;0:,count-role;other&character;rinkah:=confident.png,Oh! Rinkah and Blackrose, are you from the same place?
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;3:,count-role;other&character;sei:=excited.png,Oh! You and Sei have something in common, with all of your belts. I’m surprised, given that they don’t seem to be keeping anything loose down.
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sharla&stage;0:,count-role;other&character;shazza:=embarrassed.png,Oh! You're Shazza, right! W-wait...
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;daria:=confused.png,Oh, don't be rude, Daria! I'm sure what Ochako does on her knees is-- um... h-her business. (Just play it cool. You can act like nothing was said.)
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;0:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;elaine_puns:=bored.png,That seems a little unfair, Elaine...
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;ryuko:=wink.png,The one that Ryuko has some history with, right?
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;alpha:=embarrassed.png,Um, D.Va, if you asked nicely, I’m sure Alpha would be happy to sing what you were listening to for all of us!
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;3:,count-role;other&character;rinkah:=confused.png,Unless you’ve been Akumatized...Which I hope isn’t the case!
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&saidmarker;strategyguide:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;strategyguide0:,marker:strategyguide0=confused.png,Wait, you’re using a guide for this? It’s... really pretty simple, I thought?
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose:,count-role;other&character;zoey&stage;0-2:=confident.png,What do they say about girls who wear chokers, Zoey?
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;weiss&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;ruby:=bored.png,Yang, is Weiss always like this… Repugnant?

5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,(I really hope this place is secure from Hawkmoth… I’m worried about Uravity!)
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;revy&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,<i>Gosh</i> you have so many euphemisms for promiscuity...
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;2:=alarmed.png,A jacquin? What's that? If it's anything like a panther, I really can't say I've had good experiences...
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;2:=confident.png,A Lucky Charm, you say? I can definitely relate to that.
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;1&saidmarker;harped:=excited.png,A magic harp! <i>You</i> must have a Miraculous, right, Naryu? What's your Kwami's name?
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;dark_magician_girl&stage;1:=wink.png,And what's your name? I can't help but feel like there's something darkly magical about you...
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;2:=calm.png,Aren’t you supposed to be the smart one?
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;1:=wink.png,Awww, don't give up! You're just starting to have fun... (<i>You're one to talk, Marinette! You're only here to protect these people, remember that!</i>)
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,B-but still, we should really try to win. A lot of people look up to us.
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;red&stage;1:=alarmed.png,B-but that huge thing… Can you really carry that?
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;ann&stage;5:=alarmed.png,Because I'm sweet on you! Er. No, I mean, you're a sweetheart.
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;korra&stage;4:=confident.png,But a hero has to persevere and keep moving forward, no matter what happens.
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;zizou&stage;1:=wink.png,Do you dye it, or is it natural?
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;buffy&stage;4:=calm.png,Drive me crazy as in... upset? Because that's not happening...
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;buffy&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,Drive me crazy as in... aroused... Uhm. Well.
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;kimberly&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,E-er, sorry if that's weird! I just never feel my clothes and kind of have to trust they're just there...
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;2:=confused.png,E-er. I think that may translate more sensibly in English...
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,E-er... unless you remove your necklaces too. How'd you even get that on...?
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Er. I mean. I’m saying it from an aesthetic point of you. Point of view. Not that--Uhm. Back to the game!
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,B-but you’re definitely still a goddess and I don’t mean to imply anything too torward fowards you. Forward towards you!
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;4&notsaidmarker;dizzy:=alarmed.png,Er... <i>SHIMAKAZE, ARE YOU OKAY!? Can you hear me?</i>
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Erm. I heard that in a song.
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;revy&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,F-fine. Be that way.
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;1:=alarmed.png,Finger on! I-I would never unless you really wanted me to b-but-
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;4:=bored.png,Hmm, lots of belts, Palutena. What are you trying so hard to keep secret?
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;alpha&stage;4:=confident.png,Hmm... Okay, Alpha, can you do... Born to be Free, by X Japan?
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;1:=calm.png,Hmm... Well, it's nice to have such a powerful Oracle here with me today! Let's keep an eye out for the akuma, shall we?
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;6:=confident.png,Huh, so that’s your secret! I have a weird feeling about Cat Noir right now…
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyu:=calm.png,I get the feeling that you’re nicer than you let on, Kyu! Just a bit vulgar for my tastes. I think.
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;morrigan&stage;1:=confident.png,I guess I'll just have to wait and see!
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;2:=alarmed.png,I just wanted to let you know that it's nice to see, you know, someone who's similar to me go so far. You're a big hero to me. E-even though, you know, we're at this game.
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;2:=alarmed.png,It's-- I mean, most of the people around me in Paris. Um. Come from a different type of background. But you're a hero worldwide, so you, you know?
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;1:=calm.png,I kind of have to rely on my Miraculous for most of my powers... I'd like to think I'm pretty athletic, but you're next level!
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;1:=wink.png,I may not be the strongest woman in the world, but I'm actually a pretty good fighter, Chun-li!
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;1:=confident.png,I may be an art student, but that doesn’t mean I’m not clever, Annie! Let's see what you've got!
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;1:=excited.png,I mean, I have some friends that say I’m pretty quirky… oh! I get it. Superpowers are called Quirks where you’re from, aren’t they?
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;2:=wink.png,I much prefer ribbons to keep my hair back, but hairbands can definitely be more fashionable for long hair like yours.
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;jane&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,I was about to say...
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;daisy&stage;2:=wink.png,I’d love to try yours, but I’m a one-set kind of girl.
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;1:=excited.png,I’m glad you don’t get too caught up in your worries, Nagisa!
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,It’s just the first round, Nagisa. Don’t worry! E-er, as in  no reason to get down! Not that you’ll--Erk.
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;chiaki&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,If so, do you have any particular trophy or device you like to play games with? Just curious, in case I have to free you from Hawk Moth.
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;1:=confident.png,If you ever visit Paris, I'm sure we'd have a great time!
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,I-I have to admit, I feel really bad that you didn't choose to be here...
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;mercy&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,I-I mean they’re pretty wonderful too, just looking at you. Not you specifically, I mean generally, but you’re nice too, I’m just going to stop now.
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:=alarmed.png,I-I mean your panties looked fretty passionable to me-- O-oh erm. Pretty fashionable. A-and you were talking about your shoes. Erk. O-okay then.
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:=alarmed.png,I thought those panties looked fretty passionable though! I-I mean, um. Pretty fashionable. W-wait, you were talking about your shoes?
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;lyn&stage;5:=alarmed.png,I-I mean, your taste in fashion. Not... you know…
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,I-it was a pretty bandana, anyway...
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,You're really quite foxy, Elaine!
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;2:=excited.png,I'm just happy you're having a good time! It would be a shame if you were the one the akuma was targeting!
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;1:=wink.png,I'm kind of a dork with how into pink I actually am. I bet you'd look really good in it too! Though your tie matched your glasses and eyes in a really cool way!
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;1:=wink.png,I'm kind of interested to see what you'd look like with a nice fluffy scarf. It's doesn't match as well as your tie, but I bet it'd be really comforting.
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;sharla&stage;1:=confident.png,I'm sure I'll figure it out.
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;videl&stage;1:=wink.png,It’s good to see you have an honorable spirit about you. You’re definitely not like Chloe.
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;1&saidmarker;fled:=confident.png,Ladybug is here to keep you safe, Florina! Don’t get too worried!
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;1&saidmarker;fled:=confused.png,I… Hm… You know, I never really considered the option of running away.
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;2:=wink.png,Maybe you can show me more later! I mean, of your magic! N-not, but if you wanted to... Um!
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,Natsuki, being a woman is about being proud of who you are and the things you like. If ~player~ is the right person for you, they'll just appreciate you more! Um. The personality. Less the encroaching nudity...
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;red&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,N-no?
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,No? Hmm… Shantae, you just sound really familiar…
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;1:=excited.png,No…? Weird, I had a feeling… Let me try again…
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;spooky&stage;1:=wink.png,Of course. And you’re definitely not the cute type of ghost, Spooky. Just the scary kind.
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;spooky&stage;1:=excited.png,Of course Spooky! We all know better than to toy with spirits. Er. I at least hope we do.
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;3:=excited.png,Oh! It’s magic too? And fine gold? It’s a little gaudy, to be honest, but if it keeps people safe!
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,W-well normally I’d say it’s how you present yourself, but I think it’d be rude to say a goddess’s… Assets aren’t something heavenly!
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;amy_rose&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Oh! It's not a Miraculous. You're just like this!
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2c:=confident.png,Oh! Well. That was kind of weird, but at least you're in normal clothes now...
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;kim&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,Oh, I definitely would--Um. Is what someone who found you cute would say.
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;kim&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,Oh! Well if you’re offering--Um. I know magic, Kim! And that’s not a real place!
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;april&stage;1:=bored.png,Oh. Not anymore, huh? Well, the jumpsuit looks nice...
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;4&saidmarker;dizzy:=alarmed.png,O-oh no! Shimakaze, be safe! Do I need to call you a doctor? Or... er... a mechanic, I suppose?
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;2:=bored.png,O-oh. It was a joke. W-well, maybe that's a profession you should follow-up on, Daria?
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;mei&stage;2:=calm.png,Or maybe that was Li-Meng, the wizard? Either way, it's exciting to see you here!
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;1:=confused.png,Repairs? Ash? A-are you okay? You seem awfully resilient to harm... but... er... I'm confused now.
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;seven&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Seven… Mme. Nine? Um. My earrings are an accessory, and they’re the one thing I almost never take off. Accessories can be really important for an outfit or a person!
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,S-so, just stay confident, okay!
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;1:=confident.png,That’s the spirit, Florina! Be brave!
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;1:=wink.png,You did! Sorry you lost, but… Good job staying in the game!
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pearl&stage;1:=excited.png,This is going to be a lot more interesting than I thought! I-I mean, not you specifically Pearl b-but...
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3:=bored.png,This seems awfully familiar...
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;4:=bored.png,Um. What were those magic words…?
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;launch&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Um... I don't quite know who you are, but I think putting the gun away is a good idea.
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,U-um. You’re good at games, right, Blackrose? Let’s just keep playing, don’t get down!
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,I have to say, I don’t know what a GP is. But wherever you’re from, the style is very special!
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;1:=wink.png,Well! I’m always happy to make new friends.
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;1:=confident.png,Well! You seem like you're having fun!
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Well, I guess we don't have to worry about that tonight...
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;2:=wink.png,Well... your outfit's so cute and while you may be a little... different, I'll go with it for now!
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Um... well, let's see, I suppose.
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;arwen&stage;1:=calm.png,What brings you to a game like this, I wonder? Y-you know, from your storybook? Magic is such an interesting thing...
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;other&character;cammy&stage;3:=calm.png,Wow! She's amazing! Um. I tope hey--hope they don't keep taking off her clothes though...
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;cammy&stage;2:=confident.png,Wow! You handled yourself so well, Cammy. Guess it's a good thing I didn't need to use my yo-yo, huh?
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;alpha&stage;1:=confident.png,Wow! You're super animated too! You're awesome, Alpha!
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,W-wait a second! You aren't supposed to transform as part of a loss! O-or-- D-did I play this wrong?
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2:=alarmed.png,W-wait! Again!? Y-you have to be using an akuma! I can't transform more than once... And definitely not in such weird ways!
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2:=alarmed.png,S-shoot! You are using some kind of evil magic! A-and er. I haven't fed Tikki yet, so this might be a while before I can fix this...
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;other&character;kimberly&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,W-well, I-I can hardly blame you. To keep your hair nice. I mean. I tend to like cute, low maintainance stuff.
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4a:=alarmed.png,W-what? What is this? M-my earrings are still attached so at least...
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4a:=alarmed.png,I-I what!? H-how did you? W-what kind of akuma trickery is this!?
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4a:=confused.png,E-excuse you!? How <i>dare</i> you copy my costume, Vriska! This is <i>far</i> worse than Chloe that one time!
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;dawn&stage;2:=alarmed.png,W-wow, you’re certainly forward about enjoying this, Dawn!
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;morrigan&stage;2:=confused.png,W-w-wait!? Where'd all the bats come from!?
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;3:=confident.png,You are <i>quite</i> strange, Daria. But in a very likable way! I can see us being great friends!
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;3:,marker:coldfloor=confident.png,You did say you were worried about the floor being cold...It’s okay to be a warm person but sensitive to cold. You dress well for all environments!
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;3:=excited.png,I’m sure you have lots of other clothes, but if you wanted to go shopping after this, Nagisa, I’m sure we could find something cute!
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;alpha&stage;3:=confident.png,You know, I did do a cover... Of the artistic variety! I'm not a great singer... For Jagged Stone. Maybe I could do one for you too?
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;2:=confused.png,You sound <i>so</i> familiar! I can’t quite pin down why!
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;1:=bored.png,Your attitude is really bad. Hawk Moth will Akumatize you in no time if you keep being rude.
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,S-sorry, GoGo. I don't know why I'm being so mean... You're being more than a little rude, though...
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;1:=alarmed.png,K-kinky? J-just because I have a very form fitting costume and a-- You know what, let's not follow this line of thought.
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;1:=alarmed.png,Y-you're beautiful in your own way, Daria, y-yut boo-- but you don't resemble him!
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;videl&stage;1:=alarmed.png,Zut, don't make fun of my costume Videl!
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&stage;5:,count-role;other&character;weiss:=alarmed.png,A doll? Weiss, <i>please</i> don’t make this any weirder.
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;alice:=embarrassed.png,Alice, do you think she means pounds? She doesn’t seem to mean Euro or francs…
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;boundaries:,count-role;other&character;zoey:,marker:boundaries=wink.png,Don’t worry, Zoey, I think everyone’s being very accepting of other’s boundaries. That makes for a good game, right?
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;daria:=embarrassed.png,Er. Nothing! Uravity! Wust jut wou yer... um... j-just what you were saying! About debris. And stuff.
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3b:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=alarmed.png,G-gah! I really hope you just aren't copying people's outfits, Vriska! W-wait, a-are you going to be as lewd as Zone-tan now!?
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;weiss:=confused.png,GP? Does she mean Lien, like you have over in Vale?
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;meia:,count-role;self&saidmarker;corrin_meia_hair:=wink.png,He certainly manages to make a woman’s hairstyle work, <i>oui</i>, Meia?
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;4:,count-role;other&character;corrin_f:=confident.png,Hmm...Palutena, Corrin might use the most tactical choice, but fashion requires a certain economy. I’d be happy to help, as a hero to a goddess of heroes.
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;daria:=excited.png,I'm glad you think so, Daria! I think Uravity and Ladybug would make a great team!
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;ann:=wink.png,Is that like a panther of some sort? I bet Ann knows a thing about that.
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;4:,count-role;other&character;sei:=embarrassed.png,Just fiven that your stuff is gorn fitting, I mean form fitting! Given form fitting! Erk. Both of you… Belts, right?
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;rinkah:=embarrassed.png,N-no? Oh. I seem...You just look...I promise I didn’t mean to imply--
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;sharla&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;shazza:=bored.png,No, Shazza is the blonde Australian... Hm... I'm sorry, I keep forgetting your name.
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3a:,count-role;other&character;ruby:=embarrassed.png,This seems awfully familiar... Like something Ruby might wear... Oh no! You aren't copying people's outfits, are you!?
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;ann:=wink.png,Though I think an elegant coat or something like that would be something to see too, wouldn’t you agree Ann?
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;futaba:=wink.png,Though I think an elegant coat or something like that would be something to see too, wouldn’t you agree Futaba?
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;jane&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;moon&stage;1-10:=embarrassed.png,Though I wouldn’t expect you to mimic her for anything else, I thought maybe Moon might have a trick to pull off that zipless undressing!
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;jane&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;buffy&stage;5-10:=wink.png,Though, Buffy did already show us how to take her bra off under her clothes...
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;jane&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;twilight&stage;1-10:=embarrassed.png,Twilight has, um, however, disregarded normal social conventions. So if you wanted to, Jane, you definitely could?
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;tracer:=embarrassed.png,Um. Did you mean a GBP? I think Tracer knows about that.
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan:=alarmed.png,Wait, Streaming-chan has a real name? And you know each other? And... <i>my,</i> you have stories.
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;2:,count-role;self&saidmarker;d.va_competition:=wink.png,We'll just have to see h-how the rest goes, don't we, Hana?
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;futaba:,marker:french=bored.png,What was that, Futaba? <i>Grossier.</i>
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;zizou&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;sola:=confident.png,You and Sola know each other, right Zizou? Do all of your friends have such cool hairstyles?
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_mariba&notsaidmarker;saki_befriend_furavity:,count-role;other&character;futaba&saidmarker;saki_befriend_mariba:=alarmed.png,F-Futaba, not like that, like... er... hi, Saki, would you want to hang out with Futaba and I after this?
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_mariba&notsaidmarker;saki_befriend_furavity:,count-role;other&character;futaba&saidmarker;saki_befriend_mariba:=alarmed.png,Futaba, that'll just wake it morse--make it worse!

6-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,And your weapon has a name... are you sure you don't have like... a cockMiraculous or something, Jin?

6-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;corrin_m&stage;0:=calm.png,Hmm... how very stylish, Corrin!
6-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,N-not that I mind. But that belt seems full of cool stuff!
6-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;1:=confident.png,Oh! A sash! Very Roman of you! Are you dressed up like some kind of war god? Oh, that's a cool motif for sure!
6-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;0:=wink.png,They're not half bad, Jin, but your eyes are better without them, I think.
6-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;corrin_m&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,You're very gentle, Corrin...
6-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;0:,count-role;other&character;palutena:=confused.png,(I could learn a lot from how Palutena pushes Pit! Maybe even Cat Noir would listen...)
6-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;palutena:=wink.png,I can't tell if you're flirting with him or not, Palutena... Isn't Hades super scary, Pit?
6-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;weiss:=bored.png,Really Weiss? Beautiful skin? Can you even handle sunlight? Ugh. You are <i>frustratingly</i> hard to advocate for.
6-male_removed_accessory=confused.png,It’s miraculous that-wait, it’s not miraculous at all!
6-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;2:=alarmed.png,A rooster! I forget that the word has different meanings in English! Rooster Miraculous, I mean, we already knew you have a cock--- Ahh!!
6-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;2:=alarmed.png,I mean, it's certainly something to see naked... Er...
6-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;ryuji&stage;4:=confident.png,Akuma are like... evil magic spirits that take over people and make them do cruel things.
6-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;ryuji&stage;4:=bored.png,Hmm... I think it might be Japanese, but my teacher is Chinese... I'm not really sure where the word comes from, Ryuji!
6-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;4:=wink.png,Do you use gadgets and all that? I’m really fortunate in that my yo-yo usually has just what I need in it for my Lucky Charm!
6-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;corrin_m&stage;2:=bored.png,I like that in men. Just not married ones.
6-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;2:=alarmed.png,I-I’m not staring at those big strong hands. Nope! Not me! I-I’m just studying the stitching of those villain-fighting gloves well-worn by… Um… Proficient use.
6-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,I'm glad you aren't super attached to those... It's not like it's a Miraculous or part of your costume or something... T-the glasses, not the eyeballs.
6-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;2:=excited.png,Pit, could I actually see that? I could definitely use this to design something cool! You have good fashion sense!
6-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;1:=wink.png,Well, whatever you are, you look like you're going to be fun to play with! In this game! Not- um. Hi!
6-male_removed_accessory,count-role;other&character;d.va&stage;3:=wink.png,You know, I like to incorporate my signatures into my designs, but I, um. Usually do outerwear.
6-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;corrin_m&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,You remind me... kind of about a boy I know...

6-female_removing_accessory=bored.png,Oh, Please. That's like something Chloe would wear.
6-female_removing_accessory=wink.png,I figured since you go to a school for heroes, all of us can give you some extra insight!

6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;dark_magician_girl&stage;1:=confident.png,A lucky necklace? Well, it's lucky I got to meet you today, Dark Magician Girl!
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch&stage;0:=confident.png,Agreed. Capes aren’t quite as good as a heavy cloak. But there’s something debonair about it!
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;0:=wink.png,Ah! I'm glad you picked that trick up from me.
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Ah, <i>zut</i>, the purple hair made me imagine…
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;lyn&stage;4:=excited.png,All of your things are so finely made, I could learn a lot based on your taste!
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;zizou&stage;0:=excited.png,And your hair does look pretty! It’s a very cool texture and color.
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;0:=confused.png,Are you really a pink-haired woman with butterfly wings?
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sharla&stage;0:=bored.png,Are you... wait... no... that's not right...
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1a:=wink.png,At least that was a cool outfit. Definitely not stolen. *Cough* Pot *cough* meet *cough* kettle *cough*.
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2c:=embarrassed.png,At least you finally settled on some casualwear... Why are you transforming again?
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;2:=confident.png,At least you have two rounds of small stuff left!
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;3:=confident.png,Belts? Oh! You’re rocking the “many belts” look. Befitting of a goddess.
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;3:=wink.png,Why limit yourself to conventional aesthetics, Palutena?
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;buffy&stage;3:=bored.png,Buffy, you shouldn't so easily part with objects of fate...
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,But I don’t think they really know this much…
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;3:=confused.png,But Juleka once said there were some magic words if I ever found Chloe being too forward to Adrien…
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;3:=confused.png,But you <i>are</i> really cute.
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;cammy&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Cammy! S-shoot! Here I go--
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;0:=confident.png,Costume aside, I'm more of a fan of pink than red. A pink ladybug would look kind of weird, don't you think?
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;2:=wink.png,D.Va, could you sign my friend Nino’s album? He’s a big fan!
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;2:=wink.png,Lucio is pretty good for electronica… I’m more of a Jagged Stone girl, myself.
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;1:=confident.png,Don’t be so hard on yourself! Dealing with spirits is really challenging, and you do that really well!
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;1:=wink.png,Sometimes you lose a few hands, Sheena. Don’t worry. I’ll make sure you stay safe. From one spirit person to another.
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2b:=embarrassed.png,E-er, I'm <i>definitely</i> not into the whole maid thing, so I'm hoping whatever comes next is... A bit better.
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;1:=confused.png,Er. I can owl you chocolate-- call you Ochako, right?
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;revy&stage;0:=bored.png,Er... won't you at least part with your guns...?
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;1:=bored.png,Fortunately, um, it looks like you don't really need to rewind since it's just your sandals...
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;videl&stage;0:=confused.png,Gloves! Gloves are coming off!
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;2:=wink.png,Gracious of you to include the part actually keeping that on, Palutena.
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;2:=confident.png,Third time’s the charm, it just doesn’t seem to be a lucky one for you.
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;0:=alarmed.png,H-hey! What are you doing!? Are you copying my Miraculous?
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,What magic is this?! Did you have a Miraculous this whole time!?
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;0:=confident.png,Whoa! You're going to detransform too right--
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;0:=bored.png,Hm… Are you a swordswoman seeking redemption? Maybe you have a broken sword of some sort?
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;0:=calm.png,Hmm... Yeah, that's a good question. It's not like my costume really ever gets damaged...
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;launch&stage;1:=confused.png,Huh? What? Where'd... Is this... did I de-Akumatize Launch or something?
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;0:=wink.png,I bet we’re going to have a lot of fun tonight.
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;2:=confident.png,I don’t want another Rogercop. It looks like you’re almost pre-loaded for that kind of thing…
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;1:=confused.png,I just can't stop geeking out over you! You're an awesome fighter, you're an acclaimed interpol agent--!
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;morrigan&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,I know an Akumatized person when I see one... But I'm not sure I can see an accessory...
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;arwen&stage;0:=confident.png,I never thought I'd actually meet you, but you did so much during the War of the Ring!
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;amy_rose&stage;0:=bored.png,I suppose it could be a ring...
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;red&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,I think this is, a, um. Bad idea. My yo-yo doesn’t count!
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;dawn&stage;1:=wink.png,I’m a bit behind, but I could definitely appreciate that fluffy scarf, Dawn. I’m chilly right now.
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;videl&stage;0:=confident.png,I’m glad to see the senzu bean grows far from the vine, Videl!
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;1:=alarmed.png,I’m guessing it is. I don’t really think I’d be into <i>that</i> kind of thing.
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;2:=confident.png,I’ve never seen a bunny miraculous, and it would explain your awesome reflexes! Just not at cards.
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;2:=confused.png,If your angst didn’t turn you into a villain, that is.
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,W-wait, are there people that are into <i>feet</i>!?
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;ann&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,I-I mean, they have a bakery and I think you'd like something sweet.
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;0:=confused.png,I'm... not sure what a waifu is. Like a crush? Oh! Like a crush. No he's-- er...
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;0:=excited.png,In Japan, you have multiple pairs of shoes for school, for your house, and outside, right? That must be nice to have so many opportunities to express yourself!
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;0:=confident.png,They’re nice shoes, Nagisa! The style seems maybe a year or two out of date, though.
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;jane&stage;0:=calm.png,It’s definitely well loved and tailored. I can tell you care a lot about it.
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;mei&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,I've actually heard a lot about you! How you got lost in a Blizzard once...
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;korra&stage;3:=calm.png,Korra, I can understand being insecure…
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;0:=wink.png,Like what? Being sassy and obnoxious?
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;0:=wink.png,Such as what? A weak sense of style and a weaker sense of honor?
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2a:=wink.png,Looks like you've been plundered, Vriska.
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;mercy&stage;1:=calm.png,Mercy, Switzerland has lots of things I find super interesting. The fashion, the languages, and the baking are all wonderful! And the people...
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;revy&stage;1:=confused.png,N-no...? Er... I've yet to solve a problem that needed a gun...
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;weiss&stage;1:=wink.png,Not all wealth is material, Weiss.
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;other&character;cammy&stage;2:=confused.png,Oh no! She's getting attacked again! Here, let me help--
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;daisy&stage;1:=excited.png,Oh! Those are cute earrings, Daisy! They match your outfit just like mine!
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;0:=wink.png,Oh! Your French is coming along well, Elizabeth. You have a wonderful accent!
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;0:=confident.png,Oh! Your shoes and socks at the same time! I was worried over nothing. You're pretty brave, aren't you?
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,O-oh, sorry. I can look away if you’d like?
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;2:=alarmed.png,Oh! I’m sorry, Nagisa. It’s just a very cool jacket!
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,O-oh. Daria <i>c'est une dominatrice.</i> That makes sense.
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;chiaki&stage;0:=confident.png,Or do you just seem a little... bored? I really hope it’s boredom rather than stress!
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1b:=confident.png,Say, Futaba, is Vriska's outfit like that Tron movie? Could you help me out with this?
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kimberly:=bored.png,Say, I have to ask, from one suit-wearing hero to another, where does your stuff <i>go</i> while you're transformed?
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;neo&stage;1:=excited.png,So Neopolitan like the ice cream... and you’re short. Oh you’re pint-sized! I get it!
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3:=calm.png,So, what'll it be <i>this</i> time, Vriska? Some sort of "goddess of <i>luck</i>" outfit?
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3:=calm.png,So, what'll it be <i>this</i> time, Vriska? Some sort of "wandering martial artist" look?
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;spooky&stage;0:=alarmed.png,Spooky? Give me the knife, please. Let’s put away our weapons.
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;2:=confident.png,That famous fashion company some girl managed to destroy?
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;dark_magician_girl&stage;0:=confident.png,That hat was so cute though! It's <i>tres</i> stylish. Where'd you get it?
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;3:=alarmed.png,That lets him give people superpowers but also brings out their worst feelings.
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;jane&stage;1:=confused.png,That seems… Very difficult, Jane.
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,That’s not nice, Hana! Everyone starts somewhere… And bad behavior will just get you banned. Or Akumatized. Let’s hope the former.
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;0:=confident.png,That’s super cool! Do you have a Miraculous or is this kind of power innate to you?
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyoko&stage;0:=wink.png,The gloves are especially classy touch.
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;0:=excited.png,They say you can stand up to any challenge, no matter however demanding, and that your courage is amazing and…
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;1:=confident.png,Those boots look really well worn, Blackrose! Were they expensive? They seem well-loved!
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;1:=confident.png,Wow! I bet you’ve kicked a lot of butt with those. Figurative and otherwise!
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1c:=wink.png,Though maybe you have the Lion Miraculous, given how overconfident and prideful you're acting.
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;0:=bored.png,Though um, based on your ears, you're not really from around France, are you?
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,Um. Do those bracelets really weigh 8kg each, Chun-li?
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;0:=confident.png,Those bracelets of yours have to be <i>amazing</i> for training, Chun-li!
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;red&stage;2:=wink.png,Um. Exposed. Maybe it’s time for you to put away that sword?
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;0:=confused.png,Um. I don't mean to be critical, but the belts for your belts look is a bit too recent to be vintage...
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,U-uhm. Are you sober enough to be playing, Sei? I'd hate for you to regret this.
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;april&stage;0:=excited.png,Wait, didn't you used to have magic ninja bracelets? Like a Miraculous of some sort?
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;0:=bored.png,Was the choker that valuable? Did someone important give it to you? I’m sorry Blackrose.
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nugi-chan&stage;0:=confused.png,Webmaster? Have I fought that villain before…?
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;1:=confident.png,Well, considering some of the others we’re playing with, I suppose I can trust in that.
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kimberly&stage;0:=wink.png,Well, my Miraculous has a guardian spirit. Her name is Tikki, but even if you can't see her, she's right here...
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;alpha&stage;0:=excited.png,Well, you are a really good singer... Can you play Wonderwall?
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;pearl&stage;0:=alarmed.png,Whoa! I'm the only one who's supposed to transform!
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;1:=alarmed.png,W-wait, your stockings? Annie! You’re flashing everyone! C-come on!
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,W-well, it's nice to see you like pink stuff too, Saki. B-but you're-- you're flashing us!
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;0:=alarmed.png,W-what? A-are you okay?! Someone get a fire extinguisher!
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;weiss&stage;0:=confused.png,Yes, Weiss. We know how rich you are. Your father owns a hotel and is a mayor or something, blah blah blah…
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;0:=confident.png,You are well adorned! Both in accessories and otherwise.
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;0:=wink.png,Those are really cool armbands. I’m glad my costume normally works as armor, though. That seems a lot heavier. It’s such a relief to see you lose them, though.
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;0:,marker:blake_crush=bored.png,You know Blake, there’s something about you I can’t put my finger in…
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Your rudders... I'm not sure if you've been Akumatized, or this is a Miraculous, or something stranger...
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Oh no, not <i>again!</i> Shimakaze, are you okay?
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;3:=alarmed.png,Y-you know, maybe this can wait until after the game. Don't you use card-like seals? You're a bit... behind right now.
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;1:=confused.png,Y-you're a princess wearing sandals? Doesn't that seem to be a bit... ?
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;0&saidmarker;fled:,count-role;other&character;aimee:=alarmed.png,Aimee, don’t shoot her!
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;jane&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;amalia&stage;4-9:=confident.png,Amalia did show us how to be clever with attire, so I shouldn’t discount anything you have hidden up your sleeve! Or… Erk, pants.
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;weiss&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;blake:=bored.png,Blake, is Weiss always this… Bourgeois?
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;0:,count-role;other&character;red:=embarrassed.png,Costume aside, I'm more of a fan of pink than red. E-er. N-not the Red here, I mean like the color! Kind of like Red's red hair!
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;0:,count-role;other&character;daria:=embarrassed.png,Godzilla? Oh, if it's a big enemy, I'd probably try to evacuate an area, then figure out what part of him was Akumatized.
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose:,count-role;other&character;elizabeth&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,Hm...You and Elizabeth seem to have a lot of sentimental value for your necklaces, Blackrose. You also must have gotten yours from someone important, huh?
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1b:,count-role;other&character;futaba:=excited.png,I mean <i>Alya</i> got Akumatized into a cyber-villain. If I could save her, beating you--er, saving you--should be easy!
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;5:,count-role;other&character;yang:=wink.png,If the two of you aren’t open about this, you really should be! It’s too cute! O-oh. Your ears are… <i>That’s</i> your secret?
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;0:,count-role;self&saidmarker;elaine_puns:=bored.png,It feels like Cat Noir is here, and not in a good way.
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;0:,count-role;other&character;rinkah:=confident.png,Oh! Rinkah and Blackrose, are you from the same place?
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;3:,count-role;other&character;sei:=excited.png,Oh! You and Sei have something in common, with all of your belts. I’m surprised, given that they don’t seem to be keeping anything loose down.
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sharla&stage;0:,count-role;other&character;shazza:=embarrassed.png,Oh! You're Shazza, right! W-wait...
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;daria:=confused.png,Oh, don't be rude, Daria! I'm sure what Ochako does on her knees is-- um... h-her business. (Just play it cool. You can act like nothing was said.)
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;0:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;elaine_puns:=bored.png,That seems a little unfair, Elaine...
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;ryuko:=wink.png,The one that Ryuko has some history with, right?
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;alpha:=embarrassed.png,Um, D.Va, if you asked nicely, I’m sure Alpha would be happy to sing what you were listening to for all of us!
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;3:,count-role;other&character;rinkah:=confused.png,Unless you’ve been Akumatized...Which I hope isn’t the case!

6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose:,count-role;other&character;zoey&stage;0-2:=confident.png,What do they say about girls who wear chokers, Zoey?
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;weiss&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;ruby:=bored.png,Yang, is Weiss always like this… Repugnant?
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;weiss&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;yang:=bored.png,Yang, is Weiss always this… Yawn-inducing?

6-female_removed_accessory=confused.png,It’s miraculous that-wait, it’s not miraculous at all!
6-female_removed_accessory=confident.png,This should be a hint to some of our other companions at the table to part with their weapons.

6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;kimberly&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,E-er, sorry if that's weird! I just never feel my clothes and kind of have to trust they're just there...
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;2:=confused.png,E-er. I think that may translate more sensibly in English...
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,E-er... unless you remove your necklaces too. How'd you even get that on...?
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Er. I mean. I’m saying it from an aesthetic point of you. Point of view. Not that--Uhm. Back to the game!
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,B-but you’re definitely still a goddess and I don’t mean to imply anything too torward fowards you. Forward towards you!

6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;1:=calm.png,Hmm... Well, it's nice to have such a powerful Oracle here with me today! Let's keep an eye out for the akuma, shall we?
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;6:=confident.png,Huh, so that’s your secret! I have a weird feeling about Cat Noir right now…

6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;morrigan&stage;1:=confident.png,I guess I'll just have to wait and see!

6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;2:=alarmed.png,It's-- I mean, most of the people around me in Paris. Um. Come from a different type of background. But you're a hero worldwide, so you, you know?
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;1:=calm.png,I kind of have to rely on my Miraculous for most of my powers... I'd like to think I'm pretty athletic, but you're next level!

6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;1:=confident.png,I may be an art student, but that doesn’t mean I’m not clever, Annie! Let's see what you've got!
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;1:=excited.png,I mean, I have some friends that say I’m pretty quirky… oh! I get it. Superpowers are called Quirks where you’re from, aren’t they?
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;2:=wink.png,I much prefer ribbons to keep my hair back, but hairbands can definitely be more fashionable for long hair like yours.
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;jane&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,I was about to say...
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;daisy&stage;2:=wink.png,I’d love to try yours, but I’m a one-set kind of girl.
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;1:=excited.png,I’m glad you don’t get too caught up in your worries, Nagisa!
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,It’s just the first round, Nagisa. Don’t worry! E-er, as in  no reason to get down! Not that you’ll--Erk.
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;chiaki&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,If so, do you have any particular trophy or device you like to play games with? Just curious, in case I have to free you from Hawk Moth.
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;1:=confident.png,If you ever visit Paris, I'm sure we'd have a great time!
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,I-I have to admit, I feel really bad that you didn't choose to be here...
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;mercy&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,I-I mean they’re pretty wonderful too, just looking at you. Not you specifically, I mean generally, but you’re nice too, I’m just going to stop now.
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:=alarmed.png,I-I mean your panties looked fretty passionable to me-- O-oh erm. Pretty fashionable. A-and you were talking about your shoes. Erk. O-okay then.
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:=alarmed.png,I thought those panties looked fretty passionable though! I-I mean, um. Pretty fashionable. W-wait, you were talking about your shoes?
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;lyn&stage;5:=alarmed.png,I-I mean, your taste in fashion. Not... you know…
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,I-it was a pretty bandana, anyway...
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,You're really quite foxy, Elaine!
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;dawn&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,I-It’s either already steamy or already chilly, Dawn. I’m not sure which.
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;2:=excited.png,I'm just happy you're having a good time! It would be a shame if you were the one the akuma was targeting!
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;1:=wink.png,I'm kind of a dork with how into pink I actually am. I bet you'd look really good in it too! Though your tie matched your glasses and eyes in a really cool way!
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;1:=wink.png,I'm kind of interested to see what you'd look like with a nice fluffy scarf. It's doesn't match as well as your tie, but I bet it'd be really comforting.
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;sharla&stage;1:=confident.png,I'm sure I'll figure it out.
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;videl&stage;1:=wink.png,It’s good to see you have an honorable spirit about you. You’re definitely not like Chloe.
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;1&saidmarker;fled:=confident.png,Ladybug is here to keep you safe, Florina! Don’t get too worried!
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;1&saidmarker;fled:=confused.png,I… Hm… You know, I never really considered the option of running away.
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;2:=wink.png,Maybe you can show me more later! I mean, of your magic! N-not, but if you wanted to... Um!
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,Natsuki, being a woman is about being proud of who you are and the things you like. If ~player~ is the right person for you, they'll just appreciate you more! Um. The personality. Less the encroaching nudity...
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;red&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,N-no?
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,No? Hmm… Shantae, you just sound really familiar…
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;1:=excited.png,No…? Weird, I had a feeling… Let me try again…
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;spooky&stage;1:=wink.png,Of course. And you’re definitely not the cute type of ghost, Spooky. Just the scary kind.
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;spooky&stage;1:=excited.png,Of course Spooky! We all know better than to toy with spirits. Er. I at least hope we do.
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;3:=excited.png,Oh! It’s magic too? And fine gold? It’s a little gaudy, to be honest, but if it keeps people safe!
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,W-well normally I’d say it’s how you present yourself, but I think it’d be rude to say a goddess’s… Assets aren’t something heavenly!
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;amy_rose&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Oh! It's not a Miraculous. You're just like this!
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2c:=confident.png,Oh! Well. That was kind of weird, but at least you're in normal clothes now...
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;kim&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,Oh, I definitely would--Um. Is what someone who found you cute would say.
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;kim&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,Oh! Well if you’re offering--Um. I know magic, Kim! And that’s not a real place!
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;april&stage;1:=bored.png,Oh. Not anymore, huh? Well, the jumpsuit looks nice...
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;4&saidmarker;dizzy:=alarmed.png,O-oh no! Shimakaze, be safe! Do I need to call you a doctor? Or... er... a mechanic, I suppose?
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;2:=bored.png,O-oh. It was a joke. W-well, maybe that's a profession you should follow-up on, Daria?
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;mei&stage;2:=calm.png,Or maybe that was Li-Meng, the wizard? Either way, it's exciting to see you here!
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;1:=confused.png,Repairs? Ash? A-are you okay? You seem awfully resilient to harm... but... er... I'm confused now.
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;seven&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Seven… Mme. Nine? Um. My earrings are an accessory, and they’re the one thing I almost never take off. Accessories can be really important for an outfit or a person!
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,S-so, just stay confident, okay!
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;1:=confident.png,That’s the spirit, Florina! Be brave!
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;1:=wink.png,You did! Sorry you lost, but… Good job staying in the game!
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pearl&stage;1:=excited.png,This is going to be a lot more interesting than I thought! I-I mean, not you specifically Pearl b-but...
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3:=bored.png,This seems awfully familiar...
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;4:=bored.png,Um. What were those magic words…?
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;launch&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Um... I don't quite know who you are, but I think putting the gun away is a good idea.
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,U-um. You’re good at games, right, Blackrose? Let’s just keep playing, don’t get down!
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,I have to say, I don’t know what a GP is. But wherever you’re from, the style is very special!
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;1:=confident.png,Well! You seem like you're having fun!
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Well, I guess we don't have to worry about that tonight...
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;2:=wink.png,Well... your outfit's so cute and while you may be a little... different, I'll go with it for now!
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Um... well, let's see, I suppose.
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;arwen&stage;1:=calm.png,What brings you to a game like this, I wonder? Y-you know, from your storybook? Magic is such an interesting thing...
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;other&character;cammy&stage;3:=calm.png,Wow! She's amazing! Um. I tope hey--hope they don't keep taking off her clothes though...
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;cammy&stage;2:=confident.png,Wow! You handled yourself so well, Cammy. Guess it's a good thing I didn't need to use my yo-yo, huh?
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;alpha&stage;1:=confident.png,Wow! You're super animated too! You're awesome, Alpha!
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,W-wait a second! You aren't supposed to transform as part of a loss! O-or-- D-did I play this wrong?
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2:=alarmed.png,W-wait! Again!? Y-you have to be using an akuma! I can't transform more than once... And definitely not in such weird ways!
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2:=alarmed.png,S-shoot! You are using some kind of evil magic! A-and er. I haven't fed Tikki yet, so this might be a while before I can fix this...
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;other&character;kimberly&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,W-well, I-I can hardly blame you. To keep your hair nice. I mean. I tend to like cute, low maintainance stuff.
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4a:=alarmed.png,W-what? What is this? M-my earrings are still attached so at least...
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4a:=alarmed.png,I-I what!? H-how did you? W-what kind of akuma trickery is this!?
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4a:=confused.png,E-excuse you!? How <i>dare</i> you copy my costume, Vriska! This is <i>far</i> worse than Chloe that one time!
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;morrigan&stage;2:=confused.png,W-w-wait!? Where'd all the bats come from!?
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;3:=confident.png,You are <i>quite</i> strange, Daria. But in a very likable way! I can see us being great friends!
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;3:,marker:coldfloor=confident.png,You did say you were worried about the floor being cold...It’s okay to be a warm person but sensitive to cold. You dress well for all environments!
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;3:=excited.png,I’m sure you have lots of other clothes, but if you wanted to go shopping after this, Nagisa, I’m sure we could find something cute!
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;alpha&stage;3:=confident.png,You know, I did do a cover... Of the artistic variety! I'm not a great singer... For Jagged Stone. Maybe I could do one for you too?
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;2:=confused.png,You sound <i>so</i> familiar! I can’t quite pin down why!
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;1:=bored.png,Your attitude is really bad. Hawk Moth will Akumatize you in no time if you keep being rude.
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,S-sorry, GoGo. I don't know why I'm being so mean... You're being more than a little rude, though...
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;1:=alarmed.png,K-kinky? J-just because I have a very form fitting costume and a-- You know what, let's not follow this line of thought.
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;1:=alarmed.png,Y-you're beautiful in your own way, Daria, y-yut boo-- but you don't resemble him!
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;videl&stage;1:=alarmed.png,Zut, don't make fun of my costume Videl!
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&stage;5:,count-role;other&character;weiss:=alarmed.png,A doll? Weiss, <i>please</i> don’t make this any weirder.
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;alice:=embarrassed.png,Alice, do you think she means pounds? She doesn’t seem to mean Euro or francs…
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;boundaries:,count-role;other&character;zoey:,marker:boundaries=wink.png,Don’t worry, Zoey, I think everyone’s being very accepting of other’s boundaries. That makes for a good game, right?
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;daria:=embarrassed.png,Er. Nothing! Uravity! Wust jut wou yer... um... j-just what you were saying! About debris. And stuff.
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3b:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=alarmed.png,G-gah! I really hope you just aren't copying people's outfits, Vriska! W-wait, a-are you going to be as lewd as Zone-tan now!?
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;weiss:=confused.png,GP? Does she mean Lien, like you have over in Vale?
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;meia:,count-role;self&saidmarker;corrin_meia_hair:=wink.png,He certainly manages to make a woman’s hairstyle work, <i>oui</i>, Meia?
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;4:,count-role;other&character;corrin_f:=confident.png,Hmm...Palutena, Corrin might use the most tactical choice, but fashion requires a certain economy. I’d be happy to help, as a hero to a goddess of heroes.
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;daria:=excited.png,I'm glad you think so, Daria! I think Uravity and Ladybug would make a great team!
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;ann:=wink.png,Is that like a panther of some sort? I bet Ann knows a thing about that.
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;4:,count-role;other&character;sei:=embarrassed.png,Just fiven that your stuff is gorn fitting, I mean form fitting! Given form fitting! Erk. Both of you… Belts, right?
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;rinkah:=embarrassed.png,N-no? Oh. I seem...You just look...I promise I didn’t mean to imply--
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;sharla&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;shazza:=bored.png,No, Shazza is the blonde Australian... Hm... I'm sorry, I keep forgetting your name.
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3a:,count-role;other&character;ruby:=embarrassed.png,This seems awfully familiar... Like something Ruby might wear... Oh no! You aren't copying people's outfits, are you!?
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;ann:=wink.png,Though I think an elegant coat or something like that would be something to see too, wouldn’t you agree Ann?
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;futaba:=wink.png,Though I think an elegant coat or something like that would be something to see too, wouldn’t you agree Futaba?
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;jane&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;moon&stage;1-10:=embarrassed.png,Though I wouldn’t expect you to mimic her for anything else, I thought maybe Moon might have a trick to pull off that zipless undressing!
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;jane&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;buffy&stage;5-10:=wink.png,Though, Buffy did already show us how to take her bra off under her clothes...
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;jane&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;twilight&stage;1-10:=embarrassed.png,Twilight has, um, however, disregarded normal social conventions. So if you wanted to, Jane, you definitely could?
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;tracer:=embarrassed.png,Um. Did you mean a GBP? I think Tracer knows about that.
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan:=alarmed.png,Wait, Streaming-chan has a real name? And you know each other? And... <i>my,</i> you have stories.
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;2:,count-role;self&saidmarker;d.va_competition:=wink.png,We'll just have to see h-how the rest goes, don't we, Hana?
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;futaba:,marker:french=bored.png,What was that, Futaba? <i>Grossier.</i>
6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;zizou&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;sola:=confident.png,You and Sola know each other, right Zizou? Do all of your friends have such cool hairstyles?

6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_mariba&notsaidmarker;saki_befriend_furavity:,count-role;other&character;futaba&saidmarker;saki_befriend_mariba:=alarmed.png,Futaba, that'll just wake it morse--make it worse!

6-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_ladity&notsaidmarker;saki_befriend_furavity:,count-role;other&character;uravity&saidmarker;saki_befriend_ladity:=wink.png,<i>Everyone</i> would love to have a superpower. Saki, if you could have some kind of special ability, what would you want?
6-female_removed_accessory,priority:500,count-role;target&character;meia&stage;1:,count-role;self&saidmarker;corrins_meia_hair:=confused.png,The… Er. Boy Corrin.
6-female_removed_accessory,count-medic:1-3,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;4&saidmarker;dizzy:=alarmed.png,O-oh no! Shimakaze, be safe! Can one of the medics here come treat her? She doesn't seem to be having bad feelings, but... a possessed warship would be awful!
6-female_removed_accessory,count-uravity:1,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_furavity:,count-role;other&character;futaba&stage;2:=excited.png,You're gonna be in great hands with Futaba and Ochako, Saki! Think of this like a girls night out where we talk about boys, and makeup, and um. Getting naked and comfy and stuff!
6-female_removed_accessory,count-weapon:2,count-weapon:3,count-role;target&character;red&stage;3:=calm.png,What is with you and Aimee and the others and your weapons? You’re so reliant on things beyond your own wits.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:aimee=confident.png,This should be a hint to some of our other companions at the table to part with their weapons.

7-male_removing_accessory=confident.png,T-there’s nothing wrong with being in the nude.
7-male_removing_accessory,marker:statue=wink.png,Paris has lots of nice masonry and statues...
7-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,But why would it be black? Your skin's so pale-- <i>Oh. The weapon.</i>
7-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;3:=wink.png,E-er, I misspoke, I really <i>did</i> mean your… Um… Gear…
7-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;0:=bored.png,E-er, unless you actually have wings? Are you some kind of...
7-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;corrin_m&stage;0:=calm.png,Hmm... how very stylish, Corrin!
7-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,I mean, you can kinda see me right here, right?
7-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;1:=confident.png,I-It might be a bit bold of me, but…
7-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;1:=confident.png,Oh! A sash! Very Roman of you! Are you dressed up like some kind of war god? Oh, that's a cool motif for sure!
7-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;corrin_m&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,You're very gentle, Corrin...
7-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;0:,count-role;other&character;palutena:=confused.png,(I could learn a lot from how Palutena pushes Pit! Maybe even Cat Noir would listen...)
7-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;palutena:=wink.png,I can't tell if you're flirting with him or not, Palutena... Isn't Hades super scary, Pit?
7-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;weiss:=bored.png,Really Weiss? Beautiful skin? Can you even handle sunlight? Ugh. You are <i>frustratingly</i> hard to advocate for.
7-male_removed_accessory=wink.png,You know, ~name~, I was expecting more…
7-male_removed_accessory=bored.png,Really? That’s the best you can do? When I’m...
7-male_removed_accessory=confused.png,I guess seeing isn’t believing, ~name~.
7-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;1:=alarmed.png,A-and it's not like you'd... um... need protection with me-- <i>from</i> me! O-oh god...
7-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;2:=alarmed.png,E-er, forget that. Or don't. Um. I'm n-not... Erk...! (Shut <i>up</i> Marinette! Come on!)
7-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;corrin_m&stage;2:=bored.png,I like that in men. Just not married ones.
7-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;2:=alarmed.png,I-I’ll admit that I wouldn’t mind feeling those big strong hands on… Well… Um. Y-you know, this was a bad idea, <i>e-excusez moi.</i>
7-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;4:=alarmed.png,It’s like my whole body is blushing and I’m going to go die of embarrassment now.
7-male_removed_accessory,count-role;self&saidmarker;statue:=embarrassed.png,J-just in case you felt the need to take more off. To match. Not unlike a statue…
7-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;2:=excited.png,Pit, could I actually see that? I could definitely use this to design something cool! You have good fashion sense!
7-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;1:=wink.png,Well, whatever you are, you look like you're going to be fun to play with! In this game! Not- um. Hi!
7-male_removed_accessory,count-role;other&character;d.va&stage;3:=wink.png,You know, I like to incorporate my signatures into my designs, but I, um. Usually do outerwear.
7-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;corrin_m&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,You remind me... kind of about a boy I know...
7-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;palutena:=confident.png,I guess you help put the Pal in Palutena, huh, Pit?
7-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;palutena:=alarmed.png,W-wait, did you bring a firearm in here? I don't see your guns, Pit. Please tell me this isn't divine magic invisibility!
7-male_removed_accessory,count-palutena:1,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;aimee:=alarmed.png,W-wait, you snuck a gun in here? Please let's not.
7-female_removing_accessory=confident.png,Hey, ~name~, I’ll make you a new ~clothing~, with my own designs on it.
7-female_removing_accessory=excited.png,I'm almost naked, could you do me a favor?
7-female_removing_accessory=wink.png,I figured since you go to a school for heroes, all of us can give you some extra insight!
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;1:=confident.png,<i>Ils pillent toujours le cul!</i>
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;other&character;elizabeth&stage;3:=wink.png,A lady has to have her secrets, <i>oui</i>?
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;dark_magician_girl&stage;1:=confident.png,A lucky necklace? Well, it's lucky I got to meet you today, Dark Magician Girl!
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch&stage;0:=confident.png,Agreed. Capes aren’t quite as good as a heavy cloak. But there’s something debonair about it!
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;0:=wink.png,Ah! I'm glad you picked that trick up from me.
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Ah, <i>zut</i>, the purple hair made me imagine…
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;lyn&stage;4:=excited.png,All of your things are so finely made, I could learn a lot based on your taste!
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;zizou&stage;0:=excited.png,And your hair does look pretty! It’s a very cool texture and color.
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;0:=confused.png,Are you really a pink-haired woman with butterfly wings?
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sharla&stage;0:=bored.png,Are you... wait... no... that's not right...
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1a:=wink.png,At least that was a cool outfit. Definitely not stolen. *Cough* Pot *cough* meet *cough* kettle *cough*.
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2c:=embarrassed.png,At least you finally settled on some casualwear... Why are you transforming again?
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;2:=confident.png,At least you have two rounds of small stuff left!
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;3:=confident.png,Belts? Oh! You’re rocking the “many belts” look. Befitting of a goddess.
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;3:=wink.png,Why limit yourself to conventional aesthetics, Palutena?
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;buffy&stage;3:=bored.png,Buffy, you shouldn't so easily part with objects of fate...
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,But I don’t think they really know this much…
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;3:=confused.png,But Juleka once said there were some magic words if I ever found Chloe being too forward to Adrien…
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;3:=confused.png,But you <i>are</i> really cute.
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;cammy&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Cammy! S-shoot! Here I go--
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;0:=confident.png,Costume aside, I'm more of a fan of pink than red. A pink ladybug would look kind of weird, don't you think?
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;2:=wink.png,D.Va, could you sign my friend Nino’s album? He’s a big fan!
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;2:=wink.png,Lucio is pretty good for electronica… I’m more of a Jagged Stone girl, myself.
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;1:=confident.png,Don’t be so hard on yourself! Dealing with spirits is really challenging, and you do that really well!
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;1:=wink.png,Sometimes you lose a few hands, Sheena. Don’t worry. I’ll make sure you stay safe. From one spirit person to another.
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2b:=embarrassed.png,E-er, I'm <i>definitely</i> not into the whole maid thing, so I'm hoping whatever comes next is... A bit better.
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;1:=confused.png,Er. I can owl you chocolate-- call you Ochako, right?
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;revy&stage;0:=bored.png,Er... won't you at least part with your guns...?

7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;morrigan&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,I know an Akumatized person when I see one... But I'm not sure I can see an accessory...

7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;amy_rose&stage;0:=bored.png,I suppose it could be a ring...
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;red&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,I think this is, a, um. Bad idea. My yo-yo doesn’t count!

7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;0:=wink.png,Such as what? A weak sense of style and a weaker sense of honor?
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2a:=wink.png,Looks like you've been plundered, Vriska.
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;mercy&stage;1:=calm.png,Mercy, Switzerland has lots of things I find super interesting. The fashion, the languages, and the baking are all wonderful! And the people...

7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,O-oh. Daria <i>c'est une dominatrice.</i> That makes sense.
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;chiaki&stage;0:=confident.png,Or do you just seem a little... bored? I really hope it’s boredom rather than stress!
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1b:=confident.png,Say, Futaba, is Vriska's outfit like that Tron movie? Could you help me out with this?
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kimberly:=bored.png,Say, I have to ask, from one suit-wearing hero to another, where does your stuff <i>go</i> while you're transformed?
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;neo&stage;1:=excited.png,So Neopolitan like the ice cream... and you’re short. Oh you’re pint-sized! I get it!
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3:=calm.png,So, what'll it be <i>this</i> time, Vriska? Some sort of "goddess of <i>luck</i>" outfit?
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3:=calm.png,So, what'll it be <i>this</i> time, Vriska? Some sort of "wandering martial artist" look?
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;spooky&stage;0:=alarmed.png,Spooky? Give me the knife, please. Let’s put away our weapons.
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;2:=confident.png,That famous fashion company some girl managed to destroy?
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;dark_magician_girl&stage;0:=confident.png,That hat was so cute though! It's <i>tres</i> stylish. Where'd you get it?

7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;jane&stage;1:=confused.png,That seems… Very difficult, Jane.
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,That’s not nice, Hana! Everyone starts somewhere… And bad behavior will just get you banned. Or Akumatized. Let’s hope the former.
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;0:=confident.png,That’s super cool! Do you have a Miraculous or is this kind of power innate to you?
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyoko&stage;0:=wink.png,The gloves are especially classy touch.
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;0:=excited.png,They say you can stand up to any challenge, no matter however demanding, and that your courage is amazing and…

7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;1:=confident.png,Wow! I bet you’ve kicked a lot of butt with those. Figurative and otherwise!
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1c:=wink.png,Though maybe you have the Lion Miraculous, given how overconfident and prideful you're acting.
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;0:=bored.png,Though um, based on your ears, you're not really from around France, are you?
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,Um. Do those bracelets really weigh 8kg each, Chun-li?
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;0:=confident.png,Those bracelets of yours have to be <i>amazing</i> for training, Chun-li!
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;red&stage;2:=wink.png,Um. Exposed. Maybe it’s time for you to put away that sword?
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;0:=confused.png,Um. I don't mean to be critical, but the belts for your belts look is a bit too recent to be vintage...
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,U-uhm. Are you sober enough to be playing, Sei? I'd hate for you to regret this.
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;april&stage;0:=excited.png,Wait, didn't you used to have magic ninja bracelets? Like a Miraculous of some sort?
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;0:=bored.png,Was the choker that valuable? Did someone important give it to you? I’m sorry Blackrose.
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nugi-chan&stage;0:=confused.png,Webmaster? Have I fought that villain before…?
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;1:=confident.png,Well, considering some of the others we’re playing with, I suppose I can trust in that.
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kimberly&stage;0:=wink.png,Well, my Miraculous has a guardian spirit. Her name is Tikki, but even if you can't see her, she's right here...
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;alpha&stage;0:=excited.png,Well, you are a really good singer... Can you play Wonderwall?
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;pearl&stage;0:=alarmed.png,Whoa! I'm the only one who's supposed to transform!
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;1:=alarmed.png,W-wait, your stockings? Annie! You’re flashing everyone! C-come on!
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,W-well, it's nice to see you like pink stuff too, Saki. B-but you're-- you're flashing us!
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;0:=alarmed.png,W-what? A-are you okay?! Someone get a fire extinguisher!
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;weiss&stage;0:=confused.png,Yes, Weiss. We know how rich you are. Your father owns a hotel and is a mayor or something, blah blah blah…
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;0:=confident.png,You are well adorned! Both in accessories and otherwise.
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;0:=wink.png,Those are really cool armbands. I’m glad my costume normally works as armor, though. That seems a lot heavier. It’s such a relief to see you lose them, though.
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;0:,marker:blake_crush=bored.png,You know Blake, there’s something about you I can’t put my finger in…
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Your rudders... I'm not sure if you've been Akumatized, or this is a Miraculous, or something stranger...
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Oh no, not <i>again!</i> Shimakaze, are you okay?
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;3:=alarmed.png,Y-you know, maybe this can wait until after the game. Don't you use card-like seals? You're a bit... behind right now.
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;1:=confused.png,Y-you're a princess wearing sandals? Doesn't that seem to be a bit... ?
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;0&saidmarker;fled:,count-role;other&character;aimee:=alarmed.png,Aimee, don’t shoot her!
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;jane&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;amalia&stage;4-9:=confident.png,Amalia did show us how to be clever with attire, so I shouldn’t discount anything you have hidden up your sleeve! Or… Erk, pants.
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;weiss&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;blake:=bored.png,Blake, is Weiss always this… Bourgeois?
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;0:,count-role;other&character;red:=embarrassed.png,Costume aside, I'm more of a fan of pink than red. E-er. N-not the Red here, I mean like the color! Kind of like Red's red hair!
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;0:,count-role;other&character;daria:=embarrassed.png,Godzilla? Oh, if it's a big enemy, I'd probably try to evacuate an area, then figure out what part of him was Akumatized.
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose:,count-role;other&character;elizabeth&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,Hm...You and Elizabeth seem to have a lot of sentimental value for your necklaces, Blackrose. You also must have gotten yours from someone important, huh?
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1b:,count-role;other&character;futaba:=excited.png,I mean <i>Alya</i> got Akumatized into a cyber-villain. If I could save her, beating you--er, saving you--should be easy!
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;5:,count-role;other&character;yang:=wink.png,If the two of you aren’t open about this, you really should be! It’s too cute! O-oh. Your ears are… <i>That’s</i> your secret?
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;0:,count-role;self&saidmarker;elaine_puns:=bored.png,It feels like Cat Noir is here, and not in a good way.
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;0:,count-role;other&character;rinkah:=confident.png,Oh! Rinkah and Blackrose, are you from the same place?
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;3:,count-role;other&character;sei:=excited.png,Oh! You and Sei have something in common, with all of your belts. I’m surprised, given that they don’t seem to be keeping anything loose down.
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sharla&stage;0:,count-role;other&character;shazza:=embarrassed.png,Oh! You're Shazza, right! W-wait...
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;daria:=confused.png,Oh, don't be rude, Daria! I'm sure what Ochako does on her knees is-- um... h-her business. (Just play it cool. You can act like nothing was said.)
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;0:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;elaine_puns:=bored.png,That seems a little unfair, Elaine...
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;ryuko:=wink.png,The one that Ryuko has some history with, right?
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;alpha:=embarrassed.png,Um, D.Va, if you asked nicely, I’m sure Alpha would be happy to sing what you were listening to for all of us!
7-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;3:,count-role;other&character;rinkah:=confused.png,Unless you’ve been Akumatized...Which I hope isn’t the case!

7-female_removing_accessory,count-yandere:1-3,count-yandere&role;target:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=bored.png,I hope you really get your act together...
7-female_removing_accessory,count-yandere:1-3,count-yandere&role;target:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=confident.png,I can't let you be a danger to others, ~name~! Er-- apparently, I can't just fight you... that's security's job...
7-female_removing_accessory,count-yandere:1-3,count-yandere&role;target:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=embarrassed.png,You should be ashamed of how you've been treating other people, ~name~.
7-female_removing_accessory,count-yandere:1-3,count-yandere&role;target:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=confident.png,This serves you right.
7-female_removing_accessory,count-yandere:1-3,count-yandere&role;target:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=alarmed.png,T-there's no akuma here, is there, just ~name~ and her whole yandere stuff!
7-female_removed_accessory=calm.png,Just please take off more.
7-female_removed_accessory=embarrassed.png,I’m all about coordinating outfits, and considering I have nothing left, could you…?
7-female_removed_accessory=embarrassed.png,C-could I borrow that, ~name~? I… Am eeeling ba lit… Feeling a bit exposed!
7-female_removed_accessory=confused.png,I guess seeing isn’t believing.
7-female_removed_accessory=confident.png,This should be a hint to some of our other companions at the table to part with their weapons.
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;1:=alarmed.png,(Have I been fighting too many akuma? Do I… Um. Do I really just need to find some… <i>release?</i>)
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,(I really hope this place is secure from Hawkmoth… I’m worried about Uravity!)
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;revy&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,<i>Gosh</i> you have so many euphemisms for promiscuity...
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;2:=alarmed.png,A jacquin? What's that? If it's anything like a panther, I really can't say I've had good experiences...
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;2:=confident.png,A Lucky Charm, you say? I can definitely relate to that.
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;1&saidmarker;harped:=excited.png,A magic harp! <i>You</i> must have a Miraculous, right, Naryu? What's your Kwami's name?
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;1:=alarmed.png,A-and that your boobies were. Um! Outstanding.
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;dark_magician_girl&stage;1:=wink.png,And what's your name? I can't help but feel like there's something darkly magical about you...
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;2:=calm.png,Aren’t you supposed to be the smart one?
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;1:=wink.png,Awww, don't give up! You're just starting to have fun... (<i>You're one to talk, Marinette! You're only here to protect these people, remember that!</i>)
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;red&stage;1:=alarmed.png,B-but that huge thing… Can you really carry that?
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;ann&stage;5:=alarmed.png,Because I'm sweet on you! Er. No, I mean, you're a sweetheart.
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;korra&stage;4:=confident.png,But a hero has to persevere and keep moving forward, no matter what happens.
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;zizou&stage;1:=wink.png,Do you dye it, or is it natural?
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;buffy&stage;4:=calm.png,Drive me crazy as in... upset? Because that's not happening...
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;buffy&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,Drive me crazy as in... aroused... Uhm. Well.
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;kimberly&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,E-er, sorry if that's weird! I just never feel my clothes and kind of have to trust they're just there...
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;2:=confused.png,E-er. I think that may translate more sensibly in English...
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,E-er... unless you remove your necklaces too. How'd you even get that on...?
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Er. I mean. I’m saying it from an aesthetic point of you. Point of view. Not that--Uhm. Back to the game!
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,B-but you’re definitely still a goddess and I don’t mean to imply anything too torward fowards you. Forward towards you!
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;4&notsaidmarker;dizzy:=alarmed.png,Er... <i>SHIMAKAZE, ARE YOU OKAY!? Can you hear me?</i>
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;seven&stage;1:=wink.png,Even if I’m going to get naked, there’s one accessory I won’t ever remove, Seven. Maybe that symbol would be the same for you?
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;revy&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,F-fine. Be that way.
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;1:=alarmed.png,Finger on! I-I would never unless you really wanted me to b-but-
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;4:=bored.png,Hmm, lots of belts, Palutena. What are you trying so hard to keep secret?
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;alpha&stage;4:=confident.png,Hmm... Okay, Alpha, can you do... Born to be Free, by X Japan?
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;1:=calm.png,Hmm... Well, it's nice to have such a powerful Oracle here with me today! Let's keep an eye out for the akuma, shall we?
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;6:=confident.png,Huh, so that’s your secret! I have a weird feeling about Cat Noir right now…
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;2:=wink.png,I <i>may</i> have fantasized about it. Just a bit.
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;morrigan&stage;1:=confident.png,I guess I'll just have to wait and see!
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;2:=alarmed.png,I just wanted to let you know that it's nice to see, you know, someone who's similar to me go so far. You're a big hero to me. E-even though, you know, we're at this game.
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;2:=alarmed.png,It's-- I mean, most of the people around me in Paris. Um. Come from a different type of background. But you're a hero worldwide, so you, you know?
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;1:=calm.png,I kind of have to rely on my Miraculous for most of my powers... I'd like to think I'm pretty athletic, but you're next level!
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;1:=wink.png,I may not be the strongest woman in the world, but I'm actually a pretty good fighter, Chun-li!
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;1:=confident.png,I may be an art student, but that doesn’t mean I’m not clever, Annie! Let's see what you've got!
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;1:=excited.png,I mean, I have some friends that say I’m pretty quirky… oh! I get it. Superpowers are called Quirks where you’re from, aren’t they?
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;2:=wink.png,I much prefer ribbons to keep my hair back, but hairbands can definitely be more fashionable for long hair like yours.
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;jane&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,I was about to say...
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;daisy&stage;2:=wink.png,I’d love to try yours, but I’m a one-set kind of girl.
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;1:=excited.png,I’m glad you don’t get too caught up in your worries, Nagisa!
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,It’s just the first round, Nagisa. Don’t worry! E-er, as in  no reason to get down! Not that you’ll--Erk.
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;chiaki&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,If so, do you have any particular trophy or device you like to play games with? Just curious, in case I have to free you from Hawk Moth.
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;1:=confident.png,If you ever visit Paris, I'm sure we'd have a great time!
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,I-I have to admit, I feel really bad that you didn't choose to be here...
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;mercy&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,I-I mean they’re pretty wonderful too, just looking at you. Not you specifically, I mean generally, but you’re nice too, I’m just going to stop now.
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:=alarmed.png,I-I mean your panties looked fretty passionable to me-- O-oh erm. Pretty fashionable. A-and you were talking about your shoes. Erk. O-okay then.
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:=alarmed.png,I thought those panties looked fretty passionable though! I-I mean, um. Pretty fashionable. W-wait, you were talking about your shoes?
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;lyn&stage;5:=alarmed.png,I-I mean, your taste in fashion. Not... you know…
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,I-it was a pretty bandana, anyway...
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,You're really quite foxy, Elaine!
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;dawn&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,I-It’s either already steamy or already chilly, Dawn. I’m not sure which.
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;2:=excited.png,I'm just happy you're having a good time! It would be a shame if you were the one the akuma was targeting!
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;1:=wink.png,I'm kind of a dork with how into pink I actually am. I bet you'd look really good in it too! Though your tie matched your glasses and eyes in a really cool way!
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;1:=wink.png,I'm kind of interested to see what you'd look like with a nice fluffy scarf. It's doesn't match as well as your tie, but I bet it'd be really comforting.
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;sharla&stage;1:=confident.png,I'm sure I'll figure it out.
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;videl&stage;1:=wink.png,It’s good to see you have an honorable spirit about you. You’re definitely not like Chloe.
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;1&saidmarker;fled:=confident.png,Ladybug is here to keep you safe, Florina! Don’t get too worried!
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;1&saidmarker;fled:=confused.png,I… Hm… You know, I never really considered the option of running away.
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;2:=wink.png,Maybe you can show me more later! I mean, of your magic! N-not, but if you wanted to... Um!
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,Natsuki, being a woman is about being proud of who you are and the things you like. If ~player~ is the right person for you, they'll just appreciate you more! Um. The personality. Less the encroaching nudity...
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;red&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,N-no?
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,No? Hmm… Shantae, you just sound really familiar…
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;1:=excited.png,No…? Weird, I had a feeling… Let me try again…
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;spooky&stage;1:=wink.png,Of course. And you’re definitely not the cute type of ghost, Spooky. Just the scary kind.
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;spooky&stage;1:=excited.png,Of course Spooky! We all know better than to toy with spirits. Er. I at least hope we do.
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;3:=excited.png,Oh! It’s magic too? And fine gold? It’s a little gaudy, to be honest, but if it keeps people safe!
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,W-well normally I’d say it’s how you present yourself, but I think it’d be rude to say a goddess’s… Assets aren’t something heavenly!
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;amy_rose&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Oh! It's not a Miraculous. You're just like this!
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2c:=confident.png,Oh! Well. That was kind of weird, but at least you're in normal clothes now...
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;kim&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,Oh, I definitely would--Um. Is what someone who found you cute would say.
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;kim&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,Oh! Well if you’re offering--Um. I know magic, Kim! And that’s not a real place!
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;april&stage;1:=bored.png,Oh. Not anymore, huh? Well, the jumpsuit looks nice...
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;4&saidmarker;dizzy:=alarmed.png,O-oh no! Shimakaze, be safe! Do I need to call you a doctor? Or... er... a mechanic, I suppose?
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;2:=bored.png,O-oh. It was a joke. W-well, maybe that's a profession you should follow-up on, Daria?
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;mei&stage;2:=calm.png,Or maybe that was Li-Meng, the wizard? Either way, it's exciting to see you here!
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;1:=confused.png,Repairs? Ash? A-are you okay? You seem awfully resilient to harm... but... er... I'm confused now.
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,S-so, just stay confident, okay!
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;1:=confident.png,That’s the spirit, Florina! Be brave!
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;1:=wink.png,You did! Sorry you lost, but… Good job staying in the game!
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pearl&stage;1:=excited.png,This is going to be a lot more interesting than I thought! I-I mean, not you specifically Pearl b-but...
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3:=bored.png,This seems awfully familiar...
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;4:=bored.png,Um. What were those magic words…?
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;launch&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Um... I don't quite know who you are, but I think putting the gun away is a good idea.
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,U-um. You’re good at games, right, Blackrose? Let’s just keep playing, don’t get down!
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,I have to say, I don’t know what a GP is. But wherever you’re from, the style is very special!
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;1:=confident.png,Well! You seem like you're having fun!
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Well, I guess we don't have to worry about that tonight...
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;2:=wink.png,Well... your outfit's so cute and while you may be a little... different, I'll go with it for now!
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Um... well, let's see, I suppose.
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;arwen&stage;1:=calm.png,What brings you to a game like this, I wonder? Y-you know, from your storybook? Magic is such an interesting thing...
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;other&character;cammy&stage;3:=calm.png,Wow! She's amazing! Um. I tope hey--hope they don't keep taking off her clothes though...
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;cammy&stage;2:=confident.png,Wow! You handled yourself so well, Cammy. Guess it's a good thing I didn't need to use my yo-yo, huh?
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;alpha&stage;1:=confident.png,Wow! You're super animated too! You're awesome, Alpha!
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,W-wait a second! You aren't supposed to transform as part of a loss! O-or-- D-did I play this wrong?
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2:=alarmed.png,W-wait! Again!? Y-you have to be using an akuma! I can't transform more than once... And definitely not in such weird ways!
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2:=alarmed.png,S-shoot! You are using some kind of evil magic! A-and er. I haven't fed Tikki yet, so this might be a while before I can fix this...
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;other&character;kimberly&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,W-well, I-I can hardly blame you. To keep your hair nice. I mean. I tend to like cute, low maintainance stuff.
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4a:=alarmed.png,W-what? What is this? M-my earrings are still attached so at least...
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4a:=alarmed.png,I-I what!? H-how did you? W-what kind of akuma trickery is this!?
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4a:=confused.png,E-excuse you!? How <i>dare</i> you copy my costume, Vriska! This is <i>far</i> worse than Chloe that one time!
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;morrigan&stage;2:=confused.png,W-w-wait!? Where'd all the bats come from!?
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;3:=confident.png,You are <i>quite</i> strange, Daria. But in a very likable way! I can see us being great friends!
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;3:,marker:coldfloor=confident.png,You did say you were worried about the floor being cold...It’s okay to be a warm person but sensitive to cold. You dress well for all environments!
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;3:=excited.png,I’m sure you have lots of other clothes, but if you wanted to go shopping after this, Nagisa, I’m sure we could find something cute!
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;alpha&stage;3:=confident.png,You know, I did do a cover... Of the artistic variety! I'm not a great singer... For Jagged Stone. Maybe I could do one for you too?
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;2:=confused.png,You sound <i>so</i> familiar! I can’t quite pin down why!
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;1:=bored.png,Your attitude is really bad. Hawk Moth will Akumatize you in no time if you keep being rude.
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,S-sorry, GoGo. I don't know why I'm being so mean... You're being more than a little rude, though...
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;1:=alarmed.png,K-kinky? J-just because I have a very form fitting costume and a-- You know what, let's not follow this line of thought.
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;1:=alarmed.png,Y-you're beautiful in your own way, Daria, y-yut boo-- but you don't resemble him!
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;videl&stage;1:=alarmed.png,Zut, don't make fun of my costume Videl!
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&stage;5:,count-role;other&character;weiss:=alarmed.png,A doll? Weiss, <i>please</i> don’t make this any weirder.
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;alice:=embarrassed.png,Alice, do you think she means pounds? She doesn’t seem to mean Euro or francs…
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;boundaries:,count-role;other&character;zoey:,marker:boundaries=wink.png,Don’t worry, Zoey, I think everyone’s being very accepting of other’s boundaries. That makes for a good game, right?
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;daria:=embarrassed.png,Er. Nothing! Uravity! Wust jut wou yer... um... j-just what you were saying! About debris. And stuff.
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3b:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=alarmed.png,G-gah! I really hope you just aren't copying people's outfits, Vriska! W-wait, a-are you going to be as lewd as Zone-tan now!?
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;weiss:=confused.png,GP? Does she mean Lien, like you have over in Vale?
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;meia:,count-role;self&saidmarker;corrin_meia_hair:=wink.png,He certainly manages to make a woman’s hairstyle work, <i>oui</i>, Meia?
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;4:,count-role;other&character;corrin_f:=confident.png,Hmm...Palutena, Corrin might use the most tactical choice, but fashion requires a certain economy. I’d be happy to help, as a hero to a goddess of heroes.
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;daria:=excited.png,I'm glad you think so, Daria! I think Uravity and Ladybug would make a great team!
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;ann:=wink.png,Is that like a panther of some sort? I bet Ann knows a thing about that.
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;4:,count-role;other&character;sei:=embarrassed.png,Just fiven that your stuff is gorn fitting, I mean form fitting! Given form fitting! Erk. Both of you… Belts, right?
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;rinkah:=embarrassed.png,N-no? Oh. I seem...You just look...I promise I didn’t mean to imply--
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;sharla&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;shazza:=bored.png,No, Shazza is the blonde Australian... Hm... I'm sorry, I keep forgetting your name.
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3a:,count-role;other&character;ruby:=embarrassed.png,This seems awfully familiar... Like something Ruby might wear... Oh no! You aren't copying people's outfits, are you!?
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;ann:=wink.png,Though I think an elegant coat or something like that would be something to see too, wouldn’t you agree Ann?
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;futaba:=wink.png,Though I think an elegant coat or something like that would be something to see too, wouldn’t you agree Futaba?
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;jane&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;moon&stage;1-10:=embarrassed.png,Though I wouldn’t expect you to mimic her for anything else, I thought maybe Moon might have a trick to pull off that zipless undressing!
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;jane&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;buffy&stage;5-10:=wink.png,Though, Buffy did already show us how to take her bra off under her clothes...
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;jane&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;twilight&stage;1-10:=embarrassed.png,Twilight has, um, however, disregarded normal social conventions. So if you wanted to, Jane, you definitely could?
7-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;tracer:=embarrassed.png,Um. Did you mean a GBP? I think Tracer knows about that.

-3-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,But why would it be black? Your skin's so pale-- <i>Oh. The weapon.</i>
-3-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;3:=wink.png,E-er, I misspoke, I really <i>did</i> mean your… Um… Gear…
-3-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;0:=bored.png,E-er, unless you actually have wings? Are you some kind of...
-3-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;corrin_m&stage;0:=calm.png,Hmm... how very stylish, Corrin!
-3-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,I mean, you can kinda see me right here, right?
-3-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;1:=confident.png,I-It might be a bit bold of me, but…
-3-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;1:=confident.png,Oh! A sash! Very Roman of you! Are you dressed up like some kind of war god? Oh, that's a cool motif for sure!
-3-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;corrin_m&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,You're very gentle, Corrin...
-3-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;0:,count-role;other&character;palutena:=confused.png,(I could learn a lot from how Palutena pushes Pit! Maybe even Cat Noir would listen...)
-3-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;palutena:=wink.png,I can't tell if you're flirting with him or not, Palutena... Isn't Hades super scary, Pit?
-3-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;weiss:=bored.png,Really Weiss? Beautiful skin? Can you even handle sunlight? Ugh. You are <i>frustratingly</i> hard to advocate for.
-3-male_removed_accessory=alarmed.png,Where are you hiding your akuma!?
-3-male_removed_accessory=calm.png,And that’s all you’re taking off?
-3-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;1:=alarmed.png,A-and it's not like you'd... um... need protection with me-- <i>from</i> me! O-oh god...
-3-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;2:=alarmed.png,E-er, forget that. Or don't. Um. I'm n-not... Erk...! (Shut <i>up</i> Marinette! Come on!)
-3-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;corrin_m&stage;2:=bored.png,I like that in men. Just not married ones.
-3-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;2:=alarmed.png,I-I’ll admit that I wouldn’t mind feeling those big strong hands on… Well… Um. Y-you know, this was a bad idea, <i>e-excusez moi.</i>
-3-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;4:=alarmed.png,It’s like my whole body is blushing and I’m going to go die of embarrassment now.
-3-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;2:=excited.png,Pit, could I actually see that? I could definitely use this to design something cool! You have good fashion sense!
-3-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;1:=wink.png,Well, whatever you are, you look like you're going to be fun to play with! In this game! Not- um. Hi!
-3-male_removed_accessory,count-role;other&character;d.va&stage;3:=wink.png,You know, I like to incorporate my signatures into my designs, but I, um. Usually do outerwear.
-3-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;corrin_m&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,You remind me... kind of about a boy I know...
-3-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;palutena:=confident.png,I guess you help put the Pal in Palutena, huh, Pit?
-3-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;palutena:=alarmed.png,W-wait, did you bring a firearm in here? I don't see your guns, Pit. Please tell me this isn't divine magic invisibility!

-3-female_removing_accessory=excited.png,I’m here showing everyone my--my--
-3-female_removing_accessory=bored.png,Oh come on, this is more than bad luck.
-3-female_removing_accessory=embarrassed.png,I'm having to explain my hair color down there…
-3-female_removing_accessory=confused.png,You must be a villain of some type to be so heartless.
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;1:=confident.png,<i>Ils pillent toujours le cul!</i>
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;other&character;elizabeth&stage;3:=wink.png,A lady has to have her secrets, <i>oui</i>?
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;dark_magician_girl&stage;1:=confident.png,A lucky necklace? Well, it's lucky I got to meet you today, Dark Magician Girl!
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch&stage;0:=confident.png,Agreed. Capes aren’t quite as good as a heavy cloak. But there’s something debonair about it!
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;0:=wink.png,Ah! I'm glad you picked that trick up from me.
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Ah, <i>zut</i>, the purple hair made me imagine…
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;lyn&stage;4:=excited.png,All of your things are so finely made, I could learn a lot based on your taste!
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;zizou&stage;0:=excited.png,And your hair does look pretty! It’s a very cool texture and color.
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;0:=confused.png,Are you really a pink-haired woman with butterfly wings?
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sharla&stage;0:=bored.png,Are you... wait... no... that's not right...
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1a:=wink.png,At least that was a cool outfit. Definitely not stolen. *Cough* Pot *cough* meet *cough* kettle *cough*.
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2c:=embarrassed.png,At least you finally settled on some casualwear... Why are you transforming again?
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;2:=confident.png,At least you have two rounds of small stuff left!
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;3:=confident.png,Belts? Oh! You’re rocking the “many belts” look. Befitting of a goddess.
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;3:=wink.png,Why limit yourself to conventional aesthetics, Palutena?
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;buffy&stage;3:=bored.png,Buffy, you shouldn't so easily part with objects of fate...
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,But I don’t think they really know this much…
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;3:=confused.png,But Juleka once said there were some magic words if I ever found Chloe being too forward to Adrien…
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;3:=confused.png,But you <i>are</i> really cute.
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;cammy&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Cammy! S-shoot! Here I go--
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;0:=confident.png,Costume aside, I'm more of a fan of pink than red. A pink ladybug would look kind of weird, don't you think?
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;2:=wink.png,D.Va, could you sign my friend Nino’s album? He’s a big fan!
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;2:=wink.png,Lucio is pretty good for electronica… I’m more of a Jagged Stone girl, myself.
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;1:=confident.png,Don’t be so hard on yourself! Dealing with spirits is really challenging, and you do that really well!
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;1:=wink.png,Sometimes you lose a few hands, Sheena. Don’t worry. I’ll make sure you stay safe. From one spirit person to another.
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2b:=embarrassed.png,E-er, I'm <i>definitely</i> not into the whole maid thing, so I'm hoping whatever comes next is... A bit better.
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;1:=confused.png,Er. I can owl you chocolate-- call you Ochako, right?
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;revy&stage;0:=bored.png,Er... won't you at least part with your guns...?
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;1:=bored.png,Fortunately, um, it looks like you don't really need to rewind since it's just your sandals...
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;2:=wink.png,Gracious of you to include the part actually keeping that on, Palutena.
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;2:=confident.png,Third time’s the charm, it just doesn’t seem to be a lucky one for you.
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;0:=alarmed.png,H-hey! What are you doing!? Are you copying my Miraculous?
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,What magic is this?! Did you have a Miraculous this whole time!?
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;0:=confident.png,Whoa! You're going to detransform too right--
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;0:=bored.png,Hm… Are you a swordswoman seeking redemption? Maybe you have a broken sword of some sort?
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;0:=calm.png,Hmm... Yeah, that's a good question. It's not like my costume really ever gets damaged...
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;launch&stage;1:=confused.png,Huh? What? Where'd... Is this... did I de-Akumatize Launch or something?
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;0:=wink.png,I bet we’re going to have a lot of fun tonight.
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;2:=confident.png,I don’t want another Rogercop. It looks like you’re almost pre-loaded for that kind of thing…
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;1:=confused.png,I just can't stop geeking out over you! You're an awesome fighter, you're an acclaimed interpol agent--!
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;morrigan&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,I know an Akumatized person when I see one... But I'm not sure I can see an accessory...
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;arwen&stage;0:=confident.png,I never thought I'd actually meet you, but you did so much during the War of the Ring!
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;amy_rose&stage;0:=bored.png,I suppose it could be a ring...
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;red&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,I think this is, a, um. Bad idea. My yo-yo doesn’t count!
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;videl&stage;0:=confident.png,I’m glad to see the senzu bean grows far from the vine, Videl!
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;1:=alarmed.png,I’m guessing it is. I don’t really think I’d be into <i>that</i> kind of thing.
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;2:=confident.png,I’ve never seen a bunny miraculous, and it would explain your awesome reflexes! Just not at cards.
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;2:=confused.png,If your angst didn’t turn you into a villain, that is.
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,W-wait, are there people that are into <i>feet</i>!?
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;ann&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,I-I mean, they have a bakery and I think you'd like something sweet.
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;0:=confused.png,I'm... not sure what a waifu is. Like a crush? Oh! Like a crush. No he's-- er...
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;0:=excited.png,In Japan, you have multiple pairs of shoes for school, for your house, and outside, right? That must be nice to have so many opportunities to express yourself!
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;0:=confident.png,They’re nice shoes, Nagisa! The style seems maybe a year or two out of date, though.
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;tracer:=wink.png,It’d be nice to do that with you once I get my clothes back on, and a trip to London besides!
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;jane&stage;0:=calm.png,It’s definitely well loved and tailored. I can tell you care a lot about it.
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;mei&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,I've actually heard a lot about you! How you got lost in a Blizzard once...
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;korra&stage;3:=calm.png,Korra, I can understand being insecure…
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;0:=wink.png,Like what? Being sassy and obnoxious?
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;0:=wink.png,Such as what? A weak sense of style and a weaker sense of honor?
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2a:=wink.png,Looks like you've been plundered, Vriska.
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;mercy&stage;1:=calm.png,Mercy, Switzerland has lots of things I find super interesting. The fashion, the languages, and the baking are all wonderful! And the people...
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;revy&stage;1:=confused.png,N-no...? Er... I've yet to solve a problem that needed a gun...
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;weiss&stage;1:=wink.png,Not all wealth is material, Weiss.
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;other&character;cammy&stage;2:=confused.png,Oh no! She's getting attacked again! Here, let me help--
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;0:=alarmed.png,Oh! A <i>choker.</i> Urk, still, no thanks.
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;daisy&stage;1:=excited.png,Oh! Those are cute earrings, Daisy! They match your outfit just like mine!
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;0:=wink.png,Oh! Your French is coming along well, Elizabeth. You have a wonderful accent!
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;0:=confident.png,Oh! Your shoes and socks at the same time! I was worried over nothing. You're pretty brave, aren't you?
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,O-oh, sorry. I can look away if you’d like?
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;2:=alarmed.png,Oh! I’m sorry, Nagisa. It’s just a very cool jacket!
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,O-oh. Daria <i>c'est une dominatrice.</i> That makes sense.
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;chiaki&stage;0:=confident.png,Or do you just seem a little... bored? I really hope it’s boredom rather than stress!
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1b:=confident.png,Say, Futaba, is Vriska's outfit like that Tron movie? Could you help me out with this?
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kimberly:=bored.png,Say, I have to ask, from one suit-wearing hero to another, where does your stuff <i>go</i> while you're transformed?
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;neo&stage;1:=excited.png,So Neopolitan like the ice cream... and you’re short. Oh you’re pint-sized! I get it!
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3:=calm.png,So, what'll it be <i>this</i> time, Vriska? Some sort of "goddess of <i>luck</i>" outfit?
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3:=calm.png,So, what'll it be <i>this</i> time, Vriska? Some sort of "wandering martial artist" look?
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;spooky&stage;0:=alarmed.png,Spooky? Give me the knife, please. Let’s put away our weapons.
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;2:=confident.png,That famous fashion company some girl managed to destroy?
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;dark_magician_girl&stage;0:=confident.png,That hat was so cute though! It's <i>tres</i> stylish. Where'd you get it?
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;3:=alarmed.png,That lets him give people superpowers but also brings out their worst feelings.
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;jane&stage;1:=confused.png,That seems… Very difficult, Jane.
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,That’s not nice, Hana! Everyone starts somewhere… And bad behavior will just get you banned. Or Akumatized. Let’s hope the former.
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;0:=confident.png,That’s super cool! Do you have a Miraculous or is this kind of power innate to you?
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyoko&stage;0:=wink.png,The gloves are especially classy touch.
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;0:=excited.png,They say you can stand up to any challenge, no matter however demanding, and that your courage is amazing and…
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;1:=confident.png,Those boots look really well worn, Blackrose! Were they expensive? They seem well-loved!
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;1:=confident.png,Wow! I bet you’ve kicked a lot of butt with those. Figurative and otherwise!
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1c:=wink.png,Though maybe you have the Lion Miraculous, given how overconfident and prideful you're acting.
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;0:=bored.png,Though um, based on your ears, you're not really from around France, are you?
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,Um. Do those bracelets really weigh 8kg each, Chun-li?
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;0:=confident.png,Those bracelets of yours have to be <i>amazing</i> for training, Chun-li!
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;red&stage;2:=wink.png,Um. Exposed. Maybe it’s time for you to put away that sword?
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;0:=confused.png,Um. I don't mean to be critical, but the belts for your belts look is a bit too recent to be vintage...
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,U-uhm. Are you sober enough to be playing, Sei? I'd hate for you to regret this.
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;april&stage;0:=excited.png,Wait, didn't you used to have magic ninja bracelets? Like a Miraculous of some sort?
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nugi-chan&stage;0:=confused.png,Webmaster? Have I fought that villain before…?
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;1:=confident.png,Well, considering some of the others we’re playing with, I suppose I can trust in that.
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kimberly&stage;0:=wink.png,Well, my Miraculous has a guardian spirit. Her name is Tikki, but even if you can't see her, she's right here...
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;alpha&stage;0:=excited.png,Well, you are a really good singer... Can you play Wonderwall?
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;pearl&stage;0:=alarmed.png,Whoa! I'm the only one who's supposed to transform!
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;1:=alarmed.png,W-wait, your stockings? Annie! You’re flashing everyone! C-come on!
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,W-well, it's nice to see you like pink stuff too, Saki. B-but you're-- you're flashing us!
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;0:=alarmed.png,W-what? A-are you okay?! Someone get a fire extinguisher!
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;weiss&stage;0:=confused.png,Yes, Weiss. We know how rich you are. Your father owns a hotel and is a mayor or something, blah blah blah…
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;0:=confident.png,You are well adorned! Both in accessories and otherwise.
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;0:=wink.png,Those are really cool armbands. I’m glad my costume normally works as armor, though. That seems a lot heavier. It’s such a relief to see you lose them, though.
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;0:,marker:blake_crush=bored.png,You know Blake, there’s something about you I can’t put my finger in…
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Your rudders... I'm not sure if you've been Akumatized, or this is a Miraculous, or something stranger...
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Oh no, not <i>again!</i> Shimakaze, are you okay?
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;3:=alarmed.png,Y-you know, maybe this can wait until after the game. Don't you use card-like seals? You're a bit... behind right now.

-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;jane&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;amalia&stage;4-9:=confident.png,Amalia did show us how to be clever with attire, so I shouldn’t discount anything you have hidden up your sleeve! Or… Erk, pants.
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;weiss&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;blake:=bored.png,Blake, is Weiss always this… Bourgeois?
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;0:,count-role;other&character;red:=embarrassed.png,Costume aside, I'm more of a fan of pink than red. E-er. N-not the Red here, I mean like the color! Kind of like Red's red hair!
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;0:,count-role;other&character;daria:=embarrassed.png,Godzilla? Oh, if it's a big enemy, I'd probably try to evacuate an area, then figure out what part of him was Akumatized.
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose:,count-role;other&character;elizabeth&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,Hm...You and Elizabeth seem to have a lot of sentimental value for your necklaces, Blackrose. You also must have gotten yours from someone important, huh?
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1b:,count-role;other&character;futaba:=excited.png,I mean <i>Alya</i> got Akumatized into a cyber-villain. If I could save her, beating you--er, saving you--should be easy!
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;5:,count-role;other&character;yang:=wink.png,If the two of you aren’t open about this, you really should be! It’s too cute! O-oh. Your ears are… <i>That’s</i> your secret?

-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;0:,count-role;other&character;rinkah:=confident.png,Oh! Rinkah and Blackrose, are you from the same place?
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;3:,count-role;other&character;sei:=excited.png,Oh! You and Sei have something in common, with all of your belts. I’m surprised, given that they don’t seem to be keeping anything loose down.
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sharla&stage;0:,count-role;other&character;shazza:=embarrassed.png,Oh! You're Shazza, right! W-wait...
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;daria:=confused.png,Oh, don't be rude, Daria! I'm sure what Ochako does on her knees is-- um... h-her business. (Just play it cool. You can act like nothing was said.)
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;0:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;elaine_puns:=bored.png,That seems a little unfair, Elaine...
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;ryuko:=wink.png,The one that Ryuko has some history with, right?
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;alpha:=embarrassed.png,Um, D.Va, if you asked nicely, I’m sure Alpha would be happy to sing what you were listening to for all of us!
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;3:,count-role;other&character;rinkah:=confused.png,Unless you’ve been Akumatized...Which I hope isn’t the case!
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&saidmarker;strategyguide:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;strategyguide0:,marker:strategyguide0=confused.png,Wait, you’re using a guide for this? It’s... really pretty simple, I thought?
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose:,count-role;other&character;zoey&stage;0-2:=confident.png,What do they say about girls who wear chokers, Zoey?
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;weiss&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;ruby:=bored.png,Yang, is Weiss always like this… Repugnant?
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;weiss&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;yang:=bored.png,Yang, is Weiss always this… Yawn-inducing?

-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;1:=wink.png,I'm kind of a dork with how into pink I actually am. I bet you'd look really good in it too! Though your tie matched your glasses and eyes in a really cool way!
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;1:=wink.png,I'm kind of interested to see what you'd look like with a nice fluffy scarf. It's doesn't match as well as your tie, but I bet it'd be really comforting.
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;sharla&stage;1:=confident.png,I'm sure I'll figure it out.
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;videl&stage;1:=wink.png,It’s good to see you have an honorable spirit about you. You’re definitely not like Chloe.

-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;1&saidmarker;fled:=confused.png,I… Hm… You know, I never really considered the option of running away.
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;2:=wink.png,Maybe you can show me more later! I mean, of your magic! N-not, but if you wanted to... Um!
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,Natsuki, being a woman is about being proud of who you are and the things you like. If ~player~ is the right person for you, they'll just appreciate you more! Um. The personality. Less the encroaching nudity...
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;red&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,N-no?
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,No? Hmm… Shantae, you just sound really familiar…
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;1:=excited.png,No…? Weird, I had a feeling… Let me try again…
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;spooky&stage;1:=wink.png,Of course. And you’re definitely not the cute type of ghost, Spooky. Just the scary kind.
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;spooky&stage;1:=excited.png,Of course Spooky! We all know better than to toy with spirits. Er. I at least hope we do.
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;3:=excited.png,Oh! It’s magic too? And fine gold? It’s a little gaudy, to be honest, but if it keeps people safe!
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,W-well normally I’d say it’s how you present yourself, but I think it’d be rude to say a goddess’s… Assets aren’t something heavenly!
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;amy_rose&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Oh! It's not a Miraculous. You're just like this!
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2c:=confident.png,Oh! Well. That was kind of weird, but at least you're in normal clothes now...
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;kim&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,Oh, I definitely would--Um. Is what someone who found you cute would say.
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;kim&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,Oh! Well if you’re offering--Um. I know magic, Kim! And that’s not a real place!
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;april&stage;1:=bored.png,Oh. Not anymore, huh? Well, the jumpsuit looks nice...
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;4&saidmarker;dizzy:=alarmed.png,O-oh no! Shimakaze, be safe! Do I need to call you a doctor? Or... er... a mechanic, I suppose?
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;2:=bored.png,O-oh. It was a joke. W-well, maybe that's a profession you should follow-up on, Daria?
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;mei&stage;2:=calm.png,Or maybe that was Li-Meng, the wizard? Either way, it's exciting to see you here!
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;1:=confused.png,Repairs? Ash? A-are you okay? You seem awfully resilient to harm... but... er... I'm confused now.
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,S-so, just stay confident, okay!
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;1:=confident.png,That’s the spirit, Florina! Be brave!
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;1:=wink.png,You did! Sorry you lost, but… Good job staying in the game!
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pearl&stage;1:=excited.png,This is going to be a lot more interesting than I thought! I-I mean, not you specifically Pearl b-but...
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3:=bored.png,This seems awfully familiar...
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;4:=bored.png,Um. What were those magic words…?
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;launch&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Um... I don't quite know who you are, but I think putting the gun away is a good idea.
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,U-um. You’re good at games, right, Blackrose? Let’s just keep playing, don’t get down!
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,I have to say, I don’t know what a GP is. But wherever you’re from, the style is very special!
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;1:=confident.png,Well! You seem like you're having fun!
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Well, I guess we don't have to worry about that tonight...
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;2:=wink.png,Well... your outfit's so cute and while you may be a little... different, I'll go with it for now!
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Um... well, let's see, I suppose.
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;arwen&stage;1:=calm.png,What brings you to a game like this, I wonder? Y-you know, from your storybook? Magic is such an interesting thing...
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;other&character;cammy&stage;3:=calm.png,Wow! She's amazing! Um. I tope hey--hope they don't keep taking off her clothes though...
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;cammy&stage;2:=confident.png,Wow! You handled yourself so well, Cammy. Guess it's a good thing I didn't need to use my yo-yo, huh?
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;alpha&stage;1:=confident.png,Wow! You're super animated too! You're awesome, Alpha!
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,W-wait a second! You aren't supposed to transform as part of a loss! O-or-- D-did I play this wrong?
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2:=alarmed.png,W-wait! Again!? Y-you have to be using an akuma! I can't transform more than once... And definitely not in such weird ways!
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2:=alarmed.png,S-shoot! You are using some kind of evil magic! A-and er. I haven't fed Tikki yet, so this might be a while before I can fix this...
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;other&character;kimberly&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,W-well, I-I can hardly blame you. To keep your hair nice. I mean. I tend to like cute, low maintainance stuff.
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4a:=alarmed.png,W-what? What is this? M-my earrings are still attached so at least...
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4a:=alarmed.png,I-I what!? H-how did you? W-what kind of akuma trickery is this!?
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4a:=confused.png,E-excuse you!? How <i>dare</i> you copy my costume, Vriska! This is <i>far</i> worse than Chloe that one time!
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;morrigan&stage;2:=confused.png,W-w-wait!? Where'd all the bats come from!?
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;3:=confident.png,You are <i>quite</i> strange, Daria. But in a very likable way! I can see us being great friends!
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;3:,marker:coldfloor=confident.png,You did say you were worried about the floor being cold...It’s okay to be a warm person but sensitive to cold. You dress well for all environments!
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;3:=excited.png,I’m sure you have lots of other clothes, but if you wanted to go shopping after this, Nagisa, I’m sure we could find something cute!
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;alpha&stage;3:=confident.png,You know, I did do a cover... Of the artistic variety! I'm not a great singer... For Jagged Stone. Maybe I could do one for you too?
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;2:=confused.png,You sound <i>so</i> familiar! I can’t quite pin down why!
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;1:=bored.png,Your attitude is really bad. Hawk Moth will Akumatize you in no time if you keep being rude.
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,S-sorry, GoGo. I don't know why I'm being so mean... You're being more than a little rude, though...
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;1:=alarmed.png,K-kinky? J-just because I have a very form fitting costume and a-- You know what, let's not follow this line of thought.
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;1:=alarmed.png,Y-you're beautiful in your own way, Daria, y-yut boo-- but you don't resemble him!
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&stage;5:,count-role;other&character;weiss:=alarmed.png,A doll? Weiss, <i>please</i> don’t make this any weirder.
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;ann:=wink.png,A-Ann, do you know anything about big cats like that? Because there's a lot of... cats here...
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;alice:=embarrassed.png,Alice, do you think she means pounds? She doesn’t seem to mean Euro or francs…
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;boundaries:,count-role;other&character;zoey:,marker:boundaries=wink.png,Don’t worry, Zoey, I think everyone’s being very accepting of other’s boundaries. That makes for a good game, right?
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;daria:=embarrassed.png,Er. Nothing! Uravity! Wust jut wou yer... um... j-just what you were saying! About debris. And stuff.
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3b:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=alarmed.png,G-gah! I really hope you just aren't copying people's outfits, Vriska! W-wait, a-are you going to be as lewd as Zone-tan now!?
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;weiss:=confused.png,GP? Does she mean Lien, like you have over in Vale?
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;meia:,count-role;self&saidmarker;corrin_meia_hair:=wink.png,He certainly manages to make a woman’s hairstyle work, <i>oui</i>, Meia?
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;4:,count-role;other&character;corrin_f:=confident.png,Hmm...Palutena, Corrin might use the most tactical choice, but fashion requires a certain economy. I’d be happy to help, as a hero to a goddess of heroes.
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;gwen:=wink.png,I think the fantasy is a little better than reality, but the reality isn’t bad. In moderation.
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;daria:=excited.png,I'm glad you think so, Daria! I think Uravity and Ladybug would make a great team!
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;4:,count-role;other&character;sei:=embarrassed.png,Just fiven that your stuff is gorn fitting, I mean form fitting! Given form fitting! Erk. Both of you… Belts, right?
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;rinkah:=embarrassed.png,N-no? Oh. I seem...You just look...I promise I didn’t mean to imply--
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;sharla&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;shazza:=bored.png,No, Shazza is the blonde Australian... Hm... I'm sorry, I keep forgetting your name.
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3a:,count-role;other&character;ruby:=embarrassed.png,This seems awfully familiar... Like something Ruby might wear... Oh no! You aren't copying people's outfits, are you!?
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;ann:=wink.png,Though I think an elegant coat or something like that would be something to see too, wouldn’t you agree Ann?
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;futaba:=wink.png,Though I think an elegant coat or something like that would be something to see too, wouldn’t you agree Futaba?
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;jane&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;moon&stage;1-10:=embarrassed.png,Though I wouldn’t expect you to mimic her for anything else, I thought maybe Moon might have a trick to pull off that zipless undressing!
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;jane&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;buffy&stage;5-10:=wink.png,Though, Buffy did already show us how to take her bra off under her clothes...
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;jane&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;twilight&stage;1-10:=embarrassed.png,Twilight has, um, however, disregarded normal social conventions. So if you wanted to, Jane, you definitely could?
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;tracer:=embarrassed.png,Um. Did you mean a GBP? I think Tracer knows about that.
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan:=alarmed.png,Wait, Streaming-chan has a real name? And you know each other? And... <i>my,</i> you have stories.
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;2:,count-role;self&saidmarker;d.va_competition:=wink.png,We'll just have to see h-how the rest goes, don't we, Hana?
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;futaba:,marker:french=bored.png,What was that, Futaba? <i>Grossier.</i>
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;zizou&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;sola:=confident.png,You and Sola know each other, right Zizou? Do all of your friends have such cool hairstyles?
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_mariba&notsaidmarker;saki_befriend_furavity:,count-role;other&character;futaba&saidmarker;saki_befriend_mariba:=alarmed.png,F-Futaba, not like that, like... er... hi, Saki, would you want to hang out with Futaba and I after this?
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_mariba&notsaidmarker;saki_befriend_furavity:,count-role;other&character;futaba&saidmarker;saki_befriend_mariba:=alarmed.png,Futaba, that'll just wake it morse--make it worse! Like this! <i>Saki!</i> Hey! Let's hang out with Futaba after this!
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_ladity&notsaidmarker;saki_befriend_furavity:,count-role;other&character;uravity&saidmarker;saki_befriend_ladity:=wink.png,It's not like I could loan out a Miraculous, but I'm sure Saki would love to talk about what kinds of superpowers she'd like.
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_ladity&notsaidmarker;saki_befriend_furavity:,count-role;other&character;uravity&saidmarker;saki_befriend_ladity:=wink.png,<i>Everyone</i> would love to have a superpower.

-3-female_removed_accessory,priority:500,count-role;target&character;meia&stage;1:,count-role;self&saidmarker;corrins_meia_hair:=confused.png,The… Er. Boy Corrin.
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-medic:1-3,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;4&saidmarker;dizzy:=alarmed.png,O-oh no! Shimakaze, be safe! Can one of the medics here come treat her? She doesn't seem to be having bad feelings, but... a possessed warship would be awful!
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-uravity:1,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_furavity:,count-role;other&character;futaba&stage;2:=excited.png,You're gonna be in great hands with Futaba and Ochako, Saki! Think of this like a girls night out where we talk about boys, and makeup, and um. Getting naked and comfy and stuff!
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-weapon:2,count-weapon:3,count-role;target&character;red&stage;3:=calm.png,What is with you and Aimee and the others and your weapons? You’re so reliant on things beyond your own wits.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:aimee=confident.png,This should be a hint to some of our other companions at the table to part with their weapons.

-2-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;corrin_m&stage;0:=calm.png,Hmm... how very stylish, Corrin!
-2-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,I mean, you can kinda see me right here, right?
-2-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;1:=confident.png,I-It might be a bit bold of me, but…
-2-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;1:=confident.png,Oh! A sash! Very Roman of you! Are you dressed up like some kind of war god? Oh, that's a cool motif for sure!
-2-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;corrin_m&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,You're very gentle, Corrin...
-2-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;0:,count-role;other&character;palutena:=confused.png,(I could learn a lot from how Palutena pushes Pit! Maybe even Cat Noir would listen...)
-2-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;palutena:=wink.png,I can't tell if you're flirting with him or not, Palutena... Isn't Hades super scary, Pit?
-2-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;weiss:=bored.png,Really Weiss? Beautiful skin? Can you even handle sunlight? Ugh. You are <i>frustratingly</i> hard to advocate for.
-2-male_removed_accessory=confident.png,Take it slow... I want to enjoy this.
-2-male_removed_accessory=alarmed.png,Is it weird that I can fantasize about you taking off your outfit? No weirder than this, I suppose.
-2-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;1:=alarmed.png,A-and it's not like you'd... um... need protection with me-- <i>from</i> me! O-oh god...
-2-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;2:=alarmed.png,E-er, forget that. Or don't. Um. I'm n-not... Erk...! (Shut <i>up</i> Marinette! Come on!)
-2-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;corrin_m&stage;2:=bored.png,I like that in men. Just not married ones.
-2-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;2:=alarmed.png,I-I’ll admit that I wouldn’t mind feeling those big strong hands on… Well… Um. Y-you know, this was a bad idea, <i>e-excusez moi.</i>
-2-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;4:=alarmed.png,It’s like my whole body is blushing and I’m going to go die of embarrassment now.
-2-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;2:=excited.png,Pit, could I actually see that? I could definitely use this to design something cool! You have good fashion sense!
-2-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;1:=wink.png,Well, whatever you are, you look like you're going to be fun to play with! In this game! Not- um. Hi!
-2-male_removed_accessory,count-role;other&character;d.va&stage;3:=wink.png,You know, I like to incorporate my signatures into my designs, but I, um. Usually do outerwear.

-2-female_removing_accessory=confident.png,Ooh...
-2-female_removing_accessory=excited.png,That’s a pretty ~clothing~, ~name~.
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;1:=confident.png,<i>Ils pillent toujours le cul!</i>

-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch&stage;0:=confident.png,Agreed. Capes aren’t quite as good as a heavy cloak. But there’s something debonair about it!
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;0:=wink.png,Ah! I'm glad you picked that trick up from me.
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Ah, <i>zut</i>, the purple hair made me imagine…
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;lyn&stage;4:=excited.png,All of your things are so finely made, I could learn a lot based on your taste!
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;zizou&stage;0:=excited.png,And your hair does look pretty! It’s a very cool texture and color.
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;0:=confused.png,Are you really a pink-haired woman with butterfly wings?

-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1a:=wink.png,At least that was a cool outfit. Definitely not stolen. *Cough* Pot *cough* meet *cough* kettle *cough*.
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2c:=embarrassed.png,At least you finally settled on some casualwear... Why are you transforming again?
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;2:=confident.png,At least you have two rounds of small stuff left!
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;3:=confident.png,Belts? Oh! You’re rocking the “many belts” look. Befitting of a goddess.
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;3:=wink.png,Why limit yourself to conventional aesthetics, Palutena?
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;buffy&stage;3:=bored.png,Buffy, you shouldn't so easily part with objects of fate...
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,But I don’t think they really know this much…
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;3:=confused.png,But you <i>are</i> really cute.
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;cammy&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Cammy! S-shoot! Here I go--
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;0:=confident.png,Costume aside, I'm more of a fan of pink than red. A pink ladybug would look kind of weird, don't you think?
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;2:=wink.png,D.Va, could you sign my friend Nino’s album? He’s a big fan!
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;2:=wink.png,Lucio is pretty good for electronica… I’m more of a Jagged Stone girl, myself.

-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;chiaki&stage;0:=confident.png,Or do you just seem a little... bored? I really hope it’s boredom rather than stress!
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1b:=confident.png,Say, Futaba, is Vriska's outfit like that Tron movie? Could you help me out with this?
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kimberly:=bored.png,Say, I have to ask, from one suit-wearing hero to another, where does your stuff <i>go</i> while you're transformed?

-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,That’s not nice, Hana! Everyone starts somewhere… And bad behavior will just get you banned. Or Akumatized. Let’s hope the former.
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;0:=confident.png,That’s super cool! Do you have a Miraculous or is this kind of power innate to you?
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyoko&stage;0:=wink.png,The gloves are especially classy touch.
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;0:=excited.png,They say you can stand up to any challenge, no matter however demanding, and that your courage is amazing and…

-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1c:=wink.png,Though maybe you have the Lion Miraculous, given how overconfident and prideful you're acting.
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;0:=bored.png,Though um, based on your ears, you're not really from around France, are you?
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,Um. Do those bracelets really weigh 8kg each, Chun-li?
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;0:=confident.png,Those bracelets of yours have to be <i>amazing</i> for training, Chun-li!
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;red&stage;2:=wink.png,Um. Exposed. Maybe it’s time for you to put away that sword?
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;0:=confused.png,Um. I don't mean to be critical, but the belts for your belts look is a bit too recent to be vintage...
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,U-uhm. Are you sober enough to be playing, Sei? I'd hate for you to regret this.
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;april&stage;0:=excited.png,Wait, didn't you used to have magic ninja bracelets? Like a Miraculous of some sort?
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nugi-chan&stage;0:=confused.png,Webmaster? Have I fought that villain before…?
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;1:=confident.png,Well, considering some of the others we’re playing with, I suppose I can trust in that.

-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;alpha&stage;0:=excited.png,Well, you are a really good singer... Can you play Wonderwall?
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;pearl&stage;0:=alarmed.png,Whoa! I'm the only one who's supposed to transform!
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;1:=alarmed.png,W-wait, your stockings? Annie! You’re flashing everyone! C-come on!
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,W-well, it's nice to see you like pink stuff too, Saki. B-but you're-- you're flashing us!

-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;weiss&stage;0:=confused.png,Yes, Weiss. We know how rich you are. Your father owns a hotel and is a mayor or something, blah blah blah…
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;0:=confident.png,You are well adorned! Both in accessories and otherwise.
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;0:=wink.png,Those are really cool armbands. I’m glad my costume normally works as armor, though. That seems a lot heavier. It’s such a relief to see you lose them, though.
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;0:,marker:blake_crush=bored.png,You know Blake, there’s something about you I can’t put my finger in…
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Your rudders... I'm not sure if you've been Akumatized, or this is a Miraculous, or something stranger...
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Oh no, not <i>again!</i> Shimakaze, are you okay?
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;3:=alarmed.png,Y-you know, maybe this can wait until after the game. Don't you use card-like seals? You're a bit... behind right now.
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;1:=confused.png,Y-you're a princess wearing sandals? Doesn't that seem to be a bit... ?
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;0&saidmarker;fled:,count-role;other&character;aimee:=alarmed.png,Aimee, don’t shoot her!
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;jane&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;amalia&stage;4-9:=confident.png,Amalia did show us how to be clever with attire, so I shouldn’t discount anything you have hidden up your sleeve! Or… Erk, pants.
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;weiss&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;blake:=bored.png,Blake, is Weiss always this… Bourgeois?
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;0:,count-role;other&character;red:=embarrassed.png,Costume aside, I'm more of a fan of pink than red. E-er. N-not the Red here, I mean like the color! Kind of like Red's red hair!
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;0:,count-role;other&character;daria:=embarrassed.png,Godzilla? Oh, if it's a big enemy, I'd probably try to evacuate an area, then figure out what part of him was Akumatized.
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose:,count-role;other&character;elizabeth&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,Hm...You and Elizabeth seem to have a lot of sentimental value for your necklaces, Blackrose. You also must have gotten yours from someone important, huh?
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1b:,count-role;other&character;futaba:=excited.png,I mean <i>Alya</i> got Akumatized into a cyber-villain. If I could save her, beating you--er, saving you--should be easy!
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;5:,count-role;other&character;yang:=wink.png,If the two of you aren’t open about this, you really should be! It’s too cute! O-oh. Your ears are… <i>That’s</i> your secret?

-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;3:,count-role;other&character;sei:=excited.png,Oh! You and Sei have something in common, with all of your belts. I’m surprised, given that they don’t seem to be keeping anything loose down.
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sharla&stage;0:,count-role;other&character;shazza:=embarrassed.png,Oh! You're Shazza, right! W-wait...
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;daria:=confused.png,Oh, don't be rude, Daria! I'm sure what Ochako does on her knees is-- um... h-her business. (Just play it cool. You can act like nothing was said.)
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;0:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;elaine_puns:=bored.png,That seems a little unfair, Elaine...

-2-female_removing_accessory,priority:0,count-yandere:1-3,count-villain&role;target&stage;3-5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=wink.png,Just because ~name~ is misguided, doesn’t mean that she doesn’t have redeeming qualities. Maybe if you didn’t pick on her, she wouldn’t do what she does?
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-yandere:1-3,count-yandere&role;target:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=bored.png,What are we to do with you, ~name~?
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-yandere:1-3,count-yandere&role;target:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=bored.png,I hope you really get your act together...

-2-female_removing_accessory,count-yandere:1-3,count-yandere&role;target:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=embarrassed.png,You should be ashamed of how you've been treating other people, ~name~.
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-yandere:1-3,count-yandere&role;target:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=confident.png,This serves you right.
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-yandere:1-3,count-yandere&role;target:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=alarmed.png,T-there's no akuma here, is there, just ~name~ and her whole yandere stuff!
-2-female_removed_accessory=calm.png,Take it slow... I want to enjoy this.
-2-female_removed_accessory=embarrassed.png,Is it weird that I can fantasize about your outfit? No weirder than this, I suppose.
-2-female_removed_accessory=confident.png,This should be a hint to some of our other companions at the table to part with their weapons.
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;1:=alarmed.png,(Have I been fighting too many akuma? Do I… Um. Do I really just need to find some… <i>release?</i>)
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,(I really hope this place is secure from Hawkmoth… I’m worried about Uravity!)
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;revy&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,<i>Gosh</i> you have so many euphemisms for promiscuity...
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;2:=confident.png,A Lucky Charm, you say? I can definitely relate to that.
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;1&saidmarker;harped:=excited.png,A magic harp! <i>You</i> must have a Miraculous, right, Naryu? What's your Kwami's name?
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;1:=alarmed.png,A-and that your boobies were. Um! Outstanding.
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;dark_magician_girl&stage;1:=wink.png,And what's your name? I can't help but feel like there's something darkly magical about you...
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;2:=calm.png,Aren’t you supposed to be the smart one?
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;1:=wink.png,Awww, don't give up! You're just starting to have fun... (<i>You're one to talk, Marinette! You're only here to protect these people, remember that!</i>)
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;red&stage;1:=alarmed.png,B-but that huge thing… Can you really carry that?
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;ann&stage;5:=alarmed.png,Because I'm sweet on you! Er. No, I mean, you're a sweetheart.
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;zizou&stage;1:=wink.png,Do you dye it, or is it natural?
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;buffy&stage;4:=calm.png,Drive me crazy as in... upset? Because that's not happening...
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;buffy&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,Drive me crazy as in... aroused... Uhm. Well.
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;kimberly&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,E-er, sorry if that's weird! I just never feel my clothes and kind of have to trust they're just there...
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;2:=confused.png,E-er. I think that may translate more sensibly in English...
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,E-er... unless you remove your necklaces too. How'd you even get that on...?
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Elena, could you be a bit more magnanimous and lose faster?
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;2:=alarmed.png,U-uhm. I can feel the wind near something, Elena.
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Er. I mean. I’m saying it from an aesthetic point of you. Point of view. Not that--Uhm. Back to the game!
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,B-but you’re definitely still a goddess and I don’t mean to imply anything too torward fowards you. Forward towards you!
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;4&notsaidmarker;dizzy:=alarmed.png,Er... <i>SHIMAKAZE, ARE YOU OKAY!? Can you hear me?</i>
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;revy&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,F-fine. Be that way.
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;1:=alarmed.png,Finger on! I-I would never unless you really wanted me to b-but-
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;4:=bored.png,Hmm, lots of belts, Palutena. What are you trying so hard to keep secret?
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;alpha&stage;4:=confident.png,Hmm... Okay, Alpha, can you do... Born to be Free, by X Japan?
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;1:=calm.png,Hmm... Well, it's nice to have such a powerful Oracle here with me today! Let's keep an eye out for the akuma, shall we?
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;6:=confident.png,Huh, so that’s your secret! I have a weird feeling about Cat Noir right now…
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;2:=wink.png,I <i>may</i> have fantasized about it. Just a bit.
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;morrigan&stage;1:=confident.png,I guess I'll just have to wait and see!
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;2:=alarmed.png,I just wanted to let you know that it's nice to see, you know, someone who's similar to me go so far. You're a big hero to me. E-even though, you know, we're at this game.
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;2:=alarmed.png,It's-- I mean, most of the people around me in Paris. Um. Come from a different type of background. But you're a hero worldwide, so you, you know?
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;1:=calm.png,I kind of have to rely on my Miraculous for most of my powers... I'd like to think I'm pretty athletic, but you're next level!
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;1:=wink.png,I may not be the strongest woman in the world, but I'm actually a pretty good fighter, Chun-li!
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;1:=confident.png,I may be an art student, but that doesn’t mean I’m not clever, Annie! Let's see what you've got!
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;1:=excited.png,I mean, I have some friends that say I’m pretty quirky… oh! I get it. Superpowers are called Quirks where you’re from, aren’t they?
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;2:=wink.png,I much prefer ribbons to keep my hair back, but hairbands can definitely be more fashionable for long hair like yours.
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;jane&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,I was about to say...
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;daisy&stage;2:=wink.png,I’d love to try yours, but I’m a one-set kind of girl.
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;1:=excited.png,I’m glad you don’t get too caught up in your worries, Nagisa!
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,It’s just the first round, Nagisa. Don’t worry! E-er, as in  no reason to get down! Not that you’ll--Erk.
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;chiaki&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,If so, do you have any particular trophy or device you like to play games with? Just curious, in case I have to free you from Hawk Moth.
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;1:=confident.png,If you ever visit Paris, I'm sure we'd have a great time!
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,I-I have to admit, I feel really bad that you didn't choose to be here...
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;mercy&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,I-I mean they’re pretty wonderful too, just looking at you. Not you specifically, I mean generally, but you’re nice too, I’m just going to stop now.
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:=alarmed.png,I-I mean your panties looked fretty passionable to me-- O-oh erm. Pretty fashionable. A-and you were talking about your shoes. Erk. O-okay then.
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:=alarmed.png,I thought those panties looked fretty passionable though! I-I mean, um. Pretty fashionable. W-wait, you were talking about your shoes?
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;lyn&stage;5:=alarmed.png,I-I mean, your taste in fashion. Not... you know…
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,I-it was a pretty bandana, anyway...
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,You're really quite foxy, Elaine!
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;dawn&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,I-It’s either already steamy or already chilly, Dawn. I’m not sure which.
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;2:=excited.png,I'm just happy you're having a good time! It would be a shame if you were the one the akuma was targeting!
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;1:=wink.png,I'm kind of a dork with how into pink I actually am. I bet you'd look really good in it too! Though your tie matched your glasses and eyes in a really cool way!
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;1:=wink.png,I'm kind of interested to see what you'd look like with a nice fluffy scarf. It's doesn't match as well as your tie, but I bet it'd be really comforting.
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;sharla&stage;1:=confident.png,I'm sure I'll figure it out.
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;videl&stage;1:=wink.png,It’s good to see you have an honorable spirit about you. You’re definitely not like Chloe.
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;1&saidmarker;fled:=confident.png,Ladybug is here to keep you safe, Florina! Don’t get too worried!
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;1&saidmarker;fled:=confused.png,I… Hm… You know, I never really considered the option of running away.
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;2:=wink.png,Maybe you can show me more later! I mean, of your magic! N-not, but if you wanted to... Um!
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,Natsuki, being a woman is about being proud of who you are and the things you like. If ~player~ is the right person for you, they'll just appreciate you more! Um. The personality. Less the encroaching nudity...
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;red&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,N-no?
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,No? Hmm… Shantae, you just sound really familiar…
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;1:=excited.png,No…? Weird, I had a feeling… Let me try again…
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;spooky&stage;1:=wink.png,Of course. And you’re definitely not the cute type of ghost, Spooky. Just the scary kind.
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;spooky&stage;1:=excited.png,Of course Spooky! We all know better than to toy with spirits. Er. I at least hope we do.
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;3:=excited.png,Oh! It’s magic too? And fine gold? It’s a little gaudy, to be honest, but if it keeps people safe!
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,W-well normally I’d say it’s how you present yourself, but I think it’d be rude to say a goddess’s… Assets aren’t something heavenly!
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;amy_rose&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Oh! It's not a Miraculous. You're just like this!
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2c:=confident.png,Oh! Well. That was kind of weird, but at least you're in normal clothes now...
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;kim&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,Oh, I definitely would--Um. Is what someone who found you cute would say.
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;kim&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,Oh! Well if you’re offering--Um. I know magic, Kim! And that’s not a real place!
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;april&stage;1:=bored.png,Oh. Not anymore, huh? Well, the jumpsuit looks nice...
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;4&saidmarker;dizzy:=alarmed.png,O-oh no! Shimakaze, be safe! Do I need to call you a doctor? Or... er... a mechanic, I suppose?
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;2:=bored.png,O-oh. It was a joke. W-well, maybe that's a profession you should follow-up on, Daria?
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;mei&stage;2:=calm.png,Or maybe that was Li-Meng, the wizard? Either way, it's exciting to see you here!
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;1:=confused.png,Repairs? Ash? A-are you okay? You seem awfully resilient to harm... but... er... I'm confused now.
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;seven&stage;1:=excited.png,Seven, I think you’d be cute just wearing that badge. And I think a lot of people would feel the same way.
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,S-so, just stay confident, okay!
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;1:=confident.png,That’s the spirit, Florina! Be brave!
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;1:=wink.png,You did! Sorry you lost, but… Good job staying in the game!
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pearl&stage;1:=excited.png,This is going to be a lot more interesting than I thought! I-I mean, not you specifically Pearl b-but...
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3:=bored.png,This seems awfully familiar...
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;launch&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Um... I don't quite know who you are, but I think putting the gun away is a good idea.
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,U-um. You’re good at games, right, Blackrose? Let’s just keep playing, don’t get down!
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,I have to say, I don’t know what a GP is. But wherever you’re from, the style is very special!
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;1:=confident.png,Well! You seem like you're having fun!
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Well, I guess we don't have to worry about that tonight...
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;2:=wink.png,Well... your outfit's so cute and while you may be a little... different, I'll go with it for now!
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Um... well, let's see, I suppose.
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;arwen&stage;1:=calm.png,What brings you to a game like this, I wonder? Y-you know, from your storybook? Magic is such an interesting thing...
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;other&character;cammy&stage;3:=calm.png,Wow! She's amazing! Um. I tope hey--hope they don't keep taking off her clothes though...
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;cammy&stage;2:=confident.png,Wow! You handled yourself so well, Cammy. Guess it's a good thing I didn't need to use my yo-yo, huh?
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;alpha&stage;1:=confident.png,Wow! You're super animated too! You're awesome, Alpha!
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,W-wait a second! You aren't supposed to transform as part of a loss! O-or-- D-did I play this wrong?
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2:=alarmed.png,W-wait! Again!? Y-you have to be using an akuma! I can't transform more than once... And definitely not in such weird ways!
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2:=alarmed.png,S-shoot! You are using some kind of evil magic! A-and er. I haven't fed Tikki yet, so this might be a while before I can fix this...
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;other&character;kimberly&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,W-well, I-I can hardly blame you. To keep your hair nice. I mean. I tend to like cute, low maintainance stuff.
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4a:=alarmed.png,W-what? What is this? M-my earrings are still attached so at least...
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4a:=alarmed.png,I-I what!? H-how did you? W-what kind of akuma trickery is this!?
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4a:=confused.png,E-excuse you!? How <i>dare</i> you copy my costume, Vriska! This is <i>far</i> worse than Chloe that one time!
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;morrigan&stage;2:=confused.png,W-w-wait!? Where'd all the bats come from!?
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;3:=confident.png,You are <i>quite</i> strange, Daria. But in a very likable way! I can see us being great friends!
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;3:,marker:coldfloor=confident.png,You did say you were worried about the floor being cold...It’s okay to be a warm person but sensitive to cold. You dress well for all environments!
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;3:=excited.png,I’m sure you have lots of other clothes, but if you wanted to go shopping after this, Nagisa, I’m sure we could find something cute!
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;alpha&stage;3:=confident.png,You know, I did do a cover... Of the artistic variety! I'm not a great singer... For Jagged Stone. Maybe I could do one for you too?
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;2:=confused.png,You sound <i>so</i> familiar! I can’t quite pin down why!
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;1:=bored.png,Your attitude is really bad. Hawk Moth will Akumatize you in no time if you keep being rude.
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,S-sorry, GoGo. I don't know why I'm being so mean... You're being more than a little rude, though...
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;1:=alarmed.png,K-kinky? J-just because I have a very form fitting costume and a-- You know what, let's not follow this line of thought.
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;1:=alarmed.png,Y-you're beautiful in your own way, Daria, y-yut boo-- but you don't resemble him!
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&stage;5:,count-role;other&character;weiss:=alarmed.png,A doll? Weiss, <i>please</i> don’t make this any weirder.
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;ann:=wink.png,A-Ann, do you know anything about big cats like that? Because there's a lot of... cats here...
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;alice:=embarrassed.png,Alice, do you think she means pounds? She doesn’t seem to mean Euro or francs…
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;boundaries:,count-role;other&character;zoey:,marker:boundaries=wink.png,Don’t worry, Zoey, I think everyone’s being very accepting of other’s boundaries. That makes for a good game, right?
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;daria:=embarrassed.png,Er. Nothing! Uravity! Wust jut wou yer... um... j-just what you were saying! About debris. And stuff.
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3b:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=alarmed.png,G-gah! I really hope you just aren't copying people's outfits, Vriska! W-wait, a-are you going to be as lewd as Zone-tan now!?
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;weiss:=confused.png,GP? Does she mean Lien, like you have over in Vale?
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;meia:,count-role;self&saidmarker;corrin_meia_hair:=wink.png,He certainly manages to make a woman’s hairstyle work, <i>oui</i>, Meia?
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;4:,count-role;other&character;corrin_f:=confident.png,Hmm...Palutena, Corrin might use the most tactical choice, but fashion requires a certain economy. I’d be happy to help, as a hero to a goddess of heroes.
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;gwen:=wink.png,I think the fantasy is a little better than reality, but the reality isn’t bad. In moderation.
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;daria:=excited.png,I'm glad you think so, Daria! I think Uravity and Ladybug would make a great team!
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;4:,count-role;other&character;sei:=embarrassed.png,Just fiven that your stuff is gorn fitting, I mean form fitting! Given form fitting! Erk. Both of you… Belts, right?
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;rinkah:=embarrassed.png,N-no? Oh. I seem...You just look...I promise I didn’t mean to imply--
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;sharla&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;shazza:=bored.png,No, Shazza is the blonde Australian... Hm... I'm sorry, I keep forgetting your name.
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3a:,count-role;other&character;ruby:=embarrassed.png,This seems awfully familiar... Like something Ruby might wear... Oh no! You aren't copying people's outfits, are you!?
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;ann:=wink.png,Though I think an elegant coat or something like that would be something to see too, wouldn’t you agree Ann?
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;futaba:=wink.png,Though I think an elegant coat or something like that would be something to see too, wouldn’t you agree Futaba?
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;jane&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;moon&stage;1-10:=embarrassed.png,Though I wouldn’t expect you to mimic her for anything else, I thought maybe Moon might have a trick to pull off that zipless undressing!

-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;jane&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;twilight&stage;1-10:=embarrassed.png,Twilight has, um, however, disregarded normal social conventions. So if you wanted to, Jane, you definitely could?
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;tracer:=embarrassed.png,Um. Did you mean a GBP? I think Tracer knows about that.

-1-male_removing_accessory=bored.png,Boring.
-1-male_removing_accessory=excited.png,Now I’m thinking of you using your ~clothing~ to play with yourself.
-1-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,But why would it be black? Your skin's so pale-- <i>Oh. The weapon.</i>
-1-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;3:=wink.png,E-er, I misspoke, I really <i>did</i> mean your… Um… Gear…
-1-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;0:=bored.png,E-er, unless you actually have wings? Are you some kind of...
-1-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;corrin_m&stage;0:=calm.png,Hmm... how very stylish, Corrin!
-1-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,I mean, you can kinda see me right here, right?
-1-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;1:=confident.png,I-It might be a bit bold of me, but…
-1-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;1:=confident.png,Oh! A sash! Very Roman of you! Are you dressed up like some kind of war god? Oh, that's a cool motif for sure!
-1-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;corrin_m&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,You're very gentle, Corrin...
-1-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;0:,count-role;other&character;palutena:=confused.png,(I could learn a lot from how Palutena pushes Pit! Maybe even Cat Noir would listen...)
-1-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;palutena:=wink.png,I can't tell if you're flirting with him or not, Palutena... Isn't Hades super scary, Pit?
-1-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;weiss:=bored.png,Really Weiss? Beautiful skin? Can you even handle sunlight? Ugh. You are <i>frustratingly</i> hard to advocate for.
-1-male_removed_accessory=confused.png,Still boring, just stickier. I mean damper. Marinette, get ahold of yourself.
-1-male_removed_accessory=alarmed.png,N-not that you should, or I want you too.  I can’t believe I just said that.
-1-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;1:=alarmed.png,A-and it's not like you'd... um... need protection with me-- <i>from</i> me! O-oh god...
-1-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;2:=alarmed.png,E-er, forget that. Or don't. Um. I'm n-not... Erk...! (Shut <i>up</i> Marinette! Come on!)
-1-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;corrin_m&stage;2:=bored.png,I like that in men. Just not married ones.
-1-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;2:=alarmed.png,I-I’ll admit that I wouldn’t mind feeling those big strong hands on… Well… Um. Y-you know, this was a bad idea, <i>e-excusez moi.</i>
-1-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;4:=alarmed.png,It’s like my whole body is blushing and I’m going to go die of embarrassment now.
-1-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;2:=excited.png,Pit, could I actually see that? I could definitely use this to design something cool! You have good fashion sense!
-1-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;1:=wink.png,Well, whatever you are, you look like you're going to be fun to play with! In this game! Not- um. Hi!
-1-male_removed_accessory,count-role;other&character;d.va&stage;3:=wink.png,You know, I like to incorporate my signatures into my designs, but I, um. Usually do outerwear.
-1-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;corrin_m&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,You remind me... kind of about a boy I know...
-1-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;palutena:=confident.png,I guess you help put the Pal in Palutena, huh, Pit?
-1-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;palutena:=alarmed.png,W-wait, did you bring a firearm in here? I don't see your guns, Pit. Please tell me this isn't divine magic invisibility!
-1-male_removed_accessory,count-palutena:1,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;aimee:=alarmed.png,W-wait, you snuck a gun in here? Please let's not.
-1-female_removing_accessory=confused.png,Boring.
-1-female_removing_accessory=calm.png,Now I’m thinking of you using your ~clothing~ to play with yourself.
-1-female_removing_accessory=wink.png,I figured since you go to a school for heroes, all of us can give you some extra insight!
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;1:=confident.png,<i>Ils pillent toujours le cul!</i>
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;other&character;elizabeth&stage;3:=wink.png,A lady has to have her secrets, <i>oui</i>?
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;dark_magician_girl&stage;1:=confident.png,A lucky necklace? Well, it's lucky I got to meet you today, Dark Magician Girl!
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch&stage;0:=confident.png,Agreed. Capes aren’t quite as good as a heavy cloak. But there’s something debonair about it!
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;0:=wink.png,Ah! I'm glad you picked that trick up from me.
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Ah, <i>zut</i>, the purple hair made me imagine…
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;lyn&stage;4:=excited.png,All of your things are so finely made, I could learn a lot based on your taste!
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;zizou&stage;0:=excited.png,And your hair does look pretty! It’s a very cool texture and color.
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;0:=confused.png,Are you really a pink-haired woman with butterfly wings?
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sharla&stage;0:=bored.png,Are you... wait... no... that's not right...
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1a:=wink.png,At least that was a cool outfit. Definitely not stolen. *Cough* Pot *cough* meet *cough* kettle *cough*.
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2c:=embarrassed.png,At least you finally settled on some casualwear... Why are you transforming again?
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;2:=confident.png,At least you have two rounds of small stuff left!
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;3:=confident.png,Belts? Oh! You’re rocking the “many belts” look. Befitting of a goddess.
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;3:=wink.png,Why limit yourself to conventional aesthetics, Palutena?
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;buffy&stage;3:=bored.png,Buffy, you shouldn't so easily part with objects of fate...
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,But I don’t think they really know this much…
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;3:=confused.png,But you <i>are</i> really cute.
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;cammy&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Cammy! S-shoot! Here I go--
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;0:=confident.png,Costume aside, I'm more of a fan of pink than red. A pink ladybug would look kind of weird, don't you think?
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;2:=wink.png,D.Va, could you sign my friend Nino’s album? He’s a big fan!
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;2:=wink.png,Lucio is pretty good for electronica… I’m more of a Jagged Stone girl, myself.
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;1:=confident.png,Don’t be so hard on yourself! Dealing with spirits is really challenging, and you do that really well!
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;1:=wink.png,Sometimes you lose a few hands, Sheena. Don’t worry. I’ll make sure you stay safe. From one spirit person to another.
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2b:=embarrassed.png,E-er, I'm <i>definitely</i> not into the whole maid thing, so I'm hoping whatever comes next is... A bit better.
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;1:=confused.png,Er. I can owl you chocolate-- call you Ochako, right?
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;revy&stage;0:=bored.png,Er... won't you at least part with your guns...?
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;1:=bored.png,Fortunately, um, it looks like you don't really need to rewind since it's just your sandals...
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;2:=wink.png,Gracious of you to include the part actually keeping that on, Palutena.
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;2:=confident.png,Third time’s the charm, it just doesn’t seem to be a lucky one for you.
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;0:=alarmed.png,H-hey! What are you doing!? Are you copying my Miraculous?
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,What magic is this?! Did you have a Miraculous this whole time!?
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;0:=confident.png,Whoa! You're going to detransform too right--
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;0:=bored.png,Hm… Are you a swordswoman seeking redemption? Maybe you have a broken sword of some sort?
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;0:=calm.png,Hmm... Yeah, that's a good question. It's not like my costume really ever gets damaged...
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;launch&stage;1:=confused.png,Huh? What? Where'd... Is this... did I de-Akumatize Launch or something?
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;0:=wink.png,I bet we’re going to have a lot of fun tonight.
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;2:=confident.png,I don’t want another Rogercop. It looks like you’re almost pre-loaded for that kind of thing…
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;1:=confused.png,I just can't stop geeking out over you! You're an awesome fighter, you're an acclaimed interpol agent--!
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;morrigan&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,I know an Akumatized person when I see one... But I'm not sure I can see an accessory...
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;arwen&stage;0:=confident.png,I never thought I'd actually meet you, but you did so much during the War of the Ring!
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;amy_rose&stage;0:=bored.png,I suppose it could be a ring...
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;red&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,I think this is, a, um. Bad idea. My yo-yo doesn’t count!
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;videl&stage;0:=confident.png,I’m glad to see the senzu bean grows far from the vine, Videl!
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;1:=alarmed.png,I’m guessing it is. I don’t really think I’d be into <i>that</i> kind of thing.
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;2:=confident.png,I’ve never seen a bunny miraculous, and it would explain your awesome reflexes! Just not at cards.
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;2:=confused.png,If your angst didn’t turn you into a villain, that is.
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,W-wait, are there people that are into <i>feet</i>!?
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;ann&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,I-I mean, they have a bakery and I think you'd like something sweet.
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;0:=confused.png,I'm... not sure what a waifu is. Like a crush? Oh! Like a crush. No he's-- er...
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;0:=excited.png,In Japan, you have multiple pairs of shoes for school, for your house, and outside, right? That must be nice to have so many opportunities to express yourself!
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;0:=confident.png,They’re nice shoes, Nagisa! The style seems maybe a year or two out of date, though.
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;jane&stage;0:=calm.png,It’s definitely well loved and tailored. I can tell you care a lot about it.
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;mei&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,I've actually heard a lot about you! How you got lost in a Blizzard once...
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;korra&stage;3:=calm.png,Korra, I can understand being insecure…
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;0:=wink.png,Like what? Being sassy and obnoxious?
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;0:=wink.png,Such as what? A weak sense of style and a weaker sense of honor?
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2a:=wink.png,Looks like you've been plundered, Vriska.
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;mercy&stage;1:=calm.png,Mercy, Switzerland has lots of things I find super interesting. The fashion, the languages, and the baking are all wonderful! And the people...
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;revy&stage;1:=confused.png,N-no...? Er... I've yet to solve a problem that needed a gun...
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;weiss&stage;1:=wink.png,Not all wealth is material, Weiss.
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;other&character;cammy&stage;2:=confused.png,Oh no! She's getting attacked again! Here, let me help--
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;0:=alarmed.png,Oh! A <i>choker.</i> Urk, still, no thanks.
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;daisy&stage;1:=excited.png,Oh! Those are cute earrings, Daisy! They match your outfit just like mine!
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;0:=wink.png,Oh! Your French is coming along well, Elizabeth. You have a wonderful accent!
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;0:=confident.png,Oh! Your shoes and socks at the same time! I was worried over nothing. You're pretty brave, aren't you?
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,O-oh, sorry. I can look away if you’d like?
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;2:=alarmed.png,Oh! I’m sorry, Nagisa. It’s just a very cool jacket!
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,O-oh. Daria <i>c'est une dominatrice.</i> That makes sense.
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;chiaki&stage;0:=confident.png,Or do you just seem a little... bored? I really hope it’s boredom rather than stress!
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1b:=confident.png,Say, Futaba, is Vriska's outfit like that Tron movie? Could you help me out with this?
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kimberly:=bored.png,Say, I have to ask, from one suit-wearing hero to another, where does your stuff <i>go</i> while you're transformed?
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;neo&stage;1:=excited.png,So Neopolitan like the ice cream... and you’re short. Oh you’re pint-sized! I get it!
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3:=calm.png,So, what'll it be <i>this</i> time, Vriska? Some sort of "goddess of <i>luck</i>" outfit?
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3:=calm.png,So, what'll it be <i>this</i> time, Vriska? Some sort of "wandering martial artist" look?
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;spooky&stage;0:=alarmed.png,Spooky? Give me the knife, please. Let’s put away our weapons.
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;2:=confident.png,That famous fashion company some girl managed to destroy?
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;dark_magician_girl&stage;0:=confident.png,That hat was so cute though! It's <i>tres</i> stylish. Where'd you get it?
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;3:=alarmed.png,That lets him give people superpowers but also brings out their worst feelings.
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;jane&stage;1:=confused.png,That seems… Very difficult, Jane.
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,That’s not nice, Hana! Everyone starts somewhere… And bad behavior will just get you banned. Or Akumatized. Let’s hope the former.
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;0:=confident.png,That’s super cool! Do you have a Miraculous or is this kind of power innate to you?
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyoko&stage;0:=wink.png,The gloves are especially classy touch.
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;0:=excited.png,They say you can stand up to any challenge, no matter however demanding, and that your courage is amazing and…
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;1:=confident.png,Those boots look really well worn, Blackrose! Were they expensive? They seem well-loved!
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;1:=confident.png,Wow! I bet you’ve kicked a lot of butt with those. Figurative and otherwise!
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1c:=wink.png,Though maybe you have the Lion Miraculous, given how overconfident and prideful you're acting.
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;0:=bored.png,Though um, based on your ears, you're not really from around France, are you?
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,Um. Do those bracelets really weigh 8kg each, Chun-li?
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;0:=confident.png,Those bracelets of yours have to be <i>amazing</i> for training, Chun-li!
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;red&stage;2:=wink.png,Um. Exposed. Maybe it’s time for you to put away that sword?
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;0:=confused.png,Um. I don't mean to be critical, but the belts for your belts look is a bit too recent to be vintage...
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,U-uhm. Are you sober enough to be playing, Sei? I'd hate for you to regret this.
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;april&stage;0:=excited.png,Wait, didn't you used to have magic ninja bracelets? Like a Miraculous of some sort?
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nugi-chan&stage;0:=confused.png,Webmaster? Have I fought that villain before…?
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;1:=confident.png,Well, considering some of the others we’re playing with, I suppose I can trust in that.
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kimberly&stage;0:=wink.png,Well, my Miraculous has a guardian spirit. Her name is Tikki, but even if you can't see her, she's right here...
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;alpha&stage;0:=excited.png,Well, you are a really good singer... Can you play Wonderwall?
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;pearl&stage;0:=alarmed.png,Whoa! I'm the only one who's supposed to transform!
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;1:=alarmed.png,W-wait, your stockings? Annie! You’re flashing everyone! C-come on!
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,W-well, it's nice to see you like pink stuff too, Saki. B-but you're-- you're flashing us!
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;0:=alarmed.png,W-what? A-are you okay?! Someone get a fire extinguisher!
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;weiss&stage;0:=confused.png,Yes, Weiss. We know how rich you are. Your father owns a hotel and is a mayor or something, blah blah blah…
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;0:=confident.png,You are well adorned! Both in accessories and otherwise.
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;0:=wink.png,Those are really cool armbands. I’m glad my costume normally works as armor, though. That seems a lot heavier. It’s such a relief to see you lose them, though.
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;0:,marker:blake_crush=bored.png,You know Blake, there’s something about you I can’t put my finger in…
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Your rudders... I'm not sure if you've been Akumatized, or this is a Miraculous, or something stranger...
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Oh no, not <i>again!</i> Shimakaze, are you okay?
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;3:=alarmed.png,Y-you know, maybe this can wait until after the game. Don't you use card-like seals? You're a bit... behind right now.
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;1:=confused.png,Y-you're a princess wearing sandals? Doesn't that seem to be a bit... ?

-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;jane&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;amalia&stage;4-9:=confident.png,Amalia did show us how to be clever with attire, so I shouldn’t discount anything you have hidden up your sleeve! Or… Erk, pants.
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;weiss&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;blake:=bored.png,Blake, is Weiss always this… Bourgeois?
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;0:,count-role;other&character;red:=embarrassed.png,Costume aside, I'm more of a fan of pink than red. E-er. N-not the Red here, I mean like the color! Kind of like Red's red hair!
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;0:,count-role;other&character;daria:=embarrassed.png,Godzilla? Oh, if it's a big enemy, I'd probably try to evacuate an area, then figure out what part of him was Akumatized.
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose:,count-role;other&character;elizabeth&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,Hm...You and Elizabeth seem to have a lot of sentimental value for your necklaces, Blackrose. You also must have gotten yours from someone important, huh?
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1b:,count-role;other&character;futaba:=excited.png,I mean <i>Alya</i> got Akumatized into a cyber-villain. If I could save her, beating you--er, saving you--should be easy!
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;5:,count-role;other&character;yang:=wink.png,If the two of you aren’t open about this, you really should be! It’s too cute! O-oh. Your ears are… <i>That’s</i> your secret?
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;0:,count-role;self&saidmarker;elaine_puns:=bored.png,It feels like Cat Noir is here, and not in a good way.
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;0:,count-role;other&character;rinkah:=confident.png,Oh! Rinkah and Blackrose, are you from the same place?
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;3:,count-role;other&character;sei:=excited.png,Oh! You and Sei have something in common, with all of your belts. I’m surprised, given that they don’t seem to be keeping anything loose down.
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sharla&stage;0:,count-role;other&character;shazza:=embarrassed.png,Oh! You're Shazza, right! W-wait...
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;daria:=confused.png,Oh, don't be rude, Daria! I'm sure what Ochako does on her knees is-- um... h-her business. (Just play it cool. You can act like nothing was said.)
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;0:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;elaine_puns:=bored.png,That seems a little unfair, Elaine...
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;ryuko:=wink.png,The one that Ryuko has some history with, right?
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;alpha:=embarrassed.png,Um, D.Va, if you asked nicely, I’m sure Alpha would be happy to sing what you were listening to for all of us!
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;3:,count-role;other&character;rinkah:=confused.png,Unless you’ve been Akumatized...Which I hope isn’t the case!
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&saidmarker;strategyguide:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;strategyguide0:,marker:strategyguide0=confused.png,Wait, you’re using a guide for this? It’s... really pretty simple, I thought?
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose:,count-role;other&character;zoey&stage;0-2:=confident.png,What do they say about girls who wear chokers, Zoey?
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;weiss&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;ruby:=bored.png,Yang, is Weiss always like this… Repugnant?
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;weiss&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;yang:=bored.png,Yang, is Weiss always this… Yawn-inducing?

-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;1:=wink.png,I'm kind of a dork with how into pink I actually am. I bet you'd look really good in it too! Though your tie matched your glasses and eyes in a really cool way!
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;1:=wink.png,I'm kind of interested to see what you'd look like with a nice fluffy scarf. It's doesn't match as well as your tie, but I bet it'd be really comforting.
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;sharla&stage;1:=confident.png,I'm sure I'll figure it out.
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;videl&stage;1:=wink.png,It’s good to see you have an honorable spirit about you. You’re definitely not like Chloe.

-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;1&saidmarker;fled:=confused.png,I… Hm… You know, I never really considered the option of running away.
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;2:=wink.png,Maybe you can show me more later! I mean, of your magic! N-not, but if you wanted to... Um!
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,Natsuki, being a woman is about being proud of who you are and the things you like. If ~player~ is the right person for you, they'll just appreciate you more! Um. The personality. Less the encroaching nudity...

-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;1:=excited.png,No…? Weird, I had a feeling… Let me try again…
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;spooky&stage;1:=wink.png,Of course. And you’re definitely not the cute type of ghost, Spooky. Just the scary kind.
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;spooky&stage;1:=excited.png,Of course Spooky! We all know better than to toy with spirits. Er. I at least hope we do.
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;3:=excited.png,Oh! It’s magic too? And fine gold? It’s a little gaudy, to be honest, but if it keeps people safe!
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,W-well normally I’d say it’s how you present yourself, but I think it’d be rude to say a goddess’s… Assets aren’t something heavenly!
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;amy_rose&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Oh! It's not a Miraculous. You're just like this!
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2c:=confident.png,Oh! Well. That was kind of weird, but at least you're in normal clothes now...
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;kim&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,Oh, I definitely would--Um. Is what someone who found you cute would say.
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;kim&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,Oh! Well if you’re offering--Um. I know magic, Kim! And that’s not a real place!
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;april&stage;1:=bored.png,Oh. Not anymore, huh? Well, the jumpsuit looks nice...
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;4&saidmarker;dizzy:=alarmed.png,O-oh no! Shimakaze, be safe! Do I need to call you a doctor? Or... er... a mechanic, I suppose?
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;2:=bored.png,O-oh. It was a joke. W-well, maybe that's a profession you should follow-up on, Daria?
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;mei&stage;2:=calm.png,Or maybe that was Li-Meng, the wizard? Either way, it's exciting to see you here!
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;1:=confused.png,Repairs? Ash? A-are you okay? You seem awfully resilient to harm... but... er... I'm confused now.
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;seven&stage;1:=excited.png,Seven, I think you’d be cute just wearing that badge. And I think a lot of people would feel the same way.
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,S-so, just stay confident, okay!
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;1:=confident.png,That’s the spirit, Florina! Be brave!
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;1:=wink.png,You did! Sorry you lost, but… Good job staying in the game!
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pearl&stage;1:=excited.png,This is going to be a lot more interesting than I thought! I-I mean, not you specifically Pearl b-but...
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3:=bored.png,This seems awfully familiar...
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;launch&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Um... I don't quite know who you are, but I think putting the gun away is a good idea.
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,U-um. You’re good at games, right, Blackrose? Let’s just keep playing, don’t get down!
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,I have to say, I don’t know what a GP is. But wherever you’re from, the style is very special!
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;1:=confident.png,Well! You seem like you're having fun!
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Well, I guess we don't have to worry about that tonight...
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;2:=wink.png,Well... your outfit's so cute and while you may be a little... different, I'll go with it for now!
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Um... well, let's see, I suppose.
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;arwen&stage;1:=calm.png,What brings you to a game like this, I wonder? Y-you know, from your storybook? Magic is such an interesting thing...
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;other&character;cammy&stage;3:=calm.png,Wow! She's amazing! Um. I tope hey--hope they don't keep taking off her clothes though...
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;cammy&stage;2:=confident.png,Wow! You handled yourself so well, Cammy. Guess it's a good thing I didn't need to use my yo-yo, huh?
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;alpha&stage;1:=confident.png,Wow! You're super animated too! You're awesome, Alpha!
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,W-wait a second! You aren't supposed to transform as part of a loss! O-or-- D-did I play this wrong?
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2:=alarmed.png,W-wait! Again!? Y-you have to be using an akuma! I can't transform more than once... And definitely not in such weird ways!
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2:=alarmed.png,S-shoot! You are using some kind of evil magic! A-and er. I haven't fed Tikki yet, so this might be a while before I can fix this...
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;other&character;kimberly&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,W-well, I-I can hardly blame you. To keep your hair nice. I mean. I tend to like cute, low maintainance stuff.
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4a:=alarmed.png,W-what? What is this? M-my earrings are still attached so at least...
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4a:=alarmed.png,I-I what!? H-how did you? W-what kind of akuma trickery is this!?
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4a:=confused.png,E-excuse you!? How <i>dare</i> you copy my costume, Vriska! This is <i>far</i> worse than Chloe that one time!
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;morrigan&stage;2:=confused.png,W-w-wait!? Where'd all the bats come from!?
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;3:=confident.png,You are <i>quite</i> strange, Daria. But in a very likable way! I can see us being great friends!
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;3:,marker:coldfloor=confident.png,You did say you were worried about the floor being cold...It’s okay to be a warm person but sensitive to cold. You dress well for all environments!
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;3:=excited.png,I’m sure you have lots of other clothes, but if you wanted to go shopping after this, Nagisa, I’m sure we could find something cute!
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;alpha&stage;3:=confident.png,You know, I did do a cover... Of the artistic variety! I'm not a great singer... For Jagged Stone. Maybe I could do one for you too?
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;2:=confused.png,You sound <i>so</i> familiar! I can’t quite pin down why!
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;1:=bored.png,Your attitude is really bad. Hawk Moth will Akumatize you in no time if you keep being rude.
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,S-sorry, GoGo. I don't know why I'm being so mean... You're being more than a little rude, though...
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;1:=alarmed.png,K-kinky? J-just because I have a very form fitting costume and a-- You know what, let's not follow this line of thought.
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;1:=alarmed.png,Y-you're beautiful in your own way, Daria, y-yut boo-- but you don't resemble him!
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&stage;5:,count-role;other&character;weiss:=alarmed.png,A doll? Weiss, <i>please</i> don’t make this any weirder.
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;ann:=wink.png,A-Ann, do you know anything about big cats like that? Because there's a lot of... cats here...
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;alice:=embarrassed.png,Alice, do you think she means pounds? She doesn’t seem to mean Euro or francs…
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;boundaries:,count-role;other&character;zoey:,marker:boundaries=wink.png,Don’t worry, Zoey, I think everyone’s being very accepting of other’s boundaries. That makes for a good game, right?
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;daria:=embarrassed.png,Er. Nothing! Uravity! Wust jut wou yer... um... j-just what you were saying! About debris. And stuff.
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3b:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=alarmed.png,G-gah! I really hope you just aren't copying people's outfits, Vriska! W-wait, a-are you going to be as lewd as Zone-tan now!?
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;weiss:=confused.png,GP? Does she mean Lien, like you have over in Vale?
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;meia:,count-role;self&saidmarker;corrin_meia_hair:=wink.png,He certainly manages to make a woman’s hairstyle work, <i>oui</i>, Meia?
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;4:,count-role;other&character;corrin_f:=confident.png,Hmm...Palutena, Corrin might use the most tactical choice, but fashion requires a certain economy. I’d be happy to help, as a hero to a goddess of heroes.
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;gwen:=wink.png,I think the fantasy is a little better than reality, but the reality isn’t bad. In moderation.
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;daria:=excited.png,I'm glad you think so, Daria! I think Uravity and Ladybug would make a great team!
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;4:,count-role;other&character;sei:=embarrassed.png,Just fiven that your stuff is gorn fitting, I mean form fitting! Given form fitting! Erk. Both of you… Belts, right?
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;rinkah:=embarrassed.png,N-no? Oh. I seem...You just look...I promise I didn’t mean to imply--
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;sharla&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;shazza:=bored.png,No, Shazza is the blonde Australian... Hm... I'm sorry, I keep forgetting your name.
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3a:,count-role;other&character;ruby:=embarrassed.png,This seems awfully familiar... Like something Ruby might wear... Oh no! You aren't copying people's outfits, are you!?
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;ann:=wink.png,Though I think an elegant coat or something like that would be something to see too, wouldn’t you agree Ann?
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;futaba:=wink.png,Though I think an elegant coat or something like that would be something to see too, wouldn’t you agree Futaba?
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;jane&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;moon&stage;1-10:=embarrassed.png,Though I wouldn’t expect you to mimic her for anything else, I thought maybe Moon might have a trick to pull off that zipless undressing!
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;jane&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;buffy&stage;5-10:=wink.png,Though, Buffy did already show us how to take her bra off under her clothes...
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;jane&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;twilight&stage;1-10:=embarrassed.png,Twilight has, um, however, disregarded normal social conventions. So if you wanted to, Jane, you definitely could?
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;tracer:=embarrassed.png,Um. Did you mean a GBP? I think Tracer knows about that.
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan:=alarmed.png,Wait, Streaming-chan has a real name? And you know each other? And... <i>my,</i> you have stories.
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;2:,count-role;self&saidmarker;d.va_competition:=wink.png,We'll just have to see h-how the rest goes, don't we, Hana?
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;futaba:,marker:french=bored.png,What was that, Futaba? <i>Grossier.</i>
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;zizou&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;sola:=confident.png,You and Sola know each other, right Zizou? Do all of your friends have such cool hairstyles?
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_mariba&notsaidmarker;saki_befriend_furavity:,count-role;other&character;futaba&saidmarker;saki_befriend_mariba:=alarmed.png,F-Futaba, not like that, like... er... hi, Saki, would you want to hang out with Futaba and I after this?
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_mariba&notsaidmarker;saki_befriend_furavity:,count-role;other&character;futaba&saidmarker;saki_befriend_mariba:=alarmed.png,Futaba, that'll just wake it morse--make it worse! Like this! <i>Saki!</i> Hey! Let's hang out with Futaba after this!
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_ladity&notsaidmarker;saki_befriend_furavity:,count-role;other&character;uravity&saidmarker;saki_befriend_ladity:=wink.png,It's not like I could loan out a Miraculous, but I'm sure Saki would love to talk about what kinds of superpowers she'd like.
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_ladity&notsaidmarker;saki_befriend_furavity:,count-role;other&character;uravity&saidmarker;saki_befriend_ladity:=wink.png,<i>Everyone</i> would love to have a superpower. Saki, if you could have some kind of special ability, what would you want?
-1-female_removed_accessory,priority:500,count-role;target&character;meia&stage;1:,count-role;self&saidmarker;corrins_meia_hair:=confused.png,The… Er. Boy Corrin.
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-medic:1-3,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;4&saidmarker;dizzy:=alarmed.png,O-oh no! Shimakaze, be safe! Can one of the medics here come treat her? She doesn't seem to be having bad feelings, but... a possessed warship would be awful!
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-uravity:1,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_furavity:,count-role;other&character;futaba&stage;2:=excited.png,You're gonna be in great hands with Futaba and Ochako, Saki! Think of this like a girls night out where we talk about boys, and makeup, and um. Getting naked and comfy and stuff!
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-weapon:2,count-weapon:3,count-role;target&character;red&stage;3:=calm.png,What is with you and Aimee and the others and your weapons? You’re so reliant on things beyond your own wits.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:aimee=confident.png,This should be a hint to some of our other companions at the table to part with their weapons.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0=confident.png,This should be a hint to some of our other companions at the table to part with their weapons.

#OPPONENT REMOVING MINOR CLOTHING
#Minor pieces of clothing don't reveal much when removed, but probably indicate more progress than accessory removal.

#fully clothed
0-male_removing_minor=excited.png,You’re removing your ~clothing~, ~name~?
0-male_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_m&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,E-er. Hm. I think I prefer men that are a bit more... masculine.
0-male_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,If I’m being totally honest, I didn’t know you were still active in the hero community... Oh.
0-male_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;3:=wink.png,It's nice that you won't be walking away from the game. (Though you could walk your way into...)
0-male_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Tamokoma Branch? Is that like... your hero organization? The trivia's fine, Jin. Kind of like the rest of you... Er--
0-male_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,The rest of you looks much better. Um. Especially the... Not clothes parts.
0-male_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;2:,marker:cap_cap=embarrassed.png,U-um, er, I mean, Cap. Cap is fine, right?
0-male_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;palutena:=embarrassed.png,Yeah, sandals are a bit... Um. (How do I say they're not attractive without being really mean?)
0-male_removed_minor=embarrassed.png,Well, at least I know you’re not going to be so ashamed Hawk Moth can evilize you.
0-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;3:=alarmed.png,A-anyway, let's keep playing! D-don't pay me too much mind!
0-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;3:=wink.png,I suppose there's something to be said about self-servicing... er... fashion design-wise, anyway.
0-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_m&stage;3:=wink.png,I think you can be gentle without being weak or cowardly. Don't lose the first part, Corrin.
0-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;1:=wink.png,O-oh my. You’re very handsome under that helmet.
0-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;3:=confident.png,Well, <i>Cap,</i> I hope you’ll share those years of experience with someone still getting the hang of it!
0-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;4:=confused.png,What's a Trion body? Is that like... some sort of power manifestation?
0-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;3:,count-role;other&character;palutena:=bored.png,Hmm. (I can't figure these two out! I've known Tikki for a long time, but I'm guessing divine figures are just like this!)
0-female_removing_minor=confused.png,Not very heroic of you...
0-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;sanako&stage;0:=calm.png,(Hmm... she seems oddly familiar...)
0-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;1:=excited.png,<i>Merveilleux! I</i> see what's going on here...
0-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;1:=confused.png,A "soul gem?" Hmm... is that where you store your guardian spirit to transform?
0-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:=alarmed.png,Ahh!!! Could you stop shooting like that!
0-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:=confident.png,It is a pretty impressive skill, at least. But please don't hurt anyone!
0-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;0:=wink.png,Because you look really punk-y!
0-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;april&stage;1:=excited.png,But I don’t know if the turtle miraculous holder likes pizza that much... or sewers. He definitely knows a lot about Ancient China though!
0-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;2:=calm.png,But that’s a good thing. You’re just like Chloe, and you’re so mean I can’t imagine you’d have nice powers.
0-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;2:=alarmed.png,F-flooding? <i>D-de l'eau dans vos chaussette?</i> Um... I-is this a euphemism?
0-female_removing_minor,count-role;other&character;zoey&stage;2:=alarmed.png,HBO? Wait, this isn’t on TV? W-wait, HBO has things like this on it?
0-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;2:=calm.png,Hmm... Well, I guess there's other types of heroes out there... other types of girls with magic too, I suppose!
0-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kimberly&stage;2:=wink.png,I guess if it's strip poker, more layers would help... but I thought for sure it'd just be a sweatshirt, to fit in with your aesthetic!
0-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;1:=bored.png,I never really understood the appeal of thongs.
0-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;1:=wink.png,Sandals seem… Attire appropriate.
0-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;3:=calm.png,I think long gloves add a touch of class.
0-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;1:=wink.png,I’m glad you’re having fun!
0-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;1:=excited.png,It’s great playing with you too, Nagisa!
0-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;ann&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,I-I mean, someone I know. She's seen so many your shoots!
0-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;2:=alarmed.png,I-I’m excited to see more!
0-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;sayori&stage;0:=calm.png,I'm glad Sayori is so excitable! Even if she's a bit spacy.
0-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;2:=excited.png,Jeez, ~player~, have you considered asking Natsuki on a date, or what?
0-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;2&saidmarker;socks:=embarrassed.png,Kyu wait! I'll take off something just so you don't have to if you'll---
0-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;pearl&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Not in a bad way, just in a way that seems enchanted.
0-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;weiss&stage;2:=wink.png,Not that anyone here seems to care about your money but you.
0-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;4:=wink.png,Of course, Palutena, I’m here to win too! (And at this point it looks like we’re having more fun than worry. Palutena does these asides too, so that’s okay for me, right?)
0-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;4:=wink.png,Not that you really need me to, but I won’t let you fall under the akuma’s power!
0-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:=wink.png,Oh! Is this what people mean when say they want to shoot all over me? Is this just how some people undress in those old Western movies? ?
0-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;juri&stage;1:=confused.png,Oh! Your gloves! Here I was thinking you'd take off your hairties or something.
0-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kyoko&stage;5:=bored.png,Oh, Kyoko…
0-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;2:=bored.png,Oh.
0-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;dark_magician_girl&stage;2:=alarmed.png,O-oh. I-is that so? Hm.
0-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:=confident.png,O-Okay. I'll go ahead and hope you know how to use... Whatever skill you're using.
0-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,So given how things are going, maybe I should kiss you for luck?
0-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;2:=confused.png,Speaking of relief, do you have another set of underwear to keep you in the game, Kyu? It’s…
0-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika:=wink.png,The bad guys better watch out!
0-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;2:=wink.png,This whole thing's a little awkward but let’s try to stay calm and collected, okay?
0-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;2:=alarmed.png,Um. I can't say I've ever had to worry about it. Sometimes afterwards, but never during! I guess it's a side effect of my Miraculous?
0-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;0:=calm.png,Those actually look really well made! I'm not one for armor, but it's nice to see you care about more than durability.

1-male_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;palutena:=embarrassed.png,Yeah, sandals are a bit... Um. (How do I say they're not attractive without being really mean?)
1-male_removed_minor=embarrassed.png,You see a lot of strange things being a superhero... Nothing as odd as in this game.
1-male_removed_minor=confident.png,It’s hard to be creative under pressure, huh, ~name~?
1-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;3:=alarmed.png,A-anyway, let's keep playing! D-don't pay me too much mind!
1-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;3:=wink.png,I suppose there's something to be said about self-servicing... er... fashion design-wise, anyway.
1-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_m&stage;3:=wink.png,I think you can be gentle without being weak or cowardly. Don't lose the first part, Corrin.
1-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;1:=wink.png,O-oh my. You’re very handsome under that helmet.
1-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;3:=confident.png,Well, <i>Cap,</i> I hope you’ll share those years of experience with someone still getting the hang of it!
1-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;4:=confused.png,What's a Trion body? Is that like... some sort of power manifestation?
1-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;3:,count-role;other&character;palutena:=bored.png,Hmm. (I can't figure these two out! I've known Tikki for a long time, but I'm guessing divine figures are just like this!)
1-female_removing_minor=confident.png,You have cute ~clothing~! Or a cute one. English isn’t my first language, after all...
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;sanako&stage;0:=calm.png,(Hmm... she seems oddly familiar...)
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;1:=excited.png,<i>Merveilleux! I</i> see what's going on here...
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;1:=confused.png,A "soul gem?" Hmm... is that where you store your guardian spirit to transform?
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:=alarmed.png,Ahh!!! Could you stop shooting like that!
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:=confident.png,It is a pretty impressive skill, at least. But please don't hurt anyone!
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;0:=wink.png,Because you look really punk-y!
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;april&stage;1:=excited.png,But I don’t know if the turtle miraculous holder likes pizza that much... or sewers. He definitely knows a lot about Ancient China though!
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;2:=calm.png,But that’s a good thing. You’re just like Chloe, and you’re so mean I can’t imagine you’d have nice powers.
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;2:=alarmed.png,F-flooding? <i>D-de l'eau dans vos chaussette?</i> Um... I-is this a euphemism?
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;other&character;zoey&stage;2:=alarmed.png,HBO? Wait, this isn’t on TV? W-wait, HBO has things like this on it?
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;2:=calm.png,Hmm... Well, I guess there's other types of heroes out there... other types of girls with magic too, I suppose!
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kimberly&stage;2:=wink.png,I guess if it's strip poker, more layers would help... but I thought for sure it'd just be a sweatshirt, to fit in with your aesthetic!
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;1:=bored.png,I never really understood the appeal of thongs.
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;1:=wink.png,Sandals seem… Attire appropriate.
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;3:=calm.png,I think long gloves add a touch of class.
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;1:=wink.png,I’m glad you’re having fun!
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;1:=excited.png,It’s great playing with you too, Nagisa!
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;ann&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,I-I mean, someone I know. She's seen so many your shoots!
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;2:=alarmed.png,I-I’m excited to see more!
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;sayori&stage;0:=calm.png,I'm glad Sayori is so excitable! Even if she's a bit spacy.
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;2:=excited.png,Jeez, ~player~, have you considered asking Natsuki on a date, or what?
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;2&saidmarker;socks:=embarrassed.png,Kyu wait! I'll take off something just so you don't have to if you'll---
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;pearl&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Not in a bad way, just in a way that seems enchanted.
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;weiss&stage;2:=wink.png,Not that anyone here seems to care about your money but you.
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;4:=wink.png,Of course, Palutena, I’m here to win too! (And at this point it looks like we’re having more fun than worry. Palutena does these asides too, so that’s okay for me, right?)
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;4:=wink.png,Not that you really need me to, but I won’t let you fall under the akuma’s power!
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:=wink.png,Oh! Is this what people mean when they say they want to shoot all over me? Is this just how some people undress in those old Western movies? ?
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;juri&stage;1:=confused.png,Oh! Your gloves! Here I was thinking you'd take off your hairties or something.
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kyoko&stage;5:=bored.png,Oh, Kyoko…
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;2:=bored.png,Oh.
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;dark_magician_girl&stage;2:=alarmed.png,O-oh. I-is that so? Hm.
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:=confident.png,O-Okay. I'll go ahead and hope you know how to use... Whatever skill you're using.
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,So given how things are going, maybe I should kiss you for luck?
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;2:=confused.png,Speaking of relief, do you have another set of underwear to keep you in the game, Kyu? It’s…
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika:=wink.png,The bad guys better watch out!
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;2:=wink.png,This whole thing's a little awkward but let’s try to stay calm and collected, okay?
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;2:=alarmed.png,Um. I can't say I've ever had to worry about it. Sometimes afterwards, but never during! I guess it's a side effect of my Miraculous?
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;0:=calm.png,Those actually look really well made! I'm not one for armor, but it's nice to see you care about more than durability.
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;0:=excited.png,Wow, Corrin, those look really stylish and actually durable!
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Though... I haven't really seen a Miraculous compartmentalize like this...
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;3:=alarmed.png,Um, but. I, er. Spinning bird kick. Can you teach it to me?
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:=confused.png,Um. If you even want to take off your shoes... er... which you halready lave-- already have! Y-you risk showing your-- um. You know.
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:=bored.png,I-I guess you've already shown your underwear on accident-- um, is that the wrong thing to say?!
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;other&character;zone-tan&stage;2:,marker:ztentacles=alarmed.png,Um. People can enjoy sex however they want, Zone-tan, but I think most people prefer not to have their wardrobes damaged in the process!
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;chica&stage;0:=alarmed.png,W-wait, that’s the one with the possessed animatronics! I have to free Chica from the Akuma, now!
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;shego&stage;0:=confident.png,You may not use an akuma, but I'll stop you anyway!
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;2:=alarmed.png,Y-your... Husband? D-does he know you're at a game like this!?
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;2:=alarmed.png,I-I would never come here if I had a partner at home!
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=alarmed.png,Don’t encourage her, Zone! You don’t have some big amorphous blob that can shield us with tentacles!
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;florina:=embarrassed.png,Er, I meant--You know, morally. Not...Mortally. Erk.
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;futaba:=embarrassed.png,Er. We're not-- I'm not-- I mean, she's really pretty but--! I mean I would be <i>interested</i>
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;4:,count-role;other&character;shego:=confident.png,Er… I’m not going to go easy on you, Palutena, but I think Shego is a bigger problem if we don’t stop her now.
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kim&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;shego:=embarrassed.png,I-I mean, relationship as in friendship or rivalship?
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;ayano:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_stripping:=alarmed.png,It looks like you spend just as much time playing cards as you do practicing empathy, Ayano.
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;ayano:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;ayano_stripping:=confused.png,It’s just ~clothing~, Ayano. I think you’re overreacting. (I’m going to keep an eye out for any butterflies, just in case... This seems bad.)
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kim&stage;0:,count-role;self&saidmarker;kim_similar:=embarrassed.png,Just less dressed.
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;yang:=wink.png,O-or if you aren’t, that’s okay too? Everyone has secrets! Love or otherwise.
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;4:,count-role;other&character;neo:=confident.png,Palutena, I know Neo is pint-sized, but we should focus on making sure we can take her down… But if you don’t want me to go easy on you...
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;shego&stage;0:,count-role;other&character;sei:=confident.png,Sei, can you just arrest Shego? I’d like to see her tied up. I-I mean behind bars.
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:,count-role;self&saidmarker;localization:=embarrassed.png,W-wait a second! Argh! You tricked me!
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:,count-role;self&saidmarker;localization:=embarrassed.png,You tricked me! This is still really unsafe but you <i>tricked</i> me!
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_mariba:,count-role;other&character;futaba&saidmarker;saki_befriend_mariba:=excited.png,"Pwn?" Er... well, I'm guessing if we got loaded up on sugar and got all dressed up, getting competitive does seem a <i>little</i> fun... What do you think, Saki?
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_ladity:,count-role;other&character;uravity&saidmarker;saki_befriend_ladity:=confident.png,Hmm… I mean, I’ve done <i>saunas</i> but… Err, well, okay, let’s do this, but we have to do some skincare and go for crepes afterwards.
1-female_removing_minor,count-yandere:1-3,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=confident.png,~name~ has really pretty eyes, and a good sense of herself.
1-female_removing_minor,count-yandere:1-3,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;4:=confident.png,We’re all friends and heroes here, Palutena. But hopefully you can stay in the game long enough to help me subdue <i>her</i>!
1-female_removing_minor,priority:0,count-yandere:1-3,count-athletic&role;target&stage;3-5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=wink.png,~name~’s worked really hard to get into that kind of shape. You don’t stand a chance, <i>you know who you are.</i>.

1-female_removing_minor,priority:0,count-yandere:1-3,count-cheerful&role;target&stage;3-5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=wink.png,~name~  is always upbeat. And I will <i>never</i> let <i>you</i> take that away from her.
1-female_removing_minor,priority:0,count-yandere:1-3,count-confident&role;target&stage;3-5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=wink.png,~name~’s confidence isn’t going to be eroded by your lies, <i>you</i>!
1-female_removing_minor,priority:0,count-yandere:1-3,count-fashionable&role;target&stage;3-5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=wink.png,~name~ has killer fashion sense. Believe me. I’d know.
1-female_removing_minor,priority:0,count-yandere:1-3,count-hero&role;target&stage;3-5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=wink.png,~name~ saves and helps lots of people regularly.
1-female_removing_minor,priority:0,count-yandere:1-3,count-innocent&role;target&stage;3-5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=wink.png,~name~ has a pure soul, and if Hawk Moth can’t touch her, neither can you!
1-female_removing_minor,priority:0,count-yandere:1-3,count-kind&role;target&stage;3-5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=wink.png,~name~ doesn’t have a mean bone in her body. You could learn from her.
1-female_removing_minor,priority:0,count-yandere:1-3,count-mean&role;target&stage;3-5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=confused.png,You know, she does have a point about your attitude, ~name~...
1-female_removing_minor,priority:0,count-yandere:1-3,count-princess&role;target&stage;3-5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=wink.png,~name~ guides and protects her people with great skill.
1-female_removing_minor,priority:0,count-yandere:1-3,count-sarcastic&role;target&stage;3-5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=wink.png,~name~ has lots of witty remarks. Though she can be hard to deal with sometimes, someone with that insightful of a mind can’t fall prey to your tricks.
1-female_removing_minor,priority:0,count-yandere:1-3,count-single&role;target&stage;3-5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=wink.png,~name~ has her pick of the boys--or girls--and it’s because of her shining personality. If ~player~ wants her, she’d be a much better choice than an obsessive monster like you.
1-female_removing_minor,priority:0,count-yandere:1-3,count-taken&role;target&stage;3-5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=wink.png,~name~ is already in a committed relationship, and she doesn’t need ~player~, but given how you’re acting, you definitely don’t need them either!
1-female_removing_minor,priority:0,count-yandere:1-3,count-tomboy&role;target&stage;3-5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=wink.png,~name~ has a lot going for her, and she’s competitive in ways neither you nor I are. Don’t talk down to her or make her lose faith in herself!
1-female_removing_minor,priority:0,count-yandere:1-3,count-video_game&role;target&stage;3-5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=wink.png,~name~ is adored by her fans, and is used to facing danger. You better watch your threats!
1-female_removing_minor,priority:0,count-yandere:1-3,count-villain&role;target&stage;3-5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=wink.png,Just because ~name~ is misguided, doesn’t mean that she doesn’t have redeeming qualities. Maybe if you didn’t pick on her, she wouldn’t do what she does?
1-female_removing_minor,count-yandere:1-3,count-yandere&role;target:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=bored.png,What are we to do with you, ~name~?
1-female_removing_minor,count-yandere:1-3,count-yandere&role;target:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=bored.png,I hope you really get your act together...
1-female_removing_minor,count-yandere:1-3,count-yandere&role;target:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=confident.png,I can't let you be a danger to others, ~name~! Er-- apparently, I can't just fight you... that's security's job...
1-female_removing_minor,count-yandere:1-3,count-yandere&role;target:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=embarrassed.png,You should be ashamed of how you've been treating other people, ~name~.
1-female_removing_minor,count-yandere:1-3,count-yandere&role;target:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=confident.png,This serves you right.
1-female_removing_minor,count-yandere:1-3,count-yandere&role;target:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=alarmed.png,T-there's no akuma here, is there, just ~name~ and her whole yandere stuff!
1-female_removed_minor=wink.png,Alya'd probably love to compare notes. You really, really know how to own your apparel!
1-female_removed_minor=alarmed.png,I  really   hope you weren’t attached enough to it for it to be a theme for evil powers though…
1-female_removed_minor=alarmed.png,You see a lot of strange things being a superhero... Nothing as odd as in this game.
1-female_removed_minor=wink.png,It’s hard to be creative under pressure, huh, ~name~?
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;dark_magician_girl&stage;3:=wink.png,(She looks kind of like a frillier, female Adrien... Hmm...)
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;3:=confused.png,A-Aimee, I'd use my Lucky Charm to reverse time if you made a mistake, but there's no akumas here for me to use it on...
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;3:=alarmed.png,A-Aimee, I might die of embarrassment, but if you do that wrong, you'll actually die!
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;3:=alarmed.png,Aimee! You sure aren’t making sounds like that was a sure shot! Be careful!
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika:=confident.png,And with Nadeshiko helping you out, you already have a super strong team!
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;pearl&stage;2:=calm.png,And you certainly seem enchanting! I guess if you're not Akumatized, you're alright by me!
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;4&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=confused.png,Er... if you want to stop, Nayru, I think most people here would be okay with it... no need to push yourself!
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;3:=alarmed.png,Er… about that… Er! H-hold on, don't panic, I can explain!
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:=bored.png,Erm, Aimee... This seems very, very dangerous. And if a hero is telling you that...
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:=excited.png,At very least, I don't have to worry about you as a villain... You seem to only hit yourself...
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;alpha&stage;2:=confident.png,Hmm... Maybe now's not a great time, but could you do... Fashion Victim by Green Day?
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;zoey&stage;2:,marker:feet=bored.png,I mean, you’re an attractive woman taking off her clothes… Wait, did you mean… Your feet?
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;zoey&stage;2:,marker:feet=confused.png,Er… What, the feet? Is this a thing people…
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;1:=wink.png,I really think well-made armor can keep you really mobile, right? Maybe just not as mobile as me.
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;1:=confident.png,I'm really not one for armor, but my suit does really increase my pain tolerance and agility.
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;kyoko&stage;6:=confused.png,I’m so sorry. I wish my Lucky Charm could heal those. You’re still an amazing detective, I can tell even from this game…
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;other&character;zone-tan&stage;6:,marker:ztentacles=confident.png,I’m sure, even faced with a tentacle monster, ~name~ would hold her ground, Zone! No wardrobe destruction. Or. Um. Destruction of orifices.
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;4:=confused.png,I… Wow. You must know all kinds of tricks, Kyu. (Would you mind teaching me some?)
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;3:=wink.png,I'd say you're finally coming out of your shell, Corrin, but you definitely seem fine with this.
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,I-I do mean sandals. M-meaning sandals are fine for the beach and your clothes, I just don’t like them. I-I’m not looking at your… Butt.
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;2:=excited.png,I’ve never really seen a statuesque person undress before, so this is a bit novel to me.
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;2:=wink.png,I-I mean. I don't know what's going on. I wouldn't come to a game like this for <i>Adrien</i> or anything. Um. I guess a girl has to have her secrets, huh, Natsuki?
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;3:=wink.png,I'm glad one of us doesn't <i>seem</i> too concerned with losing. Don't worry. If you don't get your "grief seed," I'll make sure I do get my <i>akuma</i>.
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;sayori&stage;1:=wink.png,I'm just really happy you have it together, Sayori! I have some other people to watch out for so they don't get Akumatized, but I'm glad you're emotionally stable!
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;4:=wink.png,It certainly seems to help fight off <i>your</i> Akuma. I figured it'd help me with mine!
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;4:=wink.png,I mean, you <i>did</i> just take off your boots.
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;4:=wink.png,I'd be happy to show you some tricks of my own, if you'd like!
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,J-just because I don’t get a lot of chances to look at body art. But even without the art you’re really… You know…
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,N-no?
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;3:=wink.png,Okay, okay, okay. Saki, how about a hug? If you're cold or embarrassed, nothing fixes both like a big hug. And believe me, I need lots of hugs!
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;shego&stage;1:=bored.png,One piece of clothing at a time! Er... Hopefully losing here will make you rethink things?
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;chica&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,O-oh. Well, this is embarrassing. I’m not really used to… Um… A scenario where something like you wasn’t just possessed.
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,Palutena, I do have to wonder what a goddess looks like under her um...last lines of defense.
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;3:=bored.png,Quite forward to show up in your panties. To say the least.
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;3:=confused.png,That sounds really embarrassing... Is that why you're so... O-oh. N-nevermind.
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,W-wait a second, t-that's-- That's so vulgar, GoGo!
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;nugi-chan&stage;3:=confident.png,They’re very classy, Nugi-chan. I recognize high quality clothing anywhere, and I’ll make sure they’re treated well!
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;sanako&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,This is somewhat odd to admit, but this isn't my first visit here... you seem very familiar, Sanako, but I don't think I can place how...
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;2:=confused.png,Um...I don’t know about that. Maybe you’re a warmer person than me?
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,U-uhm. That looked hot! I mean, hot as not as your-- n-not as hot as-- um, when you had burnmarks-- er--!
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;zelda&stage;4:=confident.png,Weird, given we’re the title characters, right?
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;3:=excited.png,Well! I applaud you being so clever! I’m definitely not sure what it would be like to take mine off piecemeal like that.
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;2:=calm.png,Well, my earrings are <i>kind of</i> like that gem of yours... does your kwami have a name?
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;other&character;sonya&stage;6&saidmarker;commando:=embarrassed.png,Whoa, Sonya. That's... Wow, body paint. I didn't think I was into this. I guess I am, though.
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;3:=confident.png,Wow! Those are cool tattoos, Blackrose!
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,U-um, those are tattoos, right? Those wavy things, and not scars? R-right?
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;3&saidmarker;socks:=confused.png,W-wait a minute! You shouldn't threaten self-harm like that!
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;3:=alarmed.png,W-whoa! You really didn't need to bring so many guns, Elaine!
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;3:=alarmed.png,I-I'm glad you're retting gid--getting rid of those guns, Elaine!
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;kimberly&stage;3:=excited.png,You look so cute, Kimberly! I-I get a little embarrassed when I bare my midriff, but you make it look great! E-er, you know what I mean.
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;4&saidmarker;null_possess:=excited.png,You seem like a weight's off your chest! What happened, Nayru?
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;3:=wink.png,You're really lucky Natsuki's so brave! This is usually a third or fourth date activity, and she's willing to do all this for <i>you</i>! It's romantic! In a way.
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;5:,count-role;other&character;lyn:=calm.png,Aww! You two are so sweet on each other!
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;florina&saidmarker;huey:=confident.png,Don’t worry, Florina! I’m sure Huey was safely out of range!
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;3:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=embarrassed.png,Erm. If you do though, could you please <i>not</i> bring it here?
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;3:,count-role;other&character;futaba:=confused.png,Futaba, I mean… I'm still interested in men but Gwen’s… Impressive in her own right...
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;3:,count-role;other&character;aimee:=embarrassed.png,H-hey Aimee! I-I just work with someone that's just as cute--I mean looks like her!
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;shego&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;sei:=embarrassed.png,I could tie her up with my yo-yo but I think she’d like that far too much...
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;3:,count-role;other&character;uravity:=embarrassed.png,I guess we're both kind of lost in this, huh, Ochako...?
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;kim&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;shego:=calm.png,It's not like I haven't had a similar bond with some of the villains I've fought...
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;shimmy:,count-role;other&character;zoey:,marker:shimmy=wink.png,Shimmy? Oh! That’s a fun word to say! Shimmy... Shimmy... Shimmy... Erk. Sorry, ~name~, I got distracted...
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:,count-role;self&saidmarker;localization:=bored.png,Well! At least I didn’t have my outfit changed for the English Localization, Aimee!
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;chica&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;alpha:=embarrassed.png,Well, I guess Alpha is an AI that’s not possessed… I think. I’m keeping an eye on you, Chica.
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;pegasusquish:,count-role;other&character;florina&saidmarker;crash:=confident.png,W-what? You can fly on a pegasus! That’s incredible, Florina! A-and sorry, ~name~, about your ~clothing~. And spine.
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;rodeo:,count-role;other&character;zoey:,marker:rodeo=confused.png,Zoey, what do you mean by rodeo?
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;3:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_mariba:,count-role;other&character;futaba&saidmarker;saki_befriend_mariba:=wink.png,Then we can talk about boys and stuff too. I actually already like Futaba's style, and I'm already kind of good at some games, so it's a great blend for Saki!
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;3:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_ladity:,count-role;other&character;uravity&saidmarker;saki_befriend_ladity:=wink.png,Um, yeah! Well, crepes and mudmasks and all that are popular wherever you go, right? This'll be great!
1-female_removed_minor,priority:305,count-role;target&character;florina:,count-exposed:1-5=confident.png,I understand how you feel, Florina, but nothing’s wrong. You’re doing great!
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;2:,count-male:1-5=wink.png,I think most people know a breastplate is also a chestplate. Don’t get so worried, Florina!


#lost costume
2-male_removing_minor=wink.png,You know, I think you look great with that.
2-male_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;0:=bored.png,<i>And costume for…</i> Oh.
2-male_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_m&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,E-er. Hm. I think I prefer men that are a bit more... masculine.
2-male_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;2:,marker:cap_steve=calm.png,I can call you that, right? Now that we’re both unmasked?
2-male_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Tamokoma Branch? Is that like... your hero organization? The trivia's fine, Jin. Kind of like the rest of you... Er--
2-male_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,The rest of you looks much better. Um. Especially the... Not clothes parts.
2-male_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;palutena:=embarrassed.png,Yeah, sandals are a bit... Um. (How do I say they're not attractive without being really mean?)
2-male_removing_minor,priority:0,count-black_hair&role;target:=confident.png,You know, sometimes I do wonder what it'd have been like to have a more typical hair color...
2-male_removing_minor,priority:0,count-black_hair&role;target:=wink.png,Oh! I love hair like yours, ~name~. Black never goes out of style!
2-male_removing_minor,priority:0,count-blonde&role;target:=confident.png,I wonder if blondes <i>do</i> have more fun.
2-male_removing_minor,priority:0,count-blonde&role;target:=wink.png,You picked a really cute ~clothing~ to go with the brightness of your hair, ~name~!
2-male_removing_minor,priority:0,count-blue_hair&role;target:=embarrassed.png,Huh. You know. Is there a term for people like us? With blue hair? Blunette sounds kinda...
2-male_removing_minor,priority:0,count-blue_hair&role;target:=excited.png,Wow! I'm always happy to see other people with blue hair! Really! E-er! Just maybe not in a game like this!
2-male_removing_minor,priority:0,count-brunette&role;target:=excited.png,I get a little jealous about brown hair like ~name~'s. It's just so timeless!
2-male_removing_minor,priority:0,count-brunette&role;target:=wink.png,A nice thing about being a brunette must be that you can pull off just about any outfit like your ~clothing~, right, ~name~?
2-male_removing_minor,priority:0,count-exotic_hair&role;target:=embarrassed.png,Wow! So, I mean, I could um. Just stutted. Stutter! About your ~clothing~! But your hair is <i>so</i> impressive, ~name~!
2-male_removing_minor,priority:0,count-exotic_hair&role;target:=alarmed.png,O-oh! <i>Zut!</i> ~name~! Your hair looks beautiful when it's coordinated with your ~clothing~!
2-male_removing_minor,priority:0,count-ginger&role;target:=excited.png,By the way, ~name~, I wanted you to know I really like your hair! It reminds me of Alya! A-and in a game like this, that's certainly a comfort.
2-male_removing_minor,priority:0,count-ginger&role;target:=confident.png,Don't let anyone ever make fun of you for your hair, ~name~! Your soul has to burn as brightly as your locks! E-er. Sorry, that sounds really deep.
2-male_removing_minor,priority:0,count-green_hair&role;target:=confused.png,Green hair? Hmm... Is that natural, or did you just go swimming, ~name~?
2-male_removing_minor,priority:0,count-pink_hair&role;target:=excited.png,Pink hair? Oh! Just like Alyx! I hope you're just as quick on your feet, ~name~!
2-male_removing_minor,priority:0,count-pink_hair&role;target:=excited.png,<i>Pink</i> hair is pretty unusual. Unlike the really common blue variety. You should feel special, ~name~!
2-male_removing_minor,priority:0,count-purple_hair&role;target:=confused.png,<i>Purple</i> hair? Even Juleka's hair is naturally black...
2-male_removing_minor,priority:0,count-purple_hair&role;target:=confused.png,Couldn't you have settled for blue?
2-male_removing_minor,priority:0,count-white_hair&role;target:=excited.png,If you ever wanted to dye it, I bet you could do <i>such</i> cool colors, ~name~!
2-male_removing_minor,priority:0,count-white_hair&role;target:=confident.png,Wow! Your hair's so... So lovely! It's like fresh snow, ~name~!
2-male_removed_minor=embarrassed.png,You look good with it! Or without it. As an expression of your taste. Like with your mind. Not your tongue.
2-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;3:=alarmed.png,A-anyway, let's keep playing! D-don't pay me too much mind!
2-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;3:=confident.png,Hmm. I-I was kind of expecting a different answer! (Tellement pour espérer qu'il allait me dire.)
2-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;4:=confused.png,Huh? What's a Trion body? Is that kind of like my transformation and powers?
2-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;3:=wink.png,I suppose there's something to be said about self-servicing... er... fashion design-wise, anyway.
2-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_m&stage;3:=wink.png,I think you can be gentle without being weak or cowardly. Don't lose the first part, Corrin.
2-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,O-oh my. You’re very striking under that helmet, Captain America. (<i>Ca valait la peine.</i>)
2-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;3:,count-role;other&character;palutena:=bored.png,Hmm. (I can't figure these two out! I've known Tikki for a long time, but I'm guessing divine figures are just like this!)
2-male_removed_minor,count-korean&role;target:=excited.png,Korean fashion is always super interesting, ~name~, but the makeup is really spectacular. And the music that usually goes with it! Wow, I can definitely see your influences!
2-female_removing_minor=confident.png,You know, I normally customize my clothing and accessories.
2-female_removing_minor=wink.png,You know, I think you look great with that.
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;sanako&stage;0:=calm.png,(Hmm... she seems oddly familiar...)
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;1:=excited.png,<i>Merveilleux! I</i> see what's going on here...
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;1:=confused.png,A "soul gem?" Hmm... is that where you store your guardian spirit to transform?
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:=alarmed.png,Ahh!!! Could you stop shooting like that!
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:=confident.png,It is a pretty impressive skill, at least. But please don't hurt anyone!
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;0:=wink.png,Because you look really punk-y!
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;april&stage;1:=excited.png,But I don’t know if the turtle miraculous holder likes pizza that much... or sewers. He definitely knows a lot about Ancient China though!
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;2:=calm.png,But that’s a good thing. You’re just like Chloe, and you’re so mean I can’t imagine you’d have nice powers.
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;2:=alarmed.png,F-flooding? <i>D-de l'eau dans vos chaussette?</i> Um... I-is this a euphemism?
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;other&character;zoey&stage;2:=alarmed.png,HBO? Wait, this isn’t on TV? W-wait, HBO has things like this on it?
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;4:=excited.png,Here I go! Begone! THOT!
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;2:=calm.png,Hmm... Well, I guess there's other types of heroes out there... other types of girls with magic too, I suppose!
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kimberly&stage;2:=wink.png,I guess if it's strip poker, more layers would help... but I thought for sure it'd just be a sweatshirt, to fit in with your aesthetic!
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;1:=bored.png,I never really understood the appeal of thongs.
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;1:=wink.png,Sandals seem… Attire appropriate.
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;1:=wink.png,I’m glad you’re having fun!
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;1:=excited.png,It’s great playing with you too, Nagisa!
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;2:=alarmed.png,I-I’m excited to see more!
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;sayori&stage;0:=calm.png,I'm glad Sayori is so excitable! Even if she's a bit spacy.
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;ann&stage;0:=confident.png,I've seen so many of your shoots! You really, really know how to own your apparel!
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;2:=excited.png,Jeez, ~player~, have you considered asking Natsuki on a date, or what?
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;2&saidmarker;socks:=embarrassed.png,Kyu wait! I'll take off something just so you don't have to if you'll---
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;pearl&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Not in a bad way, just in a way that seems enchanted.
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;weiss&stage;2:=wink.png,Not that anyone here seems to care about your money but you.
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;4:=wink.png,Of course, Palutena, I’m here to win too! (And at this point it looks like we’re having more fun than worry. Palutena does these asides too, so that’s okay for me, right?)
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;4:=wink.png,Not that you really need me to, but I won’t let you fall under the akuma’s power!
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;dark_magician_girl&stage;4:=confident.png,Oh! I'm not the only one with that kind of talent... Um, as you may have seen.
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:=wink.png,Oh! Is this what people mean when they say they want to shoot all over me? Is this just how some people undress in those old Western movies? ?
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;juri&stage;1:=confused.png,Oh! Your gloves! Here I was thinking you'd take off your hairties or something.
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kyoko&stage;5:=bored.png,Oh, Kyoko…
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;2:=bored.png,Oh.
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;dark_magician_girl&stage;2:=alarmed.png,O-oh. I-is that so? Hm.
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:=confident.png,O-Okay. I'll go ahead and hope you know how to use... Whatever skill you're using.
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;2:=alarmed.png,Since they’re part of your body-- The wings, not the socks!
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,So given how things are going, maybe I should kiss you for luck?
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika:=wink.png,The bad guys better watch out!
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;3:=alarmed.png,This is very interesting. But aren’t those kind of dirty? I-I mean not that being dirty is bad but--
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;2:=wink.png,This whole thing's a little awkward but let’s try to stay calm and collected, okay?
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;2:=alarmed.png,Um. I can't say I've ever had to worry about it. Sometimes afterwards, but never during! I guess it's a side effect of my Miraculous?
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;0:=calm.png,Those actually look really well made! I'm not one for armor, but it's nice to see you care about more than durability.
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;0:=excited.png,Wow, Corrin, those look really stylish and actually durable!
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Though... I haven't really seen a Miraculous compartmentalize like this...
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;3:=alarmed.png,Um, but. I, er. Spinning bird kick. Can you teach it to me?
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:=confused.png,Um. If you even want to take off your shoes... er... which you halready lave-- already have! Y-you risk showing your-- um. You know.
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:=bored.png,I-I guess you've already shown your underwear on accident-- um, is that the wrong thing to say?!
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;other&character;zone-tan&stage;2:,marker:ztentacles=alarmed.png,Um. People can enjoy sex however they want, Zone-tan, but I think most people prefer not to have their wardrobes damaged in the process!
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;chica&stage;0:=alarmed.png,W-wait, that’s the one with the possessed animatronics! I have to free Chica from the Akuma, now!
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;shego&stage;0:=confident.png,You may not use an akuma, but I'll stop you anyway!
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;2:=alarmed.png,Y-your... Husband? D-does he know you're at a game like this!?
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;2:=alarmed.png,I-I would never come here if I had a partner at home!
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=alarmed.png,Don’t encourage her, Zone! You don’t have some big amorphous blob that can shield us with tentacles!
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;florina:=embarrassed.png,Er, I meant--You know, morally. Not...Mortally. Erk.
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;futaba:=embarrassed.png,Er. We're not-- I'm not-- I mean, she's really pretty but--! I mean I would be <i>interested</i>
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;4:,count-role;other&character;shego:=confident.png,Er… I’m not going to go easy on you, Palutena, but I think Shego is a bigger problem if we don’t stop her now.
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kim&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;shego:=embarrassed.png,I-I mean, relationship as in friendship or rivalship?
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;ayano:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_stripping:=alarmed.png,It looks like you spend just as much time playing cards as you do practicing empathy, Ayano.
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;ayano:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;ayano_stripping:=confused.png,It’s just ~clothing~, Ayano. I think you’re overreacting. (I’m going to keep an eye out for any butterflies, just in case... This seems bad.)
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kim&stage;0:,count-role;self&saidmarker;kim_similar:=embarrassed.png,Just less dressed.
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;yang:=wink.png,O-or if you aren’t, that’s okay too? Everyone has secrets! Love or otherwise.
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;4:,count-role;other&character;neo:=confident.png,Palutena, I know Neo is pint-sized, but we should focus on making sure we can take her down… But if you don’t want me to go easy on you...
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;shego&stage;0:,count-role;other&character;sei:=confident.png,Sei, can you just arrest Shego? I’d like to see her tied up. I-I mean behind bars.
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_mariba:,count-role;other&character;futaba&saidmarker;saki_befriend_mariba:=excited.png,"Pwn?" Er... well, I'm guessing if we got loaded up on sugar and got all dressed up, getting competitive does seem a <i>little</i> fun... What do you think, Saki?
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_ladity:,count-role;other&character;uravity&saidmarker;saki_befriend_ladity:=confident.png,Hmm… I mean, I’ve done <i>saunas</i> but… Err, well, okay, let’s do this, but we have to do some skincare and go for crepes afterwards.
2-female_removing_minor,priority:0,count-black_hair&role;target:=confident.png,You know, sometimes I do wonder what it'd have been like to have a more typical hair color...
2-female_removing_minor,priority:0,count-black_hair&role;target:=wink.png,Oh! I love hair like yours, ~name~. Black never goes out of style!

3-male_removing_minor,priority:0,count-purple_hair&role;target:=confused.png,Couldn't you have settled for blue?
3-male_removing_minor,priority:0,count-white_hair&role;target:=excited.png,If you ever wanted to dye it, I bet you could do <i>such</i> cool colors, ~name~!
3-male_removing_minor,priority:0,count-white_hair&role;target:=confident.png,Wow! Your hair's so... So lovely! It's like fresh snow, ~name~!
3-male_removed_minor=embarrassed.png,Not that you need any help with that. I mean, temperature-wise.
3-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;3:=alarmed.png,A-anyway, let's keep playing! D-don't pay me too much mind!
3-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;3:=confident.png,Hmm. I-I was kind of expecting a different answer! (Tellement pour espérer qu'il allait me dire.)
3-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;4:=confused.png,Huh? What's a Trion body? Is that kind of like my transformation and powers?
3-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;3:=wink.png,I suppose there's something to be said about self-servicing... er... fashion design-wise, anyway.
3-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_m&stage;3:=wink.png,I think you can be gentle without being weak or cowardly. Don't lose the first part, Corrin.
3-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,O-oh my. You’re very striking under that helmet, Captain America. (<i>Ca valait la peine.</i>)
3-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;3:,count-role;other&character;palutena:=bored.png,Hmm. (I can't figure these two out! I've known Tikki for a long time, but I'm guessing divine figures are just like this!)
3-male_removed_minor,count-korean&role;target:=excited.png,Korean fashion is always super interesting, ~name~, but the makeup is really spectacular. And the music that usually goes with it! Wow, I can definitely see your influences!
3-female_removing_minor,marker:temperature=calm.png,I guess it is a bit warm in here... But that’s no reason for any of us to get hot under the collar.
3-female_removing_minor,marker:alya=wink.png,I saw something just like that in Alya’s closet.
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;sanako&stage;0:=calm.png,(Hmm... she seems oddly familiar...)
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;1:=excited.png,<i>Merveilleux! I</i> see what's going on here...
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;1:=confused.png,A "soul gem?" Hmm... is that where you store your guardian spirit to transform?
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:=alarmed.png,Ahh!!! Could you stop shooting like that!
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:=confident.png,It is a pretty impressive skill, at least. But please don't hurt anyone!
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;0:=wink.png,Because you look really punk-y!
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;april&stage;1:=excited.png,But I don’t know if the turtle miraculous holder likes pizza that much... or sewers. He definitely knows a lot about Ancient China though!
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;2:=calm.png,But that’s a good thing. You’re just like Chloe, and you’re so mean I can’t imagine you’d have nice powers.
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;2:=alarmed.png,F-flooding? <i>D-de l'eau dans vos chaussette?</i> Um... I-is this a euphemism?
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;other&character;zoey&stage;2:=alarmed.png,HBO? Wait, this isn’t on TV? W-wait, HBO has things like this on it?
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;4:=excited.png,Here I go! Begone! THOT!
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;2:=calm.png,Hmm... Well, I guess there's other types of heroes out there... other types of girls with magic too, I suppose!
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kimberly&stage;2:=wink.png,I guess if it's strip poker, more layers would help... but I thought for sure it'd just be a sweatshirt, to fit in with your aesthetic!
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;1:=bored.png,I never really understood the appeal of thongs.
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;1:=wink.png,Sandals seem… Attire appropriate.
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;1:=wink.png,I’m glad you’re having fun!
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;1:=excited.png,It’s great playing with you too, Nagisa!
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;2:=alarmed.png,I-I’m excited to see more!
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;sayori&stage;0:=calm.png,I'm glad Sayori is so excitable! Even if she's a bit spacy.
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;ann&stage;0:=confident.png,I've seen so many of your shoots! You really, really know how to own your apparel!
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;2:=excited.png,Jeez, ~player~, have you considered asking Natsuki on a date, or what?
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;2&saidmarker;socks:=embarrassed.png,Kyu wait! I'll take off something just so you don't have to if you'll---
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;pearl&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Not in a bad way, just in a way that seems enchanted.
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;weiss&stage;2:=wink.png,Not that anyone here seems to care about your money but you.
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;4:=wink.png,Of course, Palutena, I’m here to win too! (And at this point it looks like we’re having more fun than worry. Palutena does these asides too, so that’s okay for me, right?)
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;4:=wink.png,Not that you really need me to, but I won’t let you fall under the akuma’s power!
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;dark_magician_girl&stage;4:=confident.png,Oh! I'm not the only one with that kind of talent... Um, as you may have seen.
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:=wink.png,Oh! Is this what people mean when they say they want to shoot all over me? Is this just how some people undress in those old Western movies? ?
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;juri&stage;1:=confused.png,Oh! Your gloves! Here I was thinking you'd take off your hairties or something.
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kyoko&stage;5:=bored.png,Oh, Kyoko…
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;2:=bored.png,Oh.
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;dark_magician_girl&stage;2:=alarmed.png,O-oh. I-is that so? Hm.
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:=confident.png,O-Okay. I'll go ahead and hope you know how to use... Whatever skill you're using.
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;2:=alarmed.png,Since they’re part of your body-- The wings, not the socks!
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,So given how things are going, maybe I should kiss you for luck?
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika:=wink.png,The bad guys better watch out!
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;3:=alarmed.png,This is very interesting. But aren’t those kind of dirty? I-I mean not that being dirty is bad but--
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;2:=wink.png,This whole thing's a little awkward but let’s try to stay calm and collected, okay?
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;2:=alarmed.png,Um. I can't say I've ever had to worry about it. Sometimes afterwards, but never during! I guess it's a side effect of my Miraculous?
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;0:=calm.png,Those actually look really well made! I'm not one for armor, but it's nice to see you care about more than durability.
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;0:=excited.png,Wow, Corrin, those look really stylish and actually durable!
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Though... I haven't really seen a Miraculous compartmentalize like this...
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;3:=alarmed.png,Um, but. I, er. Spinning bird kick. Can you teach it to me?
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:=confused.png,Um. If you even want to take off your shoes... er... which you halready lave-- already have! Y-you risk showing your-- um. You know.
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:=bored.png,I-I guess you've already shown your underwear on accident-- um, is that the wrong thing to say?!
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;other&character;zone-tan&stage;2:,marker:ztentacles=alarmed.png,Um. People can enjoy sex however they want, Zone-tan, but I think most people prefer not to have their wardrobes damaged in the process!
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;chica&stage;0:=alarmed.png,W-wait, that’s the one with the possessed animatronics! I have to free Chica from the Akuma, now!
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;shego&stage;0:=confident.png,You may not use an akuma, but I'll stop you anyway!
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;2:=alarmed.png,Y-your... Husband? D-does he know you're at a game like this!?
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;2:=alarmed.png,I-I would never come here if I had a partner at home!
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=alarmed.png,Don’t encourage her, Zone! You don’t have some big amorphous blob that can shield us with tentacles!
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;florina:=embarrassed.png,Er, I meant--You know, morally. Not...Mortally. Erk.
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;futaba:=embarrassed.png,Er. We're not-- I'm not-- I mean, she's really pretty but--! I mean I would be <i>interested</i>
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;4:,count-role;other&character;shego:=confident.png,Er… I’m not going to go easy on you, Palutena, but I think Shego is a bigger problem if we don’t stop her now.
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kim&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;shego:=embarrassed.png,I-I mean, relationship as in friendship or rivalship?
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;ayano:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_stripping:=alarmed.png,It looks like you spend just as much time playing cards as you do practicing empathy, Ayano.
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;ayano:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;ayano_stripping:=confused.png,It’s just ~clothing~, Ayano. I think you’re overreacting. (I’m going to keep an eye out for any butterflies, just in case... This seems bad.)
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kim&stage;0:,count-role;self&saidmarker;kim_similar:=embarrassed.png,Just less dressed.
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;yang:=wink.png,O-or if you aren’t, that’s okay too? Everyone has secrets! Love or otherwise.
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;4:,count-role;other&character;neo:=confident.png,Palutena, I know Neo is pint-sized, but we should focus on making sure we can take her down… But if you don’t want me to go easy on you...
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;shego&stage;0:,count-role;other&character;sei:=confident.png,Sei, can you just arrest Shego? I’d like to see her tied up. I-I mean behind bars.
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_mariba:,count-role;other&character;futaba&saidmarker;saki_befriend_mariba:=excited.png,"Pwn?" Er... well, I'm guessing if we got loaded up on sugar and got all dressed up, getting competitive does seem a <i>little</i> fun... What do you think, Saki?
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_ladity:,count-role;other&character;uravity&saidmarker;saki_befriend_ladity:=confident.png,Hmm… I mean, I’ve done <i>saunas</i> but… Err, well, okay, let’s do this, but we have to do some skincare and go for crepes afterwards.
3-female_removing_minor,priority:0,count-black_hair&role;target:=confident.png,You know, sometimes I do wonder what it'd have been like to have a more typical hair color...
3-female_removing_minor,priority:0,count-black_hair&role;target:=wink.png,Oh! I love hair like yours, ~name~. Black never goes out of style!
3-female_removing_minor,priority:0,count-blonde&role;target:=confident.png,I wonder if blondes <i>do</i> have more fun.
3-female_removing_minor,priority:0,count-blonde&role;target:=wink.png,You picked a really cute ~clothing~ to go with the brightness of your hair, ~name~!
3-female_removing_minor,priority:0,count-blue_hair&role;target:=embarrassed.png,Huh. You know. Is there a term for people like us? With blue hair? Blunette sounds kinda...
3-female_removing_minor,priority:0,count-blue_hair&role;target:=excited.png,Wow! I'm always happy to see other people with blue hair! Really! E-er! Just maybe not in a game like this!
3-female_removing_minor,priority:0,count-brunette&role;target:=excited.png,I get a little jealous about brown hair like ~name~'s. It's just so timeless!
3-female_removing_minor,priority:0,count-brunette&role;target:=wink.png,A nice thing about being a brunette must be that you can pull off just about any outfit like your ~clothing~, right, ~name~?
3-female_removing_minor,priority:0,count-exotic_hair&role;target:=embarrassed.png,Wow! So, I mean, I could um. Just stutted. Stutter! About your ~clothing~! But your hair is <i>so</i> impressive, ~name~!
3-female_removing_minor,priority:0,count-exotic_hair&role;target:=alarmed.png,O-oh! <i>Zut!</i> ~name~! Your hair looks beautiful when it's coordinated with your ~clothing~!
3-female_removing_minor,priority:0,count-ginger&role;target:=excited.png,By the way, ~name~, I wanted you to know I really like your hair! It reminds me of Alya! A-and in a game like this, that's certainly a comfort.
3-female_removing_minor,priority:0,count-ginger&role;target:=confident.png,Don't let anyone ever make fun of you for your hair, ~name~! Your soul has to burn as brightly as your locks! E-er. Sorry, that sounds really deep.
3-female_removing_minor,priority:0,count-green_hair&role;target:=confused.png,Green hair? Hmm... Is that natural, or did you just go swimming, ~name~?
3-female_removing_minor,priority:0,count-pink_hair&role;target:=excited.png,Pink hair? Oh! Just like Alyx! I hope you're just as quick on your feet, ~name~!
3-female_removing_minor,priority:0,count-pink_hair&role;target:=excited.png,<i>Pink</i> hair is pretty unusual. Unlike the really common blue variety. You should feel special, ~name~!

3-female_removing_minor,count-yandere:1-3,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;4:=confident.png,We’re all friends and heroes here, Palutena. But hopefully you can stay in the game long enough to help me subdue <i>her</i>!

3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;3:=alarmed.png,Aimee! You sure aren’t making sounds like that was a sure shot! Be careful!
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;alpha&stage;5:=confident.png,Alpha, I know you're digital but... You're pretty and definitely express your personality well. That's all you.
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika:=confident.png,And with Nadeshiko helping you out, you already have a super strong team!
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;pearl&stage;2:=calm.png,And you certainly seem enchanting! I guess if you're not Akumatized, you're alright by me!

3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:=bored.png,Erm, Aimee... This seems very, very dangerous. And if a hero is telling you that...

3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;zoey&stage;2:,marker:feet=bored.png,I mean, you’re an attractive woman taking off her clothes… Wait, did you mean… Your feet?

3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;1:=wink.png,I really think well-made armor can keep you really mobile, right? Maybe just not as mobile as me.
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;1:=confident.png,I'm really not one for armor, but my suit does really increase my pain tolerance and agility.
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;kyoko&stage;6:=confused.png,I’m so sorry. I wish my Lucky Charm could heal those. You’re still an amazing detective, I can tell even from this game…
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;other&character;zone-tan&stage;6:,marker:ztentacles=confident.png,I’m sure, even faced with a tentacle monster, ~name~ would hold her ground, Zone! No wardrobe destruction. Or. Um. Destruction of orifices.
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;3:=wink.png,I'd say you're finally coming out of your shell, Corrin, but you definitely seem fine with this.
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,I-I do mean sandals. M-meaning sandals are fine for the beach and your clothes, I just don’t like them. I-I’m not looking at your… Butt.
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;2:=excited.png,I’ve never really seen a statuesque person undress before, so this is a bit novel to me.
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;2:=wink.png,I-I mean. I don't know what's going on. I wouldn't come to a game like this for <i>Adrien</i> or anything. Um. I guess a girl has to have her secrets, huh, Natsuki?
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;3:=wink.png,I'm glad one of us doesn't <i>seem</i> too concerned with losing. Don't worry. If you don't get your "grief seed," I'll make sure I do get my <i>akuma</i>.
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;sayori&stage;1:=wink.png,I'm just really happy you have it together, Sayori! I have some other people to watch out for so they don't get Akumatized, but I'm glad you're emotionally stable!
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;4:=wink.png,It certainly seems to help fight off <i>your</i> Akuma. I figured it'd help me with mine!
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;4:=wink.png,I mean, you <i>did</i> just take off your boots.
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;4:=wink.png,I'd be happy to show you some tricks of my own, if you'd like!
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,J-just because I don’t get a lot of chances to look at body art. But even without the art you’re really… You know…
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,N-no?
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;self&saidmarker;temperature:=embarrassed.png,Not that you need any help with that. I mean, temperature-wise.
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;3:=wink.png,Okay, okay, okay. Saki, how about a hug? If you're cold or embarrassed, nothing fixes both like a big hug. And believe me, I need lots of hugs!
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;shego&stage;1:=bored.png,One piece of clothing at a time! Er... Hopefully losing here will make you rethink things?
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,O-oh. I guess it didn’t work… Maybe she meant Thoth, like that Egyptian god the Pharaoh channeled?
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;chica&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,O-oh. Well, this is embarrassing. I’m not really used to… Um… A scenario where something like you wasn’t just possessed.
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,Palutena, I do have to wonder what a goddess looks like under her um...last lines of defense.
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;self&saidmarker;alya:=alarmed.png,Please don’t tell Alya about this, if you’re borrowing it from her.
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;3:=confused.png,That sounds really embarrassing... Is that why you're so... O-oh. N-nevermind.
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,W-wait a second, t-that's-- That's so vulgar, GoGo!
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;nugi-chan&stage;3:=confident.png,They’re very classy, Nugi-chan. I recognize high quality clothing anywhere, and I’ll make sure they’re treated well!
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;sanako&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,This is somewhat odd to admit, but this isn't my first visit here... you seem very familiar, Sanako, but I don't think I can place how...
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;4:=excited.png,Um, what about your mouth? It’s very cute but <i>I’d</i> rather the only dirty parts be your language.
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,Um. Are your wings sensitive, Kyu?
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;2:=confused.png,Um...I don’t know about that. Maybe you’re a warmer person than me?
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,U-uhm. That looked hot! I mean, hot as not as your-- n-not as hot as-- um, when you had burnmarks-- er--!
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;3:=excited.png,Well! I applaud you being so clever! I’m definitely not sure what it would be like to take mine off piecemeal like that.
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;2:=calm.png,Well, my earrings are <i>kind of</i> like that gem of yours... does your kwami have a name?
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;other&character;sonya&stage;6&saidmarker;commando:=embarrassed.png,Whoa, Sonya. That's... Wow, body paint. I didn't think I was into this. I guess I am, though.
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;3:=confident.png,Wow! Those are cool tattoos, Blackrose!
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,U-um, those are tattoos, right? Those wavy things, and not scars? R-right?
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;3&saidmarker;socks:=confused.png,W-wait a minute! You shouldn't threaten self-harm like that!
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;3:=alarmed.png,W-whoa! You really didn't need to bring so many guns, Elaine!
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;3:=alarmed.png,I-I'm glad you're retting gid--getting rid of those guns, Elaine!
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;kimberly&stage;3:=excited.png,You look so cute, Kimberly! I-I get a little embarrassed when I bare my midriff, but you make it look great! E-er, you know what I mean.
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;4&saidmarker;null_possess:=excited.png,You seem like a weight's off your chest! What happened, Nayru?
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;3:=wink.png,You're really lucky Natsuki's so brave! This is usually a third or fourth date activity, and she's willing to do all this for <i>you</i>! It's romantic! In a way.
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;5:,count-role;other&character;lyn:=calm.png,Aww! You two are so sweet on each other!
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;florina&saidmarker;huey:=confident.png,Don’t worry, Florina! I’m sure Huey was safely out of range!
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;3:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=embarrassed.png,Erm. If you do though, could you please <i>not</i> bring it here?
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;3:,count-role;other&character;futaba:=confused.png,Futaba, I mean… I'm still interested in men but Gwen’s… Impressive in her own right...
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;3:,count-role;other&character;aimee:=embarrassed.png,H-hey Aimee! I-I just work with someone that's just as cute--I mean looks like her!
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;shego&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;sei:=embarrassed.png,I could tie her up with my yo-yo but I think she’d like that far too much...
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;3:,count-role;other&character;uravity:=embarrassed.png,I guess we're both kind of lost in this, huh, Ochako...?
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;kim&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;shego:=calm.png,It's not like I haven't had a similar bond with some of the villains I've fought...
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;shimmy:,count-role;other&character;zoey:,marker:shimmy=wink.png,Shimmy? Oh! That’s a fun word to say! Shimmy... Shimmy... Shimmy... Erk. Sorry, ~name~, I got distracted...
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;chica&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;alpha:=embarrassed.png,Well, I guess Alpha is an AI that’s not possessed… I think. I’m keeping an eye on you, Chica.
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;pegasusquish:,count-role;other&character;florina&saidmarker;crash:=confident.png,W-what? You can fly on a pegasus! That’s incredible, Florina! A-and sorry, ~name~, about your ~clothing~. And spine.
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;rodeo:,count-role;other&character;zoey:,marker:rodeo=confused.png,Zoey, what do you mean by rodeo?
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;3:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_mariba:,count-role;other&character;futaba&saidmarker;saki_befriend_mariba:=wink.png,Then we can talk about boys and stuff too. I actually already like Futaba's style, and I'm already kind of good at some games, so it's a great blend for Saki!
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;3:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_ladity:,count-role;other&character;uravity&saidmarker;saki_befriend_ladity:=wink.png,Um, yeah! Well, crepes and mudmasks and all that are popular wherever you go, right? This'll be great!
3-female_removed_minor,priority:305,count-role;target&character;florina:,count-exposed:1-5=confident.png,I understand how you feel, Florina, but nothing’s wrong. You’re doing great!
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;2:,count-male:1-5=wink.png,I think most people know a breastplate is also a chestplate. Don’t get so worried, Florina!


#lost jacket
4-male_removing_minor=wink.png,There’s no shame in joining me!
4-male_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;0:=bored.png,<i>And costume for…</i> Oh.
4-male_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_m&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,E-er. Hm. I think I prefer men that are a bit more... masculine.
4-male_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;2:,marker:cap_steve=calm.png,I can call you that, right? Now that we’re both unmasked?
4-male_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;3:=wink.png,It's nice that you won't be walking away from the game. (Though you could walk your way into...)
4-male_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Tamokoma Branch? Is that like... your hero organization? The trivia's fine, Jin. Kind of like the rest of you... Er--
4-male_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,The rest of you looks much better. Um. Especially the... Not clothes parts.
4-male_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;palutena:=embarrassed.png,Yeah, sandals are a bit... Um. (How do I say they're not attractive without being really mean?)
4-male_removing_minor,priority:0,count-black_hair&role;target:=confident.png,You know, sometimes I do wonder what it'd have been like to have a more typical hair color...
4-male_removing_minor,priority:0,count-black_hair&role;target:=wink.png,Oh! I love hair like yours, ~name~. Black never goes out of style!
4-male_removing_minor,priority:0,count-blonde&role;target:=confident.png,I wonder if blondes <i>do</i> have more fun.
4-male_removing_minor,priority:0,count-blonde&role;target:=wink.png,You picked a really cute ~clothing~ to go with the brightness of your hair, ~name~!
4-male_removing_minor,priority:0,count-blue_hair&role;target:=embarrassed.png,Huh. You know. Is there a term for people like us? With blue hair? Blunette sounds kinda...
4-male_removing_minor,priority:0,count-blue_hair&role;target:=excited.png,Wow! I'm always happy to see other people with blue hair! Really! E-er! Just maybe not in a game like this!
4-male_removing_minor,priority:0,count-brunette&role;target:=excited.png,I get a little jealous about brown hair like ~name~'s. It's just so timeless!
4-male_removing_minor,priority:0,count-brunette&role;target:=wink.png,A nice thing about being a brunette must be that you can pull off just about any outfit like your ~clothing~, right, ~name~?
4-male_removing_minor,priority:0,count-exotic_hair&role;target:=embarrassed.png,Wow! So, I mean, I could um. Just stutted. Stutter! About your ~clothing~! But your hair is <i>so</i> impressive, ~name~!
4-male_removing_minor,priority:0,count-exotic_hair&role;target:=alarmed.png,O-oh! <i>Zut!</i> ~name~! Your hair looks beautiful when it's coordinated with your ~clothing~!
4-male_removing_minor,priority:0,count-ginger&role;target:=excited.png,By the way, ~name~, I wanted you to know I really like your hair! It reminds me of Alya! A-and in a game like this, that's certainly a comfort.
4-male_removing_minor,priority:0,count-ginger&role;target:=confident.png,Don't let anyone ever make fun of you for your hair, ~name~! Your soul has to burn as brightly as your locks! E-er. Sorry, that sounds really deep.
4-male_removing_minor,priority:0,count-green_hair&role;target:=confused.png,Green hair? Hmm... Is that natural, or did you just go swimming, ~name~?
4-male_removing_minor,priority:0,count-pink_hair&role;target:=excited.png,Pink hair? Oh! Just like Alyx! I hope you're just as quick on your feet, ~name~!
4-male_removing_minor,priority:0,count-pink_hair&role;target:=excited.png,<i>Pink</i> hair is pretty unusual. Unlike the really common blue variety. You should feel special, ~name~!
4-male_removing_minor,priority:0,count-purple_hair&role;target:=confused.png,<i>Purple</i> hair? Even Juleka's hair is naturally black...
4-male_removing_minor,priority:0,count-purple_hair&role;target:=confused.png,Couldn't you have settled for blue?
4-male_removing_minor,priority:0,count-white_hair&role;target:=excited.png,If you ever wanted to dye it, I bet you could do <i>such</i> cool colors, ~name~!
4-male_removing_minor,priority:0,count-white_hair&role;target:=confident.png,Wow! Your hair's so... So lovely! It's like fresh snow, ~name~!
4-male_removed_minor=embarrassed.png,Uh-uh, you know. In being comfortable.
4-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;3:=alarmed.png,A-anyway, let's keep playing! D-don't pay me too much mind!
4-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;3:=confident.png,Hmm. I-I was kind of expecting a different answer! (Tellement pour espérer qu'il allait me dire.)
4-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;4:=confused.png,Huh? What's a Trion body? Is that kind of like my transformation and powers?
4-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;3:=wink.png,I suppose there's something to be said about self-servicing... er... fashion design-wise, anyway.
4-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_m&stage;3:=wink.png,I think you can be gentle without being weak or cowardly. Don't lose the first part, Corrin.
4-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,O-oh my. You’re very striking under that helmet, Captain America. (<i>Ca valait la peine.</i>)
4-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;3:,count-role;other&character;palutena:=bored.png,Hmm. (I can't figure these two out! I've known Tikki for a long time, but I'm guessing divine figures are just like this!)
4-male_removed_minor,count-korean&role;target:=excited.png,Korean fashion is always super interesting, ~name~, but the makeup is really spectacular. And the music that usually goes with it! Wow, I can definitely see your influences!
4-female_removing_minor=confused.png,Hmm, I wonder if that would fit me.
4-female_removing_minor=wink.png,There’s no shame in joining me!
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;sanako&stage;0:=calm.png,(Hmm... she seems oddly familiar...)
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;1:=excited.png,<i>Merveilleux! I</i> see what's going on here...
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;1:=confused.png,A "soul gem?" Hmm... is that where you store your guardian spirit to transform?
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:=alarmed.png,Ahh!!! Could you stop shooting like that!
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:=confident.png,It is a pretty impressive skill, at least. But please don't hurt anyone!
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;0:=wink.png,Because you look really punk-y!
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;april&stage;1:=excited.png,But I don’t know if the turtle miraculous holder likes pizza that much... or sewers. He definitely knows a lot about Ancient China though!
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;2:=calm.png,But that’s a good thing. You’re just like Chloe, and you’re so mean I can’t imagine you’d have nice powers.
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;2:=alarmed.png,F-flooding? <i>D-de l'eau dans vos chaussette?</i> Um... I-is this a euphemism?
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;other&character;zoey&stage;2:=alarmed.png,HBO? Wait, this isn’t on TV? W-wait, HBO has things like this on it?
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;4:=excited.png,Here I go! Begone! THOT!
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;2:=calm.png,Hmm... Well, I guess there's other types of heroes out there... other types of girls with magic too, I suppose!
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kimberly&stage;2:=wink.png,I guess if it's strip poker, more layers would help... but I thought for sure it'd just be a sweatshirt, to fit in with your aesthetic!
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;1:=bored.png,I never really understood the appeal of thongs.
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;1:=wink.png,Sandals seem… Attire appropriate.
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;1:=wink.png,I’m glad you’re having fun!
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;1:=excited.png,It’s great playing with you too, Nagisa!
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;2:=alarmed.png,I-I’m excited to see more!
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;sayori&stage;0:=calm.png,I'm glad Sayori is so excitable! Even if she's a bit spacy.
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;ann&stage;0:=confident.png,I've seen so many of your shoots! You really, really know how to own your apparel!
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;2:=excited.png,Jeez, ~player~, have you considered asking Natsuki on a date, or what?
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;2&saidmarker;socks:=embarrassed.png,Kyu wait! I'll take off something just so you don't have to if you'll---
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;pearl&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Not in a bad way, just in a way that seems enchanted.
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;weiss&stage;2:=wink.png,Not that anyone here seems to care about your money but you.
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;4:=wink.png,Of course, Palutena, I’m here to win too! (And at this point it looks like we’re having more fun than worry. Palutena does these asides too, so that’s okay for me, right?)
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;4:=wink.png,Not that you really need me to, but I won’t let you fall under the akuma’s power!
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;dark_magician_girl&stage;4:=confident.png,Oh! I'm not the only one with that kind of talent... Um, as you may have seen.
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:=wink.png,Oh! Is this what people mean when they say they want to shoot all over me? Is this just how some people undress in those old Western movies? ?
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;juri&stage;1:=confused.png,Oh! Your gloves! Here I was thinking you'd take off your hairties or something.
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kyoko&stage;5:=bored.png,Oh, Kyoko…
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;2:=bored.png,Oh.
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;dark_magician_girl&stage;2:=alarmed.png,O-oh. I-is that so? Hm.
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:=confident.png,O-Okay. I'll go ahead and hope you know how to use... Whatever skill you're using.
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;2:=alarmed.png,Since they’re part of your body-- The wings, not the socks!
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,So given how things are going, maybe I should kiss you for luck?
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika:=wink.png,The bad guys better watch out!
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;3:=alarmed.png,This is very interesting. But aren’t those kind of dirty? I-I mean not that being dirty is bad but--
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;2:=wink.png,This whole thing's a little awkward but let’s try to stay calm and collected, okay?
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;2:=alarmed.png,Um. I can't say I've ever had to worry about it. Sometimes afterwards, but never during! I guess it's a side effect of my Miraculous?
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;0:=calm.png,Those actually look really well made! I'm not one for armor, but it's nice to see you care about more than durability.
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;0:=excited.png,Wow, Corrin, those look really stylish and actually durable!
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Though... I haven't really seen a Miraculous compartmentalize like this...
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;3:=alarmed.png,Um, but. I, er. Spinning bird kick. Can you teach it to me?
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:=confused.png,Um. If you even want to take off your shoes... er... which you halready lave-- already have! Y-you risk showing your-- um. You know.
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:=bored.png,I-I guess you've already shown your underwear on accident-- um, is that the wrong thing to say?!
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;other&character;zone-tan&stage;2:,marker:ztentacles=alarmed.png,Um. People can enjoy sex however they want, Zone-tan, but I think most people prefer not to have their wardrobes damaged in the process!
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;chica&stage;0:=alarmed.png,W-wait, that’s the one with the possessed animatronics! I have to free Chica from the Akuma, now!
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;shego&stage;0:=confident.png,You may not use an akuma, but I'll stop you anyway!
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;2:=alarmed.png,Y-your... Husband? D-does he know you're at a game like this!?
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;2:=alarmed.png,I-I would never come here if I had a partner at home!
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=alarmed.png,Don’t encourage her, Zone! You don’t have some big amorphous blob that can shield us with tentacles!

4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;ayano:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_stripping:=alarmed.png,It looks like you spend just as much time playing cards as you do practicing empathy, Ayano.
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;ayano:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;ayano_stripping:=confused.png,It’s just ~clothing~, Ayano. I think you’re overreacting. (I’m going to keep an eye out for any butterflies, just in case... This seems bad.)
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kim&stage;0:,count-role;self&saidmarker;kim_similar:=embarrassed.png,Just less dressed.

4-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;1:=wink.png,I really think well-made armor can keep you really mobile, right? Maybe just not as mobile as me.
4-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;1:=confident.png,I'm really not one for armor, but my suit does really increase my pain tolerance and agility.
4-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;kyoko&stage;6:=confused.png,I’m so sorry. I wish my Lucky Charm could heal those. You’re still an amazing detective, I can tell even from this game…

4-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;3:=wink.png,I'd say you're finally coming out of your shell, Corrin, but you definitely seem fine with this.

4-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;2:=excited.png,I’ve never really seen a statuesque person undress before, so this is a bit novel to me.
4-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;2:=wink.png,I-I mean. I don't know what's going on. I wouldn't come to a game like this for <i>Adrien</i> or anything. Um. I guess a girl has to have her secrets, huh, Natsuki?
4-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;3:=wink.png,I'm glad one of us doesn't <i>seem</i> too concerned with losing. Don't worry. If you don't get your "grief seed," I'll make sure I do get my <i>akuma</i>.

4-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;4:=wink.png,It certainly seems to help fight off <i>your</i> Akuma. I figured it'd help me with mine!
4-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;4:=wink.png,I mean, you <i>did</i> just take off your boots.
4-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;4:=wink.png,I'd be happy to show you some tricks of my own, if you'd like!
4-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,J-just because I don’t get a lot of chances to look at body art. But even without the art you’re really… You know…

4-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;3:=wink.png,Okay, okay, okay. Saki, how about a hug? If you're cold or embarrassed, nothing fixes both like a big hug. And believe me, I need lots of hugs!
4-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;shego&stage;1:=bored.png,One piece of clothing at a time! Er... Hopefully losing here will make you rethink things?
4-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,O-oh. I guess it didn’t work… Maybe she meant Thoth, like that Egyptian god the Pharaoh channeled?
4-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;chica&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,O-oh. Well, this is embarrassing. I’m not really used to… Um… A scenario where something like you wasn’t just possessed.

5-male_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;2:,marker:cap_steve=calm.png,I can call you that, right? Now that we’re both unmasked?
5-male_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;3:=wink.png,It's nice that you won't be walking away from the game. (Though you could walk your way into...)
5-male_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Tamokoma Branch? Is that like... your hero organization? The trivia's fine, Jin. Kind of like the rest of you... Er--
5-male_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,The rest of you looks much better. Um. Especially the... Not clothes parts.
5-male_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;palutena:=embarrassed.png,Yeah, sandals are a bit... Um. (How do I say they're not attractive without being really mean?)
5-male_removed_minor=alarmed.png,You must be working for Hawk Moth.
5-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;3:=alarmed.png,A-anyway, let's keep playing! D-don't pay me too much mind!
5-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;3:=confident.png,Hmm. I-I was kind of expecting a different answer! (Tellement pour espérer qu'il allait me dire.)
5-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;4:=confused.png,Huh? What's a Trion body? Is that kind of like my transformation and powers?
5-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;3:=wink.png,I suppose there's something to be said about self-servicing... er... fashion design-wise, anyway.
5-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_m&stage;3:=wink.png,I think you can be gentle without being weak or cowardly. Don't lose the first part, Corrin.
5-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,O-oh my. You’re very striking under that helmet, Captain America. (<i>Ca valait la peine.</i>)
5-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;3:,count-role;other&character;palutena:=bored.png,Hmm. (I can't figure these two out! I've known Tikki for a long time, but I'm guessing divine figures are just like this!)
5-female_removing_minor=excited.png,I wanted to be a trendsetter...Not like this, though.
5-female_removing_minor=bored.png,I-is that it?
5-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;sanako&stage;0:=calm.png,(Hmm... she seems oddly familiar...)
5-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;1:=excited.png,<i>Merveilleux! I</i> see what's going on here...
5-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;1:=confused.png,A "soul gem?" Hmm... is that where you store your guardian spirit to transform?
5-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:=alarmed.png,Ahh!!! Could you stop shooting like that!
5-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:=confident.png,It is a pretty impressive skill, at least. But please don't hurt anyone!
5-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;0:=wink.png,Because you look really punk-y!
5-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;april&stage;1:=excited.png,But I don’t know if the turtle miraculous holder likes pizza that much... or sewers. He definitely knows a lot about Ancient China though!
5-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;2:=calm.png,But that’s a good thing. You’re just like Chloe, and you’re so mean I can’t imagine you’d have nice powers.
5-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;2:=alarmed.png,F-flooding? <i>D-de l'eau dans vos chaussette?</i> Um... I-is this a euphemism?
5-female_removing_minor,count-role;other&character;zoey&stage;2:=alarmed.png,HBO? Wait, this isn’t on TV? W-wait, HBO has things like this on it?
5-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;4:=excited.png,Here I go! Begone! THOT!
5-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;2:=calm.png,Hmm... Well, I guess there's other types of heroes out there... other types of girls with magic too, I suppose!
5-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kimberly&stage;2:=wink.png,I guess if it's strip poker, more layers would help... but I thought for sure it'd just be a sweatshirt, to fit in with your aesthetic!
5-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;1:=bored.png,I never really understood the appeal of thongs.
5-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;1:=wink.png,Sandals seem… Attire appropriate.
5-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;1:=wink.png,I’m glad you’re having fun!
5-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;1:=excited.png,It’s great playing with you too, Nagisa!
5-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;2:=alarmed.png,I-I’m excited to see more!
5-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;sayori&stage;0:=calm.png,I'm glad Sayori is so excitable! Even if she's a bit spacy.
5-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;ann&stage;0:=confident.png,I've seen so many of your shoots! You really, really know how to own your apparel!
5-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;2:=excited.png,Jeez, ~player~, have you considered asking Natsuki on a date, or what?
5-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;2&saidmarker;socks:=embarrassed.png,Kyu wait! I'll take off something just so you don't have to if you'll---
5-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;pearl&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Not in a bad way, just in a way that seems enchanted.
5-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;weiss&stage;2:=wink.png,Not that anyone here seems to care about your money but you.
5-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;4:=wink.png,Of course, Palutena, I’m here to win too! (And at this point it looks like we’re having more fun than worry. Palutena does these asides too, so that’s okay for me, right?)
5-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;4:=wink.png,Not that you really need me to, but I won’t let you fall under the akuma’s power!
5-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;dark_magician_girl&stage;4:=confident.png,Oh! I'm not the only one with that kind of talent... Um, as you may have seen.
5-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:=wink.png,Oh! Is this what people mean when they say they want to shoot all over me? Is this just how some people undress in those old Western movies? ?
5-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;juri&stage;1:=confused.png,Oh! Your gloves! Here I was thinking you'd take off your hairties or something.
5-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kyoko&stage;5:=bored.png,Oh, Kyoko…
5-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;2:=bored.png,Oh.
5-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;dark_magician_girl&stage;2:=alarmed.png,O-oh. I-is that so? Hm.
5-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:=confident.png,O-Okay. I'll go ahead and hope you know how to use... Whatever skill you're using.
5-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;2:=alarmed.png,Since they’re part of your body-- The wings, not the socks!
5-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,So given how things are going, maybe I should kiss you for luck?
5-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika:=wink.png,The bad guys better watch out!
5-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;3:=alarmed.png,This is very interesting. But aren’t those kind of dirty? I-I mean not that being dirty is bad but--
5-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;2:=wink.png,This whole thing's a little awkward but let’s try to stay calm and collected, okay?
5-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;2:=alarmed.png,Um. I can't say I've ever had to worry about it. Sometimes afterwards, but never during! I guess it's a side effect of my Miraculous?
5-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;0:=calm.png,Those actually look really well made! I'm not one for armor, but it's nice to see you care about more than durability.
5-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;0:=excited.png,Wow, Corrin, those look really stylish and actually durable!
5-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Though... I haven't really seen a Miraculous compartmentalize like this...
5-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;3:=alarmed.png,Um, but. I, er. Spinning bird kick. Can you teach it to me?
5-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:=confused.png,Um. If you even want to take off your shoes... er... which you halready lave-- already have! Y-you risk showing your-- um. You know.
5-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:=bored.png,I-I guess you've already shown your underwear on accident-- um, is that the wrong thing to say?!
5-female_removing_minor,count-role;other&character;zone-tan&stage;2:,marker:ztentacles=alarmed.png,Um. People can enjoy sex however they want, Zone-tan, but I think most people prefer not to have their wardrobes damaged in the process!
5-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;chica&stage;0:=alarmed.png,W-wait, that’s the one with the possessed animatronics! I have to free Chica from the Akuma, now!
5-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;shego&stage;0:=confident.png,You may not use an akuma, but I'll stop you anyway!
5-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;2:=alarmed.png,Y-your... Husband? D-does he know you're at a game like this!?
5-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;2:=alarmed.png,I-I would never come here if I had a partner at home!
5-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=alarmed.png,Don’t encourage her, Zone! You don’t have some big amorphous blob that can shield us with tentacles!
5-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;florina:=embarrassed.png,Er, I meant--You know, morally. Not...Mortally. Erk.
5-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;futaba:=embarrassed.png,Er. We're not-- I'm not-- I mean, she's really pretty but--! I mean I would be <i>interested</i>
5-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;4:,count-role;other&character;shego:=confident.png,Er… I’m not going to go easy on you, Palutena, but I think Shego is a bigger problem if we don’t stop her now.
5-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kim&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;shego:=embarrassed.png,I-I mean, relationship as in friendship or rivalship?
5-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;ayano:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_stripping:=alarmed.png,It looks like you spend just as much time playing cards as you do practicing empathy, Ayano.
5-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;ayano:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;ayano_stripping:=confused.png,It’s just ~clothing~, Ayano. I think you’re overreacting. (I’m going to keep an eye out for any butterflies, just in case... This seems bad.)
5-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kim&stage;0:,count-role;self&saidmarker;kim_similar:=embarrassed.png,Just less dressed.
5-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;yang:=wink.png,O-or if you aren’t, that’s okay too? Everyone has secrets! Love or otherwise.
5-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;4:,count-role;other&character;neo:=confident.png,Palutena, I know Neo is pint-sized, but we should focus on making sure we can take her down… But if you don’t want me to go easy on you...
5-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;shego&stage;0:,count-role;other&character;sei:=confident.png,Sei, can you just arrest Shego? I’d like to see her tied up. I-I mean behind bars.
5-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_mariba:,count-role;other&character;futaba&saidmarker;saki_befriend_mariba:=excited.png,"Pwn?" Er... well, I'm guessing if we got loaded up on sugar and got all dressed up, getting competitive does seem a <i>little</i> fun... What do you think, Saki?
5-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_ladity:,count-role;other&character;uravity&saidmarker;saki_befriend_ladity:=confident.png,Hmm… I mean, I’ve done <i>saunas</i> but… Err, well, okay, let’s do this, but we have to do some skincare and go for crepes afterwards.
5-female_removing_minor,count-yandere:1-3,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=confident.png,~name~ has really pretty eyes, and a good sense of herself.
5-female_removing_minor,count-yandere:1-3,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;4:=confident.png,We’re all friends and heroes here, Palutena. But hopefully you can stay in the game long enough to help me subdue <i>her</i>!

5-female_removing_minor,priority:0,count-yandere:1-3,count-fashionable&role;target&stage;3-5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=wink.png,~name~ has killer fashion sense. Believe me. I’d know.

5-female_removing_minor,priority:0,count-yandere:1-3,count-mean&role;target&stage;3-5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=confused.png,You know, she does have a point about your attitude, ~name~...
5-female_removing_minor,priority:0,count-yandere:1-3,count-princess&role;target&stage;3-5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=wink.png,~name~ guides and protects her people with great skill.

5-female_removing_minor,priority:0,count-yandere:1-3,count-taken&role;target&stage;3-5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=wink.png,~name~ is already in a committed relationship, and she doesn’t need ~player~, but given how you’re acting, you definitely don’t need them either!

5-female_removing_minor,count-yandere:1-3,count-yandere&role;target:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=bored.png,What are we to do with you, ~name~?
5-female_removing_minor,count-yandere:1-3,count-yandere&role;target:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=bored.png,I hope you really get your act together...

5-female_removed_minor=alarmed.png,You must be working for Hawk Moth.
5-female_removed_minor=embarrassed.png,I had just hoped I’d be recognized for something like designing clothes, or saving the world.
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;dark_magician_girl&stage;3:=wink.png,(She looks kind of like a frillier, female Adrien... Hmm...)
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;3:=confused.png,A-Aimee, I'd use my Lucky Charm to reverse time if you made a mistake, but there's no akumas here for me to use it on...
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;3:=alarmed.png,A-Aimee, I might die of embarrassment, but if you do that wrong, you'll actually die!
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;3:=alarmed.png,Aimee! You sure aren’t making sounds like that was a sure shot! Be careful!
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;alpha&stage;5:=confident.png,Alpha, I know you're digital but... You're pretty and definitely express your personality well. That's all you.
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika:=confident.png,And with Nadeshiko helping you out, you already have a super strong team!
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;pearl&stage;2:=calm.png,And you certainly seem enchanting! I guess if you're not Akumatized, you're alright by me!
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;4&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=confused.png,Er... if you want to stop, Nayru, I think most people here would be okay with it... no need to push yourself!
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;3:=alarmed.png,Er… about that… Er! H-hold on, don't panic, I can explain!
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:=bored.png,Erm, Aimee... This seems very, very dangerous. And if a hero is telling you that...
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:=excited.png,At very least, I don't have to worry about you as a villain... You seem to only hit yourself...
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;alpha&stage;2:=confident.png,Hmm... Maybe now's not a great time, but could you do... Fashion Victim by Green Day?
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;zoey&stage;2:,marker:feet=bored.png,I mean, you’re an attractive woman taking off her clothes… Wait, did you mean… Your feet?
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;zoey&stage;2:,marker:feet=confused.png,Er… What, the feet? Is this a thing people…
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;1:=wink.png,I really think well-made armor can keep you really mobile, right? Maybe just not as mobile as me.
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;1:=confident.png,I'm really not one for armor, but my suit does really increase my pain tolerance and agility.
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;kyoko&stage;6:=confused.png,I’m so sorry. I wish my Lucky Charm could heal those. You’re still an amazing detective, I can tell even from this game…
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;other&character;zone-tan&stage;6:,marker:ztentacles=confident.png,I’m sure, even faced with a tentacle monster, ~name~ would hold her ground, Zone! No wardrobe destruction. Or. Um. Destruction of orifices.
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;3:=wink.png,I'd say you're finally coming out of your shell, Corrin, but you definitely seem fine with this.
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,I-I do mean sandals. M-meaning sandals are fine for the beach and your clothes, I just don’t like them. I-I’m not looking at your… Butt.
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;2:=excited.png,I’ve never really seen a statuesque person undress before, so this is a bit novel to me.
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;2:=wink.png,I-I mean. I don't know what's going on. I wouldn't come to a game like this for <i>Adrien</i> or anything. Um. I guess a girl has to have her secrets, huh, Natsuki?
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;3:=wink.png,I'm glad one of us doesn't <i>seem</i> too concerned with losing. Don't worry. If you don't get your "grief seed," I'll make sure I do get my <i>akuma</i>.
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;sayori&stage;1:=wink.png,I'm just really happy you have it together, Sayori! I have some other people to watch out for so they don't get Akumatized, but I'm glad you're emotionally stable!
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;4:=wink.png,It certainly seems to help fight off <i>your</i> Akuma. I figured it'd help me with mine!
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;4:=wink.png,I mean, you <i>did</i> just take off your boots.
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;4:=wink.png,I'd be happy to show you some tricks of my own, if you'd like!
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,J-just because I don’t get a lot of chances to look at body art. But even without the art you’re really… You know…
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,N-no?
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;3:=wink.png,Okay, okay, okay. Saki, how about a hug? If you're cold or embarrassed, nothing fixes both like a big hug. And believe me, I need lots of hugs!
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;shego&stage;1:=bored.png,One piece of clothing at a time! Er... Hopefully losing here will make you rethink things?
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,O-oh. I guess it didn’t work… Maybe she meant Thoth, like that Egyptian god the Pharaoh channeled?
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;chica&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,O-oh. Well, this is embarrassing. I’m not really used to… Um… A scenario where something like you wasn’t just possessed.
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,Palutena, I do have to wonder what a goddess looks like under her um...last lines of defense.
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;3:=confused.png,That sounds really embarrassing... Is that why you're so... O-oh. N-nevermind.
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,W-wait a second, t-that's-- That's so vulgar, GoGo!
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;nugi-chan&stage;3:=confident.png,They’re very classy, Nugi-chan. I recognize high quality clothing anywhere, and I’ll make sure they’re treated well!
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;sanako&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,This is somewhat odd to admit, but this isn't my first visit here... you seem very familiar, Sanako, but I don't think I can place how...
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;4:=excited.png,Um, what about your mouth? It’s very cute but <i>I’d</i> rather the only dirty parts be your language.
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,Um. Are your wings sensitive, Kyu?
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;2:=confused.png,Um...I don’t know about that. Maybe you’re a warmer person than me?
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,U-uhm. That looked hot! I mean, hot as not as your-- n-not as hot as-- um, when you had burnmarks-- er--!
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;3:=excited.png,Well! I applaud you being so clever! I’m definitely not sure what it would be like to take mine off piecemeal like that.
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;2:=calm.png,Well, my earrings are <i>kind of</i> like that gem of yours... does your kwami have a name?
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;other&character;sonya&stage;6&saidmarker;commando:=embarrassed.png,Whoa, Sonya. That's... Wow, body paint. I didn't think I was into this. I guess I am, though.
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;3:=confident.png,Wow! Those are cool tattoos, Blackrose!
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,U-um, those are tattoos, right? Those wavy things, and not scars? R-right?
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;3&saidmarker;socks:=confused.png,W-wait a minute! You shouldn't threaten self-harm like that!
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;3:=alarmed.png,W-whoa! You really didn't need to bring so many guns, Elaine!
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;3:=alarmed.png,I-I'm glad you're retting gid--getting rid of those guns, Elaine!
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;kimberly&stage;3:=excited.png,You look so cute, Kimberly! I-I get a little embarrassed when I bare my midriff, but you make it look great! E-er, you know what I mean.
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;4&saidmarker;null_possess:=excited.png,You seem like a weight's off your chest! What happened, Nayru?
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;3:=wink.png,You're really lucky Natsuki's so brave! This is usually a third or fourth date activity, and she's willing to do all this for <i>you</i>! It's romantic! In a way.
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;5:,count-role;other&character;lyn:=calm.png,Aww! You two are so sweet on each other!
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;florina&saidmarker;huey:=confident.png,Don’t worry, Florina! I’m sure Huey was safely out of range!
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;3:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=embarrassed.png,Erm. If you do though, could you please <i>not</i> bring it here?
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;3:,count-role;other&character;futaba:=confused.png,Futaba, I mean… I'm still interested in men but Gwen’s… Impressive in her own right...
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;3:,count-role;other&character;aimee:=embarrassed.png,H-hey Aimee! I-I just work with someone that's just as cute--I mean looks like her!
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;shego&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;sei:=embarrassed.png,I could tie her up with my yo-yo but I think she’d like that far too much...
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;3:,count-role;other&character;uravity:=embarrassed.png,I guess we're both kind of lost in this, huh, Ochako...?
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;kim&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;shego:=calm.png,It's not like I haven't had a similar bond with some of the villains I've fought...
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;shimmy:,count-role;other&character;zoey:,marker:shimmy=wink.png,Shimmy? Oh! That’s a fun word to say! Shimmy... Shimmy... Shimmy... Erk. Sorry, ~name~, I got distracted...
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;chica&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;alpha:=embarrassed.png,Well, I guess Alpha is an AI that’s not possessed… I think. I’m keeping an eye on you, Chica.
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;rodeo:,count-role;other&character;zoey:,marker:rodeo=confused.png,Zoey, what do you mean by rodeo?
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;3:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_mariba:,count-role;other&character;futaba&saidmarker;saki_befriend_mariba:=wink.png,Then we can talk about boys and stuff too. I actually already like Futaba's style, and I'm already kind of good at some games, so it's a great blend for Saki!
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;3:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_ladity:,count-role;other&character;uravity&saidmarker;saki_befriend_ladity:=wink.png,Um, yeah! Well, crepes and mudmasks and all that are popular wherever you go, right? This'll be great!
5-female_removed_minor,priority:305,count-role;target&character;florina:,count-exposed:1-5=confident.png,I understand how you feel, Florina, but nothing’s wrong. You’re doing great!
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;2:,count-male:1-5=wink.png,I think most people know a breastplate is also a chestplate. Don’t get so worried, Florina!


#lost pants
6-male_removing_minor=bored.png,Oh. I-, um. I guess that’s okay.
6-male_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;0:=bored.png,<i>And costume for…</i> Oh.
6-male_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_m&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,E-er. Hm. I think I prefer men that are a bit more... masculine.
6-male_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;2:,marker:cap_steve=calm.png,I can call you that, right? Now that we’re both unmasked?
6-male_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;3:=wink.png,It's nice that you won't be walking away from the game. (Though you could walk your way into...)
6-male_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Tamokoma Branch? Is that like... your hero organization? The trivia's fine, Jin. Kind of like the rest of you... Er--
6-male_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,The rest of you looks much better. Um. Especially the... Not clothes parts.
6-male_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;palutena:=embarrassed.png,Yeah, sandals are a bit... Um. (How do I say they're not attractive without being really mean?)
6-male_removed_minor=confident.png,If it were Adrien, I might make an exception... But it seems a bit rude that’s all you’re taking off at this point!
6-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;3:=alarmed.png,A-anyway, let's keep playing! D-don't pay me too much mind!
6-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;3:=confident.png,Hmm. I-I was kind of expecting a different answer! (Tellement pour espérer qu'il allait me dire.)
6-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;4:=confused.png,Huh? What's a Trion body? Is that kind of like my transformation and powers?
6-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;3:=wink.png,I suppose there's something to be said about self-servicing... er... fashion design-wise, anyway.
6-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_m&stage;3:=wink.png,I think you can be gentle without being weak or cowardly. Don't lose the first part, Corrin.
6-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,O-oh my. You’re very striking under that helmet, Captain America. (<i>Ca valait la peine.</i>)
6-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;3:,count-role;other&character;palutena:=bored.png,Hmm. (I can't figure these two out! I've known Tikki for a long time, but I'm guessing divine figures are just like this!)
6-female_removing_minor=alarmed.png,I had thought there was an akuma here…
6-female_removing_minor=bored.png,Oh. I-, um. I guess that’s okay.
6-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;sanako&stage;0:=calm.png,(Hmm... she seems oddly familiar...)
6-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;1:=excited.png,<i>Merveilleux! I</i> see what's going on here...
6-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;1:=confused.png,A "soul gem?" Hmm... is that where you store your guardian spirit to transform?
6-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:=alarmed.png,Ahh!!! Could you stop shooting like that!
6-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:=confident.png,It is a pretty impressive skill, at least. But please don't hurt anyone!
6-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;0:=wink.png,Because you look really punk-y!
6-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;april&stage;1:=excited.png,But I don’t know if the turtle miraculous holder likes pizza that much... or sewers. He definitely knows a lot about Ancient China though!
6-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;2:=calm.png,But that’s a good thing. You’re just like Chloe, and you’re so mean I can’t imagine you’d have nice powers.
6-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;2:=alarmed.png,F-flooding? <i>D-de l'eau dans vos chaussette?</i> Um... I-is this a euphemism?
6-female_removing_minor,count-role;other&character;zoey&stage;2:=alarmed.png,HBO? Wait, this isn’t on TV? W-wait, HBO has things like this on it?
6-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;4:=excited.png,Here I go! Begone! THOT!
6-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;2:=calm.png,Hmm... Well, I guess there's other types of heroes out there... other types of girls with magic too, I suppose!
6-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kimberly&stage;2:=wink.png,I guess if it's strip poker, more layers would help... but I thought for sure it'd just be a sweatshirt, to fit in with your aesthetic!
6-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;1:=bored.png,I never really understood the appeal of thongs.
6-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;1:=wink.png,Sandals seem… Attire appropriate.
6-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;1:=wink.png,I’m glad you’re having fun!
6-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;1:=excited.png,It’s great playing with you too, Nagisa!
6-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;3:=excited.png,I’m sorry, I’ve been waiting to make that pun all game. You don’t seem like a stranger to <i>pun</i>-ishment, either, Kyu!
6-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;2:=alarmed.png,I-I’m excited to see more!
6-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;sayori&stage;0:=calm.png,I'm glad Sayori is so excitable! Even if she's a bit spacy.
6-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;ann&stage;0:=confident.png,I've seen so many of your shoots! You really, really know how to own your apparel!
6-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;2:=excited.png,Jeez, ~player~, have you considered asking Natsuki on a date, or what?
6-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;2&saidmarker;socks:=embarrassed.png,Kyu wait! I'll take off something just so you don't have to if you'll---
6-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;pearl&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Not in a bad way, just in a way that seems enchanted.
6-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;weiss&stage;2:=wink.png,Not that anyone here seems to care about your money but you.
6-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;4:=wink.png,Of course, Palutena, I’m here to win too! (And at this point it looks like we’re having more fun than worry. Palutena does these asides too, so that’s okay for me, right?)
6-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;4:=wink.png,Not that you really need me to, but I won’t let you fall under the akuma’s power!
6-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;2:=confident.png,Oh! <i>Oui!</i> You have really good legs for someone who can fly
6-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;dark_magician_girl&stage;4:=confident.png,Oh! I'm not the only one with that kind of talent... Um, as you may have seen.
6-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:=wink.png,Oh! Is this what people mean when they say they want to shoot all over me? Is this just how some people undress in those old Western movies? ?
6-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;juri&stage;1:=confused.png,Oh! Your gloves! Here I was thinking you'd take off your hairties or something.
6-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kyoko&stage;5:=bored.png,Oh, Kyoko…
6-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;2:=bored.png,Oh.
6-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;dark_magician_girl&stage;2:=alarmed.png,O-oh. I-is that so? Hm.
6-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:=confident.png,O-Okay. I'll go ahead and hope you know how to use... Whatever skill you're using.
6-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,So given how things are going, maybe I should kiss you for luck?
6-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika:=wink.png,The bad guys better watch out!
6-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;2:=wink.png,This whole thing's a little awkward but let’s try to stay calm and collected, okay?
6-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;2:=alarmed.png,Um. I can't say I've ever had to worry about it. Sometimes afterwards, but never during! I guess it's a side effect of my Miraculous?
6-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;0:=calm.png,Those actually look really well made! I'm not one for armor, but it's nice to see you care about more than durability.
6-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;0:=excited.png,Wow, Corrin, those look really stylish and actually durable!
6-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Though... I haven't really seen a Miraculous compartmentalize like this...
6-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;3:=alarmed.png,Um, but. I, er. Spinning bird kick. Can you teach it to me?
6-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:=confused.png,Um. If you even want to take off your shoes... er... which you halready lave-- already have! Y-you risk showing your-- um. You know.
6-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:=bored.png,I-I guess you've already shown your underwear on accident-- um, is that the wrong thing to say?!
6-female_removing_minor,count-role;other&character;zone-tan&stage;2:,marker:ztentacles=alarmed.png,Um. People can enjoy sex however they want, Zone-tan, but I think most people prefer not to have their wardrobes damaged in the process!
6-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;chica&stage;0:=alarmed.png,W-wait, that’s the one with the possessed animatronics! I have to free Chica from the Akuma, now!
6-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;shego&stage;0:=confident.png,You may not use an akuma, but I'll stop you anyway!
6-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;2:=alarmed.png,Y-your... Husband? D-does he know you're at a game like this!?
6-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;2:=alarmed.png,I-I would never come here if I had a partner at home!
6-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=alarmed.png,Don’t encourage her, Zone! You don’t have some big amorphous blob that can shield us with tentacles!
6-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;florina:=embarrassed.png,Er, I meant--You know, morally. Not...Mortally. Erk.
6-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;futaba:=embarrassed.png,Er. We're not-- I'm not-- I mean, she's really pretty but--! I mean I would be <i>interested</i>
6-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;4:,count-role;other&character;shego:=confident.png,Er… I’m not going to go easy on you, Palutena, but I think Shego is a bigger problem if we don’t stop her now.
6-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kim&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;shego:=embarrassed.png,I-I mean, relationship as in friendship or rivalship?
6-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;ayano:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_stripping:=alarmed.png,It looks like you spend just as much time playing cards as you do practicing empathy, Ayano.
6-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;ayano:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;ayano_stripping:=confused.png,It’s just ~clothing~, Ayano. I think you’re overreacting. (I’m going to keep an eye out for any butterflies, just in case... This seems bad.)
6-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kim&stage;0:,count-role;self&saidmarker;kim_similar:=embarrassed.png,Just less dressed.
6-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;yang:=wink.png,O-or if you aren’t, that’s okay too? Everyone has secrets! Love or otherwise.
6-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;4:,count-role;other&character;neo:=confident.png,Palutena, I know Neo is pint-sized, but we should focus on making sure we can take her down… But if you don’t want me to go easy on you...
6-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;shego&stage;0:,count-role;other&character;sei:=confident.png,Sei, can you just arrest Shego? I’d like to see her tied up. I-I mean behind bars.

6-female_removing_minor,priority:0,count-yandere:1-3,count-video_game&role;target&stage;3-5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=wink.png,~name~ is adored by her fans, and is used to facing danger. You better watch your threats!
6-female_removing_minor,priority:0,count-yandere:1-3,count-villain&role;target&stage;3-5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=wink.png,Just because ~name~ is misguided, doesn’t mean that she doesn’t have redeeming qualities. Maybe if you didn’t pick on her, she wouldn’t do what she does?
6-female_removing_minor,count-yandere:1-3,count-yandere&role;target:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=bored.png,What are we to do with you, ~name~?
6-female_removing_minor,count-yandere:1-3,count-yandere&role;target:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=bored.png,I hope you really get your act together...
6-female_removing_minor,count-yandere:1-3,count-yandere&role;target:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=confident.png,I can't let you be a danger to others, ~name~! Er-- apparently, I can't just fight you... that's security's job...
6-female_removing_minor,count-yandere:1-3,count-yandere&role;target:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=embarrassed.png,You should be ashamed of how you've been treating other people, ~name~.
6-female_removing_minor,count-yandere:1-3,count-yandere&role;target:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=confident.png,This serves you right.
6-female_removing_minor,count-yandere:1-3,count-yandere&role;target:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=alarmed.png,T-there's no akuma here, is there, just ~name~ and her whole yandere stuff!
6-female_removed_minor=confused.png,But I’ve never seen an akuma take over clothing that small before.
6-female_removed_minor=wink.png,At least the game is kind of fun. A little bit.
6-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;dark_magician_girl&stage;3:=wink.png,(She looks kind of like a frillier, female Adrien... Hmm...)
6-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;3:=confused.png,A-Aimee, I'd use my Lucky Charm to reverse time if you made a mistake, but there's no akumas here for me to use it on...
6-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;3:=alarmed.png,A-Aimee, I might die of embarrassment, but if you do that wrong, you'll actually die!
6-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;3:=alarmed.png,Aimee! You sure aren’t making sounds like that was a sure shot! Be careful!
6-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;alpha&stage;5:=confident.png,Alpha, I know you're digital but... You're pretty and definitely express your personality well. That's all you.
6-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika:=confident.png,And with Nadeshiko helping you out, you already have a super strong team!
6-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;pearl&stage;2:=calm.png,And you certainly seem enchanting! I guess if you're not Akumatized, you're alright by me!
6-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;4&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=confused.png,Er... if you want to stop, Nayru, I think most people here would be okay with it... no need to push yourself!
6-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;3:=alarmed.png,Er… about that… Er! H-hold on, don't panic, I can explain!
6-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:=bored.png,Erm, Aimee... This seems very, very dangerous. And if a hero is telling you that...
6-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:=excited.png,At very least, I don't have to worry about you as a villain... You seem to only hit yourself...
6-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;alpha&stage;2:=confident.png,Hmm... Maybe now's not a great time, but could you do... Fashion Victim by Green Day?
6-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;zoey&stage;2:,marker:feet=bored.png,I mean, you’re an attractive woman taking off her clothes… Wait, did you mean… Your feet?
6-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;zoey&stage;2:,marker:feet=confused.png,Er… What, the feet? Is this a thing people…
6-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;1:=wink.png,I really think well-made armor can keep you really mobile, right? Maybe just not as mobile as me.
6-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;1:=confident.png,I'm really not one for armor, but my suit does really increase my pain tolerance and agility.
6-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;3:=excited.png,I run and jump a lot to get this toned, I’m a bit jealous you’re naturally like that.
6-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;kyoko&stage;6:=confused.png,I’m so sorry. I wish my Lucky Charm could heal those. You’re still an amazing detective, I can tell even from this game…
6-female_removed_minor,count-role;other&character;zone-tan&stage;6:,marker:ztentacles=confident.png,I’m sure, even faced with a tentacle monster, ~name~ would hold her ground, Zone! No wardrobe destruction. Or. Um. Destruction of orifices.
6-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;3:=wink.png,I'd say you're finally coming out of your shell, Corrin, but you definitely seem fine with this.
6-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,I-I do mean sandals. M-meaning sandals are fine for the beach and your clothes, I just don’t like them. I-I’m not looking at your… Butt.
6-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;2:=excited.png,I’ve never really seen a statuesque person undress before, so this is a bit novel to me.
6-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;2:=wink.png,I-I mean. I don't know what's going on. I wouldn't come to a game like this for <i>Adrien</i> or anything. Um. I guess a girl has to have her secrets, huh, Natsuki?
6-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,I-I tend to get a little nervous when I’m exposed like this. You’re definitely making my night, I <i>pink</i>.
6-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;3:=wink.png,I'm glad one of us doesn't <i>seem</i> too concerned with losing. Don't worry. If you don't get your "grief seed," I'll make sure I do get my <i>akuma</i>.
6-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;sayori&stage;1:=wink.png,I'm just really happy you have it together, Sayori! I have some other people to watch out for so they don't get Akumatized, but I'm glad you're emotionally stable!
6-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;4:=wink.png,It certainly seems to help fight off <i>your</i> Akuma. I figured it'd help me with mine!
6-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;4:=wink.png,I mean, you <i>did</i> just take off your boots.
6-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;4:=wink.png,I'd be happy to show you some tricks of my own, if you'd like!
6-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,J-just because I don’t get a lot of chances to look at body art. But even without the art you’re really… You know…
6-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,N-no?
6-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;3:=wink.png,Okay, okay, okay. Saki, how about a hug? If you're cold or embarrassed, nothing fixes both like a big hug. And believe me, I need lots of hugs!
6-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;shego&stage;1:=bored.png,One piece of clothing at a time! Er... Hopefully losing here will make you rethink things?
6-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,O-oh. I guess it didn’t work… Maybe she meant Thoth, like that Egyptian god the Pharaoh channeled?
6-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;chica&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,O-oh. Well, this is embarrassing. I’m not really used to… Um… A scenario where something like you wasn’t just possessed.
6-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,Palutena, I do have to wonder what a goddess looks like under her um...last lines of defense.
6-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;3:=confused.png,That sounds really embarrassing... Is that why you're so... O-oh. N-nevermind.
6-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,W-wait a second, t-that's-- That's so vulgar, GoGo!
6-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;nugi-chan&stage;3:=confident.png,They’re very classy, Nugi-chan. I recognize high quality clothing anywhere, and I’ll make sure they’re treated well!
6-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;sanako&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,This is somewhat odd to admit, but this isn't my first visit here... you seem very familiar, Sanako, but I don't think I can place how...
6-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;2:=confused.png,Um...I don’t know about that. Maybe you’re a warmer person than me?
6-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,U-uhm. That looked hot! I mean, hot as not as your-- n-not as hot as-- um, when you had burnmarks-- er--!
6-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;3:=excited.png,Well! I applaud you being so clever! I’m definitely not sure what it would be like to take mine off piecemeal like that.
6-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;2:=calm.png,Well, my earrings are <i>kind of</i> like that gem of yours... does your kwami have a name?
6-female_removed_minor,count-role;other&character;sonya&stage;6&saidmarker;commando:=embarrassed.png,Whoa, Sonya. That's... Wow, body paint. I didn't think I was into this. I guess I am, though.
6-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;3:=confident.png,Wow! Those are cool tattoos, Blackrose!
6-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,U-um, those are tattoos, right? Those wavy things, and not scars? R-right?
6-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;3&saidmarker;socks:=confused.png,W-wait a minute! You shouldn't threaten self-harm like that!
6-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;3:=alarmed.png,W-whoa! You really didn't need to bring so many guns, Elaine!
6-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;3:=alarmed.png,I-I'm glad you're retting gid--getting rid of those guns, Elaine!
6-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;kimberly&stage;3:=excited.png,You look so cute, Kimberly! I-I get a little embarrassed when I bare my midriff, but you make it look great! E-er, you know what I mean.
6-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;4&saidmarker;null_possess:=excited.png,You seem like a weight's off your chest! What happened, Nayru?
6-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;3:=wink.png,You're really lucky Natsuki's so brave! This is usually a third or fourth date activity, and she's willing to do all this for <i>you</i>! It's romantic! In a way.
6-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;5:,count-role;other&character;lyn:=calm.png,Aww! You two are so sweet on each other!
6-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;florina&saidmarker;huey:=confident.png,Don’t worry, Florina! I’m sure Huey was safely out of range!
6-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;3:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=embarrassed.png,Erm. If you do though, could you please <i>not</i> bring it here?
6-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;3:,count-role;other&character;futaba:=confused.png,Futaba, I mean… I'm still interested in men but Gwen’s… Impressive in her own right...
6-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;3:,count-role;other&character;aimee:=embarrassed.png,H-hey Aimee! I-I just work with someone that's just as cute--I mean looks like her!
6-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;shego&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;sei:=embarrassed.png,I could tie her up with my yo-yo but I think she’d like that far too much...
6-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;3:,count-role;other&character;uravity:=embarrassed.png,I guess we're both kind of lost in this, huh, Ochako...?
6-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;kim&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;shego:=calm.png,It's not like I haven't had a similar bond with some of the villains I've fought...
6-female_removed_minor,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;shimmy:,count-role;other&character;zoey:,marker:shimmy=wink.png,Shimmy? Oh! That’s a fun word to say! Shimmy... Shimmy... Shimmy... Erk. Sorry, ~name~, I got distracted...
6-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;chica&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;alpha:=embarrassed.png,Well, I guess Alpha is an AI that’s not possessed… I think. I’m keeping an eye on you, Chica.
6-female_removed_minor,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;rodeo:,count-role;other&character;zoey:,marker:rodeo=confused.png,Zoey, what do you mean by rodeo?
6-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;3:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_mariba:,count-role;other&character;futaba&saidmarker;saki_befriend_mariba:=wink.png,Then we can talk about boys and stuff too. I actually already like Futaba's style, and I'm already kind of good at some games, so it's a great blend for Saki!
6-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;3:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_ladity:,count-role;other&character;uravity&saidmarker;saki_befriend_ladity:=wink.png,Um, yeah! Well, crepes and mudmasks and all that are popular wherever you go, right? This'll be great!
6-female_removed_minor,priority:305,count-role;target&character;florina:,count-exposed:1-5=confident.png,I understand how you feel, Florina, but nothing’s wrong. You’re doing great!
6-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;2:,count-male:1-5=wink.png,I think most people know a breastplate is also a chestplate. Don’t get so worried, Florina!


#lost bra
7-male_removing_minor=calm.png,Wonderful. I’ve shown you almost everything... And that’s the best you do?
7-male_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;3:=bored.png,Aww, are you sure about that, Jin? You could um... walk your way over to me. Er...
7-male_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_m&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,E-er. Hm. I think I prefer men that are a bit more... masculine.
7-male_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,The rest of you looks much better. Um. Especially the... Not clothes parts.
7-male_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;0:=calm.png,Um. I’ve kind of taken off... and you’re just now...
7-male_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;2:=confused.png,Yeah, yeah, you're going to make a "jack it" joke, Cat Noir, I already kn--
7-male_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;2:=bored.png,Y-you’re doing a lot better than I am. T-that’s all.
7-male_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;palutena:=embarrassed.png,Yeah, sandals are a bit... Um. (How do I say they're not attractive without being really mean?)
7-male_removed_minor=confused.png,It's miraculous that you're so far ahead...
7-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;3:=alarmed.png,A-anyway, let's keep playing! D-don't pay me too much mind!
7-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;4:=confused.png,Huh? What's a Trion body? Is that kind of like my transformation and powers?
7-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_m&stage;3:=wink.png,I think you can be gentle without being weak or cowardly. Don't lose the first part, Corrin.
7-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;4:=alarmed.png,I'm really much better at this when I'm in costume. Er... the flirting and such. It helps when the boy's in his costume too, though!
7-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;3:=alarmed.png,Maybe we should do some more practice, after this? Y-you know, in superheroics. Not strip poker. B-but if you really wanted, we totally could-! Ah! Nevermind, the lights here are just really bright and I’m going to stop talking.
7-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;3:=alarmed.png,--oir... Uh... this is kind of awkward... S-sorry, Jin, at least it's a flattering comparison?
7-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;1:=confused.png,O-oh my. You’re very… Distracting, Captain America. (<i>Ca valait la peine.</i>)
7-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;3:,count-role;other&character;palutena:=bored.png,Hmm. (I can't figure these two out! I've known Tikki for a long time, but I'm guessing divine figures are just like this!)
7-female_removing_minor=wink.png,Maybe it’s just the moment…
7-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;sanako&stage;0:=calm.png,(Hmm... she seems oddly familiar...)
7-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;1:=excited.png,<i>Merveilleux! I</i> see what's going on here...
7-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;1:=confused.png,A "soul gem?" Hmm... is that where you store your guardian spirit to transform?
7-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:=alarmed.png,Ahh!!! Could you stop shooting like that!
7-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:=confident.png,It is a pretty impressive skill, at least. But please don't hurt anyone!
7-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;0:=wink.png,Because you look really punk-y!
7-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;april&stage;1:=excited.png,But I don’t know if the turtle miraculous holder likes pizza that much... or sewers. He definitely knows a lot about Ancient China though!
7-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;2:=calm.png,But that’s a good thing. You’re just like Chloe, and you’re so mean I can’t imagine you’d have nice powers.
7-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;2:=alarmed.png,F-flooding? <i>D-de l'eau dans vos chaussette?</i> Um... I-is this a euphemism?
7-female_removing_minor,count-role;other&character;zoey&stage;2:=alarmed.png,HBO? Wait, this isn’t on TV? W-wait, HBO has things like this on it?
7-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;4:=excited.png,Here I go! Begone! THOT!
7-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;2:=calm.png,Hmm... Well, I guess there's other types of heroes out there... other types of girls with magic too, I suppose!
7-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kimberly&stage;2:=wink.png,I guess if it's strip poker, more layers would help... but I thought for sure it'd just be a sweatshirt, to fit in with your aesthetic!
7-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;1:=bored.png,I never really understood the appeal of thongs.
7-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;1:=wink.png,Sandals seem… Attire appropriate.
7-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;1:=wink.png,I’m glad you’re having fun!
7-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;1:=excited.png,It’s great playing with you too, Nagisa!
7-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;3:=excited.png,I’m sorry, I’ve been waiting to make that pun all game. You don’t seem like a stranger to <i>pun</i>-ishment, either, Kyu!
7-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;2:=alarmed.png,I-I’m excited to see more!
7-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;sayori&stage;0:=calm.png,I'm glad Sayori is so excitable! Even if she's a bit spacy.
7-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;ann&stage;0:=confident.png,I've seen so many of your shoots! You really, really know how to own your apparel!
7-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;2:=excited.png,Jeez, ~player~, have you considered asking Natsuki on a date, or what?
7-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;2&saidmarker;socks:=embarrassed.png,Kyu wait! I'll take off something just so you don't have to if you'll---
7-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;pearl&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Not in a bad way, just in a way that seems enchanted.
7-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;weiss&stage;2:=wink.png,Not that anyone here seems to care about your money but you.
7-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;4:=wink.png,Of course, Palutena, I’m here to win too! (And at this point it looks like we’re having more fun than worry. Palutena does these asides too, so that’s okay for me, right?)
7-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;4:=wink.png,Not that you really need me to, but I won’t let you fall under the akuma’s power!
7-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;2:=confident.png,Oh! <i>Oui!</i> You have really good legs for someone who can fly
7-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;dark_magician_girl&stage;4:=confident.png,Oh! I'm not the only one with that kind of talent... Um, as you may have seen.
7-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:=wink.png,Oh! Is this what people mean when they say they want to shoot all over me? Is this just how some people undress in those old Western movies? ?
7-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;juri&stage;1:=confused.png,Oh! Your gloves! Here I was thinking you'd take off your hairties or something.
7-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kyoko&stage;5:=bored.png,Oh, Kyoko…
7-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;2:=bored.png,Oh.
7-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;dark_magician_girl&stage;2:=alarmed.png,O-oh. I-is that so? Hm.
7-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:=confident.png,O-Okay. I'll go ahead and hope you know how to use... Whatever skill you're using.
7-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,So given how things are going, maybe I should kiss you for luck?
7-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika:=wink.png,The bad guys better watch out!
7-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;2:=wink.png,This whole thing's a little awkward but let’s try to stay calm and collected, okay?
7-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;2:=alarmed.png,Um. I can't say I've ever had to worry about it. Sometimes afterwards, but never during! I guess it's a side effect of my Miraculous?
7-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;0:=calm.png,Those actually look really well made! I'm not one for armor, but it's nice to see you care about more than durability.
7-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;0:=excited.png,Wow, Corrin, those look really stylish and actually durable!
7-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Though... I haven't really seen a Miraculous compartmentalize like this...
7-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;3:=alarmed.png,Um, but. I, er. Spinning bird kick. Can you teach it to me?
7-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:=confused.png,Um. If you even want to take off your shoes... er... which you halready lave-- already have! Y-you risk showing your-- um. You know.
7-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:=bored.png,I-I guess you've already shown your underwear on accident-- um, is that the wrong thing to say?!
7-female_removing_minor,count-role;other&character;zone-tan&stage;2:,marker:ztentacles=alarmed.png,Um. People can enjoy sex however they want, Zone-tan, but I think most people prefer not to have their wardrobes damaged in the process!
7-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;chica&stage;0:=alarmed.png,W-wait, that’s the one with the possessed animatronics! I have to free Chica from the Akuma, now!
7-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;shego&stage;0:=confident.png,You may not use an akuma, but I'll stop you anyway!
7-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;2:=alarmed.png,Y-your... Husband? D-does he know you're at a game like this!?
7-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;2:=alarmed.png,I-I would never come here if I had a partner at home!

7-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;4:,count-role;other&character;shego:=confident.png,Er… I’m not going to go easy on you, Palutena, but I think Shego is a bigger problem if we don’t stop her now.
7-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kim&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;shego:=embarrassed.png,I-I mean, relationship as in friendship or rivalship?
7-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;ayano:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_stripping:=alarmed.png,It looks like you spend just as much time playing cards as you do practicing empathy, Ayano.
7-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;ayano:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;ayano_stripping:=confused.png,It’s just ~clothing~, Ayano. I think you’re overreacting. (I’m going to keep an eye out for any butterflies, just in case... This seems bad.)
7-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kim&stage;0:,count-role;self&saidmarker;kim_similar:=embarrassed.png,Just less dressed.

7-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;4:,count-role;other&character;neo:=confident.png,Palutena, I know Neo is pint-sized, but we should focus on making sure we can take her down… But if you don’t want me to go easy on you...
7-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;shego&stage;0:,count-role;other&character;sei:=confident.png,Sei, can you just arrest Shego? I’d like to see her tied up. I-I mean behind bars.

7-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;dark_magician_girl&stage;3:=wink.png,(She looks kind of like a frillier, female Adrien... Hmm...)
7-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;3:=confused.png,A-Aimee, I'd use my Lucky Charm to reverse time if you made a mistake, but there's no akumas here for me to use it on...
7-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;3:=alarmed.png,A-Aimee, I might die of embarrassment, but if you do that wrong, you'll actually die!
7-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;3:=alarmed.png,Aimee! You sure aren’t making sounds like that was a sure shot! Be careful!
7-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;alpha&stage;5:=confident.png,Alpha, I know you're digital but... You're pretty and definitely express your personality well. That's all you.
7-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika:=confident.png,And with Nadeshiko helping you out, you already have a super strong team!
7-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;pearl&stage;2:=calm.png,And you certainly seem enchanting! I guess if you're not Akumatized, you're alright by me!

7-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:=bored.png,Erm, Aimee... This seems very, very dangerous. And if a hero is telling you that...
7-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:=excited.png,At very least, I don't have to worry about you as a villain... You seem to only hit yourself...
7-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;alpha&stage;2:=confident.png,Hmm... Maybe now's not a great time, but could you do... Fashion Victim by Green Day?
7-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;zoey&stage;2:,marker:feet=bored.png,I mean, you’re an attractive woman taking off her clothes… Wait, did you mean… Your feet?
7-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;zoey&stage;2:,marker:feet=confused.png,Er… What, the feet? Is this a thing people…
7-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;1:=wink.png,I really think well-made armor can keep you really mobile, right? Maybe just not as mobile as me.
7-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;1:=confident.png,I'm really not one for armor, but my suit does really increase my pain tolerance and agility.
7-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;3:=excited.png,I run and jump a lot to get this toned, I’m a bit jealous you’re naturally like that.
7-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;kyoko&stage;6:=confused.png,I’m so sorry. I wish my Lucky Charm could heal those. You’re still an amazing detective, I can tell even from this game…
7-female_removed_minor,count-role;other&character;zone-tan&stage;6:,marker:ztentacles=confident.png,I’m sure, even faced with a tentacle monster, ~name~ would hold her ground, Zone! No wardrobe destruction. Or. Um. Destruction of orifices.
7-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;3:=wink.png,I'd say you're finally coming out of your shell, Corrin, but you definitely seem fine with this.
7-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,I-I do mean sandals. M-meaning sandals are fine for the beach and your clothes, I just don’t like them. I-I’m not looking at your… Butt.
7-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;2:=excited.png,I’ve never really seen a statuesque person undress before, so this is a bit novel to me.
7-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;2:=wink.png,I-I mean. I don't know what's going on. I wouldn't come to a game like this for <i>Adrien</i> or anything. Um. I guess a girl has to have her secrets, huh, Natsuki?
7-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,I-I tend to get a little nervous when I’m exposed like this. You’re definitely making my night, I <i>pink</i>.
7-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;3:=wink.png,I'm glad one of us doesn't <i>seem</i> too concerned with losing. Don't worry. If you don't get your "grief seed," I'll make sure I do get my <i>akuma</i>.
7-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;sayori&stage;1:=wink.png,I'm just really happy you have it together, Sayori! I have some other people to watch out for so they don't get Akumatized, but I'm glad you're emotionally stable!
7-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;4:=wink.png,It certainly seems to help fight off <i>your</i> Akuma. I figured it'd help me with mine!
7-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;4:=wink.png,I mean, you <i>did</i> just take off your boots.
7-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;4:=wink.png,I'd be happy to show you some tricks of my own, if you'd like!
7-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,J-just because I don’t get a lot of chances to look at body art. But even without the art you’re really… You know…
7-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,N-no?
7-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;3:=wink.png,Okay, okay, okay. Saki, how about a hug? If you're cold or embarrassed, nothing fixes both like a big hug. And believe me, I need lots of hugs!
7-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;shego&stage;1:=bored.png,One piece of clothing at a time! Er... Hopefully losing here will make you rethink things?
7-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,O-oh. I guess it didn’t work… Maybe she meant Thoth, like that Egyptian god the Pharaoh channeled?
7-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;chica&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,O-oh. Well, this is embarrassing. I’m not really used to… Um… A scenario where something like you wasn’t just possessed.
7-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,Palutena, I do have to wonder what a goddess looks like under her um...last lines of defense.
7-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;3:=confused.png,That sounds really embarrassing... Is that why you're so... O-oh. N-nevermind.
7-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,W-wait a second, t-that's-- That's so vulgar, GoGo!
7-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;nugi-chan&stage;3:=confident.png,They’re very classy, Nugi-chan. I recognize high quality clothing anywhere, and I’ll make sure they’re treated well!
7-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;sanako&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,This is somewhat odd to admit, but this isn't my first visit here... you seem very familiar, Sanako, but I don't think I can place how...
7-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;2:=confused.png,Um...I don’t know about that. Maybe you’re a warmer person than me?
7-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,U-uhm. That looked hot! I mean, hot as not as your-- n-not as hot as-- um, when you had burnmarks-- er--!
7-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;3:=excited.png,Well! I applaud you being so clever! I’m definitely not sure what it would be like to take mine off piecemeal like that.
7-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;2:=calm.png,Well, my earrings are <i>kind of</i> like that gem of yours... does your kwami have a name?
7-female_removed_minor,count-role;other&character;sonya&stage;6&saidmarker;commando:=embarrassed.png,Whoa, Sonya. That's... Wow, body paint. I didn't think I was into this. I guess I am, though.
7-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;3:=confident.png,Wow! Those are cool tattoos, Blackrose!
7-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,U-um, those are tattoos, right? Those wavy things, and not scars? R-right?
7-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;3&saidmarker;socks:=confused.png,W-wait a minute! You shouldn't threaten self-harm like that!
7-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;3:=alarmed.png,W-whoa! You really didn't need to bring so many guns, Elaine!
7-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;3:=alarmed.png,I-I'm glad you're retting gid--getting rid of those guns, Elaine!
7-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;kimberly&stage;3:=excited.png,You look so cute, Kimberly! I-I get a little embarrassed when I bare my midriff, but you make it look great! E-er, you know what I mean.
7-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;4&saidmarker;null_possess:=excited.png,You seem like a weight's off your chest! What happened, Nayru?
7-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;3:=wink.png,You're really lucky Natsuki's so brave! This is usually a third or fourth date activity, and she's willing to do all this for <i>you</i>! It's romantic! In a way.
7-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;5:,count-role;other&character;lyn:=calm.png,Aww! You two are so sweet on each other!
7-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;florina&saidmarker;huey:=confident.png,Don’t worry, Florina! I’m sure Huey was safely out of range!
7-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;3:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=embarrassed.png,Erm. If you do though, could you please <i>not</i> bring it here?
7-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;3:,count-role;other&character;futaba:=confused.png,Futaba, I mean… I'm still interested in men but Gwen’s… Impressive in her own right...
7-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;3:,count-role;other&character;aimee:=embarrassed.png,H-hey Aimee! I-I just work with someone that's just as cute--I mean looks like her!
7-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;shego&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;sei:=embarrassed.png,I could tie her up with my yo-yo but I think she’d like that far too much...
7-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;3:,count-role;other&character;uravity:=embarrassed.png,I guess we're both kind of lost in this, huh, Ochako...?
7-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;kim&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;shego:=calm.png,It's not like I haven't had a similar bond with some of the villains I've fought...

-3-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;4:=alarmed.png,I'm really much better at this when I'm in costume. Er... the flirting and such. It helps when the boy's in his costume too, though!
-3-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;3:=alarmed.png,Maybe we should do some more practice, after this? Y-you know, in superheroics. Not strip poker. B-but if you really wanted, we totally could-! Ah! Nevermind, the lights here are just really bright and I’m going to stop talking.
-3-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;3:=alarmed.png,--oir... Uh... this is kind of awkward... S-sorry, Jin, at least it's a flattering comparison?
-3-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;1:=confused.png,O-oh my. You’re very… Distracting, Captain America. (<i>Ca valait la peine.</i>)
-3-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;3:,count-role;other&character;palutena:=bored.png,Hmm. (I can't figure these two out! I've known Tikki for a long time, but I'm guessing divine figures are just like this!)
-3-female_removing_minor=embarrassed.png,Tikki, are you almost ready?
-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;sanako&stage;0:=calm.png,(Hmm... she seems oddly familiar...)
-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;1:=excited.png,<i>Merveilleux! I</i> see what's going on here...
-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;1:=confused.png,A "soul gem?" Hmm... is that where you store your guardian spirit to transform?
-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:=alarmed.png,Ahh!!! Could you stop shooting like that!
-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:=confident.png,It is a pretty impressive skill, at least. But please don't hurt anyone!
-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;0:=wink.png,Because you look really punk-y!
-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;april&stage;1:=excited.png,But I don’t know if the turtle miraculous holder likes pizza that much... or sewers. He definitely knows a lot about Ancient China though!
-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;2:=calm.png,But that’s a good thing. You’re just like Chloe, and you’re so mean I can’t imagine you’d have nice powers.
-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;2:=alarmed.png,F-flooding? <i>D-de l'eau dans vos chaussette?</i> Um... I-is this a euphemism?
-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;other&character;zoey&stage;2:=alarmed.png,HBO? Wait, this isn’t on TV? W-wait, HBO has things like this on it?
-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;4:=excited.png,Here I go! Begone! THOT!
-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;2:=calm.png,Hmm... Well, I guess there's other types of heroes out there... other types of girls with magic too, I suppose!
-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kimberly&stage;2:=wink.png,I guess if it's strip poker, more layers would help... but I thought for sure it'd just be a sweatshirt, to fit in with your aesthetic!
-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;1:=bored.png,I never really understood the appeal of thongs.
-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;1:=wink.png,Sandals seem… Attire appropriate.
-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;1:=wink.png,I’m glad you’re having fun!
-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;1:=excited.png,It’s great playing with you too, Nagisa!
-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;3:=excited.png,I’m sorry, I’ve been waiting to make that pun all game. You don’t seem like a stranger to <i>pun</i>-ishment, either, Kyu!
-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;2:=alarmed.png,I-I’m excited to see more!
-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;sayori&stage;0:=calm.png,I'm glad Sayori is so excitable! Even if she's a bit spacy.
-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;tracer:=embarrassed.png,It’d be nice to do that with you once I get my clothes back on, and a trip to London besides!
-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;ann&stage;0:=confident.png,I've seen so many of your shoots! You really, really know how to own your apparel!
-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;2:=excited.png,Jeez, ~player~, have you considered asking Natsuki on a date, or what?
-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;2&saidmarker;socks:=embarrassed.png,Kyu wait! I'll take off something just so you don't have to if you'll---
-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;pearl&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Not in a bad way, just in a way that seems enchanted.
-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;weiss&stage;2:=wink.png,Not that anyone here seems to care about your money but you.
-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;4:=wink.png,Of course, Palutena, I’m here to win too! (And at this point it looks like we’re having more fun than worry. Palutena does these asides too, so that’s okay for me, right?)
-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;4:=wink.png,Not that you really need me to, but I won’t let you fall under the akuma’s power!
-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;2:=confident.png,Oh! <i>Oui!</i> You have really good legs for someone who can fly
-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;dark_magician_girl&stage;4:=confident.png,Oh! I'm not the only one with that kind of talent... Um, as you may have seen.
-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:=wink.png,Oh! Is this what people mean when they say they want to shoot all over me? Is this just how some people undress in those old Western movies? ?
-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;juri&stage;1:=confused.png,Oh! Your gloves! Here I was thinking you'd take off your hairties or something.
-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kyoko&stage;5:=bored.png,Oh, Kyoko…
-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;2:=bored.png,Oh.
-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;dark_magician_girl&stage;2:=alarmed.png,O-oh. I-is that so? Hm.
-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:=confident.png,O-Okay. I'll go ahead and hope you know how to use... Whatever skill you're using.
-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,So given how things are going, maybe I should kiss you for luck?
-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika:=wink.png,The bad guys better watch out!
-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;2:=wink.png,This whole thing's a little awkward but let’s try to stay calm and collected, okay?
-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;2:=alarmed.png,Um. I can't say I've ever had to worry about it. Sometimes afterwards, but never during! I guess it's a side effect of my Miraculous?
-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;0:=calm.png,Those actually look really well made! I'm not one for armor, but it's nice to see you care about more than durability.
-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;0:=excited.png,Wow, Corrin, those look really stylish and actually durable!
-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Though... I haven't really seen a Miraculous compartmentalize like this...
-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;3:=alarmed.png,Um, but. I, er. Spinning bird kick. Can you teach it to me?
-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:=confused.png,Um. If you even want to take off your shoes... er... which you halready lave-- already have! Y-you risk showing your-- um. You know.
-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:=bored.png,I-I guess you've already shown your underwear on accident-- um, is that the wrong thing to say?!
-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;other&character;zone-tan&stage;2:,marker:ztentacles=alarmed.png,Um. People can enjoy sex however they want, Zone-tan, but I think most people prefer not to have their wardrobes damaged in the process!
-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;chica&stage;0:=alarmed.png,W-wait, that’s the one with the possessed animatronics! I have to free Chica from the Akuma, now!
-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;shego&stage;0:=confident.png,You may not use an akuma, but I'll stop you anyway!
-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;2:=alarmed.png,Y-your... Husband? D-does he know you're at a game like this!?
-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;2:=alarmed.png,I-I would never come here if I had a partner at home!
-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=alarmed.png,Don’t encourage her, Zone! You don’t have some big amorphous blob that can shield us with tentacles!
-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;florina:=embarrassed.png,Er, I meant--You know, morally. Not...Mortally. Erk.
-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;futaba:=embarrassed.png,Er. We're not-- I'm not-- I mean, she's really pretty but--! I mean I would be <i>interested</i>
-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;4:,count-role;other&character;shego:=confident.png,Er… I’m not going to go easy on you, Palutena, but I think Shego is a bigger problem if we don’t stop her now.
-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kim&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;shego:=embarrassed.png,I-I mean, relationship as in friendship or rivalship?
-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;ayano:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_stripping:=alarmed.png,It looks like you spend just as much time playing cards as you do practicing empathy, Ayano.
-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;ayano:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;ayano_stripping:=confused.png,It’s just ~clothing~, Ayano. I think you’re overreacting. (I’m going to keep an eye out for any butterflies, just in case... This seems bad.)
-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kim&stage;0:,count-role;self&saidmarker;kim_similar:=embarrassed.png,Just less dressed.
-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;yang:=wink.png,O-or if you aren’t, that’s okay too? Everyone has secrets! Love or otherwise.
-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;4:,count-role;other&character;neo:=confident.png,Palutena, I know Neo is pint-sized, but we should focus on making sure we can take her down… But if you don’t want me to go easy on you...
-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;shego&stage;0:,count-role;other&character;sei:=confident.png,Sei, can you just arrest Shego? I’d like to see her tied up. I-I mean behind bars.
-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_mariba:,count-role;other&character;futaba&saidmarker;saki_befriend_mariba:=excited.png,"Pwn?" Er... well, I'm guessing if we got loaded up on sugar and got all dressed up, getting competitive does seem a <i>little</i> fun... What do you think, Saki?
-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_ladity:,count-role;other&character;uravity&saidmarker;saki_befriend_ladity:=confident.png,Hmm… I mean, I’ve done <i>saunas</i> but… Err, well, okay, let’s do this, but we have to do some skincare and go for crepes afterwards.
-3-female_removing_minor,count-yandere:1-3,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=confident.png,~name~ has really pretty eyes, and a good sense of herself.
-3-female_removing_minor,count-yandere:1-3,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;4:=confident.png,We’re all friends and heroes here, Palutena. But hopefully you can stay in the game long enough to help me subdue <i>her</i>!

-3-female_removing_minor,priority:0,count-yandere:1-3,count-taken&role;target&stage;3-5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=wink.png,~name~ is already in a committed relationship, and she doesn’t need ~player~, but given how you’re acting, you definitely don’t need them either!

-3-female_removing_minor,count-yandere:1-3,count-yandere&role;target:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=bored.png,What are we to do with you, ~name~?
-3-female_removing_minor,count-yandere:1-3,count-yandere&role;target:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=bored.png,I hope you really get your act together...

-3-female_removing_minor,count-yandere:1-3,count-yandere&role;target:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=embarrassed.png,You should be ashamed of how you've been treating other people, ~name~.
-3-female_removing_minor,count-yandere:1-3,count-yandere&role;target:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=confident.png,This serves you right.

-3-female_removed_minor=alarmed.png,Because looking at how bad this game is going, I definitely could use some cover.
-3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;dark_magician_girl&stage;3:=wink.png,(She looks kind of like a frillier, female Adrien... Hmm...)
-3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;3:=confused.png,A-Aimee, I'd use my Lucky Charm to reverse time if you made a mistake, but there's no akumas here for me to use it on...
-3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;3:=alarmed.png,A-Aimee, I might die of embarrassment, but if you do that wrong, you'll actually die!
-3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;3:=alarmed.png,Aimee! You sure aren’t making sounds like that was a sure shot! Be careful!
-3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;alpha&stage;5:=confident.png,Alpha, I know you're digital but... You're pretty and definitely express your personality well. That's all you.
-3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika:=confident.png,And with Nadeshiko helping you out, you already have a super strong team!
-3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;pearl&stage;2:=calm.png,And you certainly seem enchanting! I guess if you're not Akumatized, you're alright by me!
-3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;4&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=confused.png,Er... if you want to stop, Nayru, I think most people here would be okay with it... no need to push yourself!
-3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;3:=alarmed.png,Er… about that… Er! H-hold on, don't panic, I can explain!
-3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:=bored.png,Erm, Aimee... This seems very, very dangerous. And if a hero is telling you that...
-3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:=excited.png,At very least, I don't have to worry about you as a villain... You seem to only hit yourself...
-3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;alpha&stage;2:=confident.png,Hmm... Maybe now's not a great time, but could you do... Fashion Victim by Green Day?
-3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;zoey&stage;2:,marker:feet=bored.png,I mean, you’re an attractive woman taking off her clothes… Wait, did you mean… Your feet?
-3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;zoey&stage;2:,marker:feet=confused.png,Er… What, the feet? Is this a thing people…
-3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;1:=wink.png,I really think well-made armor can keep you really mobile, right? Maybe just not as mobile as me.
-3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;1:=confident.png,I'm really not one for armor, but my suit does really increase my pain tolerance and agility.
-3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;3:=excited.png,I run and jump a lot to get this toned, I’m a bit jealous you’re naturally like that.
-3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;kyoko&stage;6:=confused.png,I’m so sorry. I wish my Lucky Charm could heal those. You’re still an amazing detective, I can tell even from this game…
-3-female_removed_minor,count-role;other&character;zone-tan&stage;6:,marker:ztentacles=confident.png,I’m sure, even faced with a tentacle monster, ~name~ would hold her ground, Zone! No wardrobe destruction. Or. Um. Destruction of orifices.
-3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;3:=wink.png,I'd say you're finally coming out of your shell, Corrin, but you definitely seem fine with this.
-3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,I-I do mean sandals. M-meaning sandals are fine for the beach and your clothes, I just don’t like them. I-I’m not looking at your… Butt.
-3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;2:=excited.png,I’ve never really seen a statuesque person undress before, so this is a bit novel to me.
-3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;2:=wink.png,I-I mean. I don't know what's going on. I wouldn't come to a game like this for <i>Adrien</i> or anything. Um. I guess a girl has to have her secrets, huh, Natsuki?
-3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,I-I tend to get a little nervous when I’m exposed like this. You’re definitely making my night, I <i>pink</i>.
-3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;3:=wink.png,I'm glad one of us doesn't <i>seem</i> too concerned with losing. Don't worry. If you don't get your "grief seed," I'll make sure I do get my <i>akuma</i>.
-3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;sayori&stage;1:=wink.png,I'm just really happy you have it together, Sayori! I have some other people to watch out for so they don't get Akumatized, but I'm glad you're emotionally stable!
-3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;4:=wink.png,It certainly seems to help fight off <i>your</i> Akuma. I figured it'd help me with mine!
-3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;4:=wink.png,I mean, you <i>did</i> just take off your boots.
-3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;4:=wink.png,I'd be happy to show you some tricks of my own, if you'd like!
-3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,J-just because I don’t get a lot of chances to look at body art. But even without the art you’re really… You know…
-3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,N-no?
-3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;3:=wink.png,Okay, okay, okay. Saki, how about a hug? If you're cold or embarrassed, nothing fixes both like a big hug. And believe me, I need lots of hugs!
-3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;shego&stage;1:=bored.png,One piece of clothing at a time! Er... Hopefully losing here will make you rethink things?
-3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,O-oh. I guess it didn’t work… Maybe she meant Thoth, like that Egyptian god the Pharaoh channeled?
-3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;chica&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,O-oh. Well, this is embarrassing. I’m not really used to… Um… A scenario where something like you wasn’t just possessed.
-3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,Palutena, I do have to wonder what a goddess looks like under her um...last lines of defense.
-3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;3:=confused.png,That sounds really embarrassing... Is that why you're so... O-oh. N-nevermind.

-3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;2:=confused.png,Um...I don’t know about that. Maybe you’re a warmer person than me?

-2-male_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;3:=bored.png,Aww, are you sure about that, Jin? You could um... walk your way over to me. Er...
-2-male_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_m&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,E-er. Hm. I think I prefer men that are a bit more... masculine.
-2-male_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,The rest of you looks much better. Um. Especially the... Not clothes parts.
-2-male_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;0:=calm.png,Um. I’ve kind of taken off... and you’re just now...
-2-male_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;2:=confused.png,Yeah, yeah, you're going to make a "jack it" joke, Cat Noir, I already kn--
-2-male_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;2:=bored.png,Y-you’re doing a lot better than I am. T-that’s all.
-2-male_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;palutena:=embarrassed.png,Yeah, sandals are a bit... Um. (How do I say they're not attractive without being really mean?)
-2-male_removed_minor=embarrassed.png,B-but if you took off more that’d help... more?
-2-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;3:=alarmed.png,A-anyway, let's keep playing! D-don't pay me too much mind!
-2-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_m&stage;3:=wink.png,I think you can be gentle without being weak or cowardly. Don't lose the first part, Corrin.
-2-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;4:=alarmed.png,I'm really much better at this when I'm in costume. Er... the flirting and such. It helps when the boy's in his costume too, though!
-2-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;3:=alarmed.png,Maybe we should do some more practice, after this? Y-you know, in superheroics. Not strip poker. B-but if you really wanted, we totally could-! Ah! Nevermind, the lights here are just really bright and I’m going to stop talking.
-2-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;3:=alarmed.png,--oir... Uh... this is kind of awkward... S-sorry, Jin, at least it's a flattering comparison?
-2-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;1:=confused.png,O-oh my. You’re very… Distracting, Captain America. (<i>Ca valait la peine.</i>)
-2-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;3:,count-role;other&character;palutena:=bored.png,Hmm. (I can't figure these two out! I've known Tikki for a long time, but I'm guessing divine figures are just like this!)
-2-female_removing_minor=confident.png,Finally, ~name~, you’d better catch up!
-2-female_removing_minor=excited.png,Oh, that’s helping my Miraculous recharge.
-2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;sanako&stage;0:=calm.png,(Hmm... she seems oddly familiar...)
-2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;1:=excited.png,<i>Merveilleux! I</i> see what's going on here...
-2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;1:=confused.png,A "soul gem?" Hmm... is that where you store your guardian spirit to transform?
-2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:=alarmed.png,Ahh!!! Could you stop shooting like that!
-2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:=confident.png,It is a pretty impressive skill, at least. But please don't hurt anyone!
-2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;0:=wink.png,Because you look really punk-y!
-2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;april&stage;1:=excited.png,But I don’t know if the turtle miraculous holder likes pizza that much... or sewers. He definitely knows a lot about Ancient China though!
-2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;2:=calm.png,But that’s a good thing. You’re just like Chloe, and you’re so mean I can’t imagine you’d have nice powers.
-2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;2:=alarmed.png,F-flooding? <i>D-de l'eau dans vos chaussette?</i> Um... I-is this a euphemism?
-2-female_removing_minor,count-role;other&character;zoey&stage;2:=alarmed.png,HBO? Wait, this isn’t on TV? W-wait, HBO has things like this on it?
-2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;2:=calm.png,Hmm... Well, I guess there's other types of heroes out there... other types of girls with magic too, I suppose!
-2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kimberly&stage;2:=wink.png,I guess if it's strip poker, more layers would help... but I thought for sure it'd just be a sweatshirt, to fit in with your aesthetic!
-2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;1:=bored.png,I never really understood the appeal of thongs.
-2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;1:=wink.png,Sandals seem… Attire appropriate.
-2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;1:=wink.png,I’m glad you’re having fun!
-2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;1:=excited.png,It’s great playing with you too, Nagisa!
-2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;3:=excited.png,I’m sorry, I’ve been waiting to make that pun all game. You don’t seem like a stranger to <i>pun</i>-ishment, either, Kyu!
-2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;2:=alarmed.png,I-I’m excited to see more!
-2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;sayori&stage;0:=calm.png,I'm glad Sayori is so excitable! Even if she's a bit spacy.
-2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;ann&stage;0:=confident.png,I've seen so many of your shoots! You really, really know how to own your apparel!
-2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;2:=excited.png,Jeez, ~player~, have you considered asking Natsuki on a date, or what?
-2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;2&saidmarker;socks:=embarrassed.png,Kyu wait! I'll take off something just so you don't have to if you'll---
-2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;pearl&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Not in a bad way, just in a way that seems enchanted.
-2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;weiss&stage;2:=wink.png,Not that anyone here seems to care about your money but you.
-2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;4:=wink.png,Of course, Palutena, I’m here to win too! (And at this point it looks like we’re having more fun than worry. Palutena does these asides too, so that’s okay for me, right?)
-2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;4:=wink.png,Not that you really need me to, but I won’t let you fall under the akuma’s power!
-2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;2:=confident.png,Oh! <i>Oui!</i> You have really good legs for someone who can fly
-2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;dark_magician_girl&stage;4:=confident.png,Oh! I'm not the only one with that kind of talent... Um, as you may have seen.
-2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:=wink.png,Oh! Is this what people mean when they say they want to shoot all over me? Is this just how some people undress in those old Western movies? ?
-2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;juri&stage;1:=confused.png,Oh! Your gloves! Here I was thinking you'd take off your hairties or something.
-2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kyoko&stage;5:=bored.png,Oh, Kyoko…
-2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;2:=bored.png,Oh.
-2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;dark_magician_girl&stage;2:=alarmed.png,O-oh. I-is that so? Hm.
-2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:=confident.png,O-Okay. I'll go ahead and hope you know how to use... Whatever skill you're using.
-2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,So given how things are going, maybe I should kiss you for luck?
-2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika:=wink.png,The bad guys better watch out!
-2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;2:=wink.png,This whole thing's a little awkward but let’s try to stay calm and collected, okay?
-2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;2:=alarmed.png,Um. I can't say I've ever had to worry about it. Sometimes afterwards, but never during! I guess it's a side effect of my Miraculous?
-2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;0:=calm.png,Those actually look really well made! I'm not one for armor, but it's nice to see you care about more than durability.
-2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;0:=excited.png,Wow, Corrin, those look really stylish and actually durable!
-2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Though... I haven't really seen a Miraculous compartmentalize like this...
-2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;3:=alarmed.png,Um, but. I, er. Spinning bird kick. Can you teach it to me?
-2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:=confused.png,Um. If you even want to take off your shoes... er... which you halready lave-- already have! Y-you risk showing your-- um. You know.
-2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:=bored.png,I-I guess you've already shown your underwear on accident-- um, is that the wrong thing to say?!
-2-female_removing_minor,count-role;other&character;zone-tan&stage;2:,marker:ztentacles=alarmed.png,Um. People can enjoy sex however they want, Zone-tan, but I think most people prefer not to have their wardrobes damaged in the process!
-2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;chica&stage;0:=alarmed.png,W-wait, that’s the one with the possessed animatronics! I have to free Chica from the Akuma, now!
-2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;shego&stage;0:=confident.png,You may not use an akuma, but I'll stop you anyway!
-2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;2:=alarmed.png,Y-your... Husband? D-does he know you're at a game like this!?
-2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;2:=alarmed.png,I-I would never come here if I had a partner at home!
-2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=alarmed.png,Don’t encourage her, Zone! You don’t have some big amorphous blob that can shield us with tentacles!
-2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;florina:=embarrassed.png,Er, I meant--You know, morally. Not...Mortally. Erk.
-2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;futaba:=embarrassed.png,Er. We're not-- I'm not-- I mean, she's really pretty but--! I mean I would be <i>interested</i>
-2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;4:,count-role;other&character;shego:=confident.png,Er… I’m not going to go easy on you, Palutena, but I think Shego is a bigger problem if we don’t stop her now.
-2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kim&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;shego:=embarrassed.png,I-I mean, relationship as in friendship or rivalship?
-2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;ayano:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_stripping:=alarmed.png,It looks like you spend just as much time playing cards as you do practicing empathy, Ayano.
-2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;ayano:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;ayano_stripping:=confused.png,It’s just ~clothing~, Ayano. I think you’re overreacting. (I’m going to keep an eye out for any butterflies, just in case... This seems bad.)
-2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kim&stage;0:,count-role;self&saidmarker;kim_similar:=embarrassed.png,Just less dressed.
-2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;yang:=wink.png,O-or if you aren’t, that’s okay too? Everyone has secrets! Love or otherwise.
-2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;4:,count-role;other&character;neo:=confident.png,Palutena, I know Neo is pint-sized, but we should focus on making sure we can take her down… But if you don’t want me to go easy on you...
-2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;shego&stage;0:,count-role;other&character;sei:=confident.png,Sei, can you just arrest Shego? I’d like to see her tied up. I-I mean behind bars.

-2-female_removing_minor,count-yandere:1-3,count-yandere&role;target:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=confident.png,This serves you right.
-2-female_removing_minor,count-yandere:1-3,count-yandere&role;target:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=alarmed.png,T-there's no akuma here, is there, just ~name~ and her whole yandere stuff!
-2-female_removed_minor=embarrassed.png,B-but if you took off more that’d help... more?
-2-female_removed_minor=confused.png,I’m p-playing with myself, and you’re just-!
-2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;dark_magician_girl&stage;3:=wink.png,(She looks kind of like a frillier, female Adrien... Hmm...)
-2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;3:=confused.png,A-Aimee, I'd use my Lucky Charm to reverse time if you made a mistake, but there's no akumas here for me to use it on...
-2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;3:=alarmed.png,A-Aimee, I might die of embarrassment, but if you do that wrong, you'll actually die!
-2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;3:=alarmed.png,Aimee! You sure aren’t making sounds like that was a sure shot! Be careful!
-2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;alpha&stage;5:=confident.png,Alpha, I know you're digital but... You're pretty and definitely express your personality well. That's all you.
-2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika:=confident.png,And with Nadeshiko helping you out, you already have a super strong team!
-2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;pearl&stage;2:=calm.png,And you certainly seem enchanting! I guess if you're not Akumatized, you're alright by me!
-2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;4&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=confused.png,Er... if you want to stop, Nayru, I think most people here would be okay with it... no need to push yourself!
-2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;3:=alarmed.png,Er… about that… Er! H-hold on, don't panic, I can explain!
-2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:=bored.png,Erm, Aimee... This seems very, very dangerous. And if a hero is telling you that...
-2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:=excited.png,At very least, I don't have to worry about you as a villain... You seem to only hit yourself...
-2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;alpha&stage;2:=confident.png,Hmm... Maybe now's not a great time, but could you do... Fashion Victim by Green Day?
-2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;zoey&stage;2:,marker:feet=bored.png,I mean, you’re an attractive woman taking off her clothes… Wait, did you mean… Your feet?
-2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;zoey&stage;2:,marker:feet=confused.png,Er… What, the feet? Is this a thing people…
-2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;1:=wink.png,I really think well-made armor can keep you really mobile, right? Maybe just not as mobile as me.
-2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;1:=confident.png,I'm really not one for armor, but my suit does really increase my pain tolerance and agility.
-2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;3:=excited.png,I run and jump a lot to get this toned, I’m a bit jealous you’re naturally like that.
-2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;kyoko&stage;6:=confused.png,I’m so sorry. I wish my Lucky Charm could heal those. You’re still an amazing detective, I can tell even from this game…
-2-female_removed_minor,count-role;other&character;zone-tan&stage;6:,marker:ztentacles=confident.png,I’m sure, even faced with a tentacle monster, ~name~ would hold her ground, Zone! No wardrobe destruction. Or. Um. Destruction of orifices.
-2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;3:=wink.png,I'd say you're finally coming out of your shell, Corrin, but you definitely seem fine with this.
-2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,I-I do mean sandals. M-meaning sandals are fine for the beach and your clothes, I just don’t like them. I-I’m not looking at your… Butt.
-2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;2:=excited.png,I’ve never really seen a statuesque person undress before, so this is a bit novel to me.
-2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;2:=wink.png,I-I mean. I don't know what's going on. I wouldn't come to a game like this for <i>Adrien</i> or anything. Um. I guess a girl has to have her secrets, huh, Natsuki?
-2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,I-I tend to get a little nervous when I’m exposed like this. You’re definitely making my night, I <i>pink</i>.
-2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;3:=wink.png,I'm glad one of us doesn't <i>seem</i> too concerned with losing. Don't worry. If you don't get your "grief seed," I'll make sure I do get my <i>akuma</i>.
-2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;sayori&stage;1:=wink.png,I'm just really happy you have it together, Sayori! I have some other people to watch out for so they don't get Akumatized, but I'm glad you're emotionally stable!
-2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;4:=wink.png,It certainly seems to help fight off <i>your</i> Akuma. I figured it'd help me with mine!
-2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;4:=wink.png,I mean, you <i>did</i> just take off your boots.
-2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;4:=wink.png,I'd be happy to show you some tricks of my own, if you'd like!
-2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,J-just because I don’t get a lot of chances to look at body art. But even without the art you’re really… You know…
-2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,N-no?
-2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;3:=wink.png,Okay, okay, okay. Saki, how about a hug? If you're cold or embarrassed, nothing fixes both like a big hug. And believe me, I need lots of hugs!
-2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;shego&stage;1:=bored.png,One piece of clothing at a time! Er... Hopefully losing here will make you rethink things?
-2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;chica&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,O-oh. Well, this is embarrassing. I’m not really used to… Um… A scenario where something like you wasn’t just possessed.
-2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,Palutena, I do have to wonder what a goddess looks like under her um...last lines of defense.
-2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;3:=confused.png,That sounds really embarrassing... Is that why you're so... O-oh. N-nevermind.
-2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,W-wait a second, t-that's-- That's so vulgar, GoGo!
-2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;nugi-chan&stage;3:=confident.png,They’re very classy, Nugi-chan. I recognize high quality clothing anywhere, and I’ll make sure they’re treated well!
-2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;sanako&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,This is somewhat odd to admit, but this isn't my first visit here... you seem very familiar, Sanako, but I don't think I can place how...
-2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;2:=confused.png,Um...I don’t know about that. Maybe you’re a warmer person than me?
-2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,U-uhm. That looked hot! I mean, hot as not as your-- n-not as hot as-- um, when you had burnmarks-- er--!
-2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;3:=excited.png,Well! I applaud you being so clever! I’m definitely not sure what it would be like to take mine off piecemeal like that.
-2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;2:=calm.png,Well, my earrings are <i>kind of</i> like that gem of yours... does your kwami have a name?
-2-female_removed_minor,count-role;other&character;sonya&stage;6&saidmarker;commando:=embarrassed.png,Whoa, Sonya. That's... Wow, body paint. I didn't think I was into this. I guess I am, though.
-2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;3:=confident.png,Wow! Those are cool tattoos, Blackrose!
-2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,U-um, those are tattoos, right? Those wavy things, and not scars? R-right?
-2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;3&saidmarker;socks:=confused.png,W-wait a minute! You shouldn't threaten self-harm like that!
-2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;3:=alarmed.png,W-whoa! You really didn't need to bring so many guns, Elaine!
-2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;3:=alarmed.png,I-I'm glad you're retting gid--getting rid of those guns, Elaine!
-2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;kimberly&stage;3:=excited.png,You look so cute, Kimberly! I-I get a little embarrassed when I bare my midriff, but you make it look great! E-er, you know what I mean.
-2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;4&saidmarker;null_possess:=excited.png,You seem like a weight's off your chest! What happened, Nayru?
-2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;3:=wink.png,You're really lucky Natsuki's so brave! This is usually a third or fourth date activity, and she's willing to do all this for <i>you</i>! It's romantic! In a way.
-2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;5:,count-role;other&character;lyn:=calm.png,Aww! You two are so sweet on each other!
-2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;florina&saidmarker;huey:=confident.png,Don’t worry, Florina! I’m sure Huey was safely out of range!
-2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;3:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=embarrassed.png,Erm. If you do though, could you please <i>not</i> bring it here?
-2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;3:,count-role;other&character;futaba:=confused.png,Futaba, I mean… I'm still interested in men but Gwen’s… Impressive in her own right...
-2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;3:,count-role;other&character;aimee:=embarrassed.png,H-hey Aimee! I-I just work with someone that's just as cute--I mean looks like her!
-2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;shego&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;sei:=embarrassed.png,I could tie her up with my yo-yo but I think she’d like that far too much...
-2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;3:,count-role;other&character;uravity:=embarrassed.png,I guess we're both kind of lost in this, huh, Ochako...?
-2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;kim&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;shego:=calm.png,It's not like I haven't had a similar bond with some of the villains I've fought...
-2-female_removed_minor,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;shimmy:,count-role;other&character;zoey:,marker:shimmy=wink.png,Shimmy? Oh! That’s a fun word to say! Shimmy... Shimmy... Shimmy... Erk. Sorry, ~name~, I got distracted...
-2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;chica&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;alpha:=embarrassed.png,Well, I guess Alpha is an AI that’s not possessed… I think. I’m keeping an eye on you, Chica.
-2-female_removed_minor,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;rodeo:,count-role;other&character;zoey:,marker:rodeo=confused.png,Zoey, what do you mean by rodeo?
-2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;3:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_mariba:,count-role;other&character;futaba&saidmarker;saki_befriend_mariba:=wink.png,Then we can talk about boys and stuff too. I actually already like Futaba's style, and I'm already kind of good at some games, so it's a great blend for Saki!
-2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;3:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_ladity:,count-role;other&character;uravity&saidmarker;saki_befriend_ladity:=wink.png,Um, yeah! Well, crepes and mudmasks and all that are popular wherever you go, right? This'll be great!
-2-female_removed_minor,priority:305,count-role;target&character;florina:,count-exposed:1-5=confident.png,I understand how you feel, Florina, but nothing’s wrong. You’re doing great!
-2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;2:,count-male:1-5=wink.png,I think most people know a breastplate is also a chestplate. Don’t get so worried, Florina!


#finished
-1-male_removing_minor=embarrassed.png,Normally, I like to shower after superheroics... or coming...
-1-male_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;3:=bored.png,Aww, are you sure about that, Jin? You could um... walk your way over to me. Er...
-1-male_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_m&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,E-er. Hm. I think I prefer men that are a bit more... masculine.
-1-male_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,The rest of you looks much better. Um. Especially the... Not clothes parts.
-1-male_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;0:=calm.png,Um. I’ve kind of taken off... and you’re just now...
-1-male_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;2:=confused.png,Yeah, yeah, you're going to make a "jack it" joke, Cat Noir, I already kn--
-1-male_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;2:=bored.png,Y-you’re doing a lot better than I am. T-that’s all.
-1-male_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;palutena:=embarrassed.png,Yeah, sandals are a bit... Um. (How do I say they're not attractive without being really mean?)
-1-male_removed_minor=wink.png,But if you keep going like that, I might want to come again...
-1-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;3:=alarmed.png,A-anyway, let's keep playing! D-don't pay me too much mind!
-1-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_m&stage;3:=wink.png,I think you can be gentle without being weak or cowardly. Don't lose the first part, Corrin.
-1-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;4:=alarmed.png,I'm really much better at this when I'm in costume. Er... the flirting and such. It helps when the boy's in his costume too, though!
-1-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;3:=alarmed.png,Maybe we should do some more practice, after this? Y-you know, in superheroics. Not strip poker. B-but if you really wanted, we totally could-! Ah! Nevermind, the lights here are just really bright and I’m going to stop talking.
-1-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;3:=alarmed.png,--oir... Uh... this is kind of awkward... S-sorry, Jin, at least it's a flattering comparison?
-1-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;1:=confused.png,O-oh my. You’re very… Distracting, Captain America. (<i>Ca valait la peine.</i>)
-1-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;3:,count-role;other&character;palutena:=bored.png,Hmm. (I can't figure these two out! I've known Tikki for a long time, but I'm guessing divine figures are just like this!)
-1-female_removing_minor=confident.png,I’ve never been with a woman...
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;sanako&stage;0:=calm.png,(Hmm... she seems oddly familiar...)
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;1:=excited.png,<i>Merveilleux! I</i> see what's going on here...
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;1:=confused.png,A "soul gem?" Hmm... is that where you store your guardian spirit to transform?
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:=alarmed.png,Ahh!!! Could you stop shooting like that!
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:=confident.png,It is a pretty impressive skill, at least. But please don't hurt anyone!
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;0:=wink.png,Because you look really punk-y!
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;april&stage;1:=excited.png,But I don’t know if the turtle miraculous holder likes pizza that much... or sewers. He definitely knows a lot about Ancient China though!
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;2:=calm.png,But that’s a good thing. You’re just like Chloe, and you’re so mean I can’t imagine you’d have nice powers.
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;2:=alarmed.png,F-flooding? <i>D-de l'eau dans vos chaussette?</i> Um... I-is this a euphemism?
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;other&character;zoey&stage;2:=alarmed.png,HBO? Wait, this isn’t on TV? W-wait, HBO has things like this on it?
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;2:=calm.png,Hmm... Well, I guess there's other types of heroes out there... other types of girls with magic too, I suppose!
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kimberly&stage;2:=wink.png,I guess if it's strip poker, more layers would help... but I thought for sure it'd just be a sweatshirt, to fit in with your aesthetic!
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;1:=bored.png,I never really understood the appeal of thongs.
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;1:=wink.png,Sandals seem… Attire appropriate.
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;1:=wink.png,I’m glad you’re having fun!
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;1:=excited.png,It’s great playing with you too, Nagisa!
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;3:=excited.png,I’m sorry, I’ve been waiting to make that pun all game. You don’t seem like a stranger to <i>pun</i>-ishment, either, Kyu!
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;lilith&stage;2:=alarmed.png,I-I’m excited to see more!
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;sayori&stage;0:=calm.png,I'm glad Sayori is so excitable! Even if she's a bit spacy.
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;ann&stage;0:=confident.png,I've seen so many of your shoots! You really, really know how to own your apparel!
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;2:=excited.png,Jeez, ~player~, have you considered asking Natsuki on a date, or what?
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;2&saidmarker;socks:=embarrassed.png,Kyu wait! I'll take off something just so you don't have to if you'll---
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;pearl&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Not in a bad way, just in a way that seems enchanted.
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;weiss&stage;2:=wink.png,Not that anyone here seems to care about your money but you.
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;4:=wink.png,Of course, Palutena, I’m here to win too! (And at this point it looks like we’re having more fun than worry. Palutena does these asides too, so that’s okay for me, right?)
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;4:=wink.png,Not that you really need me to, but I won’t let you fall under the akuma’s power!
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;2:=confident.png,Oh! <i>Oui!</i> You have really good legs for someone who can fly
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;dark_magician_girl&stage;4:=confident.png,Oh! I'm not the only one with that kind of talent... Um, as you may have seen.
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:=wink.png,Oh! Is this what people mean when they say they want to shoot all over me? Is this just how some people undress in those old Western movies? ?
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;juri&stage;1:=confused.png,Oh! Your gloves! Here I was thinking you'd take off your hairties or something.
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kyoko&stage;5:=bored.png,Oh, Kyoko…
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;2:=bored.png,Oh.
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;dark_magician_girl&stage;2:=alarmed.png,O-oh. I-is that so? Hm.
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:=confident.png,O-Okay. I'll go ahead and hope you know how to use... Whatever skill you're using.
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,So given how things are going, maybe I should kiss you for luck?
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika:=wink.png,The bad guys better watch out!
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;2:=wink.png,This whole thing's a little awkward but let’s try to stay calm and collected, okay?
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;2:=alarmed.png,Um. I can't say I've ever had to worry about it. Sometimes afterwards, but never during! I guess it's a side effect of my Miraculous?
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;0:=calm.png,Those actually look really well made! I'm not one for armor, but it's nice to see you care about more than durability.
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;0:=excited.png,Wow, Corrin, those look really stylish and actually durable!
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Though... I haven't really seen a Miraculous compartmentalize like this...
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;3:=alarmed.png,Um, but. I, er. Spinning bird kick. Can you teach it to me?
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:=confused.png,Um. If you even want to take off your shoes... er... which you halready lave-- already have! Y-you risk showing your-- um. You know.
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;2:=bored.png,I-I guess you've already shown your underwear on accident-- um, is that the wrong thing to say?!
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;other&character;zone-tan&stage;2:,marker:ztentacles=alarmed.png,Um. People can enjoy sex however they want, Zone-tan, but I think most people prefer not to have their wardrobes damaged in the process!
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;chica&stage;0:=alarmed.png,W-wait, that’s the one with the possessed animatronics! I have to free Chica from the Akuma, now!
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;shego&stage;0:=confident.png,You may not use an akuma, but I'll stop you anyway!
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;2:=alarmed.png,Y-your... Husband? D-does he know you're at a game like this!?
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;2:=alarmed.png,I-I would never come here if I had a partner at home!
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=alarmed.png,Don’t encourage her, Zone! You don’t have some big amorphous blob that can shield us with tentacles!
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;florina:=embarrassed.png,Er, I meant--You know, morally. Not...Mortally. Erk.
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;futaba:=embarrassed.png,Er. We're not-- I'm not-- I mean, she's really pretty but--! I mean I would be <i>interested</i>
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;palutena&stage;4:,count-role;other&character;shego:=confident.png,Er… I’m not going to go easy on you, Palutena, but I think Shego is a bigger problem if we don’t stop her now.

-1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;4:=wink.png,It certainly seems to help fight off <i>your</i> Akuma. I figured it'd help me with mine!
-1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;4:=wink.png,I mean, you <i>did</i> just take off your boots.

-1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;3:=wink.png,Okay, okay, okay. Saki, how about a hug? If you're cold or embarrassed, nothing fixes both like a big hug. And believe me, I need lots of hugs!

-1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;2:=confused.png,Um...I don’t know about that. Maybe you’re a warmer person than me?
-1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,U-uhm. That looked hot! I mean, hot as not as your-- n-not as hot as-- um, when you had burnmarks-- er--!

-1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;2:=calm.png,Well, my earrings are <i>kind of</i> like that gem of yours... does your kwami have a name?
-1-female_removed_minor,count-role;other&character;sonya&stage;6&saidmarker;commando:=embarrassed.png,Whoa, Sonya. That's... Wow, body paint. I didn't think I was into this. I guess I am, though.

0-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;videl&stage;3:=bored.png,Videl, maybe you should focus more on fighting than card games? We can't all be multitalented.

0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6b:=embarrassed.png,The whole butt-floss and stockings look is a lot better on you than <i>my</i> costume, Vriska.
0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;juri&stage;1:=bored.png,I wish you weren't so <i>obviously</i> a villain. I'm sure we could get along great if you renounced your evil ways!
0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;6:=embarrassed.png,I-I guess you don't usually have to worry about other ships... um... trying to go for your aft. I-I meant-- oh! Wait, no, aft works perfectly here!

0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;buffy&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,I-I might have to use that at some point!
0-female_removed_major,count-role;other&character;kim&stage;8:=embarrassed.png,I-I wasn’t looking at you, Kim! I was looking at ~name~. B-because it’s her turn!

0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;5:=alarmed.png,I'll have to try that look though! It's super cu--uuuul. <i>Cool</i>! Not butts! Um! Very stylish!
0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;4:=wink.png,I've seen a lot of weird stuff in my time. That includes... illicit... fanart of me. I think you can manage this, Daria. Relatable strategy, though.
0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,No regrets here, either! E-except maybe playing a little poorly. A-and there not really being an akuma here...
0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;kimberly&stage;5:=confident.png,Oh! I see! He must be the Green Ranger, if you're the Pink one! How thoughtful of you!
0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;5:=wink.png,Oh! It's like the towel trick. Clever, Daria. It almost makes me wish I'd worn a skirt...
0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;daisy&stage;5:=excited.png,Oh! You wore a swimsuit under that. You’re really sporty, Daisy! You have to give me some workout tips!
0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;4:,marker:class_rep=excited.png,Oh! You’re doing this to help someone into student government? I was class rep, so let me know if I can help!
0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;5:=wink.png,Oh, I see. This was all part of your plan, huh? T-though...
0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;4&saidmarker;d.va_noobs:=confused.png,Oh, so we’re not noobs anymore, are we, D.Va? Apologize, then maybe I’ll give you a hug, (But only so she’s not Akumatized.)
0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;4:=wink.png,Oh. <i>Pffft</i>. Okay, that's a good joke.
0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sanako&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,O-oh! I think I brought something similar, Sanako! J-just not in the chest.
0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;5&saidmarker;null_possess:=alarmed.png,O-oh, sorry. It's just very normal. Not that it wouldn't be. It's not like I was expecting anything elaborate. In fact I'm glad it's so normal. E-erk...
0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,Sei, w-what's a bodyshot, and why am I being prompted to do one off your breasts? I-I mean breastplate.
0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;arwen&stage;4:=calm.png,S-so thanks, Arwen! I'll definitely remember... this... Uhm. Bonding we did.

0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,Whew. What a relief that must be for you, Sayaka! Um. For us! Obviously.
0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5b:=embarrassed.png,Who's Eridan? And that looks kind of like a sexy schoolgirl outfit... You certainly seem to enjoy being tasteless in your mockery of me...
0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5b:=embarrassed.png,Oh so <i>now</i> you're in a schoolgirl outfit. Do you have <i>taste</i> at all? N-not like-- Um!
0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;asuna&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,W-well, I guess you put a lot of faith in this Kirito guy. Maybe you should try keeping your own confidence, instead? I know about men who dress all in black.
0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6a:=embarrassed.png,W-well, you certainly look kind of drenched.
0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6a:=embarrassed.png,I sind of kort of--Kind of sort of--Er... Always have a bad time swimming.

0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5c:=confused.png,Yes, I'm sure we're all mortified for you being in your pyjamas. It's not like they look cute on you.
0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5c:=confused.png,Oh yeah, let's just make fun of Marinette's costume, but Vriska just looks <i>sooo</i> cute in her oversized shirt and stockings.
0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;4:=confused.png,You seem way more competent than a lot of the people I have to rescue, but let's try and make the best of this?
0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;4:=excited.png,Yeah! That's it! If you have the support of your people, you can't go wrong, right?
0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,You're really hot though, so it's no surprise! I-I mean it's hot where you live. So you'd need to wear... to cool... Urh.
0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;navi:=confident.png,You're some kind of spirit guide, aren't you? You help a hero, right?
0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_furavity:=excited.png,After you, Ochako, and Futaba have had your fun, it would be nice for us to hang out too! Let me surprise you!
0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;3:,count-role;self&saidmarker;bodysuit:=embarrassed.png,Er, It’s nice to be ahead? B-but I’m not interested in...
0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;3:,count-role;self&saidmarker;bodysuit:=embarrassed.png,Er, It’s nice to be ahead? You meant it’s sice to knee myself--Nice to see myself winning, right?!
0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;3:,count-role;self&saidmarker;bodysuit:=alarmed.png,Oh, oui. It’s quite the view--From an aesthetic view! Not necessarily a view of you in particular--Erk.
0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;4:,count-role;other&character;alice:,marker:bodysuit=excited.png,Hmm...Alice, If D.Va does use a bunny miraculous, is she the White Rabbit you’ve been chasing?
0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;5:,count-role;other&character;corrin_f&saidmarker;hotsprings:=excited.png,Hmm… Maybe hot springs are more than I thought they’d be, since you and Corrin both seem fixated on them. I should give it a try, I think!
0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_mariba:=wink.png,I definetly want to hear what kinds of boys or girls you like too, Saki! What are friends for if not lots of harebrained schemes to find your soulmate?
0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_mariba:=wink.png,We're definitely going to have to talk about boys--or girls--too, Saki!
0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;6:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=wink.png,I guess we proved her wrong, didn’t we, Florina?
0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;6:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=confident.png,I-I mean everyone is naked at some level. But, underwear is just another fashion choice. And a comfy one!
0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;bun_puns:=embarrassed.png,I know it's a bun... a pun... erk... But you definitely inspire me!

0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;4:,count-role;other&character;lyn:=alarmed.png,I-I just mean you're both swordswomen, b-but Lyn's apparel is less armor and more style.
0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;meg&stage;6:,count-role;other&character;morrigan:=wink.png,Meg... Hm. Did something get switched up here? Morrigan has the accent but you have the red hair, the plaid underwear… Or is she some sort of altar ego?
0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;kim&stage;4:,count-role;other&character;nugi-chan:=confused.png,Oh, do you have children, Nugi-chan?
0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;3:,count-role;self&saidmarker;bodysuit:=confused.png,She must be really tired for you to lose your suit like that.
0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;lyn&stage;6:,count-role;other&character;florina:=excited.png,Thank goodness. I knew you were really classy, Lyn!
0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6b:,count-role;other&character;d.va:=alarmed.png,Uh, D.Va, this is way different than <i>your</i> conception of a bunny suit. I hope, anyway.
0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;tina:=embarrassed.png,Uhm. Tina, is what Aimee's doing just something you do for fun in Texas?
0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;5:,count-role;other&character;meia:=embarrassed.png,U-um. Dealer, do we have to separate these two?
0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_ladity:=wink.png,We're definitely going to have to talk about boys--or girls--too, Saki!

0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;ruby&stage;4:,count-role;other&character;blake:=embarrassed.png,W-wait, I didn't mean... Or maybe I did? Maybe w-we should try it?
0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;2:,count-role;self&saidmarker;blake_crush:,marker:marinette_overload=alarmed.png,W-what? I-I work with someone who looks a lot like Blake. She’s way cuter though, but, um. I-I-I-
0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;seven&stage;2:,count-role;self&saidmarker;bodysuit:,count-role;other&character;samus&stage;3-7:=confused.png,Hmm… Samus, is it just particularly damage resistant?
0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;seven&stage;2:,count-role;self&saidmarker;bodysuit:,count-role;other&character;d.va&stage;4-8:=confident.png,I bet D.Va’s helps with her reflexes.

0-female_removed_major,count-dark-skinned&role;target:=wink.png,Oh, I’m envious! You must really see a lot of sunshine!
0-female_removed_major,count-journalist&role;target:=calm.png,Do you run a blog, ~name~? It’s a bit more modern than a newspaper... Though I hope this kind of thing isn’t on it!

1-male_removing_major,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;5:=excited.png,Haha, um, I'd say it's more <i>hot</i> than cool-- b-but it's clenty bool-- plenty cool!
1-male_removing_major,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;6:=calm.png,Not that I’m trying to um, snoop, Steve…
1-male_removing_major,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;4:=excited.png,Oh! Oui! So it seems!
1-male_removing_major,count-yandere:1-3,count-yandere&role;target:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=bored.png,What are we to do with you, ~name~?
1-male_removing_major,count-yandere:1-3,count-yandere&role;target:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=bored.png,I hope you really get your act together...
1-male_removing_major,count-yandere:1-3,count-yandere&role;target:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=confident.png,I can't let you be a danger to others, ~name~! Er-- apparently, I can't just fight you... that's security's job...
1-male_removing_major,count-yandere:1-3,count-yandere&role;target:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=embarrassed.png,You should be ashamed of how you've been treating other people, ~name~.
1-male_removing_major,count-yandere:1-3,count-yandere&role;target:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=confident.png,This serves you right.
1-male_removing_major,count-yandere:1-3,count-yandere&role;target:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=alarmed.png,T-there's no akuma here, is there, just ~name~ and her whole yandere stuff!
1-male_removed_major=alarmed.png,But if you start to feel particularly ashamed, I’m scared of what Hawk Moth has left to use!
1-male_removed_major,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;7:=embarrassed.png,But I keep getting glimpses behind the shield. Oh my.
1-male_removed_major,count-role;other&character;florina:=embarrassed.png,Florina! It’s okay! It’s just ~name~’s ~clothing~. Though… It is quite… Alluring…
1-male_removed_major,count-role;other&character;florina:=confident.png,Florina, don’t worry, staring is part of it! Um. Yeah!
1-male_removed_major,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,I have a feeling when it’s my turn. Um, to lose my costume, you’ll be happy to know it comes off seamlessly…
1-male_removed_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_m&stage;5:=confused.png,Not to be judgy… But aren’t those women’s panties? Are you running low on laundry, Mr. Corrin?
1-male_removed_major,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;6:=alarmed.png,Okay, seriously. I'm much better with my hands than with my mouth-- W-wait, n-n-not like-- erk!
1-female_removing_major=confident.png,I saw you eyeing my yo-yo...
1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;4:=confused.png,(What should I say? I don't want her to get Akumatized, but I'm also... Not really sure what else to do for her!)
1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;4:=confused.png,(I'm not sure what else to say to her!)
1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,A ladybug can't change her spots, but maybe you can, <i>Vriska.</i>
1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4:=wink.png,I hope whatever you picked next is a bit more unique to <i>you</i> instead of trying to mock <i>me</i>.
1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;aimee:=alarmed.png,Ahh!!! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale&stage;0:=wink.png,But nothing like you.
1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;4:=alarmed.png,Curter. I mean. More Curt.
1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;4&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=confused.png,E-er-- wait! No, it usually possesses an object! Not a person directly!
1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;1:=bored.png,E-er, I don’t want you to have to reveal your identity, Spider-Woman, but I am a bit curious, I’m not really used to other masked heroes dropping their cover in front of me.
1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;5:=alarmed.png,E-er... I... <i>Non, je ne t'aime pas coups de feau a l'arriere....</i>
1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;arwen&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,E-even though you're losing your dress, I want you to stay proud, because I know what it's like to have two very different parents, and to meet so many... interesting people.
1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;3:=confident.png,Elena, at least... You have a chance to show your people you're proud of your figure?
1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;3:=calm.png,Elena, don't worry! Have confidence in yourself and you'll be ruling this game in no time!
1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;3:=confident.png,Er... do you have something to tell us, Joey? It's okay, you're among friends. Mostly! I think!
1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;asuna&stage;4:=confused.png,Er... Had. It's weird you haven't found a kwami for yourself...
1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;3:,marker:marinette_shirted=embarrassed.png,Erk. I’ve never shirted a stranger either.
1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;spooky&stage;1:=confused.png,Ghosts don’t usually wear a lot of clothes… W-wait, that’s not just… part…
1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,guess my Japanese is worse than I thought… Hmm… I thought I’d get along really well with her…
1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;5:=bored.png,Ha, ha. Very funny. I'm glad I had my yo-yo, just in case...
1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;meg&stage;5:=confident.png,Hmm, a matching set, I hope? It's not polka dots, but I like patterns a lot!
1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;4:=bored.png,Hmm... Corrin, I get the feeling you just kind of throw on whatever you have...
1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;4:=alarmed.png,Hmm... Do you really need to raise the stakes? We've... Kind of already seen your underwear, Elaine! Though it's pery vritty! V-very pretty!
1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;juri&stage;0:=confused.png,I can respect someone who really gives it their all at the outset...
1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;4:=bored.png,I like fashion a lot, but uhm. I think I move too much for skirts to be part of my warddrobe.
1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5:=bored.png,I still haven't forgiven you, you know. You've been really rude all game.
1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5:=bored.png,Maybe this next set'll be a bit humbling for you.
1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;5:=confident.png,I think capes are <i>very</i> heroic. That's probably why you saved that, right?
1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;kimberly&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,I-I guess that's true, Kimberly, but underwear is a lot nicer than most swimsuits, right?
1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;4&saidmarker;null_possess:=embarrassed.png,I-I'll admit, I'm kind of interested to see what sort of underwear you have where you're from. You know. For fashion's sake.
1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,I-I'll admit, most of my pairs are lacy or athletic. I haven't seen fruity panties in... well, I mean, since last round, but, er, you know, Natsuki...?
1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;red&stage;1:=confused.png,Is that huge sword just like… A centerpiece of some sort?
1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;4:=calm.png,It can get... breezy in Paris. I'd really rather not show my underwear if I don't want to.
1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;marceline&stage;4:=confident.png,It’s black! I think I’ve figured out how your powers work! You drain people’s color to black, then… Um… I don’t know.
1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;1:=confused.png,Just because it seems like you have an affinity for plants...
1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;1:=bored.png,You just have a certain bearing about you. And, you know, lots of plants.
1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;ann&stage;3:=confident.png,Like... I think you'd look great in a red jumpsuit!
1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;launch&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,Not this Launch again!
1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;4:=confident.png,Oh! I see. It's like a ship. No wonder you have a nautical theme!
1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,<i>Please</i> be safe. I think the fireworks are cool, but I'd be really sad if you got hurt, Shimakaze!
1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;4:=alarmed.png,Oh! I tend not to match my underwear either unless… Uhm. I’m planning on losing it.
1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;4:=confident.png,W-well, I’m glad you’re still in the game, Nagisa!
1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;meg&stage;4:=confident.png,Oh! You have such nice legs, Meg!  I don’t think anyone minds you showing those off.
1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;4:=calm.png,Oh... I have a few shirts like that! I like to knot them above my navel, though!
1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,O-of course you’d wear underwear under your clothes!
1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;navi:=embarrassed.png,O-oh! I know this routine!
1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Or as flexible, because I usually take my time in the mornings. To, um, get to classes and such.

1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;5:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=alarmed.png,I have a feeling that Zone-tan just assumes most women are naked under their clothes. I mean, wot nearing under...Not wearing underwear!

1-female_removing_major,count-yandere&role;target:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_stripping:=bored.png,Based on how you’ve acted towards everyone else, I kind of hope you do get Akumatized. Maybe it’d give you perspective once I fix you.

1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:=confused.png,I-I'm impressed you managed to get your clothes off that way. That's some sharp shooting.
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:=excited.png,Ah! Wait a minute! Did you just transform!? Are you using a Miraculous?
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;5:=wink.png,Annie, I worry about you getting possessed by Hawk Moth. Smart people are always the toughest villains, so you should be proud of your body!

1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,U-um. Nevermind. Let's not get violent, GoGo.
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;4:,marker:gogo_max=bored.png,Just because Max is gay doesn't mean that-- <i>Va te faire cuire la cul.</i>.
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;4:,marker:gogo_dsl=alarmed.png,D-Did you really? Ugh. You're vile.
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,Er, I can maybe make some suggestions while you're visting? If you can afford that type of armor, I'm sure we can find you something cute!
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,Fortunately, my costume makes my clothes underneath seamless, so I never need underwear like that...
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;5:=alarmed.png,Doesn't that give you a huge wedgie all day?!
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;5:=confident.png,It's nice to have something you feel... Stylish in, but I never liked the way thongs looked.
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sanako&stage;2:,marker:groovy_sanako=wink.png,Groovy? <i>Groooovy</i>. Whoa! Sanako, wherever you're from, they have some really cool words!

1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;spooky&stage;2:=alarmed.png,Has Tikki been naked this whole time?! AM I WEARING TIKKI’S SKIN?
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;5:,marker:hotsprings=confused.png,Hot springs? It seems kind of weird to be naked around that many people… It’s like a sauna but swimming in sweat...No thanks.
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;4:=confident.png,Huh, I guess you like dressing comfortably too, Gwen! I-I mean, like, your underwear choice. Just… Something effective! And comfortable!
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;mei&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,I asked for language help because my mom speaks Cantonese…But, uhm, it seems your clothes can’t... on... these... er…
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale&stage;1:=confident.png,I do wonder if I had some more time to focus on fitness, if I could do even more as Ladybug than I already do!
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;6:=confident.png,I don’t really understand why people think I’m naked under my costume. It’s magic, after all.
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;meg&stage;6:=wink.png,I don’t suppose you can speak with a Scottish accent? You’re looking a little on point, Meg.
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;5:=alarmed.png,I don't think I've ever seen a... well, a <i>bra</i> like that... but what are you going to call it, Shimakaze?
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5a:=confident.png,I don't think luck has a sense of humor, but this is pretty amusing.
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5a:=confident.png,Looking kind of... vampy, Vriska. I-I kind of... appreciate it?
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;3:=confident.png,I just can't get over how stylish you manage to make your really practical apparel. I clearly have a lot to learn!
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;3:=wink.png,Whoa, even without your qipao, the rest of your outfit just flows together so well. The fashion designer in me is gushing over this. (E-er, maybe that's a poor word choice.)
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;3:=confident.png,I love how you can make even traditional-styled clothing work for your combat techniques!
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;meg&stage;5:=wink.png,I know <i>I</i> don’t. Um. To preserve your modesty, of course!
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;3:=bored.png,I mean, nice legs aren’t a bad thing, but…
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;alice&stage;3:=excited.png,I really like it, but if you ever want to modernize your apparel... I’d love to help.
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;tracer&stage;4:=confident.png,I see Lena’a underpants!
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6b:=embarrassed.png,I think that's a bunny suit... But um... From this angle I can definitely see most of your butt.
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6b:=embarrassed.png,The whole butt-floss and stockings look is a lot better on you than <i>my</i> costume, Vriska.
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;juri&stage;1:=bored.png,I wish you weren't so <i>obviously</i> a villain. I'm sure we could get along great if you renounced your evil ways!
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;6:=embarrassed.png,I-I guess you don't usually have to worry about other ships... um... trying to go for your aft. I-I meant-- oh! Wait, no, aft works perfectly here!
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;videl&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,I-I mean, when I'm not doing superhero things I have... Other skills.
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;buffy&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,I-I might have to use that at some point!
1-female_removed_major,count-role;other&character;kim&stage;8:=embarrassed.png,I-I wasn’t looking at you, Kim! I was looking at ~name~. B-because it’s her turn!
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;5&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=alarmed.png,I-it usually doesn't <i>destroy</i> clothes either... Nayru? Hey, Nayru!
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;5:=alarmed.png,I'll have to try that look though! It's super cu--uuuul. <i>Cool</i>! Not butts! Um! Very stylish!
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;4:=wink.png,I've seen a lot of weird stuff in my time. That includes... illicit... fanart of me. I think you can manage this, Daria. Relatable strategy, though.
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,No regrets here, either! E-except maybe playing a little poorly. A-and there not really being an akuma here...
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;kimberly&stage;5:=confident.png,Oh! I see! He must be the Green Ranger, if you're the Pink one! How thoughtful of you!
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;5:=wink.png,Oh! It's like the towel trick. Clever, Daria. It almost makes me wish I'd worn a skirt...
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;daisy&stage;5:=excited.png,Oh! You wore a swimsuit under that. You’re really sporty, Daisy! You have to give me some workout tips!
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;4:,marker:class_rep=excited.png,Oh! You’re doing this to help someone into student government? I was class rep, so let me know if I can help!
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;5:=wink.png,Oh, I see. This was all part of your plan, huh? T-though...
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;4&saidmarker;d.va_noobs:=confused.png,Oh, so we’re not noobs anymore, are we, D.Va? Apologize, then maybe I’ll give you a hug, (But only so she’s not Akumatized.)
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;4:=wink.png,Oh. <i>Pffft</i>. Okay, that's a good joke.
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sanako&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,O-oh! I think I brought something similar, Sanako! J-just not in the chest.
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;5&saidmarker;null_possess:=alarmed.png,O-oh, sorry. It's just very normal. Not that it wouldn't be. It's not like I was expecting anything elaborate. In fact I'm glad it's so normal. E-erk...
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,Sei, w-what's a bodyshot, and why am I being prompted to do one off your breasts? I-I mean breastplate.

1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,O-oh! W-wow. Ningerie lever... lingerie n-never really... um. Maybe I should try something like that?
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;5:=alarmed.png,Yeah… Hawkmoth is really creepy when you think about it...
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5c:=confused.png,Yes, I'm sure we're all mortified for you being in your pyjamas. It's not like they look cute on you.
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5c:=confused.png,Oh yeah, let's just make fun of Marinette's costume, but Vriska just looks <i>sooo</i> cute in her oversized shirt and stockings.
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;4:=confused.png,You seem way more competent than a lot of the people I have to rescue, but let's try and make the best of this?
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;4:=excited.png,Yeah! That's it! If you have the support of your people, you can't go wrong, right?
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,You're really hot though, so it's no surprise! I-I mean it's hot where you live. So you'd need to wear... to cool... Urh.
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;navi:=confident.png,You're some kind of spirit guide, aren't you? You help a hero, right?
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_furavity:=excited.png,After you, Ochako, and Futaba have had your fun, it would be nice for us to hang out too! Let me surprise you!
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;3:,count-role;self&saidmarker;bodysuit:=embarrassed.png,Er, It’s nice to be ahead? B-but I’m not interested in...
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;3:,count-role;self&saidmarker;bodysuit:=embarrassed.png,Er, It’s nice to be ahead? You meant it’s sice to knee myself--Nice to see myself winning, right?!
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;3:,count-role;self&saidmarker;bodysuit:=alarmed.png,Oh, oui. It’s quite the view--From an aesthetic view! Not necessarily a view of you in particular--Erk.
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;4:,count-role;other&character;alice:,marker:bodysuit=excited.png,Hmm...Alice, If D.Va does use a bunny miraculous, is she the White Rabbit you’ve been chasing?
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;5:,count-role;other&character;corrin_f&saidmarker;hotsprings:=excited.png,Hmm… Maybe hot springs are more than I thought they’d be, since you and Corrin both seem fixated on them. I should give it a try, I think!
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_mariba:=wink.png,I definetly want to hear what kinds of boys or girls you like too, Saki! What are friends for if not lots of harebrained schemes to find your soulmate?
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_mariba:=wink.png,We're definitely going to have to talk about boys--or girls--too, Saki!
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;6:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=wink.png,I guess we proved her wrong, didn’t we, Florina?
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;6:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=confident.png,I-I mean everyone is naked at some level. But, underwear is just another fashion choice. And a comfy one!
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;bun_puns:=embarrassed.png,I know it's a bun... a pun... erk... But you definitely inspire me!
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;5:,count-role;other&character;palutena:=excited.png,I see we have a few ladies here tonight interested in asymmetrical fashion. By which I mean Nagisa and Palutena!
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;4:,count-role;other&character;lyn:=alarmed.png,I-I just mean you're both swordswomen, b-but Lyn's apparel is less armor and more style.
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;meg&stage;6:,count-role;other&character;morrigan:=wink.png,Meg... Hm. Did something get switched up here? Morrigan has the accent but you have the red hair, the plaid underwear… Or is she some sort of altar ego?
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;kim&stage;4:,count-role;other&character;nugi-chan:=confused.png,Oh, do you have children, Nugi-chan?
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;3:,count-role;self&saidmarker;bodysuit:=confused.png,She must be really tired for you to lose your suit like that.
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;lyn&stage;6:,count-role;other&character;florina:=excited.png,Thank goodness. I knew you were really classy, Lyn!
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6b:,count-role;other&character;d.va:=alarmed.png,Uh, D.Va, this is way different than <i>your</i> conception of a bunny suit. I hope, anyway.
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;tina:=embarrassed.png,Uhm. Tina, is what Aimee's doing just something you do for fun in Texas?
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;5:,count-role;other&character;meia:=embarrassed.png,U-um. Dealer, do we have to separate these two?
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_ladity:=wink.png,We're definitely going to have to talk about boys--or girls--too, Saki!

1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;ruby&stage;4:,count-role;other&character;blake:=embarrassed.png,W-wait, I didn't mean... Or maybe I did? Maybe w-we should try it?
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;2:,count-role;self&saidmarker;blake_crush:,marker:marinette_overload=alarmed.png,W-what? I-I work with someone who looks a lot like Blake. She’s way cuter though, but, um. I-I-I-
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;seven&stage;2:,count-role;self&saidmarker;bodysuit:,count-role;other&character;samus&stage;3-7:=confused.png,Hmm… Samus, is it just particularly damage resistant?
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;seven&stage;2:,count-role;self&saidmarker;bodysuit:,count-role;other&character;d.va&stage;4-8:=confident.png,I bet D.Va’s helps with her reflexes.
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;4:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_ladity:,count-role;other&character;uravity&saidmarker;saki_befriend_ladity:=wink.png,Saki, I know not everyone can be a superhero, but I hope you know that we like you enough to hang out with you! This’ll probably be a funny story about how we became friends later, right?
1-female_removed_major,count-dark-skinned&role;target:=wink.png,Oh, I’m envious! You must really see a lot of sunshine!
1-female_removed_major,count-journalist&role;target:=calm.png,Do you run a blog, ~name~? It’s a bit more modern than a newspaper... Though I hope this kind of thing isn’t on it!


#lost costume
2-male_removing_major=calm.png,Honestly, I’ve seen Adrien in less.
2-male_removing_major,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;5:=excited.png,Haha, um, I'd say it's more <i>hot</i> than cool-- b-but it's clenty bool-- plenty cool!
2-male_removing_major,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;4:=excited.png,I knew I could count on Captain America! You're a really good guy, Steve!
2-male_removing_major,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;6:=calm.png,Not that I’m trying to um, snoop, Steve…
2-male_removing_major,count-yandere:1-3,count-yandere&role;target:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=bored.png,What are we to do with you, ~name~?
2-male_removing_major,count-yandere:1-3,count-yandere&role;target:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=bored.png,I hope you really get your act together...
2-male_removing_major,count-yandere:1-3,count-yandere&role;target:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=confident.png,I can't let you be a danger to others, ~name~! Er-- apparently, I can't just fight you... that's security's job...
2-male_removing_major,count-yandere:1-3,count-yandere&role;target:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=embarrassed.png,You should be ashamed of how you've been treating other people, ~name~.
2-male_removing_major,count-yandere:1-3,count-yandere&role;target:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=confident.png,This serves you right.
2-male_removing_major,count-yandere:1-3,count-yandere&role;target:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=alarmed.png,T-there's no akuma here, is there, just ~name~ and her whole yandere stuff!
2-male_removed_major=wink.png,Not that he models that way. Let’s keep that a secret between us.
2-male_removed_major,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,And… Oh. I thought you were handsome before. I-I mean um! W-wow. You really work... Hard for that, don’t you?
2-male_removed_major,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;7:=embarrassed.png,But I keep getting glimpses behind the shield. Oh my.
2-male_removed_major,count-role;other&character;florina:=embarrassed.png,Florina! It’s okay! It’s just ~name~’s ~clothing~. Though… It is quite… Alluring…
2-male_removed_major,count-role;other&character;florina:=confident.png,Florina, don’t worry, staring is part of it! Um. Yeah!
2-male_removed_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_m&stage;5:=confused.png,Not to be judgy… But aren’t those women’s panties? Are you running low on laundry, Mr. Corrin?
2-male_removed_major,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;6:=alarmed.png,Okay, seriously. I'm much better with my hands than with my mouth-- W-wait, n-n-not like-- erk!
2-female_removing_major=wink.png,I’m not really one for locker rooms...
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;4:=confused.png,(What should I say? I don't want her to get Akumatized, but I'm also... Not really sure what else to do for her!)
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;4:=confused.png,(I'm not sure what else to say to her!)
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,A ladybug can't change her spots, but maybe you can, <i>Vriska.</i>
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4:=wink.png,I hope whatever you picked next is a bit more unique to <i>you</i> instead of trying to mock <i>me</i>.
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;aimee:=alarmed.png,Ahh!!! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale&stage;0:=wink.png,But nothing like you.
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;4:=alarmed.png,Curter. I mean. More Curt.
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;4&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=confused.png,E-er-- wait! No, it usually possesses an object! Not a person directly!
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;5:=alarmed.png,E-er... I... <i>Non, je ne t'aime pas coups de feau a l'arriere....</i>
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;arwen&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,E-even though you're losing your dress, I want you to stay proud, because I know what it's like to have two very different parents, and to meet so many... interesting people.
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,Er. I mean, in terms of the fashion not that... It'll fall off now... Uhm.
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;3:=confused.png,Uhm. Elena... I'm sorry it's come to this but for what it's worth, your dress is super pretty! Just like you!
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;3:=alarmed.png,Elena! It's still early, don't get too embarrassed! Someone like you would be terrifying if you're possessed!
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;3:=confident.png,Er... do you have something to tell us, Joey? It's okay, you're among friends. Mostly! I think!
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;asuna&stage;4:=confused.png,Er... Had. It's weird you haven't found a kwami for yourself...
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;3:,marker:marinette_shirted=embarrassed.png,Erk. I’ve never shirted a stranger either.
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;spooky&stage;1:=confused.png,Ghosts don’t usually wear a lot of clothes… W-wait, that’s not just… part…
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,guess my Japanese is worse than I thought… Hmm… I thought I’d get along really well with her…
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;5:=confused.png,H-hey! That's not nice, Elaine! I was really worried I wasn't going to have my yo-yo ready!
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;meg&stage;5:=confident.png,Hmm, a matching set, I hope? It's not polka dots, but I like patterns a lot!
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;4:=bored.png,Hmm... Corrin, I get the feeling you just kind of throw on whatever you have...
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;4:=alarmed.png,Hmm... Do you really need to raise the stakes? We've... Kind of already seen your underwear, Elaine! Though it's pery vritty! V-very pretty!
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;juri&stage;0:=confused.png,I can respect someone who really gives it their all at the outset...
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;4:=bored.png,I like fashion a lot, but uhm. I think I move too much for skirts to be part of my warddrobe.
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5:=bored.png,I still haven't forgiven you, you know. You've been really rude all game.
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5:=bored.png,Maybe this next set'll be a bit humbling for you.
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;5:=confident.png,I think capes are <i>very</i> heroic. That's probably why you saved that, right?
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;kimberly&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,I-I guess that's true, Kimberly, but underwear is a lot nicer than most swimsuits, right?
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;4&saidmarker;null_possess:=embarrassed.png,I-I'll admit, I'm kind of interested to see what sort of underwear you have where you're from. You know. For fashion's sake.
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,I-I'll admit, most of my pairs are lacy or athletic. I haven't seen fruity panties in... well, I mean, since last round, but, er, you know, Natsuki...?
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;red&stage;1:=confused.png,Is that huge sword just like… A centerpiece of some sort?
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;4:=calm.png,It can get... breezy in Paris. I'd really rather not show my underwear if I don't want to.
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;marceline&stage;4:=confident.png,It’s black! I think I’ve figured out how your powers work! You drain people’s color to black, then… Um… I don’t know.
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;1:=confused.png,Just because it seems like you have an affinity for plants...
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;1:=bored.png,You just have a certain bearing about you. And, you know, lots of plants.
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;ann&stage;3:=confident.png,Like... I think you'd look great in a red jumpsuit!
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;launch&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,Not this Launch again!
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;4:=confident.png,Oh! I see. It's like a ship. No wonder you have a nautical theme!
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,<i>Please</i> be safe. I think the fireworks are cool, but I'd be really sad if you got hurt, Shimakaze!
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;4:=alarmed.png,Oh! I tend not to match my underwear either unless… Uhm. I’m planning on losing it.
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;4:=confident.png,W-well, I’m glad you’re still in the game, Nagisa!
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;meg&stage;4:=confident.png,Oh! You have such nice legs, Meg!  I don’t think anyone minds you showing those off.
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;4:=calm.png,Oh... I have a few shirts like that! I like to knot them above my navel, though!
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,O-of course you’d wear underwear under your clothes!
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Or as flexible, because I usually take my time in the mornings. To, um, get to classes and such.
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;4:=alarmed.png,Please have panties, please have panties... (<i>Or... um... or don't...</i>)
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,R-really? There's pictures like that on the internet? <i>No way</i>.
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,This’ll at least be a funny story later!
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;4:=alarmed.png,Those are… Impressive!
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;april&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,Um… It’s a very haute chic look, April! But yes, we can… See what you’re wearing underneath.
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;ruby&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,U-uhm. Yes. Yes we did just see that, Ruby. Good thing you don’t seem to like sheer panties…
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;2:=confused.png,Wait, you’re taking your skirt off first?
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;navi:=wink.png,Well, this confirms some suspicions...
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;buffy&stage;4:=confused.png,Whoa! Buffy, that's a neat trick.
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;kimberly&stage;4:=confused.png,W-well, based on your bra... I'm not sure if this is going to be <i>really</i> sexy or what, Kimberly!
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;3:=confused.png,W-well, I guess we're in an elite group now, if that's true...
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;videl&stage;3:=wink.png,You can't rely on a superhero to come save you.
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;3:=confused.png,You know, about taking it all off?
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;4:=excited.png,You know, I usually go clothes shopping with Alya, but if you wanted to get something new, it might fun.
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;4:=wink.png,You’re mean <i>and</i> slutty. It’s a shame San Fransokyo U wasted a spot on you. Even Max didn’t get in!
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;4:=confident.png,Oh, you want to try and <i>slap</i> me? Bring it on!
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;2:=excited.png,Your qipao, Chun-li? It's so pretty!
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;2:=excited.png,Oh, I like the traditional style of your qipao, Chun-li! It's really impressive that you've worked that into your fighting style!
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;alice&stage;2:=confident.png,Your taste is very vintage, and very eclectic.
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;sanako:=wink.png,You're very wise for 18, Sanako! And so sweet!
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;4:,count-role;other&character;rinkah:=wink.png,...And Blackrose is so fiery...I just thought...
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;3:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;bodysuit:,marker:bodysuit=confident.png,D.Va, now that you’re out of your suit, can I call you Hana? I think it’s a way cooler name!
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;juri:=confident.png,Hey! Chun-li's dress is really cool! You're being <i>such</i> a jerk to her, and she's not even beating you up or arresting you like she could, Juri!
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;3:,count-role;self&saidmarker;bodysuit:=embarrassed.png,Hm… We have a lot of bodysuits here today… And interesting figures underneath them! U-um.
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;2:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;bodysuit:,marker:bodysuit=calm.png,Is this Metroid I hear so much about the name of your Kwami?
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;2:,count-role;self&saidmarker;bodysuit:=wink.png,It does seem like a hassle to take off your suit...I’m glad my transformation is so easy!
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;2:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;bodysuit:,marker:bodysuit=wink.png,It does seem like a hassle to take off your suit...I’m glad my transformation is so easy!
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;5:,count-role;other&character;raven&stage;4-7:=embarrassed.png,The only person I can think of that doesn’t wear underwear under her clothes is Raven…
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;3:,count-role;other&character;ann:=confused.png,Um. Ann, are you staring because you like Nagisa, or because her bra looks like sweets?
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;seven&stage;1:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;bodysuit:,marker:bodysuit=excited.png,Whoa, your body suit regenerates you? Mine only stops me from feeling pain...But regeneration sounds great!
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;ruby&stage;3:,count-role;other&character;blake:=confident.png,With all three of here, we're almost a ladybug sandwich! With me right in the middle!
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;lyn&stage;5:,count-role;other&character;florina:=embarrassed.png,W-wouldn’t that get really drafty, Florina? And if you move, everyone would see… Well, everything.
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;4:,count-role;self&saidmarker;bun_puns:=wink.png,You seem a bit embarrassed, but keep your composure I'm sure you know how to <i>rise</i> to the challenge!
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;5:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=embarrassed.png,Z-zone might be lewd enough to go without underwear, but I don’t think you’re like that, Florina!
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;5:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=alarmed.png,I have a feeling that Zone-tan just assumes most women are naked under their clothes. I mean, wot nearing under...Not wearing underwear!

2-female_removing_major,count-yandere&role;target:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_stripping:=bored.png,Based on how you’ve acted towards everyone else, I kind of hope you do get Akumatized. Maybe it’d give you perspective once I fix you.
2-female_removing_major,count-yandere&role;target:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;ayano_stripping:=confused.png,E-er, don’t get down ~name~, it’s... Just a game.

2-female_removed_major=confident.png,But Alya always wants to go to saunas, so I suppose this is a bit like that.
2-female_removed_major=wink.png,If you ever wanted to compare notes, or model some of my designs, I'm sure we'd have a great time.
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;6:=bored.png,(<i>I really should be watching out for an akuma... but the tension between Natsuki and ~player~! It's so cute! I want... I must help them!</i>)

2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:=confused.png,I-I'm impressed you managed to get your clothes off that way. That's some sharp shooting.
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:=excited.png,Ah! Wait a minute! Did you just transform!? Are you using a Miraculous?
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;6:=confident.png,And it’s a cute pair!
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;5:=wink.png,Annie, I worry about you getting possessed by Hawk Moth. Smart people are always the toughest villains, so you should be proud of your body!
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;ann&stage;4:=bored.png,As someone who wears one routinely, I'd know.
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;launch&stage;6:=bored.png,At least she doesn't have her gun anymore...
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;6:=confused.png,At least you're... very charming... Elaine.
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;marceline&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,Breavy heathing? No, me, of course not! I’m just trying to stop your akuma!
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;seven&stage;2:,marker:bodysuit=embarrassed.png,Does the suit come with… Other benefits, Seven?
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,E-er. Sorry. I'd really rather you not try to slap me.
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,U-um. Nevermind. Let's not get violent, GoGo.
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;4:,marker:gogo_max=bored.png,Just because Max is gay doesn't mean that-- <i>Va te faire cuire la cul.</i>.
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;4:,marker:gogo_dsl=alarmed.png,D-Did you really? Ugh. You're vile.
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,Er, I can maybe make some suggestions while you're visting? If you can afford that type of armor, I'm sure we can find you something cute!
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,Fortunately, my costume makes my clothes underneath seamless, so I never need underwear like that...
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;5:=alarmed.png,Doesn't that give you a huge wedgie all day?!
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;5:=confident.png,It's nice to have something you feel... Stylish in, but I never liked the way thongs looked.
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sanako&stage;2:,marker:groovy_sanako=wink.png,Groovy? <i>Groooovy</i>. Whoa! Sanako, wherever you're from, they have some really cool words!

2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;spooky&stage;2:=alarmed.png,Has Tikki been naked this whole time?! D-does my suit...Is it...Made of Tikki?
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;5:,marker:hotsprings=confused.png,Hot springs? It seems kind of weird to be naked around that many people… It’s like a sauna but swimming in sweat...No thanks.
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;4:=confident.png,Huh, I guess you like dressing comfortably too, Gwen! I-I mean, like, your underwear choice. Just… Something effective! And comfortable!
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;mei&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,I asked for language help because my mom speaks Cantonese…But, uhm, it seems your clothes can’t... on... these... er…
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale&stage;1:=confident.png,I do wonder if I had some more time to focus on fitness, if I could do even more as Ladybug than I already do!
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;6:=confident.png,I don’t really understand why people think I’m naked under my costume. It’s magic, after all.
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;meg&stage;6:=wink.png,I don’t suppose you can speak with a Scottish accent? You’re looking a little on point, Meg.
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;5:=alarmed.png,I don't think I've ever seen a... well, a <i>bra</i> like that... but what are you going to call it, Shimakaze?
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5a:=confident.png,I don't think luck has a sense of humor, but this is pretty amusing.
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5a:=confident.png,Looking kind of... vampy, Vriska. I-I kind of... appreciate it?
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;3:=confident.png,I just can't get over how stylish you manage to make your really practical apparel. I clearly have a lot to learn!
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;3:=wink.png,Whoa, even without your qipao, the rest of your outfit just flows together so well. The fashion designer in me is gushing over this. (E-er, maybe that's a poor word choice.)
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;3:=confident.png,I love how you can make even traditional-styled clothing work for your combat techniques!
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;meg&stage;5:=wink.png,I know <i>I</i> don’t. Um. To preserve your modesty, of course!
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;3:=bored.png,I mean, nice legs aren’t a bad thing, but…
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;alice&stage;3:=excited.png,I really like it, but if you ever want to modernize your apparel... I’d love to help.
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;tracer&stage;4:=confident.png,I see Lena’a underpants!
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6b:=embarrassed.png,I think that's a bunny suit... But um... From this angle I can definitely see most of your butt.
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6b:=embarrassed.png,The whole butt-floss and stockings look is a lot better on you than <i>my</i> costume, Vriska.
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;juri&stage;1:=bored.png,I wish you weren't so <i>obviously</i> a villain. I'm sure we could get along great if you renounced your evil ways!
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;6:=embarrassed.png,I-I guess you don't usually have to worry about other ships... um... trying to go for your aft. I-I meant-- oh! Wait, no, aft works perfectly here!
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;4:=alarmed.png,I-I mean if it did it'd be embarrassing but you're already plenty... I'll uhm. Stop talking.
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;buffy&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,I-I might have to use that at some point!
2-female_removed_major,count-role;other&character;kim&stage;8:=embarrassed.png,I-I wasn’t looking at you, Kim! I was looking at ~name~. B-because it’s her turn!
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;5&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=alarmed.png,I-it usually doesn't <i>destroy</i> clothes either... Nayru? Hey, Nayru!
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;5:=alarmed.png,I'll have to try that look though! It's super cu--uuuul. <i>Cool</i>! Not butts! Um! Very stylish!
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;4:=wink.png,I've seen a lot of weird stuff in my time. That includes... illicit... fanart of me. I think you can manage this, Daria. Relatable strategy, though.
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sola&stage;5:=bored.png,N-not that I need proof or anything, just that... I'm going to stop while I'm ahead.
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,No regrets here, either! E-except maybe playing a little poorly. A-and there not really being an akuma here...
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;kimberly&stage;5:=confident.png,Oh! I see! He must be the Green Ranger, if you're the Pink one! How thoughtful of you!
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;5:=wink.png,Oh! It's like the towel trick. Clever, Daria. It almost makes me wish I'd worn a skirt...
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;daisy&stage;5:=excited.png,Oh! You wore a swimsuit under that. You’re really sporty, Daisy! You have to give me some workout tips!
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;4:,marker:class_rep=excited.png,Oh! You’re doing this to help someone into student government? I was class rep, so let me know if I can help!
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;5:=wink.png,Oh, I see. This was all part of your plan, huh? T-though...
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;4&saidmarker;d.va_noobs:=confused.png,Oh, so we’re not noobs anymore, are we, D.Va? Apologize, then maybe I’ll give you a hug, (But only so she’s not Akumatized.)
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;4:=wink.png,Oh. <i>Pffft</i>. Okay, that's a good joke.
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sanako&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,O-oh! I think I brought something similar, Sanako! J-just not in the chest.
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;5&saidmarker;null_possess:=alarmed.png,O-oh, sorry. It's just very normal. Not that it wouldn't be. It's not like I was expecting anything elaborate. In fact I'm glad it's so normal. E-erk...
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,Sei, w-what's a bodyshot, and why am I being prompted to do one off your breasts? I-I mean breastplate.

2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,Whew. What a relief that must be for you, Sayaka! Um. For us! Obviously.
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5b:=embarrassed.png,Who's Eridan? And that looks kind of like a sexy schoolgirl outfit... You certainly seem to enjoy being tasteless in your mockery of me...
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5b:=embarrassed.png,Oh so <i>now</i> you're in a schoolgirl outfit. Do you have <i>taste</i> at all? N-not like-- Um!
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;asuna&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,W-well, I guess you put a lot of faith in this Kirito guy. Maybe you should try keeping your own confidence, instead? I know about men who dress all in black.
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6a:=embarrassed.png,W-well, you certainly look kind of drenched.
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6a:=embarrassed.png,I sind of kort of--Kind of sort of--Er... Always have a bad time swimming.

2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5c:=confused.png,Yes, I'm sure we're all mortified for you being in your pyjamas. It's not like they look cute on you.
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5c:=confused.png,Oh yeah, let's just make fun of Marinette's costume, but Vriska just looks <i>sooo</i> cute in her oversized shirt and stockings.
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;videl&stage;4:=calm.png,You're okay with that, right Videl?

2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;3:,count-role;self&saidmarker;bodysuit:=embarrassed.png,Er, It’s nice to be ahead? You meant it’s sice to knee myself--Nice to see myself winning, right?!
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;3:,count-role;self&saidmarker;bodysuit:=alarmed.png,Oh, oui. It’s quite the view--From an aesthetic view! Not necessarily a view of you in particular--Erk.
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;4:,count-role;other&character;alice:,marker:bodysuit=excited.png,Hmm...Alice, If D.Va does use a bunny miraculous, is she the White Rabbit you’ve been chasing?
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;5:,count-role;other&character;corrin_f&saidmarker;hotsprings:=excited.png,Hmm… Maybe hot springs are more than I thought they’d be, since you and Corrin both seem fixated on them. I should give it a try, I think!
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_mariba:=wink.png,I definetly want to hear what kinds of boys or girls you like too, Saki! What are friends for if not lots of harebrained schemes to find your soulmate?
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_mariba:=wink.png,We're definitely going to have to talk about boys--or girls--too, Saki!
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;6:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=wink.png,I guess we proved her wrong, didn’t we, Florina?
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;6:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=confident.png,I-I mean everyone is naked at some level. But, underwear is just another fashion choice. And a comfy one!
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;bun_puns:=embarrassed.png,I know it's a bun... a pun... erk... But you definitely inspire me!
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;5:,count-role;other&character;palutena:=excited.png,I see we have a few ladies here tonight interested in asymmetrical fashion. By which I mean Nagisa and Palutena!
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;4:,count-role;other&character;lyn:=alarmed.png,I-I just mean you're both swordswomen, b-but Lyn's apparel is less armor and more style.
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;4:,count-role;self&saidmarker;marinette_shirted:=confident.png,I-I mean I’ve never taken a shirt off in front of a stranger. Or my costume! Be brave Nagisa!
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;meg&stage;6:,count-role;other&character;morrigan:=wink.png,Meg... Hm. Did something get switched up here? Morrigan has the accent but you have the red hair, the plaid underwear… Or is she some sort of altar ego?
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;kim&stage;4:,count-role;other&character;nugi-chan:=confused.png,Oh, do you have children, Nugi-chan?
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;3:,count-role;self&saidmarker;bodysuit:=confused.png,She must be really tired for you to lose your suit like that.
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;lyn&stage;6:,count-role;other&character;florina:=excited.png,Thank goodness. I knew you were really classy, Lyn!
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6b:,count-role;other&character;d.va:=alarmed.png,Uh, D.Va, this is way different than <i>your</i> conception of a bunny suit. I hope, anyway.

2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;ruby&stage;4:,count-role;other&character;blake:=embarrassed.png,W-wait, I didn't mean... Or maybe I did? Maybe w-we should try it?

3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4:=wink.png,I hope whatever you picked next is a bit more unique to <i>you</i> instead of trying to mock <i>me</i>.
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;aimee:=alarmed.png,Ahh!!! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale&stage;0:=wink.png,But nothing like you.
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;4:=alarmed.png,Curter. I mean. More Curt.
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;4&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=confused.png,E-er-- wait! No, it usually possesses an object! Not a person directly!
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;5:=alarmed.png,E-er... I... <i>Non, je ne t'aime pas coups de feau a l'arriere....</i>
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;arwen&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,E-even though you're losing your dress, I want you to stay proud, because I know what it's like to have two very different parents, and to meet so many... interesting people.
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,Er. I mean, in terms of the fashion not that... It'll fall off now... Uhm.
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;3:=confused.png,Uhm. Elena... I'm sorry it's come to this but for what it's worth, your dress is super pretty! Just like you!
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;3:=alarmed.png,Elena! It's still early, don't get too embarrassed! Someone like you would be terrifying if you're possessed!
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;3:=confident.png,Er... do you have something to tell us, Joey? It's okay, you're among friends. Mostly! I think!
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;asuna&stage;4:=confused.png,Er... Had. It's weird you haven't found a kwami for yourself...
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;3:,marker:marinette_shirted=embarrassed.png,Erk. I’ve never shirted a stranger either.
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;spooky&stage;1:=confused.png,Ghosts don’t usually wear a lot of clothes… W-wait, that’s not just… part…
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,guess my Japanese is worse than I thought… Hmm… I thought I’d get along really well with her…
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;5:=confused.png,H-hey! That's not nice, Elaine! I was really worried I wasn't going to have my yo-yo ready!
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;meg&stage;5:=confident.png,Hmm, a matching set, I hope? It's not polka dots, but I like patterns a lot!
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;4:=bored.png,Hmm... Corrin, I get the feeling you just kind of throw on whatever you have...
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;4:=alarmed.png,Hmm... Do you really need to raise the stakes? We've... Kind of already seen your underwear, Elaine! Though it's pery vritty! V-very pretty!
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;juri&stage;0:=confused.png,I can respect someone who really gives it their all at the outset...
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;4:=bored.png,I like fashion a lot, but uhm. I think I move too much for skirts to be part of my warddrobe.
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5:=bored.png,I still haven't forgiven you, you know. You've been really rude all game.
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5:=bored.png,Maybe this next set'll be a bit humbling for you.
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;5:=confident.png,I think capes are <i>very</i> heroic. That's probably why you saved that, right?
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;kimberly&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,I-I guess that's true, Kimberly, but underwear is a lot nicer than most swimsuits, right?
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;4&saidmarker;null_possess:=embarrassed.png,I-I'll admit, I'm kind of interested to see what sort of underwear you have where you're from. You know. For fashion's sake.
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,I-I'll admit, most of my pairs are lacy or athletic. I haven't seen fruity panties in... well, I mean, since last round, but, er, you know, Natsuki...?
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;red&stage;1:=confused.png,Is that huge sword just like… A centerpiece of some sort?
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;4:=calm.png,It can get... breezy in Paris. I'd really rather not show my underwear if I don't want to.
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;marceline&stage;4:=confident.png,It’s black! I think I’ve figured out how your powers work! You drain people’s color to black, then… Um… I don’t know.
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;1:=confused.png,Just because it seems like you have an affinity for plants...
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;1:=bored.png,You just have a certain bearing about you. And, you know, lots of plants.
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;ann&stage;3:=confident.png,Like... I think you'd look great in a red jumpsuit!
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;launch&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,Not this Launch again!
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;4:=confident.png,Oh! I see. It's like a ship. No wonder you have a nautical theme!
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,<i>Please</i> be safe. I think the fireworks are cool, but I'd be really sad if you got hurt, Shimakaze!
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;4:=alarmed.png,Oh! I tend not to match my underwear either unless… Uhm. I’m planning on losing it.
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;4:=confident.png,W-well, I’m glad you’re still in the game, Nagisa!
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;meg&stage;4:=confident.png,Oh! You have such nice legs, Meg!  I don’t think anyone minds you showing those off.
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;4:=calm.png,Oh... I have a few shirts like that! I like to knot them above my navel, though!
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,O-of course you’d wear underwear under your clothes!
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Or as flexible, because I usually take my time in the mornings. To, um, get to classes and such.
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;4:=alarmed.png,Please have panties, please have panties... (<i>Or... um... or don't...</i>)
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,R-really? There's pictures like that on the internet? <i>No way</i>.
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,This’ll at least be a funny story later!
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;4:=alarmed.png,Those are… Impressive!
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;april&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,Um… It’s a very haute chic look, April! But yes, we can… See what you’re wearing underneath.
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;ruby&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,U-uhm. Yes. Yes we did just see that, Ruby. Good thing you don’t seem to like sheer panties…
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;2:=confused.png,Wait, you’re taking your skirt off first?
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;1:=alarmed.png,Well, I’ve shown you mine, so I hope you don’t mind showing me yours? Y-your secret identity, that is! Definitely not anything else. Um...
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;navi:=wink.png,Well, this confirms some suspicions...
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;buffy&stage;4:=confused.png,Whoa! Buffy, that's a neat trick.
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;kimberly&stage;4:=confused.png,W-well, based on your bra... I'm not sure if this is going to be <i>really</i> sexy or what, Kimberly!
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;3:=confused.png,W-well, I guess we're in an elite group now, if that's true...
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;videl&stage;3:=wink.png,You can't rely on a superhero to come save you.
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;3:=confused.png,You know, about taking it all off?
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;4:=excited.png,You know, I usually go clothes shopping with Alya, but if you wanted to get something new, it might fun.
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;4:=wink.png,You’re mean <i>and</i> slutty. It’s a shame San Fransokyo U wasted a spot on you. Even Max didn’t get in!
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;4:=confident.png,Oh, you want to try and <i>slap</i> me? Bring it on!
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;2:=excited.png,Your qipao, Chun-li? It's so pretty!
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;2:=excited.png,Oh, I like the traditional style of your qipao, Chun-li! It's really impressive that you've worked that into your fighting style!
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;alice&stage;2:=confident.png,Your taste is very vintage, and very eclectic.
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;sanako:=wink.png,You're very wise for 18, Sanako! And so sweet!
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;4:,count-role;other&character;rinkah:=wink.png,...And Blackrose is so fiery...I just thought...

3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;juri:=confident.png,Hey! Chun-li's dress is really cool! You're being <i>such</i> a jerk to her, and she's not even beating you up or arresting you like she could, Juri!
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;3:,count-role;self&saidmarker;bodysuit:=embarrassed.png,Hm… We have a lot of bodysuits here today… And interesting figures underneath them! U-um.
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;2:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;bodysuit:,marker:bodysuit=calm.png,Is this Metroid I hear so much about the name of your Kwami?
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;2:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;bodysuit:,marker:bodysuit=wink.png,It does seem like a hassle to take off your suit...I’m glad my transformation is so easy!
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;2:,count-role;self&saidmarker;bodysuit:=wink.png,It does seem like a hassle to take off your suit...I’m glad my transformation is so easy!
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;5:,count-role;other&character;raven&stage;4-7:=embarrassed.png,The only person I can think of that doesn’t wear underwear under her clothes is Raven…
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;3:,count-role;other&character;ann:=confused.png,Um. Ann, are you staring because you like Nagisa, or because her bra looks like sweets?
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;seven&stage;1:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;bodysuit:,marker:bodysuit=excited.png,Whoa, your body suit regenerates you? Mine only stops me from feeling pain...But regeneration sounds great!
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;ruby&stage;3:,count-role;other&character;blake:=confident.png,With all three of here, we're almost a ladybug sandwich! With me right in the middle!
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;lyn&stage;5:,count-role;other&character;florina:=embarrassed.png,W-wouldn’t that get really drafty, Florina? And if you move, everyone would see… Well, everything.

3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;5:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=alarmed.png,I have a feeling that Zone-tan just assumes most women are naked under their clothes. I mean, wot nearing under...Not wearing underwear!

3-female_removing_major,count-yandere:1-3,count-villain&role;target&stage;3-5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=wink.png,Just because ~name~ is misguided, doesn’t mean that she doesn’t have redeeming qualities. Maybe if you didn’t pick on her, she wouldn’t do what she does?
3-female_removed_major=wink.png,If you ever wanted to compare notes, or model some of my designs, I'm sure we'd have a great time.
3-female_removed_major=wink.png,It’s a cute design, for a cute woman. I-I mean, from an aesthetic point of view.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;6:=bored.png,(<i>I really should be watching out for an akuma... but the tension between Natsuki and ~player~! It's so cute! I want... I must help them!</i>)
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;5:=confident.png,(I've got it!) Saki! How about we do something together after this?
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;5:=confident.png,(I think I have an idea!) Saki! How about I take you out for something fun after this?
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;red&stage;2:=bored.png,A religious memento, maybe? I’m so confused.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Aimee! You could have really hurt someone!
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:=confused.png,I-I'm impressed you managed to get your clothes off that way. That's some sharp shooting.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:=excited.png,Ah! Wait a minute! Did you just transform!? Are you using a Miraculous?
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;6:=confident.png,And it’s a cute pair!
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;5:=wink.png,Annie, I worry about you getting possessed by Hawk Moth. Smart people are always the toughest villains, so you should be proud of your body!
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;ann&stage;4:=bored.png,As someone who wears one routinely, I'd know.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;launch&stage;6:=bored.png,At least she doesn't have her gun anymore...
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;6:=confused.png,At least you're... very charming... Elaine.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;4&notsaidmarker;d.va_noobs:=wink.png,Aww...Okay Hana. If you want a hug, I’ll give you a hug.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;marceline&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,Breavy heathing? No, me, of course not! I’m just trying to stop your akuma!
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;seven&stage;2:,marker:bodysuit=embarrassed.png,Does the suit come with… Other benefits, Seven?
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,E-er. Sorry. I'd really rather you not try to slap me.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,U-um. Nevermind. Let's not get violent, GoGo.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;4:,marker:gogo_max=bored.png,Just because Max is gay doesn't mean that-- <i>Va te faire cuire la cul.</i>.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;4:,marker:gogo_dsl=alarmed.png,D-Did you really? Ugh. You're vile.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,Er, I can maybe make some suggestions while you're visting? If you can afford that type of armor, I'm sure we can find you something cute!
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,Fortunately, my costume makes my clothes underneath seamless, so I never need underwear like that...
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;5:=alarmed.png,Doesn't that give you a huge wedgie all day?!
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;5:=confident.png,It's nice to have something you feel... Stylish in, but I never liked the way thongs looked.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sanako&stage;2:,marker:groovy_sanako=wink.png,Groovy? <i>Groooovy</i>. Whoa! Sanako, wherever you're from, they have some really cool words!
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sanako&stage;2:,marker:prepared_sanako=embarrassed.png,Y-you really really prepared for this, huh, Sanako?
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;spooky&stage;2:=alarmed.png,Has Tikki been naked this whole time?! D-does my suit...Is it...Made of Tikki?
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;5:,marker:hotsprings=confused.png,Hot springs? It seems kind of weird to be naked around that many people… It’s like a sauna but swimming in sweat...No thanks.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;4:=confident.png,Huh, I guess you like dressing comfortably too, Gwen! I-I mean, like, your underwear choice. Just… Something effective! And comfortable!
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;mei&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,I asked for language help because my mom speaks Cantonese…But, uhm, it seems your clothes can’t... on... these... er…
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale&stage;1:=confident.png,I do wonder if I had some more time to focus on fitness, if I could do even more as Ladybug than I already do!
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;6:=confident.png,I don’t really understand why people think I’m naked under my costume. It’s magic, after all.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;meg&stage;6:=wink.png,I don’t suppose you can speak with a Scottish accent? You’re looking a little on point, Meg.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;5:=alarmed.png,I don't think I've ever seen a... well, a <i>bra</i> like that... but what are you going to call it, Shimakaze?
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5a:=confident.png,I don't think luck has a sense of humor, but this is pretty amusing.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5a:=confident.png,Looking kind of... vampy, Vriska. I-I kind of... appreciate it?
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;3:=confident.png,I just can't get over how stylish you manage to make your really practical apparel. I clearly have a lot to learn!
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;3:=wink.png,Whoa, even without your qipao, the rest of your outfit just flows together so well. The fashion designer in me is gushing over this. (E-er, maybe that's a poor word choice.)
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;3:=confident.png,I love how you can make even traditional-styled clothing work for your combat techniques!
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;meg&stage;5:=wink.png,I know <i>I</i> don’t. Um. To preserve your modesty, of course!
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;3:=bored.png,I mean, nice legs aren’t a bad thing, but…
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;alice&stage;3:=excited.png,I really like it, but if you ever want to modernize your apparel... I’d love to help.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;tracer&stage;4:=confident.png,I see Lena’a underpants!
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6b:=embarrassed.png,I think that's a bunny suit... But um... From this angle I can definitely see most of your butt.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6b:=embarrassed.png,The whole butt-floss and stockings look is a lot better on you than <i>my</i> costume, Vriska.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;juri&stage;1:=bored.png,I wish you weren't so <i>obviously</i> a villain. I'm sure we could get along great if you renounced your evil ways!
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;6:=embarrassed.png,I-I guess you don't usually have to worry about other ships... um... trying to go for your aft. I-I meant-- oh! Wait, no, aft works perfectly here!
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;4:=alarmed.png,I-I mean if it did it'd be embarrassing but you're already plenty... I'll uhm. Stop talking.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;other&character;kim&stage;8:=embarrassed.png,I-I wasn’t looking at you, Kim! I was looking at ~name~. B-because it’s her turn!
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;5&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=alarmed.png,I-it usually doesn't <i>destroy</i> clothes either... Nayru? Hey, Nayru!
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;5:=alarmed.png,I'll have to try that look though! It's super cu--uuuul. <i>Cool</i>! Not butts! Um! Very stylish!
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;4:=wink.png,I've seen a lot of weird stuff in my time. That includes... illicit... fanart of me. I think you can manage this, Daria. Relatable strategy, though.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sola&stage;5:=bored.png,N-not that I need proof or anything, just that... I'm going to stop while I'm ahead.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,No regrets here, either! E-except maybe playing a little poorly. A-and there not really being an akuma here...
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;kimberly&stage;5:=confident.png,Oh! I see! He must be the Green Ranger, if you're the Pink one! How thoughtful of you!
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;5:=wink.png,Oh! It's like the towel trick. Clever, Daria. It almost makes me wish I'd worn a skirt...
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;daisy&stage;5:=excited.png,Oh! You wore a swimsuit under that. You’re really sporty, Daisy! You have to give me some workout tips!
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;4:,marker:class_rep=excited.png,Oh! You’re doing this to help someone into student government? I was class rep, so let me know if I can help!
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;5:=wink.png,Oh, I see. This was all part of your plan, huh? T-though...
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;4&saidmarker;d.va_noobs:=confused.png,Oh, so we’re not noobs anymore, are we, D.Va? Apologize, then maybe I’ll give you a hug, (But only so she’s not Akumatized.)
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;4:=wink.png,Oh. <i>Pffft</i>. Okay, that's a good joke.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sanako&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,O-oh! I think I brought something similar, Sanako! J-just not in the chest.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;5&saidmarker;null_possess:=alarmed.png,O-oh, sorry. It's just very normal. Not that it wouldn't be. It's not like I was expecting anything elaborate. In fact I'm glad it's so normal. E-erk...
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,Sei, w-what's a bodyshot, and why am I being prompted to do one off your breasts? I-I mean breastplate.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;arwen&stage;4:=calm.png,S-so thanks, Arwen! I'll definitely remember... this... Uhm. Bonding we did.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;kimberly&stage;4:=alarmed.png,T-totally hot. Y-yeah. You dure sh-shoe. S-sure do, Kimberly!
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;zoey&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,Um… I hope you mean something relaxing, like a trip and not… Something debased…
3-female_removed_major,count-role;other&character;zone-tan&stage;3:,marker:ztentacles=confused.png,U-uhm, Zone-tan, I think the female form can be quite pretty. And obviously, male… Anatomy… Especially… But tentacles are gross! Only the wives of fishermen think about that!
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;2:,marker:face_it_tiger=excited.png,Wait a second! I <i>know</i> you! You’re Gwendolyne Stacy, from the <i>Mary Janes</i>! Ohmygoshwhat? I <i>love</i> <i>Face It Tiger</i>!
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;4:=confused.png,Where have I heard your voice before? It’s driving me crazy!
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,Whew. What a relief that must be for you, Sayaka! Um. For us! Obviously.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5b:=embarrassed.png,Who's Eridan? And that looks kind of like a sexy schoolgirl outfit... You certainly seem to enjoy being tasteless in your mockery of me...
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5b:=embarrassed.png,Oh so <i>now</i> you're in a schoolgirl outfit. Do you have <i>taste</i> at all? N-not like-- Um!
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;asuna&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,W-well, I guess you put a lot of faith in this Kirito guy. Maybe you should try keeping your own confidence, instead? I know about men who dress all in black.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6a:=embarrassed.png,W-well, you certainly look kind of drenched.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6a:=embarrassed.png,I sind of kort of--Kind of sort of--Er... Always have a bad time swimming.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;other&character;morrigan&stage;4:=excited.png,W-what? How are you just?
3-female_removed_major,count-role;other&character;morrigan&stage;4:=confident.png,Is your akuma power control over bats? It's... A clever use to protect your modesty, Morrigan!
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;4:=wink.png,W-wow. Y-your cingerie is lute! L-lingerie is c-cute! V-very... Um...
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,O-oh! W-wow. Ningerie lever... lingerie n-never really... um. Maybe I should try something like that?
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;5:=alarmed.png,Yeah… Hawkmoth is really creepy when you think about it...
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5c:=confused.png,Yes, I'm sure we're all mortified for you being in your pyjamas. It's not like they look cute on you.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5c:=confused.png,Oh yeah, let's just make fun of Marinette's costume, but Vriska just looks <i>sooo</i> cute in her oversized shirt and stockings.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;videl&stage;4:=calm.png,You're okay with that, right Videl?
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,You're really hot though, so it's no surprise! I-I mean it's hot where you live. So you'd need to wear... to cool... Urh.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;navi:=confident.png,You're some kind of spirit guide, aren't you? You help a hero, right?
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_furavity:=excited.png,After you, Ochako, and Futaba have had your fun, it would be nice for us to hang out too! Let me surprise you!
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;3:,count-role;self&saidmarker;bodysuit:=embarrassed.png,Er, It’s nice to be ahead? B-but I’m not interested in...
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;3:,count-role;self&saidmarker;bodysuit:=embarrassed.png,Er, It’s nice to be ahead? You meant it’s sice to knee myself--Nice to see myself winning, right?!
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;3:,count-role;self&saidmarker;bodysuit:=alarmed.png,Oh, oui. It’s quite the view--From an aesthetic view! Not necessarily a view of you in particular--Erk.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;4:,count-role;other&character;alice:,marker:bodysuit=excited.png,Hmm...Alice, If D.Va does use a bunny miraculous, is she the White Rabbit you’ve been chasing?
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;5:,count-role;other&character;corrin_f&saidmarker;hotsprings:=excited.png,Hmm… Maybe hot springs are more than I thought they’d be, since you and Corrin both seem fixated on them. I should give it a try, I think!
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_mariba:=wink.png,I definetly want to hear what kinds of boys or girls you like too, Saki! What are friends for if not lots of harebrained schemes to find your soulmate?
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_mariba:=wink.png,We're definitely going to have to talk about boys--or girls--too, Saki!
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;6:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=wink.png,I guess we proved her wrong, didn’t we, Florina?
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;6:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=confident.png,I-I mean everyone is naked at some level. But, underwear is just another fashion choice. And a comfy one!
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;bun_puns:=embarrassed.png,I know it's a bun... a pun... erk... But you definitely inspire me!
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;5:,count-role;other&character;palutena:=excited.png,I see we have a few ladies here tonight interested in asymmetrical fashion. By which I mean Nagisa and Palutena!
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;4:,count-role;other&character;lyn:=alarmed.png,I-I just mean you're both swordswomen, b-but Lyn's apparel is less armor and more style.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;4:,count-role;self&saidmarker;marinette_shirted:=confident.png,I-I mean I’ve never taken a shirt off in front of a stranger. Or my costume! Be brave Nagisa!
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;meg&stage;6:,count-role;other&character;morrigan:=wink.png,Meg... Hm. Did something get switched up here? Morrigan has the accent but you have the red hair, the plaid underwear… Or is she some sort of altar ego?
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;kim&stage;4:,count-role;other&character;nugi-chan:=confused.png,Oh, do you have children, Nugi-chan?
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;3:,count-role;self&saidmarker;bodysuit:=confused.png,She must be really tired for you to lose your suit like that.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;lyn&stage;6:,count-role;other&character;florina:=excited.png,Thank goodness. I knew you were really classy, Lyn!
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6b:,count-role;other&character;d.va:=alarmed.png,Uh, D.Va, this is way different than <i>your</i> conception of a bunny suit. I hope, anyway.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;tina:=embarrassed.png,Uhm. Tina, is what Aimee's doing just something you do for fun in Texas?
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;5:,count-role;other&character;meia:=embarrassed.png,U-um. Dealer, do we have to separate these two?
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_ladity:=wink.png,We're definitely going to have to talk about boys--or girls--too, Saki!
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_ladity:=wink.png,I definetly want to hear what kinds of boys or girls you like too, Saki! What are friends for if not lots of harebrained schemes to find your soulmate?
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;ruby&stage;4:,count-role;other&character;blake:=embarrassed.png,W-wait, I didn't mean... Or maybe I did? Maybe w-we should try it?
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;2:,count-role;self&saidmarker;blake_crush:,marker:marinette_overload=alarmed.png,W-what? I-I work with someone who looks a lot like Blake. She’s way cuter though, but, um. I-I-I-
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;seven&stage;2:,count-role;self&saidmarker;bodysuit:,count-role;other&character;samus&stage;3-7:=confused.png,Hmm… Samus, is it just particularly damage resistant?
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;seven&stage;2:,count-role;self&saidmarker;bodysuit:,count-role;other&character;d.va&stage;4-8:=confident.png,I bet D.Va’s helps with her reflexes.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;4:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_ladity:,count-role;other&character;uravity&saidmarker;saki_befriend_ladity:=wink.png,Saki, I know not everyone can be a superhero, but I hope you know that we like you enough to hang out with you! This’ll probably be a funny story about how we became friends later, right?
3-female_removed_major,count-dark-skinned&role;target:=wink.png,Oh, I’m envious! You must really see a lot of sunshine!
3-female_removed_major,count-journalist&role;target:=calm.png,Do you run a blog, ~name~? It’s a bit more modern than a newspaper... Though I hope this kind of thing isn’t on it!

4-male_removing_major,count-yandere:1-3,count-yandere&role;target:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=embarrassed.png,You should be ashamed of how you've been treating other people, ~name~.
4-male_removing_major,count-yandere:1-3,count-yandere&role;target:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=confident.png,This serves you right.
4-male_removing_major,count-yandere:1-3,count-yandere&role;target:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=alarmed.png,T-there's no akuma here, is there, just ~name~ and her whole yandere stuff!
4-male_removed_major=confused.png,Sorry, that was rude. I just really liked that jacket.
4-male_removed_major,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,And… Oh. I thought you were handsome before. I-I mean um! W-wow. You really work... Hard for that, don’t you?
4-male_removed_major,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;7:=embarrassed.png,But I keep getting glimpses behind the shield. Oh my.
4-male_removed_major,count-role;other&character;florina:=embarrassed.png,Florina! It’s okay! It’s just ~name~’s ~clothing~. Though… It is quite… Alluring…
4-male_removed_major,count-role;other&character;florina:=confident.png,Florina, don’t worry, staring is part of it! Um. Yeah!

4-male_removed_major,count-androgynous&role;target:=wink.png,You have such soft edges, ~name~. I like that you can explore beyond your masculinity.
4-male_removed_major,count-chubby&role;target:=wink.png,I know lots of people like someone who's a great snuggler. You might have a little extra weight, but it's just more of you to love, ~name~!
4-male_removed_major,count-muscular&role;target:=excited.png,Wow, ~name~! You must have a killer workout plan. I bet you could suplex trains!

4-male_removed_major,count-tall&role;target:=excited.png,Wow! ~name~, I've been waiting to tell you all day you're just so... Tall! I bet you could be a model for all kinds of outfits!
4-female_removing_major=excited.png,Hey, ~name~, are you sure you want to take that off?
4-female_removing_major=alarmed.png,I gave up my favorite jacket. Your ~clothing~ ~clothing.ifPlural(aren't|isn't)~ even designer!

4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;4:=confused.png,(I'm not sure what else to say to her!)
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,A ladybug can't change her spots, but maybe you can, <i>Vriska.</i>
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4:=wink.png,I hope whatever you picked next is a bit more unique to <i>you</i> instead of trying to mock <i>me</i>.
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;aimee:=alarmed.png,Ahh!!! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale&stage;0:=wink.png,But nothing like you.
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;4:=alarmed.png,Curter. I mean. More Curt.
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;4&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=confused.png,E-er-- wait! No, it usually possesses an object! Not a person directly!
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;5:=alarmed.png,E-er... I... <i>Non, je ne t'aime pas coups de feau a l'arriere....</i>
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;arwen&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,E-even though you're losing your dress, I want you to stay proud, because I know what it's like to have two very different parents, and to meet so many... interesting people.
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,Er. I mean, in terms of the fashion not that... It'll fall off now... Uhm.
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;3:=confused.png,Uhm. Elena... I'm sorry it's come to this but for what it's worth, your dress is super pretty! Just like you!
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;3:=alarmed.png,Elena! It's still early, don't get too embarrassed! Someone like you would be terrifying if you're possessed!
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;3:=confident.png,Er... do you have something to tell us, Joey? It's okay, you're among friends. Mostly! I think!
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;asuna&stage;4:=confused.png,Er... Had. It's weird you haven't found a kwami for yourself...
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;3:,marker:marinette_shirted=embarrassed.png,Erk. I’ve never shirted a stranger either.
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;spooky&stage;1:=confused.png,Ghosts don’t usually wear a lot of clothes… W-wait, that’s not just… part…
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,guess my Japanese is worse than I thought… Hmm… I thought I’d get along really well with her…
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;5:=confused.png,H-hey! That's not nice, Elaine! I was really worried I wasn't going to have my yo-yo ready!
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;meg&stage;5:=confident.png,Hmm, a matching set, I hope? It's not polka dots, but I like patterns a lot!
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;4:=bored.png,Hmm... Corrin, I get the feeling you just kind of throw on whatever you have...
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;4:=alarmed.png,Hmm... Do you really need to raise the stakes? We've... Kind of already seen your underwear, Elaine! Though it's pery vritty! V-very pretty!
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;juri&stage;0:=confused.png,I can respect someone who really gives it their all at the outset...
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;4:=bored.png,I like fashion a lot, but uhm. I think I move too much for skirts to be part of my warddrobe.
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5:=bored.png,I still haven't forgiven you, you know. You've been really rude all game.
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5:=bored.png,Maybe this next set'll be a bit humbling for you.
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;5:=confident.png,I think capes are <i>very</i> heroic. That's probably why you saved that, right?
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;kimberly&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,I-I guess that's true, Kimberly, but underwear is a lot nicer than most swimsuits, right?
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;4&saidmarker;null_possess:=embarrassed.png,I-I'll admit, I'm kind of interested to see what sort of underwear you have where you're from. You know. For fashion's sake.
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,I-I'll admit, most of my pairs are lacy or athletic. I haven't seen fruity panties in... well, I mean, since last round, but, er, you know, Natsuki...?
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;red&stage;1:=confused.png,Is that huge sword just like… A centerpiece of some sort?
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;4:=calm.png,It can get... breezy in Paris. I'd really rather not show my underwear if I don't want to.
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;marceline&stage;4:=confident.png,It’s black! I think I’ve figured out how your powers work! You drain people’s color to black, then… Um… I don’t know.
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;1:=confused.png,Just because it seems like you have an affinity for plants...
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;1:=bored.png,You just have a certain bearing about you. And, you know, lots of plants.
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;ann&stage;3:=confident.png,Like... I think you'd look great in a red jumpsuit!
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;launch&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,Not this Launch again!
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;4:=confident.png,Oh! I see. It's like a ship. No wonder you have a nautical theme!
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,<i>Please</i> be safe. I think the fireworks are cool, but I'd be really sad if you got hurt, Shimakaze!
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;4:=alarmed.png,Oh! I tend not to match my underwear either unless… Uhm. I’m planning on losing it.
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;4:=confident.png,W-well, I’m glad you’re still in the game, Nagisa!
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;meg&stage;4:=confident.png,Oh! You have such nice legs, Meg!  I don’t think anyone minds you showing those off.
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;4:=calm.png,Oh... I have a few shirts like that! I like to knot them above my navel, though!
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,O-of course you’d wear underwear under your clothes!
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Or as flexible, because I usually take my time in the mornings. To, um, get to classes and such.
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;4:=alarmed.png,Please have panties, please have panties... (<i>Or... um... or don't...</i>)
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,R-really? There's pictures like that on the internet? <i>No way</i>.
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,This’ll at least be a funny story later!
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;4:=alarmed.png,Those are… Impressive!
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;april&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,Um… It’s a very haute chic look, April! But yes, we can… See what you’re wearing underneath.
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;ruby&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,U-uhm. Yes. Yes we did just see that, Ruby. Good thing you don’t seem to like sheer panties…
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;2:=confused.png,Wait, you’re taking your skirt off first?
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;1:=alarmed.png,Well, I’ve shown you mine, so I hope you don’t mind showing me yours? Y-your secret identity, that is! Definitely not anything else. Um...
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;navi:=wink.png,Well, this confirms some suspicions...
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;buffy&stage;4:=confused.png,Whoa! Buffy, that's a neat trick.
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;kimberly&stage;4:=confused.png,W-well, based on your bra... I'm not sure if this is going to be <i>really</i> sexy or what, Kimberly!
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;3:=confused.png,W-well, I guess we're in an elite group now, if that's true...
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;videl&stage;3:=wink.png,You can't rely on a superhero to come save you.
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;3:=confused.png,You know, about taking it all off?
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;4:=excited.png,You know, I usually go clothes shopping with Alya, but if you wanted to get something new, it might fun.
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;4:=wink.png,You’re mean <i>and</i> slutty. It’s a shame San Fransokyo U wasted a spot on you. Even Max didn’t get in!
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;4:=confident.png,Oh, you want to try and <i>slap</i> me? Bring it on!
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;2:=excited.png,Your qipao, Chun-li? It's so pretty!
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;2:=excited.png,Oh, I like the traditional style of your qipao, Chun-li! It's really impressive that you've worked that into your fighting style!
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;alice&stage;2:=confident.png,Your taste is very vintage, and very eclectic.
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;sanako:=wink.png,You're very wise for 18, Sanako! And so sweet!
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;4:,count-role;other&character;rinkah:=wink.png,...And Blackrose is so fiery...I just thought...
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;3:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;bodysuit:,marker:bodysuit=confident.png,D.Va, now that you’re out of your suit, can I call you Hana? I think it’s a way cooler name!
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;juri:=confident.png,Hey! Chun-li's dress is really cool! You're being <i>such</i> a jerk to her, and she's not even beating you up or arresting you like she could, Juri!
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;3:,count-role;self&saidmarker;bodysuit:=embarrassed.png,Hm… We have a lot of bodysuits here today… And interesting figures underneath them! U-um.
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;2:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;bodysuit:,marker:bodysuit=calm.png,Is this Metroid I hear so much about the name of your Kwami?
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;2:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;bodysuit:,marker:bodysuit=wink.png,It does seem like a hassle to take off your suit...I’m glad my transformation is so easy!
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;2:,count-role;self&saidmarker;bodysuit:=wink.png,It does seem like a hassle to take off your suit...I’m glad my transformation is so easy!
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;5:,count-role;other&character;raven&stage;4-7:=embarrassed.png,The only person I can think of that doesn’t wear underwear under her clothes is Raven…
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;3:,count-role;other&character;ann:=confused.png,Um. Ann, are you staring because you like Nagisa, or because her bra looks like sweets?
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;seven&stage;1:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;bodysuit:,marker:bodysuit=excited.png,Whoa, your body suit regenerates you? Mine only stops me from feeling pain...But regeneration sounds great!
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;ruby&stage;3:,count-role;other&character;blake:=confident.png,With all three of here, we're almost a ladybug sandwich! With me right in the middle!
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;lyn&stage;5:,count-role;other&character;florina:=embarrassed.png,W-wouldn’t that get really drafty, Florina? And if you move, everyone would see… Well, everything.
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;4:,count-role;self&saidmarker;bun_puns:=wink.png,You seem a bit embarrassed, but keep your composure I'm sure you know how to <i>rise</i> to the challenge!
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;5:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=embarrassed.png,Z-zone might be lewd enough to go without underwear, but I don’t think you’re like that, Florina!
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;5:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=alarmed.png,I have a feeling that Zone-tan just assumes most women are naked under their clothes. I mean, wot nearing under...Not wearing underwear!
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;3:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_ladity:,count-role;other&character;uravity&saidmarker;saki_befriend_ladity:=excited.png,Saki, what about we go to an amusement park or something? It’s not <i>quite</i> like flying, but I bet you’d really enjoy something kind of thrilling, right?

4-female_removing_major,count-yandere&role;target:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_stripping:=bored.png,Based on how you’ve acted towards everyone else, I kind of hope you do get Akumatized. Maybe it’d give you perspective once I fix you.
4-female_removing_major,count-yandere&role;target:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;ayano_stripping:=confused.png,E-er, don’t get down ~name~, it’s... Just a game.

4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;launch&stage;6:=bored.png,At least she doesn't have her gun anymore...
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;6:=confused.png,At least you're... very charming... Elaine.
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;4&notsaidmarker;d.va_noobs:=wink.png,Aww...Okay Hana. If you want a hug, I’ll give you a hug.
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;marceline&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,Breavy heathing? No, me, of course not! I’m just trying to stop your akuma!
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;seven&stage;2:,marker:bodysuit=embarrassed.png,Does the suit come with… Other benefits, Seven?
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,E-er. Sorry. I'd really rather you not try to slap me.
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,U-um. Nevermind. Let's not get violent, GoGo.

4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,Er, I can maybe make some suggestions while you're visting? If you can afford that type of armor, I'm sure we can find you something cute!
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,Fortunately, my costume makes my clothes underneath seamless, so I never need underwear like that...
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;5:=alarmed.png,Doesn't that give you a huge wedgie all day?!
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;5:=confident.png,It's nice to have something you feel... Stylish in, but I never liked the way thongs looked.

4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;5:,marker:hotsprings=confused.png,Hot springs? It seems kind of weird to be naked around that many people… It’s like a sauna but swimming in sweat...No thanks.
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;4:=confident.png,Huh, I guess you like dressing comfortably too, Gwen! I-I mean, like, your underwear choice. Just… Something effective! And comfortable!

4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale&stage;1:=confident.png,I do wonder if I had some more time to focus on fitness, if I could do even more as Ladybug than I already do!
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;6:=confident.png,I don’t really understand why people think I’m naked under my costume. It’s magic, after all.
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;meg&stage;6:=wink.png,I don’t suppose you can speak with a Scottish accent? You’re looking a little on point, Meg.
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;5:=alarmed.png,I don't think I've ever seen a... well, a <i>bra</i> like that... but what are you going to call it, Shimakaze?

4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;3:=confident.png,I just can't get over how stylish you manage to make your really practical apparel. I clearly have a lot to learn!
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;3:=wink.png,Whoa, even without your qipao, the rest of your outfit just flows together so well. The fashion designer in me is gushing over this. (E-er, maybe that's a poor word choice.)
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;3:=confident.png,I love how you can make even traditional-styled clothing work for your combat techniques!
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;meg&stage;5:=wink.png,I know <i>I</i> don’t. Um. To preserve your modesty, of course!
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;3:=bored.png,I mean, nice legs aren’t a bad thing, but…
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;alice&stage;3:=excited.png,I really like it, but if you ever want to modernize your apparel... I’d love to help.
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;tracer&stage;4:=confident.png,I see Lena’a underpants!
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6b:=embarrassed.png,I think that's a bunny suit... But um... From this angle I can definitely see most of your butt.
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6b:=embarrassed.png,The whole butt-floss and stockings look is a lot better on you than <i>my</i> costume, Vriska.
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;juri&stage;1:=bored.png,I wish you weren't so <i>obviously</i> a villain. I'm sure we could get along great if you renounced your evil ways!

4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;buffy&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,I-I might have to use that at some point!

4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;5:=alarmed.png,I'll have to try that look though! It's super cu--uuuul. <i>Cool</i>! Not butts! Um! Very stylish!
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;4:=wink.png,I've seen a lot of weird stuff in my time. That includes... illicit... fanart of me. I think you can manage this, Daria. Relatable strategy, though.
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sola&stage;5:=bored.png,N-not that I need proof or anything, just that... I'm going to stop while I'm ahead.
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,No regrets here, either! E-except maybe playing a little poorly. A-and there not really being an akuma here...

4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;5:=wink.png,Oh, I see. This was all part of your plan, huh? T-though...
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;4&saidmarker;d.va_noobs:=confused.png,Oh, so we’re not noobs anymore, are we, D.Va? Apologize, then maybe I’ll give you a hug, (But only so she’s not Akumatized.)
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;4:=wink.png,Oh. <i>Pffft</i>. Okay, that's a good joke.
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sanako&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,O-oh! I think I brought something similar, Sanako! J-just not in the chest.
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;5&saidmarker;null_possess:=alarmed.png,O-oh, sorry. It's just very normal. Not that it wouldn't be. It's not like I was expecting anything elaborate. In fact I'm glad it's so normal. E-erk...
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,Sei, w-what's a bodyshot, and why am I being prompted to do one off your breasts? I-I mean breastplate.

4-female_removed_major,count-role;other&character;zone-tan&stage;3:,marker:ztentacles=confused.png,U-uhm, Zone-tan, I think the female form can be quite pretty. And obviously, male… Anatomy… Especially… But tentacles are gross! Only the wives of fishermen think about that!
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;2:,marker:face_it_tiger=excited.png,Wait a second! I <i>know</i> you! You’re Gwendolyne Stacy, from the <i>Mary Janes</i>! Ohmygoshwhat? I <i>love</i> <i>Face It Tiger</i>!

4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,Whew. What a relief that must be for you, Sayaka! Um. For us! Obviously.
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5b:=embarrassed.png,Who's Eridan? And that looks kind of like a sexy schoolgirl outfit... You certainly seem to enjoy being tasteless in your mockery of me...
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5b:=embarrassed.png,Oh so <i>now</i> you're in a schoolgirl outfit. Do you have <i>taste</i> at all? N-not like-- Um!
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;asuna&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,W-well, I guess you put a lot of faith in this Kirito guy. Maybe you should try keeping your own confidence, instead? I know about men who dress all in black.
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6a:=embarrassed.png,W-well, you certainly look kind of drenched.
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6a:=embarrassed.png,I sind of kort of--Kind of sort of--Er... Always have a bad time swimming.

4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5c:=confused.png,Yes, I'm sure we're all mortified for you being in your pyjamas. It's not like they look cute on you.
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5c:=confused.png,Oh yeah, let's just make fun of Marinette's costume, but Vriska just looks <i>sooo</i> cute in her oversized shirt and stockings.
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;videl&stage;4:=calm.png,You're okay with that, right Videl?
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,You're really hot though, so it's no surprise! I-I mean it's hot where you live. So you'd need to wear... to cool... Urh.

4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;3:,count-role;self&saidmarker;bodysuit:=embarrassed.png,Er, It’s nice to be ahead? You meant it’s sice to knee myself--Nice to see myself winning, right?!
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;3:,count-role;self&saidmarker;bodysuit:=alarmed.png,Oh, oui. It’s quite the view--From an aesthetic view! Not necessarily a view of you in particular--Erk.
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;4:,count-role;other&character;alice:,marker:bodysuit=excited.png,Hmm...Alice, If D.Va does use a bunny miraculous, is she the White Rabbit you’ve been chasing?
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;5:,count-role;other&character;corrin_f&saidmarker;hotsprings:=excited.png,Hmm… Maybe hot springs are more than I thought they’d be, since you and Corrin both seem fixated on them. I should give it a try, I think!
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_mariba:=wink.png,I definetly want to hear what kinds of boys or girls you like too, Saki! What are friends for if not lots of harebrained schemes to find your soulmate?

4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;6:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=wink.png,I guess we proved her wrong, didn’t we, Florina?
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;6:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=confident.png,I-I mean everyone is naked at some level. But, underwear is just another fashion choice. And a comfy one!
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;bun_puns:=embarrassed.png,I know it's a bun... a pun... erk... But you definitely inspire me!

4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;4:,count-role;self&saidmarker;marinette_shirted:=confident.png,I-I mean I’ve never taken a shirt off in front of a stranger. Or my costume! Be brave Nagisa!
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;meg&stage;6:,count-role;other&character;morrigan:=wink.png,Meg... Hm. Did something get switched up here? Morrigan has the accent but you have the red hair, the plaid underwear… Or is she some sort of altar ego?
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;kim&stage;4:,count-role;other&character;nugi-chan:=confused.png,Oh, do you have children, Nugi-chan?
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;3:,count-role;self&saidmarker;bodysuit:=confused.png,She must be really tired for you to lose your suit like that.
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;lyn&stage;6:,count-role;other&character;florina:=excited.png,Thank goodness. I knew you were really classy, Lyn!
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6b:,count-role;other&character;d.va:=alarmed.png,Uh, D.Va, this is way different than <i>your</i> conception of a bunny suit. I hope, anyway.
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;tina:=embarrassed.png,Uhm. Tina, is what Aimee's doing just something you do for fun in Texas?
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;5:,count-role;other&character;meia:=embarrassed.png,U-um. Dealer, do we have to separate these two?
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_ladity:=wink.png,We're definitely going to have to talk about boys--or girls--too, Saki!

4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;ruby&stage;4:,count-role;other&character;blake:=embarrassed.png,W-wait, I didn't mean... Or maybe I did? Maybe w-we should try it?
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;2:,count-role;self&saidmarker;blake_crush:,marker:marinette_overload=alarmed.png,W-what? I-I work with someone who looks a lot like Blake. She’s way cuter though, but, um. I-I-I-

4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;seven&stage;2:,count-role;self&saidmarker;bodysuit:,count-role;other&character;d.va&stage;4-8:=confident.png,I bet D.Va’s helps with her reflexes.

4-female_removed_major,count-androgynous&role;target:=confident.png,You know, I don't know a lot of people that dress like you, ~name~. But I think you pull off a very handsome and masculine look. Very striking!

5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;asuna&stage;4:=confused.png,Er... Had. It's weird you haven't found a kwami for yourself...
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;3:,marker:marinette_shirted=embarrassed.png,Erk. I’ve never shirted a stranger either.
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;spooky&stage;1:=confused.png,Ghosts don’t usually wear a lot of clothes… W-wait, that’s not just… part…
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,guess my Japanese is worse than I thought… Hmm… I thought I’d get along really well with her…
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;5:=confused.png,H-hey! That's not nice, Elaine! I was really worried I wasn't going to have my yo-yo ready!
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;meg&stage;5:=confident.png,Hmm, a matching set, I hope? It's not polka dots, but I like patterns a lot!
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;4:=bored.png,Hmm... Corrin, I get the feeling you just kind of throw on whatever you have...
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;4:=alarmed.png,Hmm... Do you really need to raise the stakes? We've... Kind of already seen your underwear, Elaine! Though it's pery vritty! V-very pretty!
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;juri&stage;0:=confused.png,I can respect someone who really gives it their all at the outset...
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;4:=bored.png,I like fashion a lot, but uhm. I think I move too much for skirts to be part of my warddrobe.
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5:=bored.png,I still haven't forgiven you, you know. You've been really rude all game.
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5:=bored.png,Maybe this next set'll be a bit humbling for you.
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;5:=confident.png,I think capes are <i>very</i> heroic. That's probably why you saved that, right?
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;kimberly&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,I-I guess that's true, Kimberly, but underwear is a lot nicer than most swimsuits, right?
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;4&saidmarker;null_possess:=embarrassed.png,I-I'll admit, I'm kind of interested to see what sort of underwear you have where you're from. You know. For fashion's sake.
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,I-I'll admit, most of my pairs are lacy or athletic. I haven't seen fruity panties in... well, I mean, since last round, but, er, you know, Natsuki...?
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;red&stage;1:=confused.png,Is that huge sword just like… A centerpiece of some sort?
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;4:=calm.png,It can get... breezy in Paris. I'd really rather not show my underwear if I don't want to.
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;marceline&stage;4:=confident.png,It’s black! I think I’ve figured out how your powers work! You drain people’s color to black, then… Um… I don’t know.
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;1:=confused.png,Just because it seems like you have an affinity for plants...
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;1:=bored.png,You just have a certain bearing about you. And, you know, lots of plants.
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;ann&stage;3:=confident.png,Like... I think you'd look great in a red jumpsuit!
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;launch&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,Not this Launch again!
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;4:=alarmed.png,Oh! I tend not to match my underwear either unless… Uhm. I’m planning on losing it.
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;4:=confident.png,W-well, I’m glad you’re still in the game, Nagisa!
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;meg&stage;4:=confident.png,Oh! You have such nice legs, Meg!  I don’t think anyone minds you showing those off.
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;4:=calm.png,Oh... I have a few shirts like that! I like to knot them above my navel, though!
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,O-of course you’d wear underwear under your clothes!
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Or as flexible, because I usually take my time in the mornings. To, um, get to classes and such.
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;4:=alarmed.png,Please have panties, please have panties... (<i>Or... um... or don't...</i>)
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,R-really? There's pictures like that on the internet? <i>No way</i>.
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,This’ll at least be a funny story later!
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;4:=alarmed.png,Those are… Impressive!
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;april&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,Um… It’s a very haute chic look, April! But yes, we can… See what you’re wearing underneath.
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;ruby&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,U-uhm. Yes. Yes we did just see that, Ruby. Good thing you don’t seem to like sheer panties…
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;2:=confused.png,Wait, you’re taking your skirt off first?
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;1:=alarmed.png,Well, I’ve shown you mine, so I hope you don’t mind showing me yours? Y-your secret identity, that is! Definitely not anything else. Um...
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;navi:=wink.png,Well, this confirms some suspicions...
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;buffy&stage;4:=confused.png,Whoa! Buffy, that's a neat trick.
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;kimberly&stage;4:=confused.png,W-well, based on your bra... I'm not sure if this is going to be <i>really</i> sexy or what, Kimberly!
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;3:=confused.png,W-well, I guess we're in an elite group now, if that's true...
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;videl&stage;3:=wink.png,You can't rely on a superhero to come save you.
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;3:=confused.png,You know, about taking it all off?
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;4:=excited.png,You know, I usually go clothes shopping with Alya, but if you wanted to get something new, it might fun.
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;4:=wink.png,You’re mean <i>and</i> slutty. It’s a shame San Fransokyo U wasted a spot on you. Even Max didn’t get in!
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;4:=confident.png,Oh, you want to try and <i>slap</i> me? Bring it on!
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;2:=excited.png,Your qipao, Chun-li? It's so pretty!
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;2:=excited.png,Oh, I like the traditional style of your qipao, Chun-li! It's really impressive that you've worked that into your fighting style!
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;alice&stage;2:=confident.png,Your taste is very vintage, and very eclectic.
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;sanako:=wink.png,You're very wise for 18, Sanako! And so sweet!
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;4:,count-role;other&character;rinkah:=wink.png,...And Blackrose is so fiery...I just thought...
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;3:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;bodysuit:,marker:bodysuit=confident.png,D.Va, now that you’re out of your suit, can I call you Hana? I think it’s a way cooler name!
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;juri:=confident.png,Hey! Chun-li's dress is really cool! You're being <i>such</i> a jerk to her, and she's not even beating you up or arresting you like she could, Juri!
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;3:,count-role;self&saidmarker;bodysuit:=embarrassed.png,Hm… We have a lot of bodysuits here today… And interesting figures underneath them! U-um.
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;2:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;bodysuit:,marker:bodysuit=calm.png,Is this Metroid I hear so much about the name of your Kwami?
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;2:,count-role;self&saidmarker;bodysuit:=wink.png,It does seem like a hassle to take off your suit...I’m glad my transformation is so easy!
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;2:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;bodysuit:,marker:bodysuit=wink.png,It does seem like a hassle to take off your suit...I’m glad my transformation is so easy!
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;5:,count-role;other&character;raven&stage;4-7:=embarrassed.png,The only person I can think of that doesn’t wear underwear under her clothes is Raven…
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;3:,count-role;other&character;ann:=confused.png,Um. Ann, are you staring because you like Nagisa, or because her bra looks like sweets?
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;seven&stage;1:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;bodysuit:,marker:bodysuit=excited.png,Whoa, your body suit regenerates you? Mine only stops me from feeling pain...But regeneration sounds great!
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;ruby&stage;3:,count-role;other&character;blake:=confident.png,With all three of here, we're almost a ladybug sandwich! With me right in the middle!
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;lyn&stage;5:,count-role;other&character;florina:=embarrassed.png,W-wouldn’t that get really drafty, Florina? And if you move, everyone would see… Well, everything.
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;4:,count-role;self&saidmarker;bun_puns:=wink.png,You seem a bit embarrassed, but keep your composure I'm sure you know how to <i>rise</i> to the challenge!
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;5:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=embarrassed.png,Z-zone might be lewd enough to go without underwear, but I don’t think you’re like that, Florina!
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;5:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=alarmed.png,I have a feeling that Zone-tan just assumes most women are naked under their clothes. I mean, wot nearing under...Not wearing underwear!
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;3:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_ladity:,count-role;other&character;uravity&saidmarker;saki_befriend_ladity:=excited.png,Saki, what about we go to an amusement park or something? It’s not <i>quite</i> like flying, but I bet you’d really enjoy something kind of thrilling, right?
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;seven&stage;1:,count-role;self&saidmarker;bodysuit:,count-role;other&character;d.va:=excited.png,Whoa, your bodysuit regenerates you? Mine only stops me from feeling pain...What does yours do, D.Va?
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;seven&stage;1:,count-role;self&saidmarker;bodysuit:,count-role;other&character;samus:=excited.png,Whoa, your bodysuit regenerates you? Mine only stops me from feeling pain...What does yours do, Samus?
5-female_removing_major,priority:385,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;4:=confident.png,Oh, that's a nice shirt, Shimakaze, do you mind if I try it on?
5-female_removing_major,priority:385,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,<i>Please</i> be safe. I think the fireworks are cool, but I'd be really sad if you got hurt, Shimakaze!
5-female_removing_major,priority:385,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;4:=confident.png,Oh! I see. It's like a ship. No wonder you have a nautical theme!
5-female_removing_major,count-princess&role;target:,count-role;other&character;florina&stage;0-5:=alarmed.png,B-bad girl...Florina, u-uhm. Can you say that again? For posteriors? I mean, posterity?
5-female_removing_major,count-yandere&role;target:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_stripping:=bored.png,Based on how you’ve acted towards everyone else, I kind of hope you do get Akumatized. Maybe it’d give you perspective once I fix you.
5-female_removing_major,count-yandere&role;target:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;ayano_stripping:=confused.png,E-er, don’t get down ~name~, it’s... Just a game.
5-female_removing_major,count-yandere:1-3,count-role;target&stage;3-5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=confident.png,~name~ is brave. Or she wouldn’t have stayed here.

5-female_removing_major,count-yandere:1-3,count-cheerful&role;target&stage;3-5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=wink.png,~name~  is always upbeat. And I will <i>never</i> let you take that away from her.
5-female_removing_major,count-yandere:1-3,count-confident&role;target&stage;3-5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=wink.png,~name~’s confidence isn’t going to be eroded by your lies, <i>you</i> big jerk!

5-female_removing_major,count-yandere:1-3,count-villain&role;target&stage;3-5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=wink.png,Just because ~name~ is misguided, doesn’t mean that she doesn’t have redeeming qualities. Maybe if you didn’t pick on her, she wouldn’t do what she does?
5-female_removed_major=wink.png,If you ever wanted to compare notes, or model some of my designs, I'm sure we'd have a great time.
5-female_removed_major=confused.png,Since, you’re not, you know... Uhm. Clothed in it. Anymore...
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;6:=bored.png,(<i>I really should be watching out for an akuma... but the tension between Natsuki and ~player~! It's so cute! I want... I must help them!</i>)

5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;5:=confident.png,(I think I have an idea!) Saki! How about I take you out for something fun after this?
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;red&stage;2:=bored.png,A religious memento, maybe? I’m so confused.
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Aimee! You could have really hurt someone!
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:=confused.png,I-I'm impressed you managed to get your clothes off that way. That's some sharp shooting.
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:=excited.png,Ah! Wait a minute! Did you just transform!? Are you using a Miraculous?
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;6:=confident.png,And it’s a cute pair!
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;5:=wink.png,Annie, I worry about you getting possessed by Hawk Moth. Smart people are always the toughest villains, so you should be proud of your body!
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;ann&stage;4:=bored.png,As someone who wears one routinely, I'd know.
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;launch&stage;6:=bored.png,At least she doesn't have her gun anymore...
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;6:=confused.png,At least you're... very charming... Elaine.
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;4&notsaidmarker;d.va_noobs:=wink.png,Aww...Okay Hana. If you want a hug, I’ll give you a hug.
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;marceline&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,Breavy heathing? No, me, of course not! I’m just trying to stop your akuma!
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;seven&stage;2:,marker:bodysuit=embarrassed.png,Does the suit come with… Other benefits, Seven?
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,E-er. Sorry. I'd really rather you not try to slap me.
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,U-um. Nevermind. Let's not get violent, GoGo.
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;4:,marker:gogo_max=bored.png,Just because Max is gay doesn't mean that-- <i>Va te faire cuire la cul.</i>.
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;4:,marker:gogo_dsl=alarmed.png,D-Did you really? Ugh. You're vile.
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,Er, I can maybe make some suggestions while you're visting? If you can afford that type of armor, I'm sure we can find you something cute!
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,Fortunately, my costume makes my clothes underneath seamless, so I never need underwear like that...
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;5:=alarmed.png,Doesn't that give you a huge wedgie all day?!
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;5:=confident.png,It's nice to have something you feel... Stylish in, but I never liked the way thongs looked.
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sanako&stage;2:,marker:groovy_sanako=wink.png,Groovy? <i>Groooovy</i>. Whoa! Sanako, wherever you're from, they have some really cool words!
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sanako&stage;2:,marker:prepared_sanako=embarrassed.png,Y-you really really prepared for this, huh, Sanako?
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;spooky&stage;2:=alarmed.png,Has Tikki been naked this whole time?! D-does my suit...Is it...Made of Tikki?
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;mei&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,I asked for language help because my mom speaks Cantonese…But, uhm, it seems your clothes can’t... on... these... er…
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale&stage;1:=confident.png,I do wonder if I had some more time to focus on fitness, if I could do even more as Ladybug than I already do!
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;6:=confident.png,I don’t really understand why people think I’m naked under my costume. It’s magic, after all.
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;meg&stage;6:=wink.png,I don’t suppose you can speak with a Scottish accent? You’re looking a little on point, Meg.
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5a:=confident.png,I don't think luck has a sense of humor, but this is pretty amusing.
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5a:=confident.png,Looking kind of... vampy, Vriska. I-I kind of... appreciate it?
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;3:=confident.png,I just can't get over how stylish you manage to make your really practical apparel. I clearly have a lot to learn!
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;3:=wink.png,Whoa, even without your qipao, the rest of your outfit just flows together so well. The fashion designer in me is gushing over this. (E-er, maybe that's a poor word choice.)
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;3:=confident.png,I love how you can make even traditional-styled clothing work for your combat techniques!
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;meg&stage;5:=confident.png,I know <i>I</i> don’t. You’re really the complete package!
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;3:=bored.png,I mean, nice legs aren’t a bad thing, but…
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;alice&stage;3:=excited.png,I really like it, but if you ever want to modernize your apparel... I’d love to help.
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;tracer&stage;4:=confident.png,I see Lena’a underpants!
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6b:=embarrassed.png,I think that's a bunny suit... But um... From this angle I can definitely see most of your butt.
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6b:=embarrassed.png,The whole butt-floss and stockings look is a lot better on you than <i>my</i> costume, Vriska.
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;juri&stage;1:=bored.png,I wish you weren't so <i>obviously</i> a villain. I'm sure we could get along great if you renounced your evil ways!
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,I-I don’t usually like to admit this, but I’m usually assuming the other girls are naked under their suits…
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;6:=embarrassed.png,I-I guess you don't usually have to worry about other ships... um... trying to go for your aft. I-I meant-- oh! Wait, no, aft works perfectly here!

5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;4:=wink.png,I've seen a lot of weird stuff in my time. That includes... illicit... fanart of me. I think you can manage this, Daria. Relatable strategy, though.
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,No regrets here, either! E-except maybe playing a little poorly. A-and there not really being an akuma here...

5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;daisy&stage;5:=excited.png,Oh! You wore a swimsuit under that. You’re really sporty, Daisy! You have to give me some workout tips!
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;4:,marker:class_rep=excited.png,Oh! You’re doing this to help someone into student government? I was class rep, so let me know if I can help!
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;5:=wink.png,Oh, I see. This was all part of your plan, huh? T-though...
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;4&saidmarker;d.va_noobs:=confused.png,Oh, so we’re not noobs anymore, are we, D.Va? Apologize, then maybe I’ll give you a hug, (But only so she’s not Akumatized.)
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;4:=wink.png,Oh. <i>Pffft</i>. Okay, that's a good joke.
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;5&saidmarker;null_possess:=alarmed.png,O-oh, sorry. It's just very normal. Not that it wouldn't be. It's not like I was expecting anything elaborate. In fact I'm glad it's so normal. E-erk...
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,Sei, w-what's a bodyshot, and why am I being prompted to do one off your breasts? I-I mean breastplate.

5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;4:=confused.png,Where have I heard your voice before? It’s driving me crazy!
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,Whew. What a relief that must be for you, Sayaka! Um. For us! Obviously.
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5b:=embarrassed.png,Who's Eridan? And that looks kind of like a sexy schoolgirl outfit... You certainly seem to enjoy being tasteless in your mockery of me...
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5b:=embarrassed.png,Oh so <i>now</i> you're in a schoolgirl outfit. Do you have <i>taste</i> at all? N-not like-- Um!
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;asuna&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,W-well, I guess you put a lot of faith in this Kirito guy. Maybe you should try keeping your own confidence, instead? I know about men who dress all in black.
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6a:=embarrassed.png,W-well, you certainly look kind of drenched.
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6a:=embarrassed.png,I sind of kort of--Kind of sort of--Er... Always have a bad time swimming.

5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;5:=alarmed.png,Yeah… Hawkmoth is really creepy when you think about it...
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5c:=confused.png,Yes, I'm sure we're all mortified for you being in your pyjamas. It's not like they look cute on you.
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5c:=confused.png,Oh yeah, let's just make fun of Marinette's costume, but Vriska just looks <i>sooo</i> cute in her oversized shirt and stockings.
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;videl&stage;4:=calm.png,You're okay with that, right Videl?
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,You're really hot though, so it's no surprise! I-I mean it's hot where you live. So you'd need to wear... to cool... Urh.
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;navi:=confident.png,You're some kind of spirit guide, aren't you? You help a hero, right?

5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;3:,count-role;self&saidmarker;bodysuit:=embarrassed.png,Er, It’s nice to be ahead? You meant it’s sice to knee myself--Nice to see myself winning, right?!
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;3:,count-role;self&saidmarker;bodysuit:=alarmed.png,Oh, oui. It’s quite the view--From an aesthetic view! Not necessarily a view of you in particular--Erk.
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;4:,count-role;other&character;alice:,marker:bodysuit=excited.png,Hmm...Alice, If D.Va does use a bunny miraculous, is she the White Rabbit you’ve been chasing?
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;5:,count-role;other&character;corrin_f&saidmarker;hotsprings:=excited.png,Hmm… Maybe hot springs are more than I thought they’d be, since you and Corrin both seem fixated on them. I should give it a try, I think!
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_mariba:=wink.png,I definetly want to hear what kinds of boys or girls you like too, Saki! What are friends for if not lots of harebrained schemes to find your soulmate?
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_mariba:=wink.png,We're definitely going to have to talk about boys--or girls--too, Saki!
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;6:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=wink.png,I guess we proved her wrong, didn’t we, Florina?
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;6:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=confident.png,I-I mean everyone is naked at some level. But, underwear is just another fashion choice. And a comfy one!
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;bun_puns:=embarrassed.png,I know it's a bun... a pun... erk... But you definitely inspire me!
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;5:,count-role;other&character;palutena:=excited.png,I see we have a few ladies here tonight interested in asymmetrical fashion. By which I mean Nagisa and Palutena!
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;4:,count-role;other&character;lyn:=alarmed.png,I-I just mean you're both swordswomen, b-but Lyn's apparel is less armor and more style.
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;4:,count-role;self&saidmarker;marinette_shirted:=confident.png,I-I mean I’ve never taken a shirt off in front of a stranger. Or my costume! Be brave Nagisa!
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;meg&stage;6:,count-role;other&character;morrigan:=wink.png,Meg... Hm. Did something get switched up here? Morrigan has the accent but you have the red hair, the plaid underwear… Or is she some sort of altar ego?
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;kim&stage;4:,count-role;other&character;nugi-chan:=confused.png,Oh, do you have children, Nugi-chan?
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;3:,count-role;self&saidmarker;bodysuit:=confused.png,She must be really tired for you to lose your suit like that.
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;lyn&stage;6:,count-role;other&character;florina:=excited.png,Thank goodness. I knew you were really classy, Lyn!
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6b:,count-role;other&character;d.va:=alarmed.png,Uh, D.Va, this is way different than <i>your</i> conception of a bunny suit. I hope, anyway.
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;tina:=embarrassed.png,Uhm. Tina, is what Aimee's doing just something you do for fun in Texas?
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;5:,count-role;other&character;meia:=embarrassed.png,U-um. Dealer, do we have to separate these two?
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_ladity:=wink.png,We're definitely going to have to talk about boys--or girls--too, Saki!

5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;ruby&stage;4:,count-role;other&character;blake:=embarrassed.png,W-wait, I didn't mean... Or maybe I did? Maybe w-we should try it?
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;2:,count-role;self&saidmarker;blake_crush:,marker:marinette_overload=alarmed.png,W-what? I-I work with someone who looks a lot like Blake. She’s way cuter though, but, um. I-I-I-
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;seven&stage;2:,count-role;self&saidmarker;bodysuit:,count-role;other&character;samus&stage;3-7:=confused.png,Hmm… Samus, is it just particularly damage resistant?
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;seven&stage;2:,count-role;self&saidmarker;bodysuit:,count-role;other&character;d.va&stage;4-8:=confident.png,I bet D.Va’s helps with her reflexes.

This’ll probably be a funny story about how we became friends later, right?
5-female_removed_major,priority:385,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;5:=confused.png,Huh? I'm stronger than I look, but um... if you say so, Shimakaze!
5-female_removed_major,priority:385,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;5:=alarmed.png,I don't think I've ever seen a... well, a <i>bra</i> like that... but what are you going to call it, Shimakaze?
5-female_removed_major,count-androgynous&role;target:=confident.png,You know, I don't know a lot of people that dress like you, ~name~. But I think you pull off a very handsome and masculine look. Very striking!
5-female_removed_major,count-athletic&role;target:=embarrassed.png,Wow! ~name~ you certainly see a lot of action... I mean, of the physical variety. Oh dear…
5-female_removed_major,count-chubby&role;target:=wink.png,I know lots of people like someone who's a great snuggler. You might have a little extra weight, but it's just more of you to love, ~name~!
5-female_removed_major,count-journalist&role;target:=calm.png,Do you run a blog, ~name~? It’s a bit more modern than a newspaper... Though I hope this kind of thing isn’t on it!

6-male_removing_major,count-yandere:1-3,count-yandere&role;target:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=alarmed.png,T-there's no akuma here, is there, just ~name~ and her whole yandere stuff!
6-male_removed_major=embarrassed.png,I mean. I’m always dressed for fun. Sometimes undressed. Wait I mean I like dressing up! Not undressing.
6-male_removed_major,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,And… Oh. I thought you were handsome before. I-I mean um! W-wow. You really work... Hard for that, don’t you?
6-male_removed_major,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;7:=embarrassed.png,But I keep getting glimpses behind the shield. Oh my.
6-male_removed_major,count-role;other&character;florina:=embarrassed.png,Florina! It’s okay! It’s just ~name~’s ~clothing~. Though… It is quite… Alluring…
6-male_removed_major,count-role;other&character;florina:=confident.png,Florina, don’t worry, staring is part of it! Um. Yeah!
6-male_removed_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_m&stage;5:=confused.png,Not to be judgy… But aren’t those women’s panties? Are you running low on laundry, Mr. Corrin?
6-male_removed_major,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;6:=alarmed.png,Okay, seriously. I'm much better with my hands than with my mouth-- W-wait, n-n-not like-- erk!
6-male_removed_major,count-androgynous&role;target:=wink.png,You have such soft edges, ~name~. I like that you can explore beyond your masculinity.
6-male_removed_major,count-chubby&role;target:=wink.png,I know lots of people like someone who's a great snuggler. You might have a little extra weight, but it's just more of you to love, ~name~!

6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;4:=confused.png,(I'm not sure what else to say to her!)
6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,A ladybug can't change her spots, but maybe you can, <i>Vriska.</i>
6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4:=wink.png,I hope whatever you picked next is a bit more unique to <i>you</i> instead of trying to mock <i>me</i>.
6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;aimee:=alarmed.png,Ahh!!! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale&stage;0:=wink.png,But nothing like you.
6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;4:=alarmed.png,Curter. I mean. More Curt.
6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;4&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=confused.png,E-er-- wait! No, it usually possesses an object! Not a person directly!
6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;5:=alarmed.png,E-er... I... <i>Non, je ne t'aime pas coups de feau a l'arriere....</i>
6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;arwen&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,E-even though you're losing your dress, I want you to stay proud, because I know what it's like to have two very different parents, and to meet so many... interesting people.
6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;3:=confident.png,Er... do you have something to tell us, Joey? It's okay, you're among friends. Mostly! I think!
6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;asuna&stage;4:=confused.png,Er... Had. It's weird you haven't found a kwami for yourself...
6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;3:,marker:marinette_shirted=embarrassed.png,Erk. I’ve never shirted a stranger either.
6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;spooky&stage;1:=confused.png,Ghosts don’t usually wear a lot of clothes… W-wait, that’s not just… part…
6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,guess my Japanese is worse than I thought… Hmm… I thought I’d get along really well with her…
6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;5:=confused.png,H-hey! That's not nice, Elaine! I was really worried I wasn't going to have my yo-yo ready!
6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;3:=confident.png,Hm. You know, you are really far ahead... Is it rude to admit I'm a bit curious about... Your other styles?
6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;meg&stage;5:=confident.png,Hmm, a matching set, I hope? It's not polka dots, but I like patterns a lot!
6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;4:=bored.png,Hmm... Corrin, I get the feeling you just kind of throw on whatever you have...
6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;4:=alarmed.png,Hmm... Do you really need to raise the stakes? We've... Kind of already seen your underwear, Elaine! Though it's pery vritty! V-very pretty!
6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;3:=excited.png,I believe in you. Don't give up!
6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;3:=confident.png,Even if you take off your dress, the person under it is what really matters! I-I mean...
6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;juri&stage;0:=confused.png,I can respect someone who really gives it their all at the outset...
6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;4:=bored.png,I like fashion a lot, but uhm. I think I move too much for skirts to be part of my warddrobe.
6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5:=bored.png,I still haven't forgiven you, you know. You've been really rude all game.
6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5:=bored.png,Maybe this next set'll be a bit humbling for you.
6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;5:=confident.png,I think capes are <i>very</i> heroic. That's probably why you saved that, right?
6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;kimberly&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,I-I guess that's true, Kimberly, but underwear is a lot nicer than most swimsuits, right?
6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;4&saidmarker;null_possess:=embarrassed.png,I-I'll admit, I'm kind of interested to see what sort of underwear you have where you're from. You know. For fashion's sake.
6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,I-I'll admit, most of my pairs are lacy or athletic. I haven't seen fruity panties in... well, I mean, since last round, but, er, you know, Natsuki...?
6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;red&stage;1:=confused.png,Is that huge sword just like… A centerpiece of some sort?
6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;4:=calm.png,It can get... breezy in Paris. I'd really rather not show my underwear if I don't want to.
6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;marceline&stage;4:=confident.png,It’s black! I think I’ve figured out how your powers work! You drain people’s color to black, then… Um… I don’t know.
6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;1:=confused.png,Just because it seems like you have an affinity for plants...
6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;1:=bored.png,You just have a certain bearing about you. And, you know, lots of plants.
6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;ann&stage;3:=confident.png,Like... I think you'd look great in a red jumpsuit!
6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;launch&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,Not this Launch again!
6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;4:=confident.png,Oh! I see. It's like a ship. No wonder you have a nautical theme!
6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,<i>Please</i> be safe. I think the fireworks are cool, but I'd be really sad if you got hurt, Shimakaze!
6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;4:=alarmed.png,Oh! I tend not to match my underwear either unless… Uhm. I’m planning on losing it.
6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;4:=confident.png,W-well, I’m glad you’re still in the game, Nagisa!
6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;meg&stage;4:=confident.png,Oh! You have such nice legs, Meg!  I don’t think anyone minds you showing those off.
6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;4:=calm.png,Oh... I have a few shirts like that! I like to knot them above my navel, though!
6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,O-of course you’d wear underwear under your clothes!
6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Or as flexible, because I usually take my time in the mornings. To, um, get to classes and such.
6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;4:=alarmed.png,Please have panties, please have panties... (<i>Or... um... or don't...</i>)
6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,R-really? There's pictures like that on the internet? <i>No way</i>.
6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,This’ll at least be a funny story later!
6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;4:=alarmed.png,Those are… Impressive!
6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;april&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,Um… It’s a very haute chic look, April! But yes, we can… See what you’re wearing underneath.
6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;ruby&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,U-uhm. Yes. Yes we did just see that, Ruby. Good thing you don’t seem to like sheer panties…
6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;2:=confused.png,Wait, you’re taking your skirt off first?
6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;1:=alarmed.png,Well, I’ve shown you mine, so I hope you don’t mind showing me yours? Y-your secret identity, that is! Definitely not anything else. Um...
6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;navi:=wink.png,Well, this confirms some suspicions...
6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;buffy&stage;4:=confused.png,Whoa! Buffy, that's a neat trick.
6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;kimberly&stage;4:=confused.png,W-well, based on your bra... I'm not sure if this is going to be <i>really</i> sexy or what, Kimberly!
6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;3:=confused.png,W-well, I guess we're in an elite group now, if that's true...
6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;videl&stage;3:=wink.png,You can't rely on a superhero to come save you.
6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;3:=confused.png,You know, about taking it all off?
6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;4:=excited.png,You know, I usually go clothes shopping with Alya, but if you wanted to get something new, it might fun.
6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;4:=wink.png,You’re mean <i>and</i> slutty. It’s a shame San Fransokyo U wasted a spot on you. Even Max didn’t get in!
6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;4:=confident.png,Oh, you want to try and <i>slap</i> me? Bring it on!
6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;2:=excited.png,Your qipao, Chun-li? It's so pretty!
6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;2:=excited.png,Oh, I like the traditional style of your qipao, Chun-li! It's really impressive that you've worked that into your fighting style!
6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;alice&stage;2:=confident.png,Your taste is very vintage, and very eclectic.
6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;sanako:=wink.png,You're very wise for 18, Sanako! And so sweet!
6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;4:,count-role;other&character;rinkah:=wink.png,...And Blackrose is so fiery...I just thought...

6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;juri:=confident.png,Hey! Chun-li's dress is really cool! You're being <i>such</i> a jerk to her, and she's not even beating you up or arresting you like she could, Juri!
6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;3:,count-role;self&saidmarker;bodysuit:=embarrassed.png,Hm… We have a lot of bodysuits here today… And interesting figures underneath them! U-um.
6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;2:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;bodysuit:,marker:bodysuit=calm.png,Is this Metroid I hear so much about the name of your Kwami?
6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;2:,count-role;self&saidmarker;bodysuit:=wink.png,It does seem like a hassle to take off your suit...I’m glad my transformation is so easy!
6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;2:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;bodysuit:,marker:bodysuit=wink.png,It does seem like a hassle to take off your suit...I’m glad my transformation is so easy!
6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;5:,count-role;other&character;raven&stage;4-7:=embarrassed.png,The only person I can think of that doesn’t wear underwear under her clothes is Raven…
6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;3:,count-role;other&character;ann:=confused.png,Um. Ann, are you staring because you like Nagisa, or because her bra looks like sweets?
6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;ruby&stage;3:,count-role;other&character;blake:=confident.png,With all three of here, we're almost a ladybug sandwich! With me right in the middle!
6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;lyn&stage;5:,count-role;other&character;florina:=embarrassed.png,W-wouldn’t that get really drafty, Florina? And if you move, everyone would see… Well, everything.
6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;4:,count-role;self&saidmarker;bun_puns:=wink.png,You seem a bit embarrassed, but keep your composure I'm sure you know how to <i>rise</i> to the challenge!
6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;5:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=embarrassed.png,Z-zone might be lewd enough to go without underwear, but I don’t think you’re like that, Florina!
6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;5:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=alarmed.png,I have a feeling that Zone-tan just assumes most women are naked under their clothes. I mean, wot nearing under...Not wearing underwear!
6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;3:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_ladity:,count-role;other&character;uravity&saidmarker;saki_befriend_ladity:=excited.png,Saki, what about we go to an amusement park or something? It’s not <i>quite</i> like flying, but I bet you’d really enjoy something kind of thrilling, right?
6-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;seven&stage;1:,count-role;self&saidmarker;bodysuit:,count-role;other&character;d.va:=excited.png,Whoa, your bodysuit regenerates you? Mine only stops me from feeling pain...What does yours do, D.Va?

6-female_removing_major,count-yandere&role;target:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_stripping:=bored.png,Based on how you’ve acted towards everyone else, I kind of hope you do get Akumatized. Maybe it’d give you perspective once I fix you.
6-female_removing_major,count-yandere&role;target:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;ayano_stripping:=confused.png,E-er, don’t get down ~name~, it’s... Just a game.
6-female_removing_major,count-yandere:1-3,count-role;target&stage;3-5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=confident.png,~name~ is brave. Or she wouldn’t have stayed here.

6-female_removing_major,count-yandere:1-3,count-cheerful&role;target&stage;3-5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=wink.png,~name~  is always upbeat. And I will <i>never</i> let you take that away from her.

6-female_removing_major,count-yandere:1-3,count-mean&role;target&stage;3-5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=confused.png,You know, <i>she</i> does have a point, ~name~...

6-female_removed_major=wink.png,If you ever wanted to compare notes, or model some of my designs, I'm sure we'd have a great time.
6-female_removed_major=confident.png,That has to be super comfortable <i>and</i> stylish. What a good fit for your skin and muscle tone!
6-female_removed_major=embarrassed.png,I mean. I’m always dressed for fun. Sometimes undressed. Wait I mean I like dressing up! Not undressing.
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;6:=bored.png,(<i>I really should be watching out for an akuma... but the tension between Natsuki and ~player~! It's so cute! I want... I must help them!</i>)

6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;5:=confident.png,(I think I have an idea!) Saki! How about I take you out for something fun after this?
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;red&stage;2:=bored.png,A religious memento, maybe? I’m so confused.
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;seven&stage;2:,marker:bodysuit=wink.png,After sex, I bet that helps you get ready to go again, oui? Comment femme fatale de toi!
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Aimee! You could have really hurt someone!
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:=confused.png,I-I'm impressed you managed to get your clothes off that way. That's some sharp shooting.
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:=excited.png,Ah! Wait a minute! Did you just transform!? Are you using a Miraculous?
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;5:=wink.png,Annie, I worry about you getting possessed by Hawk Moth. Smart people are always the toughest villains, so you should be proud of your body!
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;ann&stage;4:=bored.png,As someone who wears one routinely, I'd know.
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;launch&stage;6:=bored.png,At least she doesn't have her gun anymore...
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;6:=confused.png,At least you're... very charming... Elaine.
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;4&notsaidmarker;d.va_noobs:=wink.png,Aww...Okay Hana. If you want a hug, I’ll give you a hug.
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;marceline&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,Breavy heathing? No, me, of course not! I’m just trying to stop your akuma!
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;dawn&stage;5:=excited.png,Dawn, wow, I wasn't expecting our bras to match too...
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,E-er. Sorry. I'd really rather you not try to slap me.
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,U-um. Nevermind. Let's not get violent, GoGo.
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;4:,marker:gogo_max=bored.png,Just because Max is gay doesn't mean that-- <i>Va te faire cuire la cul.</i>.
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;4:,marker:gogo_dsl=alarmed.png,D-Did you really? Ugh. You're vile.
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,Er, I can maybe make some suggestions while you're visting? If you can afford that type of armor, I'm sure we can find you something cute!
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,Fortunately, my costume makes my clothes underneath seamless, so I never need underwear like that...
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;5:=alarmed.png,Doesn't that give you a huge wedgie all day?!
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;5:=confident.png,It's nice to have something you feel... Stylish in, but I never liked the way thongs looked.
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sanako&stage;2:,marker:groovy_sanako=wink.png,Groovy? <i>Groooovy</i>. Whoa! Sanako, wherever you're from, they have some really cool words!
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sanako&stage;2:,marker:prepared_sanako=embarrassed.png,Y-you really really prepared for this, huh, Sanako?
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;spooky&stage;2:=alarmed.png,Has Tikki been naked this whole time?! D-does my suit...Is it...Made of Tikki?
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;mei&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,I asked for language help because my mom speaks Cantonese…But, uhm, it seems your clothes can’t... on... these... er…
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale&stage;1:=confident.png,I do wonder if I had some more time to focus on fitness, if I could do even more as Ladybug than I already do!
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;6:=confident.png,I don’t really understand why people think I’m naked under my costume. It’s magic, after all.
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;meg&stage;6:=wink.png,I don’t suppose you can speak with a Scottish accent? You’re looking a little on point, Meg.
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;5:=alarmed.png,I don't think I've ever seen a... well, a <i>bra</i> like that... but what are you going to call it, Shimakaze?
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5a:=confident.png,I don't think luck has a sense of humor, but this is pretty amusing.
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5a:=confident.png,Looking kind of... vampy, Vriska. I-I kind of... appreciate it?
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;3:=confident.png,I just can't get over how stylish you manage to make your really practical apparel. I clearly have a lot to learn!
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;3:=wink.png,Whoa, even without your qipao, the rest of your outfit just flows together so well. The fashion designer in me is gushing over this. (E-er, maybe that's a poor word choice.)
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;3:=confident.png,I love how you can make even traditional-styled clothing work for your combat techniques!
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;meg&stage;5:=confident.png,I know <i>I</i> don’t. You’re really the complete package!
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;3:=bored.png,I mean, nice legs aren’t a bad thing, but…
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;zoey&stage;4:=wink.png,I never did anything like that, either, Zoey. But maybe now’s a good time to start? This is pretty good company...
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;alice&stage;3:=excited.png,I really like it, but if you ever want to modernize your apparel... I’d love to help.
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;tracer&stage;4:=confident.png,I see Lena’a underpants!
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6b:=embarrassed.png,I think that's a bunny suit... But um... From this angle I can definitely see most of your butt.
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6b:=embarrassed.png,The whole butt-floss and stockings look is a lot better on you than <i>my</i> costume, Vriska.
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;juri&stage;1:=bored.png,I wish you weren't so <i>obviously</i> a villain. I'm sure we could get along great if you renounced your evil ways!
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,I-I don’t usually like to admit this, but I’m usually assuming the other girls are naked under their suits…
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;6:=embarrassed.png,I-I guess you don't usually have to worry about other ships... um... trying to go for your aft. I-I meant-- oh! Wait, no, aft works perfectly here!
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;buffy&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,I-I might have to use that at some point!
6-female_removed_major,count-role;other&character;kim&stage;8:=embarrassed.png,I-I wasn’t looking at you, Kim! I was looking at ~name~. B-because it’s her turn!
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;5&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=alarmed.png,I-it usually doesn't <i>destroy</i> clothes either... Nayru? Hey, Nayru!
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;5:=alarmed.png,I'll have to try that look though! It's super cu--uuuul. <i>Cool</i>! Not butts! Um! Very stylish!
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;4:=wink.png,I've seen a lot of weird stuff in my time. That includes... illicit... fanart of me. I think you can manage this, Daria. Relatable strategy, though.
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,No regrets here, either! E-except maybe playing a little poorly. A-and there not really being an akuma here...
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;kimberly&stage;5:=confident.png,Oh! I see! He must be the Green Ranger, if you're the Pink one! How thoughtful of you!
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;5:=wink.png,Oh! It's like the towel trick. Clever, Daria. It almost makes me wish I'd worn a skirt...
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;daisy&stage;5:=excited.png,Oh! You wore a swimsuit under that. You’re really sporty, Daisy! You have to give me some workout tips!
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;4:,marker:class_rep=excited.png,Oh! You’re doing this to help someone into student government? I was class rep, so let me know if I can help!
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;5:=wink.png,Oh, I see. This was all part of your plan, huh? T-though...
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;4&saidmarker;d.va_noobs:=confused.png,Oh, so we’re not noobs anymore, are we, D.Va? Apologize, then maybe I’ll give you a hug, (But only so she’s not Akumatized.)
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;4:=wink.png,Oh. <i>Pffft</i>. Okay, that's a good joke.
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;5&saidmarker;null_possess:=alarmed.png,O-oh, sorry. It's just very normal. Not that it wouldn't be. It's not like I was expecting anything elaborate. In fact I'm glad it's so normal. E-erk...
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,Sei, w-what's a bodyshot, and why am I being prompted to do one off your breasts? I-I mean breastplate.
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;arwen&stage;4:=calm.png,S-so thanks, Arwen! I'll definitely remember... this... Uhm. Bonding we did.
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;6:=confused.png,That sounds like it would chafe, horribly, riding without clothes?
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;kimberly&stage;4:=alarmed.png,T-totally hot. Y-yeah. You dure sh-shoe. S-sure do, Kimberly!
6-female_removed_major,count-role;other&character;zone-tan&stage;3:,marker:ztentacles=confused.png,U-uhm, Zone-tan, I think the female form can be quite pretty. And obviously, male… Anatomy… Especially… But tentacles are gross! Only the wives of fishermen think about that!
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;2:,marker:face_it_tiger=excited.png,Wait a second! I <i>know</i> you! You’re Gwendolyne Stacy, from the <i>Mary Janes</i>! Ohmygoshwhat? I <i>love</i> <i>Face It Tiger</i>!
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sanako&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,We match! Um. Well, it's reversed. But they're both polka dots! I like polka dots too, I suppose!
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;4:=confused.png,Where have I heard your voice before? It’s driving me crazy!
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,Whew. What a relief that must be for you, Sayaka! Um. For us! Obviously.
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5b:=embarrassed.png,Who's Eridan? And that looks kind of like a sexy schoolgirl outfit... You certainly seem to enjoy being tasteless in your mockery of me...
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5b:=embarrassed.png,Oh so <i>now</i> you're in a schoolgirl outfit. Do you have <i>taste</i> at all? N-not like-- Um!
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;asuna&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,W-well, I guess you put a lot of faith in this Kirito guy. Maybe you should try keeping your own confidence, instead? I know about men who dress all in black.
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6a:=embarrassed.png,W-well, you certainly look kind of drenched.
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6a:=embarrassed.png,I sind of kort of--Kind of sort of--Er... Always have a bad time swimming.
6-female_removed_major,count-role;other&character;morrigan&stage;4:=excited.png,W-what? How are you just?
6-female_removed_major,count-role;other&character;morrigan&stage;4:=confident.png,Is your akuma power control over bats? It's... A clever use to protect your modesty, Morrigan!
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;4:=wink.png,W-wow. Y-your cingerie is lute! L-lingerie is c-cute! V-very... Um...
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,O-oh! W-wow. Ningerie lever... lingerie n-never really... um. Maybe I should try something like that?
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;5:=alarmed.png,Yeah… Hawkmoth is really creepy when you think about it...
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5c:=confused.png,Yes, I'm sure we're all mortified for you being in your pyjamas. It's not like they look cute on you.
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5c:=confused.png,Oh yeah, let's just make fun of Marinette's costume, but Vriska just looks <i>sooo</i> cute in her oversized shirt and stockings.
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,Yes, that's. I. Uhm. Really rude. Sorry Elena.
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;videl&stage;4:=calm.png,You're okay with that, right Videl?
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,You're really hot though, so it's no surprise! I-I mean it's hot where you live. So you'd need to wear... to cool... Urh.
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;navi:=confident.png,You're some kind of spirit guide, aren't you? You help a hero, right?
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_furavity:=excited.png,After you, Ochako, and Futaba have had your fun, it would be nice for us to hang out too! Let me surprise you!
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;3:,count-role;self&saidmarker;bodysuit:=excited.png,And yes! It’s a nice view. What kind of fabric is your outfit made of?
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;4:,count-role;other&character;alice:,marker:bodysuit=excited.png,Hmm...Alice, If D.Va does use a bunny miraculous, is she the White Rabbit you’ve been chasing?
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;5:,count-role;other&character;corrin_f&saidmarker;hotsprings:=excited.png,Hmm… Maybe hot springs are more than I thought they’d be, since you and Corrin both seem fixated on them. I should give it a try, I think!
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_mariba:=wink.png,I definetly want to hear what kinds of boys or girls you like too, Saki! What are friends for if not lots of harebrained schemes to find your soulmate?
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_mariba:=wink.png,We're definitely going to have to talk about boys--or girls--too, Saki!
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;6:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=wink.png,I guess we proved her wrong, didn’t we, Florina?
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;6:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=confident.png,I-I mean everyone is naked at some level. But, underwear is just another fashion choice. And a comfy one!
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;bun_puns:=embarrassed.png,I know it's a bun... a pun... erk... But you definitely inspire me!
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;5:,count-role;other&character;palutena:=excited.png,I see we have a few ladies here tonight interested in asymmetrical fashion. By which I mean Nagisa and Palutena!
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;4:,count-role;other&character;lyn:=alarmed.png,I-I just mean you're both swordswomen, b-but Lyn's apparel is less armor and more style.
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;4:,count-role;self&saidmarker;marinette_shirted:=confident.png,I-I mean I’ve never taken a shirt off in front of a stranger. Or my costume! Be brave Nagisa!
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;meg&stage;6:,count-role;other&character;morrigan:=wink.png,Meg... Hm. Did something get switched up here? Morrigan has the accent but you have the red hair, the plaid underwear… Or is she some sort of altar ego?
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;kim&stage;4:,count-role;other&character;nugi-chan:=confused.png,Oh, do you have children, Nugi-chan?
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;3:,count-role;self&saidmarker;bodysuit:=confused.png,She must be really tired for you to lose your suit like that.
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;lyn&stage;6:,count-role;other&character;florina:=excited.png,Thank goodness. I knew you were really classy, Lyn!
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6b:,count-role;other&character;d.va:=alarmed.png,Uh, D.Va, this is way different than <i>your</i> conception of a bunny suit. I hope, anyway.
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;tina:=embarrassed.png,Uhm. Tina, is what Aimee's doing just something you do for fun in Texas?
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;5:,count-role;other&character;meia:=embarrassed.png,U-um. Dealer, do we have to separate these two?
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_ladity:=wink.png,We're definitely going to have to talk about boys--or girls--too, Saki!
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_ladity:=wink.png,I definetly want to hear what kinds of boys or girls you like too, Saki! What are friends for if not lots of harebrained schemes to find your soulmate?
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;ruby&stage;4:,count-role;other&character;blake:=embarrassed.png,W-wait, I didn't mean... Or maybe I did? Maybe w-we should try it?
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;2:,count-role;self&saidmarker;blake_crush:,marker:marinette_overload=alarmed.png,W-what? I-I work with someone who looks a lot like Blake. She’s way cuter though, but, um. I-I-I-
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;seven&stage;2:,count-role;self&saidmarker;bodysuit:,count-role;other&character;samus&stage;3-7:=confused.png,Hmm… Samus, is it just particularly damage resistant?
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;seven&stage;2:,count-role;self&saidmarker;bodysuit:,count-role;other&character;d.va&stage;4-8:=confident.png,I bet D.Va’s helps with her reflexes.
6-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;4:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_ladity:,count-role;other&character;uravity&saidmarker;saki_befriend_ladity:=wink.png,Saki, I know not everyone can be a superhero, but I hope you know that we like you enough to hang out with you! This’ll probably be a funny story about how we became friends later, right?
6-female_removed_major,count-androgynous&role;target:=confident.png,You know, I don't know a lot of people that dress like you, ~name~. But I think you pull off a very handsome and masculine look. Very striking!
6-female_removed_major,count-athletic&role;target:=embarrassed.png,Wow! ~name~ you certainly see a lot of action... I mean, of the physical variety. Oh dear…
6-female_removed_major,count-chubby&role;target:=wink.png,I know lots of people like someone who's a great snuggler. You might have a little extra weight, but it's just more of you to love, ~name~!
6-female_removed_major,count-journalist&role;target:=calm.png,Do you run a blog, ~name~? It’s a bit more modern than a newspaper... Though I hope this kind of thing isn’t on it!
6-female_removed_major,priority:380,count-korean&role;target:=confused.png,You know, after this, you could take me out for bulgogi or dolsot, and maybe we could talk about... animation?
6-female_removed_major,count-muscular&role;target:=excited.png,Wow, ~name~! You must have a killer workout plan. I bet you could suplex trains!
6-female_removed_major,count-short&role;target:=wink.png,I like how economical you are, ~name~! You might be small in stature, but you're enormous in personality!
6-female_removed_major,count-tall&role;target:=excited.png,Wow! ~name~, I've been waiting to tell you all day you're just so... Tall! I bet you could be a model for all kinds of outfits!

7-male_removing_major,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;5:=excited.png,<i>Dans Anglais...</i> Ah, oui, I wouldn't mind...
7-male_removing_major,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;4:=excited.png,I knew I could count on Captain America! You're a really good guy, Steve!
7-male_removing_major,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;6:=calm.png,Not that I’m trying to um, snoop, Steve…
7-male_removing_major,count-yandere:1-3,count-yandere&role;target:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=bored.png,What are we to do with you, ~name~?
7-male_removing_major,count-yandere:1-3,count-yandere&role;target:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=bored.png,I hope you really get your act together...
7-male_removing_major,count-yandere:1-3,count-yandere&role;target:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=confident.png,I can't let you be a danger to others, ~name~! Er-- apparently, I can't just fight you... that's security's job...
7-male_removing_major,count-yandere:1-3,count-yandere&role;target:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=embarrassed.png,You should be ashamed of how you've been treating other people, ~name~.
7-male_removing_major,count-yandere:1-3,count-yandere&role;target:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=confident.png,This serves you right.
7-male_removing_major,count-yandere:1-3,count-yandere&role;target:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=alarmed.png,T-there's no akuma here, is there, just ~name~ and her whole yandere stuff!
7-male_removed_major=confused.png,T-taking off your clothes after a long day. Not that I want to lie against it.
7-male_removed_major,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;6:=wink.png,<i>Getting</i> lucky. Um. After this...
7-male_removed_major,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,And… Oh. I thought you were handsome before. I-I mean um! W-wow. You really work... Hard for that, don’t you?
7-male_removed_major,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;7:=embarrassed.png,But I keep getting glimpses behind the shield. Oh my.
7-male_removed_major,count-role;other&character;florina:=embarrassed.png,Florina! It’s okay! It’s just ~name~’s ~clothing~. Though… It is quite… Alluring…
7-male_removed_major,count-role;other&character;florina:=confident.png,Florina, don’t worry, staring is part of it! Um. Yeah!
7-male_removed_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_m&stage;5:=confused.png,Not to be judgy… But aren’t those women’s panties? Are you running low on laundry, Mr. Corrin?
7-male_removed_major,count-korean&role;target:=confused.png,You know, after this, you could take me out for bulgogi or dolsot, and maybe we could talk about... animation?
7-female_removing_major=bored.png,I’m surprised it’s taken you so long.
7-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;4:=confused.png,(What should I say? I don't want her to get Akumatized, but I'm also... Not really sure what else to do for her!)
7-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;4:=confused.png,(I'm not sure what else to say to her!)
7-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,A ladybug can't change her spots, but maybe you can, <i>Vriska.</i>
7-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4:=wink.png,I hope whatever you picked next is a bit more unique to <i>you</i> instead of trying to mock <i>me</i>.
7-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;aimee:=alarmed.png,Ahh!!! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
7-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale&stage;0:=wink.png,But nothing like you.
7-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;4:=alarmed.png,Curter. I mean. More Curt.
7-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;4&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=confused.png,E-er-- wait! No, it usually possesses an object! Not a person directly!
7-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;5:=alarmed.png,E-er... I... <i>Non, je ne t'aime pas coups de feau a l'arriere....</i>
7-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;arwen&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,E-even though you're losing your dress, I want you to stay proud, because I know what it's like to have two very different parents, and to meet so many... interesting people.
7-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;3:=confident.png,Er... do you have something to tell us, Joey? It's okay, you're among friends. Mostly! I think!
7-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;asuna&stage;4:=confused.png,Er... Had. It's weird you haven't found a kwami for yourself...
7-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;3:,marker:marinette_shirted=embarrassed.png,Erk. I’ve never shirted a stranger either.
7-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;spooky&stage;1:=confused.png,Ghosts don’t usually wear a lot of clothes… W-wait, that’s not just… part…
7-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,guess my Japanese is worse than I thought… Hmm… I thought I’d get along really well with her…
7-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;5:=confused.png,H-hey! That's not nice, Elaine! I was really worried I wasn't going to have my yo-yo ready!
7-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;3:=confident.png,Hm. You know, you are really far ahead... Is it rude to admit I'm a bit curious about... Your other styles?
7-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;meg&stage;5:=confident.png,Hmm, a matching set, I hope? It's not polka dots, but I like patterns a lot!
7-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;4:=bored.png,Hmm... Corrin, I get the feeling you just kind of throw on whatever you have...
7-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;4:=alarmed.png,Hmm... Do you really need to raise the stakes? We've... Kind of already seen your underwear, Elaine! Though it's pery vritty! V-very pretty!
7-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;3:=excited.png,I believe in you. Don't give up!
7-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;3:=confident.png,Even if you take off your dress, the person under it is what really matters! I-I mean...
7-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;juri&stage;0:=confused.png,I can respect someone who really gives it their all at the outset...
7-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;4:=bored.png,I like fashion a lot, but uhm. I think I move too much for skirts to be part of my warddrobe.
7-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5:=bored.png,I still haven't forgiven you, you know. You've been really rude all game.
7-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5:=bored.png,Maybe this next set'll be a bit humbling for you.
7-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;5:=confident.png,I think capes are <i>very</i> heroic. That's probably why you saved that, right?
7-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;kimberly&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,I-I guess that's true, Kimberly, but underwear is a lot nicer than most swimsuits, right?
7-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;4&saidmarker;null_possess:=embarrassed.png,I-I'll admit, I'm kind of interested to see what sort of underwear you have where you're from. You know. For fashion's sake.
7-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,I-I'll admit, most of my pairs are lacy or athletic. I haven't seen fruity panties in... well, I mean, since last round, but, er, you know, Natsuki...?
7-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;red&stage;1:=confused.png,Is that huge sword just like… A centerpiece of some sort?
7-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;4:=calm.png,It can get... breezy in Paris. I'd really rather not show my underwear if I don't want to.
7-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;1:=confused.png,Just because it seems like you have an affinity for plants...
7-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;1:=bored.png,You just have a certain bearing about you. And, you know, lots of plants.
7-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;ann&stage;3:=confident.png,Like... I think you'd look great in a red jumpsuit!
7-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;launch&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,Not this Launch again!
7-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;4:=confident.png,Oh! I see. It's like a ship. No wonder you have a nautical theme!
7-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,<i>Please</i> be safe. I think the fireworks are cool, but I'd be really sad if you got hurt, Shimakaze!
7-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;4:=alarmed.png,Oh! I tend not to match my underwear either unless… Uhm. I’m planning on losing it.
7-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;4:=confident.png,W-well, I’m glad you’re still in the game, Nagisa!
7-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;meg&stage;4:=confident.png,Oh! You have such nice legs, Meg!  I don’t think anyone minds you showing those off.
7-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;4:=calm.png,Oh... I have a few shirts like that! I like to knot them above my navel, though!
7-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,O-of course you’d wear underwear under your clothes!
7-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Or as flexible, because I usually take my time in the mornings. To, um, get to classes and such.
7-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;4:=alarmed.png,Please have panties, please have panties... (<i>Or... um... or don't...</i>)
7-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,R-really? There's pictures like that on the internet? <i>No way</i>.
7-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,This’ll at least be a funny story later!
7-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;4:=alarmed.png,Those are… Impressive!
7-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;april&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,Um… It’s a very haute chic look, April! But yes, we can… See what you’re wearing underneath.
7-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;ruby&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,U-uhm. Ruby, are you deliberately flashing me since I’m so far behind?
7-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;2:=confused.png,Wait, you’re taking your skirt off first?
7-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;1:=wink.png,Well, I’ve shown you mine, so I hope you don’t mind showing me yours? And I mean a <i>lot</i> more than just a secret identity, Gwen.
7-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;navi:=wink.png,Well, this confirms some suspicions...
7-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;buffy&stage;4:=confused.png,Whoa! Buffy, that's a neat trick.
7-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;kimberly&stage;4:=confused.png,W-well, based on your bra... I'm not sure if this is going to be <i>really</i> sexy or what, Kimberly!
7-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;3:=confused.png,W-well, I guess we're in an elite group now, if that's true...
7-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;videl&stage;3:=wink.png,You can't rely on a superhero to come save you.
7-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;3:=confused.png,You know, about taking it all off?
7-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;4:=excited.png,You know, I usually go clothes shopping with Alya, but if you wanted to get something new, it might fun.
7-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;4:=wink.png,You’re mean <i>and</i> slutty. It’s a shame San Fransokyo U wasted a spot on you. Even Max didn’t get in!
7-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;4:=confident.png,Oh, you want to try and <i>slap</i> me? Bring it on!
7-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;2:=excited.png,Your qipao, Chun-li? It's so pretty!
7-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;2:=excited.png,Oh, I like the traditional style of your qipao, Chun-li! It's really impressive that you've worked that into your fighting style!
7-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;alice&stage;2:=confident.png,Your taste is very vintage, and very eclectic.
7-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;sanako:=wink.png,You're very wise for 18, Sanako! And so sweet!

7-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;3:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;bodysuit:,marker:bodysuit=confident.png,D.Va, now that you’re out of your suit, can I call you Hana? I think it’s a way cooler name!
7-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;juri:=confident.png,Hey! Chun-li's dress is really cool! You're being <i>such</i> a jerk to her, and she's not even beating you up or arresting you like she could, Juri!
7-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;3:,count-role;self&saidmarker;bodysuit:=embarrassed.png,Hm… We have a lot of bodysuits here today… And interesting figures underneath them! U-um.
7-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;2:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;bodysuit:,marker:bodysuit=calm.png,Is this Metroid I hear so much about the name of your Kwami?
7-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;2:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;bodysuit:,marker:bodysuit=wink.png,It does seem like a hassle to take off your suit...I’m glad my transformation is so easy!
7-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;2:,count-role;self&saidmarker;bodysuit:=wink.png,It does seem like a hassle to take off your suit...I’m glad my transformation is so easy!
7-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;5:,count-role;other&character;raven&stage;4-7:=embarrassed.png,The only person I can think of that doesn’t wear underwear under her clothes is Raven…
7-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;3:,count-role;other&character;ann:=confused.png,Um. Ann, are you staring because you like Nagisa, or because her bra looks like sweets?
7-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;ruby&stage;3:,count-role;other&character;blake:=confident.png,With all three of here, we're almost a ladybug sandwich! With me right in the middle!
7-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;lyn&stage;5:,count-role;other&character;florina:=embarrassed.png,W-wouldn’t that get really drafty, Florina? And if you move, everyone would see… Well, everything.

7-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;5:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=embarrassed.png,Z-zone might be lewd enough to go without underwear, but I don’t think you’re like that, Florina!
7-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;5:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=alarmed.png,I have a feeling that Zone-tan just assumes most women are naked under their clothes. I mean, wot nearing under...Not wearing underwear!

7-female_removing_major,count-princess&role;target:,count-role;other&character;florina&stage;0-5:=alarmed.png,B-bad girl...Florina, u-uhm. Can you say that again? For posteriors? I mean, posterity?
7-female_removing_major,count-yandere&role;target:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_stripping:=bored.png,Based on how you’ve acted towards everyone else, I kind of hope you do get Akumatized. Maybe it’d give you perspective once I fix you.
7-female_removing_major,count-yandere&role;target:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;ayano_stripping:=confused.png,E-er, don’t get down ~name~, it’s... Just a game.

7-female_removed_major=embarrassed.png,You just really seem to be enjoying yourself…

7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;5:=confident.png,(I think I have an idea!) Saki! How about I take you out for something fun after this?
7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;red&stage;2:=bored.png,A religious memento, maybe? I’m so confused.
7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;seven&stage;2:,marker:bodysuit=wink.png,After sex, I bet that helps you get ready to go again, oui? Comment femme fatale de toi!
7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Aimee! You could have really hurt someone!
7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:=confused.png,I-I'm impressed you managed to get your clothes off that way. That's some sharp shooting.
7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:=excited.png,Ah! Wait a minute! Did you just transform!? Are you using a Miraculous?
7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;5:=wink.png,Annie, I worry about you getting possessed by Hawk Moth. Smart people are always the toughest villains, so you should be proud of your body!
7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;ann&stage;4:=bored.png,As someone who wears one routinely, I'd know.
7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;launch&stage;6:=bored.png,At least she doesn't have her gun anymore...
7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;6:=confused.png,At least you're... very charming... Elaine.
7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;4&notsaidmarker;d.va_noobs:=wink.png,Aww...Okay Hana. If you want a hug, I’ll give you a hug.
7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;dawn&stage;5:=excited.png,Dawn, wow, I wasn't expecting our bras to match too...
7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,E-er. Sorry. I'd really rather you not try to slap me.
7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,U-um. Nevermind. Let's not get violent, GoGo.
7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;4:,marker:gogo_max=bored.png,Just because Max is gay doesn't mean that-- <i>Va te faire cuire la cul.</i>.
7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;4:,marker:gogo_dsl=alarmed.png,D-Did you really? Ugh. You're vile.
7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,Er, I can maybe make some suggestions while you're visting? If you can afford that type of armor, I'm sure we can find you something cute!
7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,Fortunately, my costume makes my clothes underneath seamless, so I never need underwear like that...
7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;5:=alarmed.png,Doesn't that give you a huge wedgie all day?!
7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;5:=confident.png,It's nice to have something you feel... Stylish in, but I never liked the way thongs looked.
7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sanako&stage;2:,marker:groovy_sanako=wink.png,Groovy? <i>Groooovy</i>. Whoa! Sanako, wherever you're from, they have some really cool words!
7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sanako&stage;2:,marker:prepared_sanako=embarrassed.png,Y-you really really prepared for this, huh, Sanako?
7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;kimberly&stage;5:=wink.png,Hmm... you sure about that? Modesty is important, but so's honesty. I don't wear the sexy stuff if I'm planning on keeping it on <i>all</i> night.
7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;mei&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,I asked for language help because my mom speaks Cantonese…But, uhm, it seems your clothes can’t... on... these... er…
7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale&stage;1:=confident.png,I do wonder if I had some more time to focus on fitness, if I could do even more as Ladybug than I already do!
7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;6:=confident.png,I don’t really understand why people think I’m naked under my costume. It’s magic, after all.
7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;meg&stage;6:=wink.png,I don’t suppose you can speak with a Scottish accent? You’re looking a little on point, Meg.
7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;5:=alarmed.png,I don't think I've ever seen a... well, a <i>bra</i> like that... but what are you going to call it, Shimakaze?
7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5a:=confident.png,I don't think luck has a sense of humor, but this is pretty amusing.
7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5a:=confident.png,Looking kind of... vampy, Vriska. I-I kind of... appreciate it?
7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;3:=confident.png,I just can't get over how stylish you manage to make your really practical apparel. I clearly have a lot to learn!
7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;3:=wink.png,Whoa, even without your qipao, the rest of your outfit just flows together so well. The fashion designer in me is gushing over this. (E-er, maybe that's a poor word choice.)
7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;3:=confident.png,I love how you can make even traditional-styled clothing work for your combat techniques!
7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;meg&stage;5:=confident.png,I know <i>I</i> don’t. You’re really the complete package!
7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;3:=bored.png,I mean, nice legs aren’t a bad thing, but…
7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;zoey&stage;4:=wink.png,I never did anything like that, either, Zoey. But maybe now’s a good time to start? This is pretty good company...
7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;alice&stage;3:=excited.png,I really like it, but if you ever want to modernize your apparel... I’d love to help.
7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;tracer&stage;4:=confident.png,I see Lena’a underpants!
7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6b:=embarrassed.png,I think that's a bunny suit... But um... From this angle I can definitely see most of your butt.
7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6b:=embarrassed.png,The whole butt-floss and stockings look is a lot better on you than <i>my</i> costume, Vriska.
7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;juri&stage;1:=bored.png,I wish you weren't so <i>obviously</i> a villain. I'm sure we could get along great if you renounced your evil ways!
7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,I-I don’t usually like to admit this, but I’m usually assuming the other girls are naked under their suits…
7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;6:=embarrassed.png,I-I guess you don't usually have to worry about other ships... um... trying to go for your aft. I-I meant-- oh! Wait, no, aft works perfectly here!
7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;buffy&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,I-I might have to use that at some point!
7-female_removed_major,count-role;other&character;kim&stage;8:=embarrassed.png,I-I wasn’t looking at you, Kim! I was looking at ~name~. B-because it’s her turn!
7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;5&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=alarmed.png,I-it usually doesn't <i>destroy</i> clothes either... Nayru? Hey, Nayru!
7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;5:=alarmed.png,I'll have to try that look though! It's super cu--uuuul. <i>Cool</i>! Not butts! Um! Very stylish!
7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;4:=wink.png,I've seen a lot of weird stuff in my time. That includes... illicit... fanart of me. I think you can manage this, Daria. Relatable strategy, though.
7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,No regrets here, either! E-except maybe playing a little poorly. A-and there not really being an akuma here...
7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;5:=wink.png,Oh! It's like the towel trick. Clever, Daria. It almost makes me wish I'd worn a skirt...
7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;daisy&stage;5:=excited.png,Oh! You wore a swimsuit under that. You’re really sporty, Daisy! You have to give me some workout tips!
7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;4:,marker:class_rep=excited.png,Oh! You’re doing this to help someone into student government? I was class rep, so let me know if I can help!
7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;5:=wink.png,Oh, I see. This was all part of your plan, huh? T-though...
7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;4&saidmarker;d.va_noobs:=confused.png,Oh, so we’re not noobs anymore, are we, D.Va? Apologize, then maybe I’ll give you a hug, (But only so she’s not Akumatized.)
7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;4:=wink.png,Oh. <i>Pffft</i>. Okay, that's a good joke.
7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;5&saidmarker;null_possess:=alarmed.png,O-oh, sorry. It's just very normal. Not that it wouldn't be. It's not like I was expecting anything elaborate. In fact I'm glad it's so normal. E-erk...
7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,Sei, w-what's a bodyshot, and why am I being prompted to do one off your breasts? I-I mean breastplate.
7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;arwen&stage;4:=calm.png,S-so thanks, Arwen! I'll definitely remember... this... Uhm. Bonding we did.
7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;6:=confused.png,That sounds like it would chafe, horribly, riding without clothes?
7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;kimberly&stage;4:=alarmed.png,T-totally hot. Y-yeah. You dure sh-shoe. S-sure do, Kimberly!
7-female_removed_major,count-role;other&character;zone-tan&stage;3:,marker:ztentacles=confused.png,U-uhm, Zone-tan, I think the female form can be quite pretty. And obviously, male… Anatomy… Especially… But tentacles are gross! Only the wives of fishermen think about that!
7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;2:,marker:face_it_tiger=excited.png,Wait a second! I <i>know</i> you! You’re Gwendolyne Stacy, from the <i>Mary Janes</i>! Ohmygoshwhat? I <i>love</i> <i>Face It Tiger</i>!
7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sanako&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,We match! Um. Well, it's reversed. But they're both polka dots! I like polka dots too, I suppose!
7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;4:=confused.png,Where have I heard your voice before? It’s driving me crazy!
7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,Whew. What a relief that must be for you, Sayaka! Um. For us! Obviously.
7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5b:=embarrassed.png,Who's Eridan? And that looks kind of like a sexy schoolgirl outfit... You certainly seem to enjoy being tasteless in your mockery of me...
7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5b:=embarrassed.png,Oh so <i>now</i> you're in a schoolgirl outfit. Do you have <i>taste</i> at all? N-not like-- Um!
7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;asuna&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,W-well, I guess you put a lot of faith in this Kirito guy. Maybe you should try keeping your own confidence, instead? I know about men who dress all in black.
7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6a:=embarrassed.png,W-well, you certainly look kind of drenched.
7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6a:=embarrassed.png,I sind of kort of--Kind of sort of--Er... Always have a bad time swimming.
7-female_removed_major,count-role;other&character;morrigan&stage;4:=excited.png,W-what? How are you just?
7-female_removed_major,count-role;other&character;morrigan&stage;4:=confident.png,Is your akuma power control over bats? It's... A clever use to protect your modesty, Morrigan!

7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,O-oh! W-wow. Ningerie lever... lingerie n-never really... um. Maybe I should try something like that?
7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;5:=alarmed.png,Yeah… Hawkmoth is really creepy when you think about it...
7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5c:=confused.png,Yes, I'm sure we're all mortified for you being in your pyjamas. It's not like they look cute on you.
7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5c:=confused.png,Oh yeah, let's just make fun of Marinette's costume, but Vriska just looks <i>sooo</i> cute in her oversized shirt and stockings.
7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,Yes, that's. I. Uhm. Really rude. Sorry Elena.
7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;videl&stage;4:=calm.png,You're okay with that, right Videl?
7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,You're really hot though, so it's no surprise! I-I mean it's hot where you live. So you'd need to wear... to cool... Urh.
7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;navi:=confident.png,You're some kind of spirit guide, aren't you? You help a hero, right?
7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_furavity:=excited.png,After you, Ochako, and Futaba have had your fun, it would be nice for us to hang out too! Let me surprise you!
7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;3:,count-role;self&saidmarker;bodysuit:=excited.png,And yes! It’s a nice view. What kind of fabric is your outfit made of?
7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;4:,count-role;other&character;alice:,marker:bodysuit=excited.png,Hmm...Alice, If D.Va does use a bunny miraculous, is she the White Rabbit you’ve been chasing?
7-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;5:,count-role;other&character;corrin_f&saidmarker;hotsprings:=excited.png,Hmm… Maybe hot springs are more than I thought they’d be, since you and Corrin both seem fixated on them. I should give it a try, I think!

-3-female_removing_major,count-yandere:1-3,count-single&role;target&stage;3-5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=wink.png,~name~ has her pick of the boys--or girls--and it’s because of her shining personality. If ~player~ wants her, she’d be a much better choice than an obsessive monster like you.
-3-female_removing_major,count-yandere:1-3,count-taken&role;target&stage;3-5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=wink.png,~name~ is already in a committed relationship, and she doesn’t need ~player~, but given how you’re acting, you definitely don’t need them either!

-3-female_removed_major=wink.png,If you ever wanted to compare notes, or model some of my designs, I'm sure we'd have a great time.
-3-female_removed_major=excited.png,If you want to take the rest off, I bet I can match your buns, I am a baker’s daughter...

-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Aimee! You could have really hurt someone!
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:=confused.png,I-I'm impressed you managed to get your clothes off that way. That's some sharp shooting.
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:=excited.png,Ah! Wait a minute! Did you just transform!? Are you using a Miraculous?
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;5:=wink.png,Annie, I worry about you getting possessed by Hawk Moth. Smart people are always the toughest villains, so you should be proud of your body!

-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;launch&stage;6:=bored.png,At least she doesn't have her gun anymore...
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;6:=confused.png,At least you're... very charming... Elaine.
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;4&notsaidmarker;d.va_noobs:=wink.png,Aww...Okay Hana. If you want a hug, I’ll give you a hug.
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,E-er. Sorry. I'd really rather you not try to slap me.
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,U-um. Nevermind. Let's not get violent, GoGo.
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;4:,marker:gogo_max=bored.png,Just because Max is gay doesn't mean that-- <i>Va te faire cuire la cul.</i>.
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;4:,marker:gogo_dsl=alarmed.png,D-Did you really? Ugh. You're vile.
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,Er, I can maybe make some suggestions while you're visting? If you can afford that type of armor, I'm sure we can find you something cute!
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,Fortunately, my costume makes my clothes underneath seamless, so I never need underwear like that...
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;5:=alarmed.png,Doesn't that give you a huge wedgie all day?!
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;5:=confident.png,It's nice to have something you feel... Stylish in, but I never liked the way thongs looked.
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sanako&stage;2:,marker:groovy_sanako=wink.png,Groovy? <i>Groooovy</i>. Whoa! Sanako, wherever you're from, they have some really cool words!
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sanako&stage;2:,marker:prepared_sanako=embarrassed.png,Y-you really really prepared for this, huh, Sanako?
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;kimberly&stage;5:=wink.png,Hmm... you sure about that? Modesty is important, but so's honesty. I don't wear the sexy stuff if I'm planning on keeping it on <i>all</i> night.
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;mei&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,I asked for language help because my mom speaks Cantonese…But, uhm, it seems your clothes can’t... on... these... er…
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale&stage;1:=confident.png,I do wonder if I had some more time to focus on fitness, if I could do even more as Ladybug than I already do!
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;6:=confident.png,I don’t really understand why people think I’m naked under my costume. It’s magic, after all.
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;meg&stage;6:=wink.png,I don’t suppose you can speak with a Scottish accent? You’re looking a little on point, Meg.
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;5:=alarmed.png,I don't think I've ever seen a... well, a <i>bra</i> like that... but what are you going to call it, Shimakaze?
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5a:=confident.png,I don't think luck has a sense of humor, but this is pretty amusing.
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5a:=confident.png,Looking kind of... vampy, Vriska. I-I kind of... appreciate it?
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;3:=confident.png,I just can't get over how stylish you manage to make your really practical apparel. I clearly have a lot to learn!
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;3:=wink.png,Whoa, even without your qipao, the rest of your outfit just flows together so well. The fashion designer in me is gushing over this. (E-er, maybe that's a poor word choice.)
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;3:=confident.png,I love how you can make even traditional-styled clothing work for your combat techniques!
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;meg&stage;5:=confident.png,I know <i>I</i> don’t. You’re really the complete package!
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;3:=bored.png,I mean, nice legs aren’t a bad thing, but…
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;zoey&stage;4:=wink.png,I never did anything like that, either, Zoey. But maybe now’s a good time to start? This is pretty good company...
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;alice&stage;3:=excited.png,I really like it, but if you ever want to modernize your apparel... I’d love to help.
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;tracer&stage;4:=confident.png,I see Lena’a underpants!
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6b:=embarrassed.png,I think that's a bunny suit... But um... From this angle I can definitely see most of your butt.
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6b:=embarrassed.png,The whole butt-floss and stockings look is a lot better on you than <i>my</i> costume, Vriska.
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;juri&stage;1:=bored.png,I wish you weren't so <i>obviously</i> a villain. I'm sure we could get along great if you renounced your evil ways!
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,I-I don’t usually like to admit this, but I’m usually assuming the other girls are naked under their suits…
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;6:=embarrassed.png,I-I guess you don't usually have to worry about other ships... um... trying to go for your aft. I-I meant-- oh! Wait, no, aft works perfectly here!
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;buffy&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,I-I might have to use that at some point!
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;other&character;kim&stage;8:=embarrassed.png,I-I wasn’t looking at you, Kim! I was looking at ~name~. B-because it’s her turn!
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;5&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=alarmed.png,I-it usually doesn't <i>destroy</i> clothes either... Nayru? Hey, Nayru!
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;5:=alarmed.png,I'll have to try that look though! It's super cu--uuuul. <i>Cool</i>! Not butts! Um! Very stylish!
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;4:=wink.png,I've seen a lot of weird stuff in my time. That includes... illicit... fanart of me. I think you can manage this, Daria. Relatable strategy, though.
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,No regrets here, either! E-except maybe playing a little poorly. A-and there not really being an akuma here...
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;5:=wink.png,Oh! It's like the towel trick. Clever, Daria. It almost makes me wish I'd worn a skirt...
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;daisy&stage;5:=excited.png,Oh! You wore a swimsuit under that. You’re really sporty, Daisy! You have to give me some workout tips!
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;4:,marker:class_rep=excited.png,Oh! You’re doing this to help someone into student government? I was class rep, so let me know if I can help!
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;5:=wink.png,Oh, I see. This was all part of your plan, huh? T-though...
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;4&saidmarker;d.va_noobs:=confused.png,Oh, so we’re not noobs anymore, are we, D.Va? Apologize, then maybe I’ll give you a hug, (But only so she’s not Akumatized.)
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;4:=wink.png,Oh. <i>Pffft</i>. Okay, that's a good joke.
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;5&saidmarker;null_possess:=alarmed.png,O-oh, sorry. It's just very normal. Not that it wouldn't be. It's not like I was expecting anything elaborate. In fact I'm glad it's so normal. E-erk...
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,Sei, w-what's a bodyshot, and why am I being prompted to do one off your breasts? I-I mean breastplate.
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;arwen&stage;4:=calm.png,S-so thanks, Arwen! I'll definitely remember... this... Uhm. Bonding we did.
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;6:=confused.png,That sounds like it would chafe, horribly, riding without clothes?
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;kimberly&stage;4:=alarmed.png,T-totally hot. Y-yeah. You dure sh-shoe. S-sure do, Kimberly!
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;other&character;zone-tan&stage;3:,marker:ztentacles=confused.png,U-uhm, Zone-tan, I think the female form can be quite pretty. And obviously, male… Anatomy… Especially… But tentacles are gross! Only the wives of fishermen think about that!

-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sanako&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,We match! Um. Well, it's reversed. But they're both polka dots! I like polka dots too, I suppose!
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;4:=confused.png,Where have I heard your voice before? It’s driving me crazy!
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,Whew. What a relief that must be for you, Sayaka! Um. For us! Obviously.
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5b:=embarrassed.png,Who's Eridan? And that looks kind of like a sexy schoolgirl outfit... You certainly seem to enjoy being tasteless in your mockery of me...
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5b:=embarrassed.png,Oh so <i>now</i> you're in a schoolgirl outfit. Do you have <i>taste</i> at all? N-not like-- Um!
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;asuna&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,W-well, I guess you put a lot of faith in this Kirito guy. Maybe you should try keeping your own confidence, instead? I know about men who dress all in black.
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6a:=embarrassed.png,W-well, you certainly look kind of drenched.
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6a:=embarrassed.png,I sind of kort of--Kind of sort of--Er... Always have a bad time swimming.
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;other&character;morrigan&stage;4:=excited.png,W-what? How are you just?
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;other&character;morrigan&stage;4:=confident.png,Is your akuma power control over bats? It's... A clever use to protect your modesty, Morrigan!

-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5c:=confused.png,Yes, I'm sure we're all mortified for you being in your pyjamas. It's not like they look cute on you.
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5c:=confused.png,Oh yeah, let's just make fun of Marinette's costume, but Vriska just looks <i>sooo</i> cute in her oversized shirt and stockings.
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,Yes, that's. I. Uhm. Really rude. Sorry Elena.
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,You're really hot though, so it's no surprise! I-I mean it's hot where you live. So you'd need to wear... to cool... Urh.

-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;3:,count-role;self&saidmarker;bodysuit:=excited.png,And yes! It’s a nice view. What kind of fabric is your outfit made of?
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;4:,count-role;other&character;alice:,marker:bodysuit=excited.png,Hmm...Alice, If D.Va does use a bunny miraculous, is she the White Rabbit you’ve been chasing?
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;5:,count-role;other&character;corrin_f&saidmarker;hotsprings:=excited.png,Hmm… Maybe hot springs are more than I thought they’d be, since you and Corrin both seem fixated on them. I should give it a try, I think!
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_mariba:=wink.png,I definetly want to hear what kinds of boys or girls you like too, Saki! What are friends for if not lots of harebrained schemes to find your soulmate?
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_mariba:=wink.png,We're definitely going to have to talk about boys--or girls--too, Saki!
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;6:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=wink.png,I guess we proved her wrong, didn’t we, Florina?
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;6:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=confident.png,I-I mean everyone is naked at some level. But, underwear is just another fashion choice. And a comfy one!
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;bun_puns:=embarrassed.png,I know it's a bun... a pun... erk... But you definitely inspire me!

-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;4:,count-role;other&character;lyn:=alarmed.png,I-I just mean you're both swordswomen, b-but Lyn's apparel is less armor and more style.
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;4:,count-role;self&saidmarker;marinette_shirted:=confident.png,I-I mean I’ve never taken a shirt off in front of a stranger. Or my costume! Be brave Nagisa!
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;meg&stage;6:,count-role;other&character;morrigan:=wink.png,Meg... Hm. Did something get switched up here? Morrigan has the accent but you have the red hair, the plaid underwear… Or is she some sort of altar ego?
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;kim&stage;4:,count-role;other&character;nugi-chan:=confused.png,Oh, do you have children, Nugi-chan?
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;3:,count-role;self&saidmarker;bodysuit:=confused.png,She must be really tired for you to lose your suit like that.
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;lyn&stage;6:,count-role;other&character;florina:=excited.png,Thank goodness. I knew you were really classy, Lyn!
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6b:,count-role;other&character;d.va:=alarmed.png,Uh, D.Va, this is way different than <i>your</i> conception of a bunny suit. I hope, anyway.
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;tina:=embarrassed.png,Uhm. Tina, is what Aimee's doing just something you do for fun in Texas?
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;5:,count-role;other&character;meia:=embarrassed.png,U-um. Dealer, do we have to separate these two?
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_ladity:=wink.png,We're definitely going to have to talk about boys--or girls--too, Saki!

-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;ruby&stage;4:,count-role;other&character;blake:=embarrassed.png,W-wait, I didn't mean... Or maybe I did? Maybe w-we should try it?
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;2:,count-role;self&saidmarker;blake_crush:,marker:marinette_overload=alarmed.png,W-what? I-I work with someone who looks a lot like Blake. She’s way cuter though, but, um. I-I-I-
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;seven&stage;2:,count-role;self&saidmarker;bodysuit:,count-role;other&character;samus&stage;3-7:=confused.png,Hmm… Samus, is it just particularly damage resistant?
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;seven&stage;2:,count-role;self&saidmarker;bodysuit:,count-role;other&character;d.va&stage;4-8:=confident.png,I bet D.Va’s helps with her reflexes.

This’ll probably be a funny story about how we became friends later, right?
-3-female_removed_major,count-journalist&role;target:=calm.png,Do you run a blog, ~name~? It’s a bit more modern than a newspaper... Though I hope this kind of thing isn’t on it!

-2-male_removed_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_m&stage;5:=confused.png,Not to be judgy… But aren’t those women’s panties? Are you running low on laundry, Mr. Corrin?
-2-female_removing_major=embarrassed.png,I’m n-not attracted to women...
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;4:=confused.png,(What should I say? I don't want her to get Akumatized, but I'm also... Not really sure what else to do for her!)

-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,A ladybug can't change her spots, but maybe you can, <i>Vriska.</i>
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4:=wink.png,I hope whatever you picked next is a bit more unique to <i>you</i> instead of trying to mock <i>me</i>.

-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale&stage;0:=wink.png,But nothing like you.
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;4:=alarmed.png,Curter. I mean. More Curt.
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;4&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=confused.png,E-er-- wait! No, it usually possesses an object! Not a person directly!
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;5:=alarmed.png,E-er... I... <i>Non, je ne t'aime pas coups de feau a l'arriere....</i>
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;arwen&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,E-even though you're losing your dress, I want you to stay proud, because I know what it's like to have two very different parents, and to meet so many... interesting people.
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;3:=confident.png,Er... do you have something to tell us, Joey? It's okay, you're among friends. Mostly! I think!
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;asuna&stage;4:=confused.png,Er... Had. It's weird you haven't found a kwami for yourself...
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;3:,marker:marinette_shirted=embarrassed.png,Erk. I’ve never shirted a stranger either.
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;spooky&stage;1:=confused.png,Ghosts don’t usually wear a lot of clothes… W-wait, that’s not just… part…
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,guess my Japanese is worse than I thought… Hmm… I thought I’d get along really well with her…
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;5:=confused.png,H-hey! That's not nice, Elaine! I was really worried I wasn't going to have my yo-yo ready!
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;3:=confident.png,Hm. You know, you are really far ahead... Is it rude to admit I'm a bit curious about... Your other styles?
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;meg&stage;5:=confident.png,Hmm, a matching set, I hope? It's not polka dots, but I like patterns a lot!
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;4:=bored.png,Hmm... Corrin, I get the feeling you just kind of throw on whatever you have...
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;4:=alarmed.png,Hmm... Do you really need to raise the stakes? We've... Kind of already seen your underwear, Elaine! Though it's pery vritty! V-very pretty!
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;juri&stage;0:=confused.png,I can respect someone who really gives it their all at the outset...
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;4:=bored.png,I like fashion a lot, but uhm. I think I move too much for skirts to be part of my wardrobe.
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5:=bored.png,I still haven't forgiven you, you know. You've been really rude all game.
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5:=bored.png,Maybe this next set'll be a bit humbling for you.
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;5:=confident.png,I think capes are <i>very</i> heroic. That's probably why you saved that, right?
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;kimberly&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,I-I guess that's true, Kimberly, but underwear is a lot nicer than most swimsuits, right?
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;4&saidmarker;null_possess:=embarrassed.png,I-I'll admit, I'm kind of interested to see what sort of underwear you have where you're from. You know. For fashion's sake.
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,I-I'll admit, most of my pairs are lacy or athletic. I haven't seen fruity panties in... well, I mean, since last round, but, er, you know, Natsuki...?
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;red&stage;1:=confused.png,Is that huge sword just like… A centerpiece of some sort?
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;4:=calm.png,It can get... breezy in Paris. I'd really rather not show my underwear if I don't want to.
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;1:=confused.png,It seems as though you have an affinity for plants... Like... Using them to cover yourself.
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;ann&stage;3:=confident.png,Like... I think you'd look great in a red jumpsuit!
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;launch&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,Not this Launch again!
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;4:=confident.png,Oh! I see. It's like a ship. No wonder you have a nautical theme!
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,<i>Please</i> be safe. I think the fireworks are cool, but I'd be really sad if you got hurt, Shimakaze!
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;4:=alarmed.png,Oh! I tend not to match my underwear either unless… Uhm. I’m planning on losing it.
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;4:=confident.png,W-well, I’m glad you’re still in the game, Nagisa!
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;meg&stage;4:=confident.png,Oh! You have such nice legs, Meg!  I don’t think anyone minds you showing those off.
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;4:=calm.png,Oh... I have a few shirts like that! I like to knot them above my navel, though!
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,O-of course you’d wear underwear under your clothes!
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;ruby&stage;3:=confident.png,O-oh! Those are a cute pair. I-I wonder what’s under there, though!
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;4:=alarmed.png,Please have panties, please have panties... (<i>Or... um... or don't...</i>)
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;3:=confused.png,Right now not withstanding...
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,R-really? There's pictures like that on the internet? <i>No way</i>.
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,This’ll at least be a funny story later!
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;4:=alarmed.png,Those are… Impressive!
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;april&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,Um… It’s a very haute chic look, April! But yes, we can… See what you’re wearing underneath.
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;2:=confused.png,Wait, you’re taking your skirt off first?
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;1:=wink.png,Well, I’ve shown you mine, so I hope you don’t mind showing me yours? And I mean a <i>lot</i> more than just a secret identity, Gwen.
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;navi:=wink.png,Well, this confirms some suspicions...
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;buffy&stage;4:=confused.png,Whoa! Buffy, that's a neat trick.
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;kimberly&stage;4:=confused.png,W-well, based on your bra... I'm not sure if this is going to be <i>really</i> sexy or what, Kimberly!
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;3:=confused.png,W-well, I guess we're in an elite group now, if that's true...
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;3:=confused.png,You know, about taking it all off?
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;4:=excited.png,You know, I usually go clothes shopping with Alya, but if you wanted to get something new, it might fun.
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;4:=wink.png,You’re mean <i>and</i> slutty. It’s a shame San Fransokyo U wasted a spot on you. Even Max didn’t get in!
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;4:=confident.png,Oh, you want to try and <i>slap</i> me? Bring it on!
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;2:=excited.png,Your qipao, Chun-li? It's so pretty!
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;2:=excited.png,Oh, I like the traditional style of your qipao, Chun-li! It's really impressive that you've worked that into your fighting style!
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;alice&stage;2:=confident.png,Your taste is very vintage, and very eclectic.
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;sanako:=wink.png,You're very wise for 18, Sanako! And so sweet!
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;blackrose&stage;4:,count-role;other&character;rinkah:=wink.png,...And Blackrose is so fiery...I just thought...

-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;juri:=confident.png,Hey! Chun-li's dress is really cool! You're being <i>such</i> a jerk to her, and she's not even beating you up or arresting you like she could, Juri!
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;3:,count-role;self&saidmarker;bodysuit:=embarrassed.png,Hm… We have a lot of bodysuits here today… And interesting figures underneath them! U-um.
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;2:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;bodysuit:,marker:bodysuit=calm.png,Is this Metroid I hear so much about the name of your Kwami?
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;2:,count-role;self&saidmarker;bodysuit:=wink.png,It does seem like a hassle to take off your suit...I’m glad my transformation is so easy!
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;2:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;bodysuit:,marker:bodyshit=wink.png,It does seem like a hassle to take off your suit...I’m glad my transformation is so easy!
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;5:,count-role;other&character;raven&stage;4-7:=embarrassed.png,The only person I can think of that doesn’t wear underwear under her clothes is Raven…
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;3:,count-role;other&character;ann:=confused.png,Um. Ann, are you staring because you like Nagisa, or because her bra looks like sweets?
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;ruby&stage;3:,count-role;other&character;blake:=confident.png,With all three of here, we're almost a ladybug sandwich! With me right in the middle!
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;lyn&stage;5:,count-role;other&character;florina:=embarrassed.png,W-wouldn’t that get really drafty, Florina? And if you move, everyone would see… Well, everything.
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;4:,count-role;self&saidmarker;bun_puns:=wink.png,You seem a bit embarrassed, but keep your composure I'm sure you know how to <i>rise</i> to the challenge!
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;5:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=embarrassed.png,Z-zone might be lewd enough to go without underwear, but I don’t think you’re like that, Florina!
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;5:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=alarmed.png,I have a feeling that Zone-tan just assumes most women are naked under their clothes. I mean, wot nearing under...Not wearing underwear!
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;3:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_ladity:,count-role;other&character;uravity&saidmarker;saki_befriend_ladity:=excited.png,Saki, what about we go to an amusement park or something?

-2-female_removing_major,count-yandere&role;target:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_stripping:=bored.png,Based on how you’ve acted towards everyone else, I kind of hope you do get Akumatized. Maybe it’d give you perspective once I fix you.
-2-female_removing_major,count-yandere&role;target:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;ayano_stripping:=confused.png,E-er, don’t get down ~name~, it’s... Just a game.
-2-female_removing_major,count-yandere:1-3,count-role;target&stage;3-5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=confident.png,~name~ is brave. Or she wouldn’t have stayed here.

-2-female_removing_major,count-yandere:1-3,count-single&role;target&stage;3-5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=wink.png,~name~ has her pick of the boys--or girls--and it’s because of her shining personality. If ~player~ wants her, she’d be a much better choice than an obsessive monster like you.
-2-female_removing_major,count-yandere:1-3,count-taken&role;target&stage;3-5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=wink.png,~name~ is already in a committed relationship, and she doesn’t need ~player~, but given how you’re acting, you definitely don’t need them either!

-2-female_removed_major=wink.png,If you ever wanted to compare notes, or model some of my designs, I'm sure we'd have a great time.

-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;5:=confident.png,(I think I have an idea!) Saki! How about I take you out for something fun after this?
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;red&stage;2:=bored.png,A religious memento, maybe? I’m so confused.

-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Aimee! You could have really hurt someone!
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:=confused.png,I-I'm impressed you managed to get your clothes off that way. That's some sharp shooting.
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:=excited.png,Ah! Wait a minute! Did you just transform!? Are you using a Miraculous?
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;5:=wink.png,Annie, I worry about you getting possessed by Hawk Moth. Smart people are always the toughest villains, so you should be proud of your body!

-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;launch&stage;6:=bored.png,At least she doesn't have her gun anymore...
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;6:=confused.png,At least you're... very charming... Elaine.
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;4&notsaidmarker;d.va_noobs:=wink.png,Aww...Okay Hana. If you want a hug, I’ll give you a hug.
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,E-er. Sorry. I'd really rather you not try to slap me.
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,U-um. Nevermind. Let's not get violent, GoGo.
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;4:,marker:gogo_max=bored.png,Just because Max is gay doesn't mean that-- <i>Va te faire cuire la cul.</i>.
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;4:,marker:gogo_dsl=alarmed.png,D-Did you really? Ugh. You're vile.
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,Er, I can maybe make some suggestions while you're visting? If you can afford that type of armor, I'm sure we can find you something cute!
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,Fortunately, my costume makes my clothes underneath seamless, so I never need underwear like that...
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;5:=alarmed.png,Doesn't that give you a huge wedgie all day?!
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;5:=confident.png,It's nice to have something you feel... Stylish in, but I never liked the way thongs looked.
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sanako&stage;2:,marker:groovy_sanako=wink.png,Groovy? <i>Groooovy</i>. Whoa! Sanako, wherever you're from, they have some really cool words!
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sanako&stage;2:,marker:prepared_sanako=embarrassed.png,Y-you really really prepared for this, huh, Sanako?
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;kimberly&stage;5:=wink.png,Hmm... you sure about that? Modesty is important, but so's honesty. I don't wear the sexy stuff if I'm planning on keeping it on <i>all</i> night.
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;mei&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,I asked for language help because my mom speaks Cantonese…But, uhm, it seems your clothes can’t... on... these... er…
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale&stage;1:=confident.png,I do wonder if I had some more time to focus on fitness, if I could do even more as Ladybug than I already do!
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;6:=confident.png,I don’t really understand why people think I’m naked under my costume. It’s magic, after all.
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;meg&stage;6:=wink.png,I don’t suppose you can speak with a Scottish accent? You’re looking a little on point, Meg.

-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5a:=confident.png,I don't think luck has a sense of humor, but this is pretty amusing.
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5a:=confident.png,Looking kind of... vampy, Vriska. I-I kind of... appreciate it?
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;3:=confident.png,I just can't get over how stylish you manage to make your really practical apparel. I clearly have a lot to learn!
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;3:=wink.png,Whoa, even without your qipao, the rest of your outfit just flows together so well. The fashion designer in me is gushing over this. (E-er, maybe that's a poor word choice.)
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;3:=confident.png,I love how you can make even traditional-styled clothing work for your combat techniques!
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;meg&stage;5:=confident.png,I know <i>I</i> don’t. You’re really the complete package!
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;3:=bored.png,I mean, nice legs aren’t a bad thing, but…
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;zoey&stage;4:=wink.png,I never did anything like that, either, Zoey. But maybe now’s a good time to start? This is pretty good company...
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;alice&stage;3:=excited.png,I really like it, but if you ever want to modernize your apparel... I’d love to help.
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;tracer&stage;4:=confident.png,I see Lena’a underpants!
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6b:=embarrassed.png,I think that's a bunny suit... But um... From this angle I can definitely see most of your butt.
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6b:=embarrassed.png,The whole butt-floss and stockings look is a lot better on you than <i>my</i> costume, Vriska.
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;juri&stage;1:=bored.png,I wish you weren't so <i>obviously</i> a villain. I'm sure we could get along great if you renounced your evil ways!
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,I-I don’t usually like to admit this, but I’m usually assuming the other girls are naked under their suits…
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;6:=embarrassed.png,I-I guess you don't usually have to worry about other ships... um... trying to go for your aft. I-I meant-- oh! Wait, no, aft works perfectly here!
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;buffy&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,I-I might have to use that at some point!
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;other&character;kim&stage;8:=embarrassed.png,I-I wasn’t looking at you, Kim! I was looking at ~name~. B-because it’s her turn!
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;5&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=alarmed.png,I-it usually doesn't <i>destroy</i> clothes either... Nayru? Hey, Nayru!
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;5:=alarmed.png,I'll have to try that look though! It's super cu--uuuul. <i>Cool</i>! Not butts! Um! Very stylish!
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;4:=wink.png,I've seen a lot of weird stuff in my time. That includes... illicit... fanart of me. I think you can manage this, Daria. Relatable strategy, though.
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,No regrets here, either! E-except maybe playing a little poorly. A-and there not really being an akuma here...
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;5:=wink.png,Oh! It's like the towel trick. Clever, Daria. It almost makes me wish I'd worn a skirt...
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;daisy&stage;5:=excited.png,Oh! You wore a swimsuit under that. You’re really sporty, Daisy! You have to give me some workout tips!
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;4:,marker:class_rep=excited.png,Oh! You’re doing this to help someone into student government? I was class rep, so let me know if I can help!
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;5:=wink.png,Oh, I see. This was all part of your plan, huh? T-though...
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;4&saidmarker;d.va_noobs:=confused.png,Oh, so we’re not noobs anymore, are we, D.Va? Apologize, then maybe I’ll give you a hug, (But only so she’s not Akumatized.)
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;4:=wink.png,Oh. <i>Pffft</i>. Okay, that's a good joke.
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;5&saidmarker;null_possess:=alarmed.png,O-oh, sorry. It's just very normal. Not that it wouldn't be. It's not like I was expecting anything elaborate. In fact I'm glad it's so normal. E-erk...
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,Sei, w-what's a bodyshot, and why am I being prompted to do one off your breasts? I-I mean breastplate.
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;arwen&stage;4:=calm.png,S-so thanks, Arwen! I'll definitely remember... this... Uhm. Bonding we did.
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;6:=confused.png,That sounds like it would chafe, horribly, riding without clothes?
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;kimberly&stage;4:=alarmed.png,T-totally hot. Y-yeah. You dure sh-shoe. S-sure do, Kimberly!
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;other&character;zone-tan&stage;3:,marker:ztentacles=confused.png,U-uhm, Zone-tan, I think the female form can be quite pretty. And obviously, male… Anatomy… Especially… But tentacles are gross! Only the wives of fishermen think about that!
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;2:,marker:face_it_tiger=excited.png,Wait a second! I <i>know</i> you! You’re Gwendolyne Stacy, from the <i>Mary Janes</i>! Ohmygoshwhat? I <i>love</i> <i>Face It Tiger</i>!
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sanako&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,We match! Um. Well, it's reversed. But they're both polka dots! I like polka dots too, I suppose!
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;4:=confused.png,Where have I heard your voice before? It’s driving me crazy!
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,Whew. What a relief that must be for you, Sayaka! Um. For us! Obviously.
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5b:=embarrassed.png,Who's Eridan? And that looks kind of like a sexy schoolgirl outfit... You certainly seem to enjoy being tasteless in your mockery of me...
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5b:=embarrassed.png,Oh so <i>now</i> you're in a schoolgirl outfit. Do you have <i>taste</i> at all? N-not like-- Um!
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;asuna&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,W-well, I guess you put a lot of faith in this Kirito guy. Maybe you should try keeping your own confidence, instead? I know about men who dress all in black.
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6a:=embarrassed.png,W-well, you certainly look kind of drenched.
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6a:=embarrassed.png,I sind of kort of--Kind of sort of--Er... Always have a bad time swimming.
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;other&character;morrigan&stage;4:=excited.png,W-what? How are you just?
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;other&character;morrigan&stage;4:=confident.png,Is your akuma power control over bats? It's... A clever use to protect your modesty, Morrigan!
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;4:=wink.png,W-wow. Y-your cingerie is lute! L-lingerie is c-cute! V-very... Um...
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,O-oh! W-wow. Ningerie lever... lingerie n-never really... um. Maybe I should try something like that?
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;5:=alarmed.png,Yeah… Hawkmoth is really creepy when you think about it...
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5c:=confused.png,Yes, I'm sure we're all mortified for you being in your pyjamas. It's not like they look cute on you.
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5c:=confused.png,Oh yeah, let's just make fun of Marinette's costume, but Vriska just looks <i>sooo</i> cute in her oversized shirt and stockings.
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,Yes, that's. I. Uhm. Really rude. Sorry Elena.
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,You're really hot though, so it's no surprise! I-I mean it's hot where you live. So you'd need to wear... to cool... Urh.
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;navi:=confident.png,You're some kind of spirit guide, aren't you? You help a hero, right?
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_furavity:=excited.png,After you, Ochako, and Futaba have had your fun, it would be nice for us to hang out too! Let me surprise you!
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;3:,count-role;self&saidmarker;bodysuit:=excited.png,And yes! It’s a nice view. What kind of fabric is your outfit made of?
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;4:,count-role;other&character;alice:,marker:bodysuit=excited.png,Hmm...Alice, If D.Va does use a bunny miraculous, is she the White Rabbit you’ve been chasing?
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;5:,count-role;other&character;corrin_f&saidmarker;hotsprings:=excited.png,Hmm… Maybe hot springs are more than I thought they’d be, since you and Corrin both seem fixated on them. I should give it a try, I think!
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_mariba:=wink.png,I definetly want to hear what kinds of boys or girls you like too, Saki! What are friends for if not lots of harebrained schemes to find your soulmate?
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_mariba:=wink.png,We're definitely going to have to talk about boys--or girls--too, Saki!
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;6:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=wink.png,I guess we proved her wrong, didn’t we, Florina?
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;6:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=confident.png,I-I mean everyone is naked at some level. But, underwear is just another fashion choice. And a comfy one!
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;bun_puns:=embarrassed.png,I know it's a bun... a pun... erk... But you definitely inspire me!
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;5:,count-role;other&character;palutena:=excited.png,I see we have a few ladies here tonight interested in asymmetrical fashion. By which I mean Nagisa and Palutena!
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;4:,count-role;other&character;lyn:=alarmed.png,I-I just mean you're both swordswomen, b-but Lyn's apparel is less armor and more style.
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;4:,count-role;self&saidmarker;marinette_shirted:=confident.png,I-I mean I’ve never taken a shirt off in front of a stranger. Or my costume! Be brave Nagisa!
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;meg&stage;6:,count-role;other&character;morrigan:=wink.png,Meg... Hm. Did something get switched up here? Morrigan has the accent but you have the red hair, the plaid underwear… Or is she some sort of altar ego?
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;kim&stage;4:,count-role;other&character;nugi-chan:=confused.png,Oh, do you have children, Nugi-chan?
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;samus&stage;3:,count-role;self&saidmarker;bodysuit:=confused.png,She must be really tired for you to lose your suit like that.
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;lyn&stage;6:,count-role;other&character;florina:=excited.png,Thank goodness. I knew you were really classy, Lyn!
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6b:,count-role;other&character;d.va:=alarmed.png,Uh, D.Va, this is way different than <i>your</i> conception of a bunny suit. I hope, anyway.
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;tina:=embarrassed.png,Uhm. Tina, is what Aimee's doing just something you do for fun in Texas?
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;5:,count-role;other&character;meia:=embarrassed.png,U-um. Dealer, do we have to separate these two?
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_ladity:=wink.png,We're definitely going to have to talk about boys--or girls--too, Saki!
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_ladity:=wink.png,I definetly want to hear what kinds of boys or girls you like too, Saki! What are friends for if not lots of harebrained schemes to find your soulmate?
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;ruby&stage;4:,count-role;other&character;blake:=embarrassed.png,W-wait, I didn't mean... Or maybe I did? Maybe w-we should try it?
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;2:,count-role;self&saidmarker;blake_crush:,marker:marinette_overload=alarmed.png,W-what? I-I work with someone who looks a lot like Blake. She’s way cuter though, but, um. I-I-I-
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;seven&stage;2:,count-role;self&saidmarker;bodysuit:,count-role;other&character;samus&stage;3-7:=confused.png,Hmm… Samus, is it just particularly damage resistant?
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;seven&stage;2:,count-role;self&saidmarker;bodysuit:,count-role;other&character;d.va&stage;4-8:=confident.png,I bet D.Va’s helps with her reflexes.
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;4:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_befriend_ladity:,count-role;other&character;uravity&saidmarker;saki_befriend_ladity:=wink.png,Saki, I know not everyone can be a superhero, but I hope you know that we like you enough to hang out with you! This’ll probably be a funny story about how we became friends later, right?
-2-female_removed_major,count-journalist&role;target:=calm.png,Do you run a blog, ~name~? It’s a bit more modern than a newspaper... Though I hope this kind of thing isn’t on it!

-1-male_removing_major,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;6:=calm.png,Not that I’m trying to um, snoop, Steve…
-1-male_removing_major,count-yandere:1-3,count-yandere&role;target:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=bored.png,What are we to do with you, ~name~?
-1-male_removing_major,count-yandere:1-3,count-yandere&role;target:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=bored.png,I hope you really get your act together...
-1-male_removing_major,count-yandere:1-3,count-yandere&role;target:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=confident.png,I can't let you be a danger to others, ~name~! Er-- apparently, I can't just fight you... that's security's job...
-1-male_removing_major,count-yandere:1-3,count-yandere&role;target:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=embarrassed.png,You should be ashamed of how you've been treating other people, ~name~.
-1-male_removing_major,count-yandere:1-3,count-yandere&role;target:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=confident.png,This serves you right.
-1-male_removing_major,count-yandere:1-3,count-yandere&role;target:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ayano_f_suspicious:=alarmed.png,T-there's no akuma here, is there, just ~name~ and her whole yandere stuff!
-1-male_removed_major=confident.png,I hope looking isn’t too rude, you <i>did</i> agree to this game too...
-1-male_removed_major,count-role;target&character;jin&stage;6:=wink.png,<i>Getting</i> lucky. Um. After this...
-1-male_removed_major,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,And… Oh. I thought you were handsome before. I-I mean um! W-wow. You really work... Hard for that, don’t you?
-1-male_removed_major,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;7:=embarrassed.png,But I keep getting glimpses behind the shield. Oh my.
-1-male_removed_major,count-role;other&character;florina:=embarrassed.png,Florina! It’s okay! It’s just ~name~’s ~clothing~. Though… It is quite… Alluring…
-1-male_removed_major,count-role;other&character;florina:=confident.png,Florina, don’t worry, staring is part of it! Um. Yeah!
-1-male_removed_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_m&stage;5:=confused.png,Not to be judgy… But aren’t those women’s panties? Are you running low on laundry, Mr. Corrin?
-1-female_removing_major=bored.png,I’m quite relieved. Maybe you’ll have a chance soon?
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;4:=confused.png,(What should I say? I don't want her to get Akumatized, but I'm also... Not really sure what else to do for her!)
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;4:=confused.png,(I'm not sure what else to say to her!)
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,A ladybug can't change her spots, but maybe you can, <i>Vriska.</i>
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4:=wink.png,I hope whatever you picked next is a bit more unique to <i>you</i> instead of trying to mock <i>me</i>.
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;aimee:=alarmed.png,Ahh!!! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale&stage;0:=wink.png,But nothing like you.
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;4:=alarmed.png,Curter. I mean. More Curt.
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;4&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=confused.png,E-er-- wait! No, it usually possesses an object! Not a person directly!
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;5:=alarmed.png,E-er... I... <i>Non, je ne t'aime pas coups de feau a l'arriere....</i>
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;arwen&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,E-even though you're losing your dress, I want you to stay proud, because I know what it's like to have two very different parents, and to meet so many... interesting people.
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;3:=confident.png,Er... do you have something to tell us, Joey? It's okay, you're among friends. Mostly! I think!
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;asuna&stage;4:=confused.png,Er... Had. It's weird you haven't found a kwami for yourself...
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;3:,marker:marinette_shirted=embarrassed.png,Erk. I’ve never shirted a stranger either.
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;spooky&stage;1:=confused.png,Ghosts don’t usually wear a lot of clothes… W-wait, that’s not just… part…

-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;5:=confused.png,H-hey! That's not nice, Elaine! I was really worried I wasn't going to have my yo-yo ready!
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;3:=confident.png,Hm. You know, you are really far ahead... Is it rude to admit I'm a bit curious about... Your other styles?
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;meg&stage;5:=confident.png,Hmm, a matching set, I hope? It's not polka dots, but I like patterns a lot!
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;4:=bored.png,Hmm... Corrin, I get the feeling you just kind of throw on whatever you have...
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;4:=alarmed.png,Hmm... Do you really need to raise the stakes? We've... Kind of already seen your underwear, Elaine! Though it's pery vritty! V-very pretty!
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;juri&stage;0:=confused.png,I can respect someone who really gives it their all at the outset...
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;4:=bored.png,I like fashion a lot, but uhm. I think I move too much for skirts to be part of my warddrobe.
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5:=bored.png,I still haven't forgiven you, you know. You've been really rude all game.
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5:=bored.png,Maybe this next set'll be a bit humbling for you.
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;5:=confident.png,I think capes are <i>very</i> heroic. That's probably why you saved that, right?
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;kimberly&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,I-I guess that's true, Kimberly, but underwear is a lot nicer than most swimsuits, right?
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;4&saidmarker;null_possess:=embarrassed.png,I-I'll admit, I'm kind of interested to see what sort of underwear you have where you're from. You know. For fashion's sake.
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,I-I'll admit, most of my pairs are lacy or athletic. I haven't seen fruity panties in... well, I mean, since last round, but, er, you know, Natsuki...?
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;red&stage;1:=confused.png,Is that huge sword just like… A centerpiece of some sort?
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;4:=calm.png,It can get... breezy in Paris. I'd really rather not show my underwear if I don't want to.
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;1:=confused.png,It seems as though you have an affinity for plants... Like... Using them to cover yourself.
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;ann&stage;3:=confident.png,Like... I think you'd look great in a red jumpsuit!
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;launch&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,Not this Launch again!
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;4:=confident.png,Oh! I see. It's like a ship. No wonder you have a nautical theme!
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,<i>Please</i> be safe. I think the fireworks are cool, but I'd be really sad if you got hurt, Shimakaze!
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;4:=alarmed.png,Oh! I tend not to match my underwear either unless… Uhm. I’m planning on losing it.
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;4:=confident.png,W-well, I’m glad you’re still in the game, Nagisa!
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;meg&stage;4:=confident.png,Oh! You have such nice legs, Meg!  I don’t think anyone minds you showing those off.
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;4:=calm.png,Oh... I have a few shirts like that! I like to knot them above my navel, though!
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,O-of course you’d wear underwear under your clothes!
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;4:=alarmed.png,Please have panties, please have panties... (<i>Or... um... or don't...</i>)
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elena&stage;3:=confused.png,Right now not withstanding...
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,R-really? There's pictures like that on the internet? <i>No way</i>.
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;ruby&stage;3:=confused.png,Ruby, I’m a bittle lit sissadointed... Little bit disappointed you’re teasing me now that I’m done...
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;uravity&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,This’ll at least be a funny story later!
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;4:=alarmed.png,Those are… Impressive!

-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;4:,marker:gogo_max=bored.png,Just because Max is gay doesn't mean that-- <i>Va te faire cuire la cul.</i>.
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;gogo&stage;4:,marker:gogo_dsl=alarmed.png,D-Did you really? Ugh. You're vile.
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,Er, I can maybe make some suggestions while you're visting? If you can afford that type of armor, I'm sure we can find you something cute!
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,Fortunately, my costume makes my clothes underneath seamless, so I never need underwear like that...
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;5:=alarmed.png,Doesn't that give you a huge wedgie all day?!
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;5:=confident.png,It's nice to have something you feel... Stylish in, but I never liked the way thongs looked.

-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;kimberly&stage;5:=wink.png,Hmm... you sure about that? Modesty is important, but so's honesty. I don't wear the sexy stuff if I'm planning on keeping it on <i>all</i> night.
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;mei&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,I asked for language help because my mom speaks Cantonese…But, uhm, it seems your clothes can’t... on... these... er…
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale&stage;1:=confident.png,I do wonder if I had some more time to focus on fitness, if I could do even more as Ladybug than I already do!
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;6:=confident.png,I don’t really understand why people think I’m naked under my costume. It’s magic, after all.
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;meg&stage;6:=wink.png,I don’t suppose you can speak with a Scottish accent? You’re looking a little on point, Meg.
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;5:=alarmed.png,I don't think I've ever seen a... well, a <i>bra</i> like that... but what are you going to call it, Shimakaze?
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5a:=confident.png,I don't think luck has a sense of humor, but this is pretty amusing.

-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;3:=confident.png,I just can't get over how stylish you manage to make your really practical apparel. I clearly have a lot to learn!
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;3:=wink.png,Whoa, even without your qipao, the rest of your outfit just flows together so well. The fashion designer in me is gushing over this. (E-er, maybe that's a poor word choice.)
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;chun-li&stage;3:=confident.png,I love how you can make even traditional-styled clothing work for your combat techniques!
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;meg&stage;5:=confident.png,I know <i>I</i> don’t. You’re really the complete package!
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;annie&stage;3:=bored.png,I mean, nice legs aren’t a bad thing, but…
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;zoey&stage;4:=wink.png,I never did anything like that, either, Zoey. But maybe now’s a good time to start? This is pretty good company...
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;alice&stage;3:=excited.png,I really like it, but if you ever want to modernize your apparel... I’d love to help.
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;tracer&stage;4:=confident.png,I see Lena’a underpants!
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6b:=embarrassed.png,I think that's a bunny suit... But um... From this angle I can definitely see most of your butt.
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6b:=embarrassed.png,The whole butt-floss and stockings look is a lot better on you than <i>my</i> costume, Vriska.
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;juri&stage;1:=bored.png,I wish you weren't so <i>obviously</i> a villain. I'm sure we could get along great if you renounced your evil ways!
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,I-I don’t usually like to admit this, but I’m usually assuming the other girls are naked under their suits…
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;6:=embarrassed.png,I-I guess you don't usually have to worry about other ships... um... trying to go for your aft. I-I meant-- oh! Wait, no, aft works perfectly here!
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;buffy&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,I-I might have to use that at some point!
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;other&character;kim&stage;8:=embarrassed.png,I-I wasn’t looking at you, Kim! I was looking at ~name~. B-because it’s her turn!
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;5&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=alarmed.png,I-it usually doesn't <i>destroy</i> clothes either... Nayru? Hey, Nayru!
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;5:=alarmed.png,I'll have to try that look though! It's super cu--uuuul. <i>Cool</i>! Not butts! Um! Very stylish!
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;4:=wink.png,I've seen a lot of weird stuff in my time. That includes... illicit... fanart of me. I think you can manage this, Daria. Relatable strategy, though.
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,No regrets here, either! E-except maybe playing a little poorly. A-and there not really being an akuma here...
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;daria&stage;5:=wink.png,Oh! It's like the towel trick. Clever, Daria. It almost makes me wish I'd worn a skirt...
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;daisy&stage;5:=excited.png,Oh! You wore a swimsuit under that. You’re really sporty, Daisy! You have to give me some workout tips!
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;nagisa&stage;4:,marker:class_rep=excited.png,Oh! You’re doing this to help someone into student government? I was class rep, so let me know if I can help!
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;5:=wink.png,Oh, I see. This was all part of your plan, huh? T-though...
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;d.va&stage;4&saidmarker;d.va_noobs:=confused.png,Oh, so we’re not noobs anymore, are we, D.Va? Apologize, then maybe I’ll give you a hug, (But only so she’s not Akumatized.)
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;4:=wink.png,Oh. <i>Pffft</i>. Okay, that's a good joke.
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;nayru&stage;5&saidmarker;null_possess:=alarmed.png,O-oh, sorry. It's just very normal. Not that it wouldn't be. It's not like I was expecting anything elaborate. In fact I'm glad it's so normal. E-erk...
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,Sei, w-what's a bodyshot, and why am I being prompted to do one off your breasts? I-I mean breastplate.
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;arwen&stage;4:=calm.png,S-so thanks, Arwen! I'll definitely remember... this... Uhm. Bonding we did.
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;6:=confused.png,That sounds like it would chafe, horribly, riding without clothes?

-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,Whew. What a relief that must be for you, Sayaka! Um. For us! Obviously.
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5b:=embarrassed.png,Who's Eridan? And that looks kind of like a sexy schoolgirl outfit... You certainly seem to enjoy being tasteless in your mockery of me...

-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;asuna&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,W-well, I guess you put a lot of faith in this Kirito guy. Maybe you should try keeping your own confidence, instead? I know about men who dress all in black.

0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-rwby&role;target:=embarrassed.png,I heard a rumor from a friend that you all shave down there... Is that like, a bonding experience?
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-thong&role;target:=bored.png,At least you'll be out of your thong, ~name~. That <i>can't</i> be comfortable.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-thong&role;target:=confused.png,I think thongs are just... super uncomfortable. But no panty lines... I think I'd have a bigger issue with that if not for my costume.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-thong&role;target:=alarmed.png,At least you don't have to wear your thong anymore, ~name~. How a day-long wedgie is at all comfortable is beyond me.

0-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;palutena:=alarmed.png,I-I suppose a memory is words a thousand worths. Worth a thousand words!
0-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;kyoko:=alarmed.png,I-I'm not saying I'll, I just meant that you, I mean, uhm. Want to try on a Miraculous instead? Maybe... a spider, for making connections?
0-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;navi:=alarmed.png,I'm really awkward about this, I can't think about you except how much you remind me of Tikki and it's so <i>weird</i>!
0-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;cammy:=embarrassed.png,I'm so sorry your clothes keep getting damaged. If um. You want, after this, I can loan you some of my stuff? Because we match! In... various ways!
0-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;uravity:=alarmed.png,It makes your breasts look stunning too! Er, you look stunned, um… erk-- j-just keep at it, Ochako!
0-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;lux:=wink.png,It’s not supposed to match for blondes, is it? So that’s pretty normal. The contrast is pretty striking, given your light magic. Looks like you have a dark spot after all!
0-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;natsuki:=wink.png,Just like my friend Alyx! She also has pink hair. And um, grooms like you do.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;alpha:,marker:smooth_criminal=wink.png,Looks like you were struck by a <i>smooth</i> criminal.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika:=confident.png,Maybe after this, you could show me some grappling stuff, huh, Mika?
0-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;ruby:=wink.png,Oh, I see at least the leader does what she wants.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru&saidmarker;null_possess:=excited.png,Oh, what a relief! We have the same style--of um. You know! I think you must've just trimmed fresh today, though, <i>oui</i>?
0-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;ann:=embarrassed.png,Oh. I see that it is. W-well! It adds a new element to your career! U-uhm. I mean, in modeling. Not this.

0-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;kyu:=wink.png,Or a hawk moth yourself. Though you’re very <i>very</i> smooth. (You know, with trying to help ~player~. And, you know, the obvious.)
0-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;nagisa:=confident.png,Stay with it, Nagisa. If you don’t give up, you might lose, but you’re not defeated!
0-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;annie:=wink.png,Tell me about it, Annie. There’s just not enough hours in the day… But I find that spending time in the shower to trim and groom. If you feel good, and look good, you can do your best!
0-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight:=alarmed.png,That’s definitely not human behavior! Are you a giant Kwami, or something else?
0-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;red:=wink.png,The Kwami inside seems to know you pretty well. It’s weird that you haven’t transformed yet, though.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;gwen:=alarmed.png,Um. I don’t like the sound of this...
0-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;juri:=alarmed.png,U-uhm. Y-you're just very hairy! Most European girls I know um. Take care of that in other ways.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;videl:=confused.png,U-um. I think I have some questions about why you do that. You know. As a fighter.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;raven:=embarrassed.png,We’re both mixed women, we both fight evil, we both like bodysuits... We both don’t... shave our... er... nevermind.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch:=embarrassed.png,Well, that’s not true, my costume just vanishes when I run out of force...
0-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;blackrose:=alarmed.png,Whoa. I haven’t… Erm, seen many, but that’s particularly pretty!
0-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;felicia:=confident.png,W-well, I'm sure your partners will appreciate that, anyway...
0-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;shimakaze:=wink.png,W-well, less elaborate than how you groom, I suppose.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;launch:=embarrassed.png,W-well, that's... half of the question answered, I suppose.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;saki:=alarmed.png,W-wow, you sure are hairy, Saki! (Oh come on, Marinette!)
0-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;saki:=alarmed.png,W-well, I think we all see you now, Saki! (Marinette, that's not what you should've said!)
0-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=bored.png,Yikes. That looks rode hard and put away… um… Wet. I believe is the expression.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=alarmed.png,You can climax just by… Thinking? Now <i>That’s</i> a superpower.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;other&character;mulan&saidmarker;duel_lost:=wink.png,You mentioned a spirit guide… and you're from what seems to be Ancient China… do you know anything about the Miraculouses?

0-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;palutena:,count-role;other&character;lyn:=bored.png,Oh. Well, that’s one way of being unique.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;blake:,count-role;other&character;yang&stage;8-10:=alarmed.png,O-oh I was expecting to say you had a… ah, fuzzy… B-but I guess this way you don’t get hair in each other’s mouths?
0-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;cammy:,count-role;other&character;chun-li:=embarrassed.png,Ow! I don't think I'd let a friend help me undress like that! (Yikes...)

1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=alarmed.png,E-er, did you just... Slice that pretty set of underwear?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=alarmed.png,Um! I'm glad you didn't hurt him, but you've hurt your bra, Elaine!

1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;navi:=alarmed.png,Hmm... And to think, I've offered to make her clothes so many times...
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight:=confident.png,Hmm... That's an interesting trick, Twilight. I'm glad you're staying modest!
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;aimee:=excited.png,I-

1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;cammy:=confused.png,I really want to help! But they're all so fast! Poor Cammy!
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;6:=wink.png,I wonder if it's a French thing...
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;shantae:=alarmed.png,I’m sorry, it seems you… Um, have gotten rather naked.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;shimakaze:=embarrassed.png,I-I hope that my Lucky Charm can save you if this--
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=alarmed.png,I-I really don't think you should be destroying her clothing, though! It's not super fancy, but that doesn't mean it's not without value!
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;ayano:=alarmed.png,Is... IS THAT BLOOD?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;ayano:=alarmed.png,That’s blood, isn’t it? Possessed or not, you need to be stopped, Ayano! You’re insane! I won’t let you win!
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru:=wink.png,I've only really been naked with my friends too. Don't they have saunas in Labrynna?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=embarrassed.png,Moon, we can already see...

1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,Okay so... I guess the next part is easy... unless you have a rabbit coming out or something!
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;4:=excited.png,O-okay, I am kind of interesting in seeing this magic trick, if I'm being honest...
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;uravity:=embarrassed.png,Regarding, er... your questions...
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;shazza:=embarrassed.png,Shazza, you're a lot bigger in person than I expected! I just hadn't gotten the chance to say it.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;daria:=embarrassed.png,Try having two identities and a bunch of friends with crushes on each other, if you want complicated.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;kyu:=wink.png,Well, this is a nice preview for everyone else!
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;kim:=confident.png,What’s the sitch Kim? Just comparing catchphrases!

1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight:,count-role;other&character;buffy:=wink.png,Hmm... I wonder if Buffy taught you that, or if she's just a really fast learner...
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;saki:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_date:=wink.png,S-sorry if that's a bit forward, but it's not like you haven't seen her almost naked <i>anyway</i>, so you <i>do</i> kind of owe her a date, I think!

1-female_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-fair-skinned&role;target:=wink.png,Your skin looks so healthy! Do you use cosmetics, or are you just lucky like that?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-large_breasts&role;target:=embarrassed.png,You shouldn't swing those in our faces, ~name~. Or maybe you should. Whatever is less embarassing.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-medium_breasts&role;target:=confident.png,Hmm... Is it your ~clothing~ or are you just naturally so... full, ~name~?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-pale_eyes&role;target:=embarrassed.png,Huh. I don't think I've seen eyes that color before. N-not in person, anyway.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-pale-skinned&role;target:=embarrassed.png,Hm... You really don't see a lot of sun, do you, ~name~?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-pale-skinned&role;target:=confused.png,I-I'm not going to lie, pale skin kind of... Makes me a little worried you'll be super creepy, ~name~.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-red_eyes&role;target:=alarmed.png,I feel bad for you, ~name~. Red's not a typical eye color. E-er that's not why I feel bad. You losing your... Um... Anyway.

1-female_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-unusual_skin&role;target:=embarrassed.png,W-well. ~name~, you're n-not really from my normal palette when it comes to designing clothes...
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-violet_eyes&role;target:=embarrassed.png,Violet is such a cool eye color! You get the best of blue while still seeing wider color palettes. Um. Or so I learned in school.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:ruby=confused.png,O-or maybe you're the imposter? I <i>really</i> never liked illusion powers.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:yang=confused.png,O-or maybe you're the imposter? I <i>really</i> never liked illusion powers.

1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;kyu:=calm.png,For um, if I lose. T-though your chest is very nice! Um.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;amalia:=bored.png,Forest for the trees? <i>L'anglais est tellement une langue étrange.</i>
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru&saidmarker;null_possess:=calm.png,If it makes you feel better, Nayru, maybe you could just consider me your friend? I mean, this was <i>quite</i> a get-to-know-you.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;sanako:=confused.png,I-I'm not sure if I should flirt or ask you to help me with my homework. This is such an uncanny feeling...

1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;juri:=wink.png,They're surprisingly cute for a villain. Juri, when I take away your akuma, I hope you don't feel too resentful!
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;7:=confused.png,Well, I've kind of seen these, so I guess that's all that needs to be said...
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=confused.png,Well... this is odd, but I suppose if Nayru was okay with it, I can be too... I'd never <i>ever</i> let someone else do this to me though...

1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;dawn&stage;7:=bored.png,I mean, most people already know they’re supposed to match... Mine does, obviously...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=embarrassed.png,I um. Think your friendship reminds me of Cat Noir and his kwami. They seem to argue a bit more than Tikki and I.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;kyu:=confused.png,I’m glad you weren’t possessed by Hawk Moth…
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;felicia:=embarrassed.png,I-I appreciate few yallowing--- You following the rules, Felicia, b-but it's just kind of... Not what I was expecting!
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;ann:=alarmed.png,I-I mean if it is, that's great. People like to ask about mine a lot.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;uravity:=wink.png,It must be super cool to be able to fly or float like you do!
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru&saidmarker;null_possess:=wink.png,Just keep a brave face, okay, Nayru?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;kimberly:=embarrassed.png,Kimberly, I know we just met but... I've never seen tan lines on someone's... you know. I-I hope it doesn't cross a line if I look!
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;launch:=alarmed.png,Launch matches... um... between sneezes... (She doesn't seem <i>too</i> akumatizable, just... irritated...)
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch:=excited.png,Oh my! That’s definitely magic I’ve never seen!
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;blackrose:=confident.png,Oh! Blackrose, I-I know it’s hard to lose but, hopefully whatever you have is particularly um...exotic?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;sayori:=confident.png,O-oh, well, I wouldn't stare! But I think it's great you're happy with your appearance like this! I like to groom, but I think I get really self-conscious about how I look. I'm proud for you, Sayori!
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=excited.png,O-oh. W-well, this is a nice view, even if <i>I'm</i> not a fan of that style of underwear...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=excited.png,Y-you know, I have to say, I'm understanding the appeal of that kind of underwear...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=excited.png,At least it's not <i>entirely</i> up your butt, Elaine.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;red:=excited.png,Or is it something like my earrings? <i>What?</i> Is your <i>sword</i> a Miraculous!?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska:=bored.png,Or you could roll the die again. I really hope you're not just resetting your clothes...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska:=bored.png,Just for your consideration: having good luck means <i>not</i> needing to rely on it...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight:=confused.png,T-Twilight, usually that's something that comes off last!
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight:=alarmed.png,W-wait everyone will be able to see your-
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;navi:=embarrassed.png,Um, er, no, not, what you're-- about-- no, I mean, the literal--
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;sayaka:=embarrassed.png,Um, Sayaka, I don't think I've ever faced an akuma like this before. Maybe witches are much scarier...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika:=embarrassed.png,Um. Just less while naked.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;shimakaze:=embarrassed.png,Um... is... all this talk about taking on water... a euphemism, Shimakaze? It's... very elaborate.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;elizabeth:=alarmed.png,Wait I meant running! Oh no, you'll be doing both soon, argh! I'm so sorry!
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;gwen:=embarrassed.png,What?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;nagisa:=wink.png,W-what, of course you’re cute!
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;nagisa:=embarrassed.png,A-as a friend, court you’re of yute! I- I’m. Er..
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;aimee:=alarmed.png,Y-you're really going to just? Wearing so little?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;cammy:,count-role;other&character;chun-li:=alarmed.png,...! I-I...!
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;natsuki:,count-role;other&character;monika:,marker:trapsuki=alarmed.png,E-er, what is it you're implying about Natsuki, Monika...?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;blake:,count-role;other&character;yang&stage;8-10:=alarmed.png,I know you aren’t a fan of… Um… Chat… Jokes, Blake…
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch:,count-role;other&character;hermione:=wink.png,Oh! So like how Hermione has been removing her small stuff. It’s… Interesting you saved it for last!
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;yang:,count-role;other&character;blake&stage;8-10:=embarrassed.png,So, Blake… Um… Shaves… Her… Chat…
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;neo:,count-role;other&character;yang&stage;8-10:=embarrassed.png,Um. Yang, does Neo hate you, or… Like you?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight:,count-role;other&character;nagisa:=embarrassed.png,U-uh, Nagisa, shouldn't we tell Twilight not to...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;d.va&saidmarker;d.va_high_score:,count-role;other&character;moon:=confused.png,Wait, is the goal of this game to get naked fastest? Is that why Moon plays like she does?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;palutena:,count-role;other&character;lyn:=embarrassed.png,Well, two green haired women... Do your... You know... erm, match?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,priority:306,count-role;target&character;d.va&saidmarker;d.va_high_score:,count-exposed:1-2=bored.png,U-uhm. D.Va, it’s only the high score if you’re winning, right? I don’t really think... Er... Maybe you’re playing another game?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,priority:36,count-bodysuit:2,count-bodysuit:3,count-bodysuit:4,count-role;self&saidmarker;bodysuit:,count-exposed:2-4=embarrassed.png,Um…~name~, do you shave? I get a feeling I’m the only person with a body suit who… Doesn’t.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-rwby&role;target:=embarrassed.png,I heard a rumor from a friend that you all shave down there... Is that like, a bonding experience?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-thong&role;target:=bored.png,At least you'll be out of your thong, ~name~. That <i>can't</i> be comfortable.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-thong&role;target:=confused.png,I think thongs are just... super uncomfortable. But no panty lines... I think I'd have a bigger issue with that if not for my costume.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-thong&role;target:=alarmed.png,At least you don't have to wear your thong anymore, ~name~. How a day-long wedgie is at all comfortable is beyond me.
1-female_crotch_is_visible=embarrassed.png,Oh, I do mine a little differently--I mean, uh, never mind, look at her!
1-female_crotch_is_visible=excited.png,See! It matches for people with non-typical hair colors too!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;aimee:=confused.png,... Did you just... Climax... ?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=alarmed.png,<i>C'est tout à fait le cul!</i>
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=alarmed.png,Quite the tattoo, Elaine! You must've had it for a long time!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;lilith:=embarrassed.png,But your tattoos are cool! W-wait, you didn’t think I meant your... piercings or... your... uhm, patterning…
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=alarmed.png,E-er... I think it's okay to be excited. I-I mean, it's only natural. Not weird. O-or anything like that. S-so, just yenjoy ourself-- enjoy yourself, Nayru!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;meia:,marker:unusual_blue_hair=bored.png,Er. I’m still not used to seeing women bare like this. It’s unusual to see blue hair in the first place so…
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;corrin_f:=alarmed.png,Goodness. Don't you fight a lot of battles? How on earth do you have time to maintain something like that?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;corrin_f:=confused.png,U-uhm. Corrin, with your ears, should I believe that all of your people look like that... or?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;5:=alarmed.png,H-hey! You can't do that! No fair!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;futaba:=alarmed.png,I can't believe you didn't wear underwear!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;kimberly:=excited.png,I tend to prefer lots of sunblock, but that looks <i>super</i> cool, Kimberly! I'll have to try the look. We even... um, trim the same!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;dawn:=embarrassed.png,I-Eep. I’m going to stop talking now.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;palutena:=alarmed.png,I-I suppose a memory is words a thousand worths. Worth a thousand words!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;kyoko:=alarmed.png,I-I'm not saying I'll, I just meant that you, I mean, uhm. Want to try on a Miraculous instead? Maybe... a spider, for making connections?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;navi:=alarmed.png,I'm really awkward about this, I can't think about you except how much you remind me of Tikki and it's so <i>weird</i>!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;cammy:=embarrassed.png,I'm so sorry your clothes keep getting damaged. If um. You want, after this, I can loan you some of my stuff? Because we match! In... various ways!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;uravity:=alarmed.png,It makes your breasts look stunning too! Er, you look stunned, um… erk-- j-just keep at it, Ochako!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;lux:=wink.png,It’s not supposed to match for blondes, is it? So that’s pretty normal. The contrast is pretty striking, given your light magic. Looks like you have a dark spot after all!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;natsuki:=wink.png,Just like my friend Alyx! She also has pink hair. And um, grooms like you do.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;alpha:,marker:smooth_criminal=wink.png,Looks like you were struck by a <i>smooth</i> criminal.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika:=confident.png,Maybe after this, you could show me some grappling stuff, huh, Mika?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;ruby:=wink.png,Oh, I see at least the leader does what she wants.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru&saidmarker;null_possess:=excited.png,Oh, what a relief! We have the same style--of um. You know! I think you must've just trimmed fresh today, though, <i>oui</i>?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;ann:=embarrassed.png,Oh. I see that it is. W-well! It adds a new element to your career! U-uhm. I mean, in modeling. Not this.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;sayaka:=alarmed.png,O-oh! You're... so hairy! I make sure to trim, most of the time, anyway... er... not that anyone needed to know that...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;daria:=bored.png,O-oh. Well, that trick again. I see. Well played, Daria.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;kyu:=wink.png,Or a hawk moth yourself. Though you’re very <i>very</i> smooth. (You know, with trying to help ~player~. And, you know, the obvious.)
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;nagisa:=confident.png,Stay with it, Nagisa. If you don’t give up, you might lose, but you’re not defeated!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;annie:=wink.png,Tell me about it, Annie. There’s just not enough hours in the day… But I find that spending time in the shower to trim and groom. If you feel good, and look good, you can do your best!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight:=alarmed.png,That’s definitely not human behavior! Are you a giant Kwami, or something else?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;red:=wink.png,The Kwami inside seems to know you pretty well. It’s weird that you haven’t transformed yet, though.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;gwen:=alarmed.png,Um. I don’t like the sound of this...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;juri:=alarmed.png,U-uhm. Y-you're just very hairy! Most European girls I know um. Take care of that in other ways.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;videl:=confused.png,U-um. I think I have some questions about why you do that. You know. As a fighter.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;raven:=embarrassed.png,We’re both mixed women, we both fight evil, we both like bodysuits... We both don’t... shave our... er... nevermind.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch:=embarrassed.png,Well, that’s not true, my costume just vanishes when I run out of force...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;blackrose:=alarmed.png,Whoa. I haven’t… Erm, seen many, but that’s particularly pretty!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;streaming-chan&stage;7:=alarmed.png,W-wait, you removed your clothes instead of that hat and camera?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;felicia:=confident.png,W-well, I'm sure your partners will appreciate that, anyway...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;shimakaze:=wink.png,W-well, less elaborate than how you groom, I suppose.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;launch:=embarrassed.png,W-well, that's... half of the question answered, I suppose.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;saki:=alarmed.png,W-wow, you sure are hairy, Saki! (Oh come on, Marinette!)
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;saki:=alarmed.png,W-well, I think we all see you now, Saki! (Marinette, that's not what you should've said!)
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=bored.png,Yikes. That looks rode hard and put away… um… Wet. I believe is the expression.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=alarmed.png,You can climax just by… Thinking? Now <i>That’s</i> a superpower.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;other&character;mulan&saidmarker;duel_lost:=wink.png,You mentioned a spirit guide… and you're from what seems to be Ancient China… do you know anything about the Miraculouses?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska:=confused.png,You're... You're sad. You're just <i>so</i> sad, Vriska. Come here and let me break your die, and just de-Akumatize you already.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska:=confused.png,I'm sorry, Vriska. But you really should just quit.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch:,count-role;other&character;hermione&stage;9-10:=confused.png,A-are you also going to use magic to do… Um… What she did?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;yang:,count-role;other&character;blake&stage;8-10:=alarmed.png,D-does that make it easier for you two to… You know? Soixante neuf?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;juri:,count-role;other&character;d.va&stage;6-8:,marker:korean_trends=embarrassed.png,Er... Hana, does yours... er... get that hairy when you don't shave? Or is Juri just out of touch with Korean beauty trends?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;palutena:,count-role;other&character;lyn:=bored.png,Oh. Well, that’s one way of being unique.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;blake:,count-role;other&character;yang&stage;8-10:=alarmed.png,O-oh I was expecting to say you had a… ah, fuzzy… B-but I guess this way you don’t get hair in each other’s mouths?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;cammy:,count-role;other&character;chun-li:=embarrassed.png,Ow! I don't think I'd let a friend help me undress like that! (Yikes...)
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;hotsprings:,count-role;other&character;sheena&stage;8-10:,marker:hotsprings=embarrassed.png,Sheena, you mean explored as in… The area--The area of the water and rocks, not, all of us girls, right?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,priority:36,count-bodysuit:2,count-bodysuit:3,count-bodysuit:4,count-role;self&saidmarker;bodysuit:,count-exposed:2-4=alarmed.png,I-it just seems like a lot of work for not a lot of benefit… Does it really feel that much better?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-dark-skinned&role;target:=excited.png,Oh, wow, you really look cool, ~name~!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-hairy&role;target:=alarmed.png,T-that’s very... Eastern of you, both European and otherwise.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-shaved&role;target:=confused.png,Ow, that seems like it would hurt a lot to maintain.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-trimmed&role;target:=excited.png,Oh, maybe I’ll try that style!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7,alsoPlaying:lyn=excited.png,See! It matches for people with non-typical hair colors too!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7,alsoPlaying:palutena=excited.png,See! It matches for people with non-typical hair colors too!

2-male_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-pierced_nipples&role;target:=confused.png,Y-yikes, ~name~. That takes a lot of guts. I mean. Um. Not on your chest! B-but. Erk. N-not to my liking. Mostly.
2-male_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-scarred&role;target:=bored.png,Oh ~name~... I'm sorry, whatever happened to you, I wish I could lucky charm it away...
2-male_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-scarred&role;target:=bored.png,~name~, your scars look really cool, actually! I-I know that might not make them less... you know, personal. But they're part of you, and I think that's respectable.
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;captain_america:,marker:normandie=calm.png,I’d let him storm <i>my</i> Normandy.
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;pit:=embarrassed.png,Um! I'll-- Um! I-I'm actually really excited to see this.
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;pit:=wink.png,Show me what you have, hero.
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;jin:=wink.png,W-well, it would be a shame, but I guess you couldn't be so <i>cocky</i> anymore.
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;corrin_m:=embarrassed.png,You say this Camilla is your wife? She must be a very patient woman!
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;pit:,count-role;other&character;palutena:=alarmed.png,O-oh. Oh no, I have very much misinterpreted this relationship. I am so sorry.
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-large_penis&role;target:,count-role;other&character;aella:=embarrassed.png,Um. Aella, I feel like we're due for a random encounter soon. It looks like it's going to be a big one...
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-large_penis&role;target:=embarrassed.png,S-surely you're hiding something else in your ~clothing~, ~name~! T-this is a joke, right?
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-medium_penis&role;target:=bored.png,W-well, don't you look aroused at the prospect of getting naked in front of strangers...
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-small_penis&role;target:=confused.png,Bye bye... um... <i>little</i> butterfly?
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-small_penis&role;target:=excited.png,Way to keep your composure, ~name~! It's still so compact!
2-male_small_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;corrin_m:=bored.png,Um. I suppose style and skill count for more? You’re not my type, Corrin, but you should be proud of who you are!
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;pit:=alarmed.png,Hm... I think I see a powerup I know <i>I</i> wouldn't mind getting familiar with. E-er. It's over there! Behind Pit's... That's why I'm staring! W-where I'm staring!
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,priority:0,count-circumcised&role;target:=confused.png,Um... I think I've seen this in... E-er... Design media. B-but never in person. Not like <i>~name~'s,</i> anyway.
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,priority:0,count-uncircumcised&role;target:=confused.png,U-um. N-not that it looks weird, it's just-- I wasn't-- Um. This is a bit strange to me, here, is all.
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,count-role;other&character;nagisa:,marker:ztentacles=alarmed.png,I-I wouldn’t follow that line of logic if I were, Nagisa! I’ve heard that Japanese schoolgirls are very vulnerable to those kinds of things!
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;captain_america:=alarmed.png,Oh. My. God. Wait. Wait! Did I say that <i>out loud?</i> In <i>English</i>? Um! Can everyone just forget they heard that! P-please?
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;jin:=embarrassed.png,W-well, I-I guess some powers have very impractical applications. Y-yikes, t-that's--!
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,count-role;other&character;aella:=wink.png,You know, Aella, I think you're the only woman I've met who could handle something like that. Um. Without breaking, anyway.
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,count-huge_penis&role;target:=alarmed.png,N-no! T-that's-- That's far too large!
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,count-huge_penis&role;target:=alarmed.png,E-er, how <i>big</i> are the women where you're from <i>~name~</i>!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible=embarrassed.png,Nothing to be ashamed of... You for being undressed, me for... watching out for you.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible=confused.png,O-or maybe you're the imposter? I <i>really</i> never liked illusion powers.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;juri&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,(<i>Oh dear. I kind of want to see them... she's just... </i>so<i> forward!</i>)
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska:=confused.png,(I know what it's like to have a bunch of magic you aren't sure what to do with... I should try and be a little nicer, if just to make her lower her guard so I can break that die of hers and release the akuma.)
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska:=confused.png,(She puts up a tough act. But she's probably just scared and really insecure... I can't even tell if she's Akumatized. I mostly just... Feel bad for her. I should be a little nicer.)
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;sanako:=wink.png,As long as you don't leave things in the oven too long, I can see people liking fluffy pastries like those, Sanako!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika:=embarrassed.png,At least I had clothes on underneath…
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=confused.png,Did someone shame you for your body? Is that why you're like this?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=alarmed.png,E-er, did you just... Slice that pretty set of underwear?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=alarmed.png,Um! I'm glad you didn't hurt him, but you've hurt your bra, Elaine!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;felicia:=embarrassed.png,H-hey! Sait a wecond! W-wait a second! Were you naked this whole time!?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;felicia:=embarrassed.png,H-hold on there, Felicia! W-what are you--?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;navi:=alarmed.png,Hmm... And to think, I've offered to make her clothes so many times...
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight:=confident.png,Hmm... That's an interesting trick, Twilight. I'm glad you're staying modest!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;aimee:=excited.png,I-
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;aimee:=bored.png,Again!?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;4:=confident.png,I guess you could say you missed the forest for the leaves!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;kyu:=embarrassed.png,I mean, because that’s how I activate and deactivate my costume…
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;cammy:=confused.png,I really want to help! But they're all so fast! Poor Cammy!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;6:=wink.png,I wonder if it's a French thing...
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;shantae:=alarmed.png,I’m sorry, it seems you… Um, have gotten rather naked.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;shimakaze:=embarrassed.png,I-I hope that my Lucky Charm can save you if this--
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=alarmed.png,I-I really don't think you should be destroying her clothing, though! It's not super fancy, but that doesn't mean it's not without value!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;ayano:=alarmed.png,Is... IS THAT BLOOD?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;ayano:=alarmed.png,That’s blood, isn’t it? Possessed or not, you need to be stopped, Ayano! You’re insane! I won’t let you win!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru:=wink.png,I've only really been naked with my friends too. Don't they have saunas in Labrynna?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=embarrassed.png,Moon, we can already see...
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch:=wink.png,Oh! I do. Your breasts are--
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;gwen:=excited.png,Oh, so there’s a good twist, right--
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,Okay so... I guess the next part is easy... unless you have a rabbit coming out or something!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;4:=excited.png,O-okay, I am kind of interesting in seeing this magic trick, if I'm being honest...
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;uravity:=embarrassed.png,Regarding, er... your questions...
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;shazza:=embarrassed.png,Shazza, you're a lot bigger in person than I expected! I just hadn't gotten the chance to say it.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;daria:=embarrassed.png,Try having two identities and a bunch of friends with crushes on each other, if you want complicated.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;kim:=confident.png,What’s the sitch Kim? Just comparing catchphrases!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;kim:=calm.png,Don’t bug out, Kim...Just compare our catchphrases!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;nagisa:=wink.png,Wow, your uniform is surprisingly… Compressive. I-Impressive?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,You can say that again. I know probably <i>un peu trop dans ce moi</i> costume.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;kimberly:=embarrassed.png,Y-yeah. At least your tanlines are cute!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;5:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;saki_date:=wink.png,(No vous sente pas gene!) How about we go shopping? You seem to care a lot about your school uniform, but maybe there's other cute clothes you'd like?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;5:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;saki_date:=wink.png,(No vous sente pas honteaux!) Why don't we go out for crepes? Obviously because I'm French I'll find the good ones!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;cammy:,count-role;other&character;juri:=alarmed.png,Cammy! Wash your-- watch out!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight:,count-role;other&character;buffy:=wink.png,Hmm... I wonder if Buffy taught you that, or if she's just a really fast learner...
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;saki:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_date:=wink.png,S-sorry if that's a bit forward, but it's not like you haven't seen her almost naked <i>anyway</i>, so you <i>do</i> kind of owe her a date, I think!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;shego:,count-role;other&character;kim:=confident.png,Surrender, Shego! The two of us have you cornered! Give up!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;nagisa:,count-role;self&saidmarker;marinette_ricebun:=confused.png,W-wait a second!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-amber_eyes&role;target:=embarrassed.png,Oh... Would you look at that. Kind of like... A sunset...
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-blue_eyes&role;target:=embarrassed.png,Oh! The light just caught your eyes and-- <i>So</i> cool, ~name~. I-I hope that doesn't sound self-involved.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-blue_eyes&role;target:=alarmed.png,Oh! Our eyes match, ~name~! I-I kind of hope our chests don't, though.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-dark_eyes&role;target:=embarrassed.png,You have such deep, pretty eyes, ~name~! Er-- Handsome eyes! Um--! Pick which you like! J-just so you know I'm not staring at your chest!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-dark_eyes&role;target:,marker:brown_eyes=wink.png,I heard someone say that boys love it when you show them your brown eyes! You must be really popular, ~name~!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-dark-skinned&role;target:=excited.png,Wow, ~name~, you have a really great skin tone!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-dark-skinned&role;target:=embarrassed.png,You're lucky to have such a nice complexion! I bet it makes it easy to get a lot of sun! N-not that you would without your ~clothing~, of course!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-fair-skinned&role;target:=wink.png,Your skin looks so healthy! Do you use cosmetics, or are you just lucky like that?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-pale_eyes&role;target:=embarrassed.png,Huh. I don't think I've seen eyes that color before. N-not in person, anyway.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-pale-skinned&role;target:=embarrassed.png,Hm... You really don't see a lot of sun, do you, ~name~?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-pale-skinned&role;target:=confused.png,I-I'm not going to lie, pale skin kind of... Makes me a little worried you'll be super creepy, ~name~.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-red_eyes&role;target:=alarmed.png,I feel bad for you, ~name~. Red's not a typical eye color. E-er that's not why I feel bad. You losing your... Um... Anyway.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-red_eyes&role;target:=embarrassed.png,You know, ~name~, I was kinda worried that red eyes would mean you were something evil... But you're not <i>so</i> bad.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-unusual_skin&role;target:=excited.png,I'm... Not going to lie, ~name~, I've... Um. Well, your skin color is usually only common to akuma victims. Since you're in control of yourself... It's kinda... Hot.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-unusual_skin&role;target:=embarrassed.png,W-well. ~name~, you're n-not really from my normal palette when it comes to designing clothes...
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-violet_eyes&role;target:=embarrassed.png,Violet is such a cool eye color! You get the best of blue while still seeing wider color palettes. Um. Or so I learned in school.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:ruby=confused.png,O-or maybe you're the imposter? I <i>really</i> never liked illusion powers.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:yang=confused.png,O-or maybe you're the imposter? I <i>really</i> never liked illusion powers.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible=confident.png,Oh, you’re in good company. No need to worry. Our busts fit into way cooler clothes and things!
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;navi:=embarrassed.png,Er... I don't think... I <i>know</i> she doesn't have the anatomy you do. I think.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska&saidmarker;7b:=excited.png,H-hey, Vriska, you can pull off the whole... Sexy mechanic look. There. That's a compliment.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska&saidmarker;7b:=excited.png,No <i>wonder</i> you looked so good in my costume. You've got a model's figure!
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska&saidmarker;7a:=embarrassed.png,O-oh my. You can really see everything. I'm... Glad you're so comfortable with your grooming habits and chest, Vriska.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska&saidmarker;7a:=confident.png,I-It <i>does</i> take a certain <i>je ne sais quoi</i> to um. Be so open with your body. You don't have to cheat to make <i>friends</i> with an appearance like that, Vriska!
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;shimakaze:=confused.png,--tits...? I-Er, I mean, this gets! H-ha, yeah! I-I'm glad you're okay, Shimakaze! It looks like you're really strong... (<i>Or maybe the explosions are just for show...</i>)

2-female_small_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-scarred&role;target:=bored.png,Oh ~name~... I'm sorry, whatever happened to you, I wish I could lucky charm it away...

2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;aimee:=alarmed.png,Aimee, are you okay?
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;aimee:=confused.png,R-really? That's what you consider underwear?! Why would you even- You're crazy! Plain and simple!
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;daria:=wink.png,Aw... Daria, were you just embarrassed because you forgot to shave today?
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;kimberly:=alarmed.png,Don't be so shy, Kimberly! I think your breasts look great! I-I mean your tan! Y-your chest is cute too, though. E-erk.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;shazza:=alarmed.png,Er, my timing seems to be off... like your top, though.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;amalia:=bored.png,Forest for the trees? <i>L'anglais est tellement une langue étrange.</i>
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;sayaka:=alarmed.png,Gah! That's not supposed to be a surprise!! At-at least I put on clothes this morning before adventuring... I've... um similarly been embarrassed.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru&saidmarker;null_possess:=calm.png,If it makes you feel better, Nayru, maybe you could just consider me your friend? I mean, this was <i>quite</i> a get-to-know-you.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;sanako:=confused.png,I-I'm not sure if I should flirt or ask you to help me with my homework. This is such an uncanny feeling...
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;nagisa:=excited.png,Not weird at all. I have to yell out all sorts of things to make the Miraculous de-Akumatize people! Or put on my costume!
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;5:=alarmed.png,Oh no, Joey! I-I don't think this was supposed to be the trick! A-and where did your hair, there go?
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;gwen:=embarrassed.png,--Oh. Well, at least <i>my</i> skintight outfit is fun. And not. You know, not cannibalistic. That’d be super weird, right? Uhm. Right?
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;6:=calm.png,Phew. At least nothing went wrong, this time, and you seem to be having fun, Joey!
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;cammy:=wink.png,She's... You're so impressive, Cammy. I mean. All of you. Um. Your body. And fighting style. All of that.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;nagisa:,marker:battlecry_nagisa=confident.png,That’s impressive, I mean! You have such a good figure, Nagisa!
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;juri:=wink.png,They're surprisingly cute for a villain. Juri, when I take away your akuma, I hope you don't feel too resentful!
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;kyu:=alarmed.png,Though I’m a bit horrified to think of what powers you’d give someone.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;7:=confused.png,Well, I've kind of seen these, so I guess that's all that needs to be said...
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=confused.png,Well... this is odd, but I suppose if Nayru was okay with it, I can be too... I'd never <i>ever</i> let someone else do this to me though...
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch:=embarrassed.png,W-well they’re perky, but you can see your hair… there… and that underwear is...um...not my style.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=embarrassed.png,W-well, that's quite the chest. No wonder people always try to plunder you, Elaine.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=embarrassed.png,<i>C'est tout à fait la poitrine. Pas étonnant que les gens essayent toujours de te piller, Elaine.</i>

2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;shego:,count-role;other&character;kim:=calm.png,J-just surrender to us, not Hawk Moth. Just because Kim and I are having a crossover doesn't mean our villains need to...
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;cammy:,count-role;other&character;juri:=alarmed.png,That's so rude of you, Juri! Why are you accosting your friend like that!?
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;saki:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_date:=embarrassed.png,Um... S-sorry if matchmaking was a bit... rude of me, all things considered... I just figured you'd look cute together...
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;saki:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_date:=embarrassed.png,Um! Saki looks way cuter than she thinks she does, right? Um. ~player~? (I think she looks pretty!)

2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch:,count-role;other&character;d.va:=confident.png,You know, having a really supportive suit really does help with going braless. Sorry to hear you can’t, D.Va!

2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-pierced_nipples&role;target:=confused.png,Y-yikes, ~name~. That takes a lot of guts. I mean. Um. Not on your chest! B-but. Erk. N-not to my liking. Mostly.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-scarred&role;target:=bored.png,Oh ~name~... I'm sorry, whatever happened to you, I wish I could lucky charm it away...
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-scarred&role;target:=bored.png,~name~, your scars look really cool, actually! I-I know that might not make them less... you know, personal. But they're part of you, and I think that's respectable.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;april&stage;3:=excited.png,Donnie? Oh! You have someone special?
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;shantae:=alarmed.png,Maybe your dance is just so distracting that I dreamed the whole conversation up?
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;uravity:=wink.png,No extra bug heroes yet! But it’s always great to meet new teammates!
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;uravity:=embarrassed.png,Er, cat-themed you say? I think one cat-themed superhero is enough for my life.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;palutena:=excited.png,Oh! I wasn’t expecting...After the belts...Wow. I can see why the statues in your likeness have so many references to heavenly spheres.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;palutena:=embarrassed.png,Oh, don’t be so ashamed. We’re all here having fun, Palutena. There’s nothing wrong with nudity… Except the staring. And embarrassment. Okay, I’m sorry.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;felicia:=alarmed.png,Uh-hm. When I said I worked with another kitty, I did mean another person. N-not something else.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;felicia:=embarrassed.png,Um... S-sorry Felicia, you look <i>vaguely</i> like someone I've spent a lot of time with... Just... Female and not dark.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika:=wink.png,Um… I commend you for keeping the mask on, though. Is that for a secret identity, or just dedication to your craft?
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;uravity:,count-role;other&character;gwen:=wink.png,I have a feeling I’ll be making a new teammate after this game, actually... I think she’s more arachnid themed, though!
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;angie_boobs:,count-role;other&character;angie:,marker:angie_boobs=wink.png,You know, Angie, it's okay to like breasts. No need to be embarrassed.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;uravity:,count-role;other&character;blake:=alarmed.png,You know, I think I could do to meet new cat-themed superheroes… just to compare them to my Cat Noir. N-not <i>mine</i> mine, mind mew. Erk--
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-freckles&role;target:=wink.png,When you blush, your freckles really stand out, ~name~!
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-freckles&role;target:=embarrassed.png,Aww, ~name~ has ladybug spots too! Just, more freckly and less costumey.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-huge_breasts&role;target:=embarrassed.png,E-erk? ~name~? W-w-whay!? I-I mean, w-what!?
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-huge_breasts&role;target:=alarmed.png,Y-yikes. D-do you ever worry about smothering people when you sleep with them!?
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-pierced_nipples&role;target:=confused.png,Ow! ~name~, doesn't that... well, it's not like my ears hurt but... sat's po tensitive! That's such a sensitive area!

2-female_large_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-scarred&role;target:=bored.png,Oh ~name~... I'm sorry, whatever happened to you, I wish I could lucky charm it away...
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-scarred&role;target:=bored.png,~name~, your scars look really cool, actually! I-I know that might not make them less... you know, personal. But they're part of you, and I think that's respectable.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;saki:=embarrassed.png,(I just feel a strong urge to protect her... Especially now...)
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;saki:=embarrassed.png,(I feel such a strong need to protect Saki...)
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;daria:=embarrassed.png,(I'm kind of hoping I get to see it, she's been teasing herself for a while...)
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;kyu:=embarrassed.png,But I can’t help but feel it’d be uniquely confident to wear a pair of butterfly underwear like that!
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;cammy:=alarmed.png,Cammy! Why do they keep attacking you!?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;palutena:=embarrassed.png,D-did you mean to imply you drop them for other people? O-or mostly just yourself?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;juri:=embarrassed.png,E-er. I guess you really are from Korea!
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;other&character;zone-tan&stage;2:,marker:ztentacles=embarrassed.png,I can imagine more fun things to do involving that than… I-I mean not personally but… Um…!
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;kyoko:=embarrassed.png,I have a really bad feeling that you'd be a very strong supervillain... I-I think I should help you unwind before you get too stressed!
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;dawn&stage;7:=bored.png,I mean, most people already know they’re supposed to match... Mine does, obviously...
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=embarrassed.png,I um. Think your friendship reminds me of Cat Noir and his kwami. They seem to argue a bit more than Tikki and I.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;felicia:=embarrassed.png,I-I appreciate few yallowing--- You following the rules, Felicia, b-but it's just kind of... Not what I was expecting!
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;ann:=alarmed.png,I-I mean if it is, that's great. People like to ask about mine a lot.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;uravity:=wink.png,It must be super cool to be able to fly or float like you do!
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru&saidmarker;null_possess:=wink.png,Just keep a brave face, okay, Nayru?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;kimberly:=embarrassed.png,Kimberly, I know we just met but... I've never seen tan lines on someone's... you know. I-I hope it doesn't cross a line if I look!
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;launch:=alarmed.png,Launch matches... um... between sneezes... (She doesn't seem <i>too</i> akumatizable, just... irritated...)
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch:=excited.png,Oh my! That’s definitely magic I’ve never seen!
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;blackrose:=confident.png,Oh! Blackrose, I-I know it’s hard to lose but, hopefully whatever you have is particularly um...exotic?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;sayori:=confident.png,O-oh, well, I wouldn't stare! But I think it's great you're happy with your appearance like this! I like to groom, but I think I get really self-conscious about how I look. I'm proud for you, Sayori!
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=excited.png,O-oh. W-well, this is a nice view, even if <i>I'm</i> not a fan of that style of underwear...
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=excited.png,Y-you know, I have to say, I'm understanding the appeal of that kind of underwear...
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=excited.png,At least it's not <i>entirely</i> up your butt, Elaine.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;red:=excited.png,Or is it something like my earrings? <i>What?</i> Is your <i>sword</i> a Miraculous!?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska:=bored.png,Or you could roll the die again. I really hope you're not just resetting your clothes...
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska:=bored.png,Just for your consideration: having good luck means <i>not</i> needing to rely on it...
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;sola:=embarrassed.png,Sola, I'm sorry that my original question about the matching is going to be answered... please don't hex me.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight:=confused.png,T-Twilight, usually that's something that comes off last!
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight:=alarmed.png,W-wait everyone will be able to see your-
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;navi:=embarrassed.png,Um, er, no, not, what you're-- about-- no, I mean, the literal--
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;sayaka:=embarrassed.png,Um, Sayaka, I don't think I've ever faced an akuma like this before. Maybe witches are much scarier...
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika:=embarrassed.png,Um. Just less while naked.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;shimakaze:=embarrassed.png,Um... is... all this talk about taking on water... a euphemism, Shimakaze? It's... very elaborate.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;elizabeth:=alarmed.png,Wait I meant running! Oh no, you'll be doing both soon, argh! I'm so sorry!
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;gwen:=embarrassed.png,What?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;nagisa:=wink.png,W-what, of course you’re cute!
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;nagisa:=embarrassed.png,A-as a friend, court you’re of yute! I- I’m. Er..
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;aimee:=alarmed.png,Y-you're really going to just? Wearing so little?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;cammy:,count-role;other&character;chun-li:=alarmed.png,...! I-I...!
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;natsuki:,count-role;other&character;monika:,marker:trapsuki=alarmed.png,E-er, what is it you're implying about Natsuki, Monika...?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;blake:,count-role;other&character;yang&stage;8-10:=alarmed.png,I know you aren’t a fan of… Um… Chat… Jokes, Blake…
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch:,count-role;other&character;hermione:=wink.png,Oh! So like how Hermione has been removing her small stuff. It’s… Interesting you saved it for last!
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;yang:,count-role;other&character;blake&stage;8-10:=embarrassed.png,So, Blake… Um… Shaves… Her… Chat…
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;neo:,count-role;other&character;yang&stage;8-10:=embarrassed.png,Um. Yang, does Neo hate you, or… Like you?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight:,count-role;other&character;nagisa:=embarrassed.png,U-uh, Nagisa, shouldn't we tell Twilight not to...
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;d.va&saidmarker;d.va_high_score:,count-role;other&character;moon:=confused.png,Wait, is the goal of this game to get naked fastest? Is that why Moon plays like she does?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;palutena:,count-role;other&character;lyn:=embarrassed.png,Well, two green haired women... Do your... You know... erm, match?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,priority:306,count-role;target&character;d.va&saidmarker;d.va_high_score:,count-exposed:1-2=bored.png,U-uhm. D.Va, it’s only the high score if you’re winning, right? I don’t really think... Er... Maybe you’re playing another game?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,priority:36,count-bodysuit:2,count-bodysuit:3,count-bodysuit:4,count-role;self&saidmarker;bodysuit:,count-exposed:2-4=embarrassed.png,Um…~name~, do you shave? I get a feeling I’m the only person with a body suit who… Doesn’t.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-rwby&role;target:=embarrassed.png,I heard a rumor from a friend that you all shave down there... Is that like, a bonding experience?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-thong&role;target:=bored.png,At least you'll be out of your thong, ~name~. That <i>can't</i> be comfortable.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-thong&role;target:=confused.png,I think thongs are just... super uncomfortable. But no panty lines... I think I'd have a bigger issue with that if not for my costume.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-thong&role;target:=alarmed.png,At least you don't have to wear your thong anymore, ~name~. How a day-long wedgie is at all comfortable is beyond me.
2-female_crotch_is_visible=embarrassed.png,Oh, I do mine a little differently--I mean, uh, never mind, look at her!
2-female_crotch_is_visible=excited.png,See! It matches for people with non-typical hair colors too!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;aimee:=confused.png,... Did you just... Climax... ?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=alarmed.png,<i>C'est tout à fait le cul!</i>
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=alarmed.png,Quite the tattoo, Elaine! You must've had it for a long time!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;kyu:=confident.png,After the game, would you show me where you got those? Or maybe, I could trade you? I bet I could fit!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;lilith:=embarrassed.png,But your tattoos are cool! W-wait, you didn’t think I meant your... piercings or... your... uhm, patterning…
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=alarmed.png,E-er... I think it's okay to be excited. I-I mean, it's only natural. Not weird. O-or anything like that. S-so, just yenjoy ourself-- enjoy yourself, Nayru!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;meia:,marker:unusual_blue_hair=bored.png,Er. I’m still not used to seeing women bare like this. It’s unusual to see blue hair in the first place so…
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;corrin_f:=alarmed.png,Goodness. Don't you fight a lot of battles? How on earth do you have time to maintain something like that?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;corrin_f:=confused.png,U-uhm. Corrin, with your ears, should I believe that all of your people look like that... or?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;sola:=alarmed.png,Hex, Sola! I-I'm not quite ready f-for whatever you thought I was suggesting even though I'm... In... this game...
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;5:=alarmed.png,H-hey! You can't do that! No fair!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;futaba:=alarmed.png,I can't believe you didn't wear underwear!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;kimberly:=excited.png,I tend to prefer lots of sunblock, but that looks <i>super</i> cool, Kimberly! I'll have to try the look. We even... um, trim the same!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;dawn:=embarrassed.png,I-Eep. I’m going to stop talking now.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;palutena:=alarmed.png,I-I suppose a memory is words a thousand worths. Worth a thousand words!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;kyoko:=alarmed.png,I-I'm not saying I'll, I just meant that you, I mean, uhm. Want to try on a Miraculous instead? Maybe... a spider, for making connections?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;navi:=alarmed.png,I'm really awkward about this, I can't think about you except how much you remind me of Tikki and it's so <i>weird</i>!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;cammy:=embarrassed.png,I'm so sorry your clothes keep getting damaged. If um. You want, after this, I can loan you some of my stuff? Because we match! In... various ways!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;uravity:=alarmed.png,It makes your breasts look stunning too! Er, you look stunned, um… erk-- j-just keep at it, Ochako!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;lux:=wink.png,It’s not supposed to match for blondes, is it? So that’s pretty normal. The contrast is pretty striking, given your light magic. Looks like you have a dark spot after all!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;natsuki:=wink.png,Just like my friend Alyx! She also has pink hair. And um, grooms like you do.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;alpha:,marker:smooth_criminal=wink.png,Looks like you were struck by a <i>smooth</i> criminal.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika:=confident.png,Maybe after this, you could show me some grappling stuff, huh, Mika?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;ruby:=wink.png,Oh, I see at least the leader does what she wants.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru&saidmarker;null_possess:=excited.png,Oh, what a relief! We have the same style--of um. You know! I think you must've just trimmed fresh today, though, <i>oui</i>?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;ann:=embarrassed.png,Oh. I see that it is. W-well! It adds a new element to your career! U-uhm. I mean, in modeling. Not this.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;sayaka:=alarmed.png,O-oh! You're... so hairy! I make sure to trim, most of the time, anyway... er... not that anyone needed to know that...
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;daria:=bored.png,O-oh. Well, that trick again. I see. Well played, Daria.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;nagisa:=confident.png,Stay with it, Nagisa. If you don’t give up, you might lose, but you’re not defeated!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;annie:=wink.png,Tell me about it, Annie. There’s just not enough hours in the day… But I find that spending time in the shower to trim and groom. If you feel good, and look good, you can do your best!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight:=alarmed.png,That’s definitely not human behavior! Are you a giant Kwami, or something else?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;red:=wink.png,The Kwami inside seems to know you pretty well. It’s weird that you haven’t transformed yet, though.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;gwen:=alarmed.png,Um. I don’t like the sound of this...
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;juri:=alarmed.png,U-uhm. Y-you're just very hairy! Most European girls I know um. Take care of that in other ways.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;videl:=confused.png,U-um. I think I have some questions about why you do that. You know. As a fighter.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;raven:=embarrassed.png,We’re both mixed women, we both fight evil, we both like bodysuits... We both don’t... shave our... er... nevermind.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch:=embarrassed.png,Well, that’s not true, my costume just vanishes when I run out of force...
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;blackrose:=alarmed.png,Whoa. I haven’t… Erm, seen many, but that’s particularly pretty!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;streaming-chan&stage;7:=alarmed.png,W-wait, you removed your clothes instead of that hat and camera?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;felicia:=confident.png,W-well, I'm sure your partners will appreciate that, anyway...
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;shimakaze:=wink.png,W-well, less elaborate than how you groom, I suppose.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;launch:=embarrassed.png,W-well, that's... half of the question answered, I suppose.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;saki:=alarmed.png,W-wow, you sure are hairy, Saki! (Oh come on, Marinette!)
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;saki:=alarmed.png,W-well, I think we all see you now, Saki! (Marinette, that's not what you should've said!)
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=bored.png,Yikes. That looks rode hard and put away… um… Wet. I believe is the expression.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=alarmed.png,You can climax just by… Thinking? Now <i>That’s</i> a superpower.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;other&character;mulan&saidmarker;duel_lost:=wink.png,You mentioned a spirit guide… and you're from what seems to be Ancient China… do you know anything about the Miraculouses?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska:=confused.png,You're... You're sad. You're just <i>so</i> sad, Vriska. Come here and let me break your die, and just de-Akumatize you already.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska:=confused.png,I'm sorry, Vriska. But you really should just quit.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch:,count-role;other&character;hermione&stage;9-10:=confused.png,A-are you also going to use magic to do… Um… What she did?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;yang:,count-role;other&character;blake&stage;8-10:=alarmed.png,D-does that make it easier for you two to… You know? Soixante neuf?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;juri:,count-role;other&character;d.va&stage;6-8:,marker:korean_trends=embarrassed.png,Er... Hana, does yours... er... get that hairy when you don't shave? Or is Juri just out of touch with Korean beauty trends?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;palutena:,count-role;other&character;lyn:=bored.png,Oh. Well, that’s one way of being unique.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;blake:,count-role;other&character;yang&stage;8-10:=alarmed.png,O-oh I was expecting to say you had a… ah, fuzzy… B-but I guess this way you don’t get hair in each other’s mouths?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;cammy:,count-role;other&character;chun-li:=embarrassed.png,Ow! I don't think I'd let a friend help me undress like that! (Yikes...)
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;hotsprings:,count-role;other&character;sheena&stage;8-10:,marker:hotsprings=embarrassed.png,Sheena, you mean explored as in… The area--The area of the water and rocks, not, all of us girls, right?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,priority:36,count-bodysuit:2,count-bodysuit:3,count-bodysuit:4,count-role;self&saidmarker;bodysuit:,count-exposed:2-4=alarmed.png,I-it just seems like a lot of work for not a lot of benefit… Does it really feel that much better?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-dark-skinned&role;target:=excited.png,Oh, wow, you really look cool, ~name~!

3-male_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-unusual_skin&role;target:=embarrassed.png,W-well. ~name~, you're n-not really from my normal palette when it comes to designing clothes...
3-male_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-violet_eyes&role;target:=embarrassed.png,Violet is such a cool eye color! You get the best of blue while still seeing wider color palettes. Um. Or so I learned in school.
3-male_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;jin:=embarrassed.png,O-oh. Oh goodness. Th-that's quite impressive. D-did you just throw hands to get to this point?
3-male_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;pit:=excited.png,Well, you can add me to the list that like your build, Pit. <i>Tres beau!</i>

3-male_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-scarred&role;target:=bored.png,~name~, your scars look really cool, actually! I-I know that might not make them less... you know, personal. But they're part of you, and I think that's respectable.

3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;pit:=embarrassed.png,Um! I'll-- Um! I-I'm actually really excited to see this.
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;pit:=wink.png,Show me what you have, hero.
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;jin:=wink.png,W-well, it would be a shame, but I guess you couldn't be so <i>cocky</i> anymore.
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;corrin_m:=embarrassed.png,You say this Camilla is your wife? She must be a very patient woman!
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;pit:,count-role;other&character;palutena:=alarmed.png,O-oh. Oh no, I have very much misinterpreted this relationship. I am so sorry.
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-large_penis&role;target:,count-role;other&character;aella:=embarrassed.png,Um. Aella, I feel like we're due for a random encounter soon. It looks like it's going to be a big one...
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-large_penis&role;target:=embarrassed.png,S-surely you're hiding something else in your ~clothing~, ~name~! T-this is a joke, right?
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-medium_penis&role;target:=bored.png,W-well, don't you look aroused at the prospect of getting naked in front of strangers...
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-small_penis&role;target:=confused.png,Bye bye... um... <i>little</i> butterfly?
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-small_penis&role;target:=excited.png,Way to keep your composure, ~name~! It's still so compact!
3-male_small_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;corrin_m:=bored.png,Um. I suppose style and skill count for more? You’re not my type, Corrin, but you should be proud of who you are!
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;pit:=alarmed.png,Hm... I think I see a powerup I know <i>I</i> wouldn't mind getting familiar with. E-er. It's over there! Behind Pit's... That's why I'm staring! W-where I'm staring!
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,priority:0,count-circumcised&role;target:=confused.png,Um... I think I've seen this in... E-er... Design media. B-but never in person. Not like <i>~name~'s,</i> anyway.
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,priority:0,count-uncircumcised&role;target:=confused.png,U-um. N-not that it looks weird, it's just-- I wasn't-- Um. This is a bit strange to me, here, is all.
3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,count-role;other&character;nagisa:,marker:ztentacles=alarmed.png,I-I wouldn’t follow that line of logic if I were, Nagisa! I’ve heard that Japanese schoolgirls are very vulnerable to those kinds of things!

3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;jin:=embarrassed.png,W-well, I-I guess some powers have very impractical applications. Y-yikes, t-that's--!
3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,count-role;other&character;aella:=wink.png,You know, Aella, I think you're the only woman I've met who could handle something like that. Um. Without breaking, anyway.
3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,count-huge_penis&role;target:=alarmed.png,N-no! T-that's-- That's far too large!
3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,count-huge_penis&role;target:=alarmed.png,E-er, how <i>big</i> are the women where you're from <i>~name~</i>!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible=embarrassed.png,Nothing to be ashamed of... You for being undressed, me for... watching out for you.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible=confused.png,O-or maybe you're the imposter? I <i>really</i> never liked illusion powers.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;juri&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,(<i>Oh dear. I kind of want to see them... she's just... </i>so<i> forward!</i>)
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska:=confused.png,(I know what it's like to have a bunch of magic you aren't sure what to do with... I should try and be a little nicer, if just to make her lower her guard so I can break that die of hers and release the akuma.)
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska:=confused.png,(She puts up a tough act. But she's probably just scared and really insecure... I can't even tell if she's Akumatized. I mostly just... Feel bad for her. I should be a little nicer.)
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;sanako:=wink.png,As long as you don't leave things in the oven too long, I can see people liking fluffy pastries like those, Sanako!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika:=embarrassed.png,At least I had clothes on underneath…
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=confused.png,Did someone shame you for your body? Is that why you're like this?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=alarmed.png,E-er, did you just... Slice that pretty set of underwear?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=alarmed.png,Um! I'm glad you didn't hurt him, but you've hurt your bra, Elaine!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;felicia:=embarrassed.png,H-hey! Sait a wecond! W-wait a second! Were you naked this whole time!?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;felicia:=embarrassed.png,H-hold on there, Felicia! W-what are you--?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;navi:=alarmed.png,Hmm... And to think, I've offered to make her clothes so many times...
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight:=confident.png,Hmm... That's an interesting trick, Twilight. I'm glad you're staying modest!

3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;kyu:=embarrassed.png,I mean, because that’s how I activate and deactivate my costume…
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;cammy:=confused.png,I really want to help! But they're all so fast! Poor Cammy!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;6:=wink.png,I wonder if it's a French thing...
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;shantae:=alarmed.png,I’m sorry, it seems you… Um, have gotten rather naked.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;shimakaze:=embarrassed.png,I-I hope that my Lucky Charm can save you if this--
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=alarmed.png,I-I really don't think you should be destroying her clothing, though! It's not super fancy, but that doesn't mean it's not without value!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;ayano:=alarmed.png,Is... IS THAT BLOOD?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;ayano:=alarmed.png,That’s blood, isn’t it? Possessed or not, you need to be stopped, Ayano! You’re insane! I won’t let you win!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru:=wink.png,I've only really been naked with my friends too. Don't they have saunas in Labrynna?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=embarrassed.png,Moon, we can already see...

3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;gwen:=excited.png,Oh, so there’s a good twist, right--
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,Okay so... I guess the next part is easy... unless you have a rabbit coming out or something!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;4:=excited.png,O-okay, I am kind of interesting in seeing this magic trick, if I'm being honest...
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;uravity:=embarrassed.png,Regarding, er... your questions...
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;shazza:=embarrassed.png,Shazza, you're a lot bigger in person than I expected! I just hadn't gotten the chance to say it.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;daria:=embarrassed.png,Try having two identities and a bunch of friends with crushes on each other, if you want complicated.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;kim:=confident.png,What’s the sitch Kim? Just comparing catchphrases!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;kim:=calm.png,Don’t bug out, Kim...Just compare our catchphrases!

3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight:,count-role;other&character;buffy:=wink.png,Hmm... I wonder if Buffy taught you that, or if she's just a really fast learner...
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;saki:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_date:=wink.png,S-sorry if that's a bit forward, but it's not like you haven't seen her almost naked <i>anyway</i>, so you <i>do</i> kind of owe her a date, I think!

3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;amalia:=bored.png,Forest for the trees? <i>L'anglais est tellement une langue étrange.</i>
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;sayaka:=alarmed.png,Gah! That's not supposed to be a surprise!! At-at least I put on clothes this morning before adventuring... I've... um similarly been embarrassed.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru&saidmarker;null_possess:=calm.png,If it makes you feel better, Nayru, maybe you could just consider me your friend? I mean, this was <i>quite</i> a get-to-know-you.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;sanako:=confused.png,I-I'm not sure if I should flirt or ask you to help me with my homework. This is such an uncanny feeling...
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;nagisa:=excited.png,Not weird at all. I have to yell out all sorts of things to make the Miraculous de-Akumatize people! Or put on my costume!
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;5:=alarmed.png,Oh no, Joey! I-I don't think this was supposed to be the trick! A-and where did your hair, there go?
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;gwen:=embarrassed.png,--Oh. Well, at least <i>my</i> skintight outfit is fun. And not. You know, not cannibalistic. That’d be super weird, right? Uhm. Right?
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;6:=calm.png,Phew. At least nothing went wrong, this time, and you seem to be having fun, Joey!
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;cammy:=wink.png,She's... You're so impressive, Cammy. I mean. All of you. Um. Your body. And fighting style. All of that.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;nagisa:,marker:battlecry_nagisa=confident.png,That’s impressive, I mean! You have such a good figure, Nagisa!
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;juri:=wink.png,They're surprisingly cute for a villain. Juri, when I take away your akuma, I hope you don't feel too resentful!
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;kyu:=alarmed.png,Though I’m a bit horrified to think of what powers you’d give someone.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;7:=confused.png,Well, I've kind of seen these, so I guess that's all that needs to be said...
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=confused.png,Well... this is odd, but I suppose if Nayru was okay with it, I can be too... I'd never <i>ever</i> let someone else do this to me though...
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch:=embarrassed.png,W-well they’re perky, but you can see your hair… there… and that underwear is...um...not my style.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=embarrassed.png,W-well, that's quite the chest. No wonder people always try to plunder you, Elaine.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=embarrassed.png,<i>C'est tout à fait la poitrine. Pas étonnant que les gens essayent toujours de te piller, Elaine.</i>
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;7:,count-role;other&character;meia:=alarmed.png,E-er, Sei, consider sat you’re waying-- What you’re saying to her!
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;shego:,count-role;other&character;kim:=calm.png,J-just surrender to us, not Hawk Moth. Just because Kim and I are having a crossover doesn't mean our villains need to...
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;cammy:,count-role;other&character;juri:=alarmed.png,That's so rude of you, Juri! Why are you accosting your friend like that!?
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;saki:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_date:=embarrassed.png,Um... S-sorry if matchmaking was a bit... rude of me, all things considered... I just figured you'd look cute together...
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;saki:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_date:=embarrassed.png,Um! Saki looks way cuter than she thinks she does, right? Um. ~player~? (I think she looks pretty!)
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;6:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;saki_date:=confident.png,W-well, up to you, Saki! Consider it a... um... reward! For seeing this through!
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;angie_boobs:,count-role;other&character;angie:,marker:angie_boobs=wink.png,You know, Angie, it's okay to like breasts. No need to be embarrassed.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch:,count-role;other&character;d.va:=confident.png,You know, having a really supportive suit really does help with going braless. Sorry to hear you can’t, D.Va!
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;nagisa:,count-role;self&saidmarker;marinette_ricebun:=alarmed.png,You’re bigger than I expected! This is like biting into a bun and finding a rice cracker!
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;aimee:,count-role;other&character;harley:=bored.png,You're insane. And Harley is right here, Aimee. I'm not trying to be mean but...
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-freckles&role;target:=wink.png,When you blush, your freckles really stand out, ~name~!
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-freckles&role;target:=embarrassed.png,Aww, ~name~ has ladybug spots too! Just, more freckly and less costumey.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-pierced_nipples&role;target:=confused.png,Ow! ~name~, doesn't that... well, it's not like my ears hurt but... sat's po tensitive! That's such a sensitive area!
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-pierced_nipples&role;target:=confused.png,Y-yikes, ~name~. That takes a lot of guts. I mean. Um. Not on your chest! B-but. Erk. N-not to my liking. Mostly.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-scarred&role;target:=bored.png,Oh ~name~... I'm sorry, whatever happened to you, I wish I could lucky charm it away...
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-scarred&role;target:=bored.png,~name~, your scars look really cool, actually! I-I know that might not make them less... you know, personal. But they're part of you, and I think that's respectable.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;april&stage;3:=excited.png,Donnie? Oh! You have someone special?
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;shantae:=alarmed.png,Maybe your dance is just so distracting that I dreamed the whole conversation up?
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;uravity:=wink.png,No extra bug heroes yet! But it’s always great to meet new teammates!
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;uravity:=embarrassed.png,Er, cat-themed you say? I think one cat-themed superhero is enough for my life.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;palutena:=excited.png,Oh! I wasn’t expecting...After the belts...Wow. I can see why the statues in your likeness have so many references to heavenly spheres.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;palutena:=embarrassed.png,Oh, don’t be so ashamed. We’re all here having fun, Palutena. There’s nothing wrong with nudity… Except the staring. And embarrassment. Okay, I’m sorry.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;felicia:=alarmed.png,Uh-hm. When I said I worked with another kitty, I did mean another person. N-not something else.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;felicia:=embarrassed.png,Um... S-sorry Felicia, you look <i>vaguely</i> like someone I've spent a lot of time with... Just... Female and not dark.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika:=wink.png,Um… I commend you for keeping the mask on, though. Is that for a secret identity, or just dedication to your craft?
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;uravity:,count-role;other&character;gwen:=wink.png,I have a feeling I’ll be making a new teammate after this game, actually... I think she’s more arachnid themed, though!
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;angie_boobs:,count-role;other&character;angie:,marker:angie_boobs=wink.png,You know, Angie, it's okay to like breasts. No need to be embarrassed.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;uravity:,count-role;other&character;blake:=alarmed.png,You know, I think I could do to meet new cat-themed superheroes… just to compare them to my Cat Noir. N-not <i>mine</i> mine, mind mew. Erk--
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-freckles&role;target:=wink.png,When you blush, your freckles really stand out, ~name~!
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-freckles&role;target:=embarrassed.png,Aww, ~name~ has ladybug spots too! Just, more freckly and less costumey.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-huge_breasts&role;target:=embarrassed.png,E-erk? ~name~? W-w-whay!? I-I mean, w-what!?
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-huge_breasts&role;target:=alarmed.png,Y-yikes. D-do you ever worry about smothering people when you sleep with them!?
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-pierced_nipples&role;target:=confused.png,Ow! ~name~, doesn't that... well, it's not like my ears hurt but... sat's po tensitive! That's such a sensitive area!

3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;saki:=embarrassed.png,(I just feel a strong urge to protect her... Especially now...)
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;saki:=embarrassed.png,(I feel such a strong need to protect Saki...)
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;daria:=embarrassed.png,(I'm kind of hoping I get to see it, she's been teasing herself for a while...)
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;kyu:=embarrassed.png,But I can’t help but feel it’d be uniquely confident to wear a pair of butterfly underwear like that!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;cammy:=alarmed.png,Cammy! Why do they keep attacking you!?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;palutena:=embarrassed.png,D-did you mean to imply you drop them for other people? O-or mostly just yourself?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;juri:=embarrassed.png,E-er. I guess you really are from Korea!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;other&character;zone-tan&stage;2:,marker:ztentacles=embarrassed.png,I can imagine more fun things to do involving that than… I-I mean not personally but… Um…!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;kyoko:=embarrassed.png,I have a really bad feeling that you'd be a very strong supervillain... I-I think I should help you unwind before you get too stressed!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;dawn&stage;7:=bored.png,I mean, most people already know they’re supposed to match... Mine does, obviously...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=embarrassed.png,I um. Think your friendship reminds me of Cat Noir and his kwami. They seem to argue a bit more than Tikki and I.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;felicia:=embarrassed.png,I-I appreciate few yallowing--- You following the rules, Felicia, b-but it's just kind of... Not what I was expecting!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;ann:=alarmed.png,I-I mean if it is, that's great. People like to ask about mine a lot.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;uravity:=wink.png,It must be super cool to be able to fly or float like you do!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru&saidmarker;null_possess:=wink.png,Just keep a brave face, okay, Nayru?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;kimberly:=embarrassed.png,Kimberly, I know we just met but... I've never seen tan lines on someone's... you know. I-I hope it doesn't cross a line if I look!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;launch:=alarmed.png,Launch matches... um... between sneezes... (She doesn't seem <i>too</i> akumatizable, just... irritated...)
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch:=excited.png,Oh my! That’s definitely magic I’ve never seen!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;blackrose:=confident.png,Oh! Blackrose, I-I know it’s hard to lose but, hopefully whatever you have is particularly um...exotic?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;sayori:=confident.png,O-oh, well, I wouldn't stare! But I think it's great you're happy with your appearance like this! I like to groom, but I think I get really self-conscious about how I look. I'm proud for you, Sayori!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=excited.png,O-oh. W-well, this is a nice view, even if <i>I'm</i> not a fan of that style of underwear...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=excited.png,Y-you know, I have to say, I'm understanding the appeal of that kind of underwear...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=excited.png,At least it's not <i>entirely</i> up your butt, Elaine.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;red:=excited.png,Or is it something like my earrings? <i>What?</i> Is your <i>sword</i> a Miraculous!?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska:=bored.png,Or you could roll the die again. I really hope you're not just resetting your clothes...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska:=bored.png,Just for your consideration: having good luck means <i>not</i> needing to rely on it...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;sola:=embarrassed.png,Sola, I'm sorry that my original question about the matching is going to be answered... please don't hex me.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight:=confused.png,T-Twilight, usually that's something that comes off last!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight:=alarmed.png,W-wait everyone will be able to see your-
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;navi:=embarrassed.png,Um, er, no, not, what you're-- about-- no, I mean, the literal--
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;sayaka:=embarrassed.png,Um, Sayaka, I don't think I've ever faced an akuma like this before. Maybe witches are much scarier...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika:=embarrassed.png,Um. Just less while naked.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;shimakaze:=embarrassed.png,Um... is... all this talk about taking on water... a euphemism, Shimakaze? It's... very elaborate.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;elizabeth:=alarmed.png,Wait I meant running! Oh no, you'll be doing both soon, argh! I'm so sorry!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;gwen:=embarrassed.png,What?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;nagisa:=wink.png,W-what, of course you’re cute!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;nagisa:=embarrassed.png,A-as a friend, court you’re of yute! I- I’m. Er..
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;aimee:=alarmed.png,Y-you're really going to just? Wearing so little?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;cammy:,count-role;other&character;chun-li:=alarmed.png,...! I-I...!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;natsuki:,count-role;other&character;monika:,marker:trapsuki=alarmed.png,E-er, what is it you're implying about Natsuki, Monika...?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;blake:,count-role;other&character;yang&stage;8-10:=alarmed.png,I know you aren’t a fan of… Um… Chat… Jokes, Blake…
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch:,count-role;other&character;hermione:=wink.png,Oh! So like how Hermione has been removing her small stuff. It’s… Interesting you saved it for last!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;yang:,count-role;other&character;blake&stage;8-10:=embarrassed.png,So, Blake… Um… Shaves… Her… Chat…
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;neo:,count-role;other&character;yang&stage;8-10:=embarrassed.png,Um. Yang, does Neo hate you, or… Like you?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight:,count-role;other&character;nagisa:=embarrassed.png,U-uh, Nagisa, shouldn't we tell Twilight not to...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;d.va&saidmarker;d.va_high_score:,count-role;other&character;moon:=confused.png,Wait, is the goal of this game to get naked fastest? Is that why Moon plays like she does?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;palutena:,count-role;other&character;lyn:=embarrassed.png,Well, two green haired women... Do your... You know... erm, match?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,priority:306,count-role;target&character;d.va&saidmarker;d.va_high_score:,count-exposed:1-2=bored.png,U-uhm. D.Va, it’s only the high score if you’re winning, right? I don’t really think... Er... Maybe you’re playing another game?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,priority:36,count-bodysuit:2,count-bodysuit:3,count-bodysuit:4,count-role;self&saidmarker;bodysuit:,count-exposed:2-4=embarrassed.png,Um…~name~, do you shave? I get a feeling I’m the only person with a body suit who… Doesn’t.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-rwby&role;target:=embarrassed.png,I heard a rumor from a friend that you all shave down there... Is that like, a bonding experience?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-thong&role;target:=bored.png,At least you'll be out of your thong, ~name~. That <i>can't</i> be comfortable.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-thong&role;target:=confused.png,I think thongs are just... super uncomfortable. But no panty lines... I think I'd have a bigger issue with that if not for my costume.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-thong&role;target:=alarmed.png,At least you don't have to wear your thong anymore, ~name~. How a day-long wedgie is at all comfortable is beyond me.
3-female_crotch_is_visible=embarrassed.png,Oh, I do mine a little differently--I mean, uh, never mind, look at her!
3-female_crotch_is_visible=excited.png,See! It matches for people with non-typical hair colors too!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;aimee:=confused.png,... Did you just... Climax... ?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=alarmed.png,<i>C'est tout à fait le cul!</i>
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=alarmed.png,Quite the tattoo, Elaine! You must've had it for a long time!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;kyu:=confident.png,After the game, would you show me where you got those? Or maybe, I could trade you? I bet I could fit!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;lilith:=embarrassed.png,But your tattoos are cool! W-wait, you didn’t think I meant your... piercings or... your... uhm, patterning…
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=alarmed.png,E-er... I think it's okay to be excited. I-I mean, it's only natural. Not weird. O-or anything like that. S-so, just yenjoy ourself-- enjoy yourself, Nayru!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;meia:,marker:unusual_blue_hair=bored.png,Er. I’m still not used to seeing women bare like this. It’s unusual to see blue hair in the first place so…
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;corrin_f:=alarmed.png,Goodness. Don't you fight a lot of battles? How on earth do you have time to maintain something like that?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;corrin_f:=confused.png,U-uhm. Corrin, with your ears, should I believe that all of your people look like that... or?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;sola:=alarmed.png,Hex, Sola! I-I'm not quite ready f-for whatever you thought I was suggesting even though I'm... In... this game...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;5:=alarmed.png,H-hey! You can't do that! No fair!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;futaba:=alarmed.png,I can't believe you didn't wear underwear!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;kimberly:=excited.png,I tend to prefer lots of sunblock, but that looks <i>super</i> cool, Kimberly! I'll have to try the look. We even... um, trim the same!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;dawn:=embarrassed.png,I-Eep. I’m going to stop talking now.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;palutena:=alarmed.png,I-I suppose a memory is words a thousand worths. Worth a thousand words!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;kyoko:=alarmed.png,I-I'm not saying I'll, I just meant that you, I mean, uhm. Want to try on a Miraculous instead? Maybe... a spider, for making connections?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;navi:=alarmed.png,I'm really awkward about this, I can't think about you except how much you remind me of Tikki and it's so <i>weird</i>!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;cammy:=embarrassed.png,I'm so sorry your clothes keep getting damaged. If um. You want, after this, I can loan you some of my stuff? Because we match! In... various ways!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;uravity:=alarmed.png,It makes your breasts look stunning too! Er, you look stunned, um… erk-- j-just keep at it, Ochako!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;lux:=wink.png,It’s not supposed to match for blondes, is it? So that’s pretty normal. The contrast is pretty striking, given your light magic. Looks like you have a dark spot after all!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;natsuki:=wink.png,Just like my friend Alyx! She also has pink hair. And um, grooms like you do.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;alpha:,marker:smooth_criminal=wink.png,Looks like you were struck by a <i>smooth</i> criminal.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika:=confident.png,Maybe after this, you could show me some grappling stuff, huh, Mika?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;ruby:=wink.png,Oh, I see at least the leader does what she wants.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru&saidmarker;null_possess:=excited.png,Oh, what a relief! We have the same style--of um. You know! I think you must've just trimmed fresh today, though, <i>oui</i>?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;ann:=embarrassed.png,Oh. I see that it is. W-well! It adds a new element to your career! U-uhm. I mean, in modeling. Not this.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;sayaka:=alarmed.png,O-oh! You're... so hairy! I make sure to trim, most of the time, anyway... er... not that anyone needed to know that...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;daria:=bored.png,O-oh. Well, that trick again. I see. Well played, Daria.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;nagisa:=confident.png,Stay with it, Nagisa. If you don’t give up, you might lose, but you’re not defeated!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;annie:=wink.png,Tell me about it, Annie. There’s just not enough hours in the day… But I find that spending time in the shower to trim and groom. If you feel good, and look good, you can do your best!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight:=alarmed.png,That’s definitely not human behavior! Are you a giant Kwami, or something else?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;red:=wink.png,The Kwami inside seems to know you pretty well. It’s weird that you haven’t transformed yet, though.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;gwen:=alarmed.png,Um. I don’t like the sound of this...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;juri:=alarmed.png,U-uhm. Y-you're just very hairy! Most European girls I know um. Take care of that in other ways.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;videl:=confused.png,U-um. I think I have some questions about why you do that. You know. As a fighter.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;raven:=embarrassed.png,We’re both mixed women, we both fight evil, we both like bodysuits... We both don’t... shave our... er... nevermind.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch:=embarrassed.png,Well, that’s not true, my costume just vanishes when I run out of force...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;blackrose:=alarmed.png,Whoa. I haven’t… Erm, seen many, but that’s particularly pretty!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;streaming-chan&stage;7:=alarmed.png,W-wait, you removed your clothes instead of that hat and camera?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;felicia:=confident.png,W-well, I'm sure your partners will appreciate that, anyway...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;shimakaze:=wink.png,W-well, less elaborate than how you groom, I suppose.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;launch:=embarrassed.png,W-well, that's... half of the question answered, I suppose.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;saki:=alarmed.png,W-wow, you sure are hairy, Saki! (Oh come on, Marinette!)
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;saki:=alarmed.png,W-well, I think we all see you now, Saki! (Marinette, that's not what you should've said!)
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=bored.png,Yikes. That looks rode hard and put away… um… Wet. I believe is the expression.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=alarmed.png,You can climax just by… Thinking? Now <i>That’s</i> a superpower.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;other&character;mulan&saidmarker;duel_lost:=wink.png,You mentioned a spirit guide… and you're from what seems to be Ancient China… do you know anything about the Miraculouses?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska:=confused.png,You're... You're sad. You're just <i>so</i> sad, Vriska. Come here and let me break your die, and just de-Akumatize you already.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska:=confused.png,I'm sorry, Vriska. But you really should just quit.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch:,count-role;other&character;hermione&stage;9-10:=confused.png,A-are you also going to use magic to do… Um… What she did?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;yang:,count-role;other&character;blake&stage;8-10:=alarmed.png,D-does that make it easier for you two to… You know? Soixante neuf?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;juri:,count-role;other&character;d.va&stage;6-8:,marker:korean_trends=embarrassed.png,Er... Hana, does yours... er... get that hairy when you don't shave? Or is Juri just out of touch with Korean beauty trends?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;palutena:,count-role;other&character;lyn:=bored.png,Oh. Well, that’s one way of being unique.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;blake:,count-role;other&character;yang&stage;8-10:=alarmed.png,O-oh I was expecting to say you had a… ah, fuzzy… B-but I guess this way you don’t get hair in each other’s mouths?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;cammy:,count-role;other&character;chun-li:=embarrassed.png,Ow! I don't think I'd let a friend help me undress like that! (Yikes...)
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;hotsprings:,count-role;other&character;sheena&stage;8-10:,marker:hotsprings=embarrassed.png,Sheena, you mean explored as in… The area--The area of the water and rocks, not, all of us girls, right?

3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-dark-skinned&role;target:=excited.png,Oh, wow, you really look cool, ~name~!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-hairy&role;target:=alarmed.png,T-that’s very... Eastern of you, both European and otherwise.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-shaved&role;target:=confused.png,Ow, that seems like it would hurt a lot to maintain.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-trimmed&role;target:=excited.png,Oh, maybe I’ll try that style!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7,alsoPlaying:lyn=excited.png,See! It matches for people with non-typical hair colors too!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7,alsoPlaying:palutena=excited.png,See! It matches for people with non-typical hair colors too!

4-male_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;pit:=embarrassed.png,I-I won't look too closely. I-it's not like you're a statue for me to study. Though... Have I seen you carved in marble <i>somewhere</i>?
4-male_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;jin:=calm.png,Okay, we get it, your body's amazing and--
4-male_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;pit:,count-role;other&character;palutena:=excited.png,You two are such a good team!

4-male_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-dark-skinned&role;target:=embarrassed.png,You're lucky to have such a nice complexion! I bet it makes it easy to get a lot of sun! N-not that you would without your ~clothing~, of course!
4-male_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-fair-skinned&role;target:=wink.png,Your skin looks so healthy! Do you use cosmetics, or are you just lucky like that?
4-male_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-green_eyes&role;target:=embarrassed.png,Mmm... S-sorry ~name~. I just really like people with green eyes... Like Adrien... E-er, s-sorry, gack to the bame! B-back to the game!
4-male_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-green_eyes&role;target:=embarrassed.png,O-oh! Those eyes remind me of-- W-well, you probably know who they remind me of, to be honest.
4-male_chest_will_be_visible,count-mystery_inc&role;target:=calm.png,~name~, I get the feeling you’re used to unraveling mysteries of the supernatural variety... Like your current outfit, maybe there’s more than it seems?
4-male_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-pale_eyes&role;target:=embarrassed.png,Huh. I don't think I've seen eyes that color before. N-not in person, anyway.
4-male_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-pale-skinned&role;target:=embarrassed.png,Hm... You really don't see a lot of sun, do you, ~name~?
4-male_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-pale-skinned&role;target:=confused.png,I-I'm not going to lie, pale skin kind of... Makes me a little worried you'll be super creepy, ~name~.
4-male_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-red_eyes&role;target:=alarmed.png,I feel bad for you, ~name~. Red's not a typical eye color. E-er that's not why I feel bad. You losing your... Um... Anyway.
4-male_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-red_eyes&role;target:=embarrassed.png,You know, ~name~, I was kinda worried that red eyes would mean you were something evil... But you're not <i>so</i> bad.
4-male_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-unusual_skin&role;target:=excited.png,I'm... Not going to lie, ~name~, I've... Um. Well, your skin color is usually only common to akuma victims. Since you're in control of yourself... It's kinda... Hot.
4-male_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-unusual_skin&role;target:=embarrassed.png,W-well. ~name~, you're n-not really from my normal palette when it comes to designing clothes...
4-male_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-violet_eyes&role;target:=embarrassed.png,Violet is such a cool eye color! You get the best of blue while still seeing wider color palettes. Um. Or so I learned in school.
4-male_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;jin:=embarrassed.png,O-oh. Oh goodness. Th-that's quite impressive. D-did you just throw hands to get to this point?
4-male_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;pit:=excited.png,Well, you can add me to the list that like your build, Pit. <i>Tres beau!</i>
4-male_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;6:=alarmed.png,You’re really going to hold onto that shield until the very end, aren’t you, Steve? The way you hold it makes your muscles look great! J-just so you know!
4-male_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;pit:,count-role;other&character;palutena:=confident.png,Wow! I'd go to battle for that chest! Um. Against Hawk Moth's akuma. To keep people safe. <i>Oui</i>.

4-male_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-scarred&role;target:=bored.png,Oh ~name~... I'm sorry, whatever happened to you, I wish I could lucky charm it away...
4-male_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-scarred&role;target:=bored.png,~name~, your scars look really cool, actually! I-I know that might not make them less... you know, personal. But they're part of you, and I think that's respectable.
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;captain_america:,marker:normandie=calm.png,I’d let him storm <i>my</i> Normandy.
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;pit:=embarrassed.png,Um! I'll-- Um! I-I'm actually really excited to see this.
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;pit:=wink.png,Show me what you have, hero.
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;jin:=wink.png,W-well, it would be a shame, but I guess you couldn't be so <i>cocky</i> anymore.
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;corrin_m:=embarrassed.png,You say this Camilla is your wife? She must be a very patient woman!
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;pit:,count-role;other&character;palutena:=alarmed.png,O-oh. Oh no, I have very much misinterpreted this relationship. I am so sorry.
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-large_penis&role;target:,count-role;other&character;aella:=embarrassed.png,Um. Aella, I feel like we're due for a random encounter soon. It looks like it's going to be a big one...
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-large_penis&role;target:=embarrassed.png,S-surely you're hiding something else in your ~clothing~, ~name~! T-this is a joke, right?
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-medium_penis&role;target:=bored.png,W-well, don't you look aroused at the prospect of getting naked in front of strangers...
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-small_penis&role;target:=confused.png,Bye bye... um... <i>little</i> butterfly?
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-small_penis&role;target:=excited.png,Way to keep your composure, ~name~! It's still so compact!
4-male_small_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;corrin_m:=bored.png,Um. I suppose style and skill count for more? You’re not my type, Corrin, but you should be proud of who you are!
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;pit:=alarmed.png,Hm... I think I see a powerup I know <i>I</i> wouldn't mind getting familiar with. E-er. It's over there! Behind Pit's... That's why I'm staring! W-where I'm staring!
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,priority:0,count-circumcised&role;target:=confused.png,Um... I think I've seen this in... E-er... Design media. B-but never in person. Not like <i>~name~'s,</i> anyway.
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,priority:0,count-uncircumcised&role;target:=confused.png,U-um. N-not that it looks weird, it's just-- I wasn't-- Um. This is a bit strange to me, here, is all.
4-male_large_crotch_is_visible,count-role;other&character;nagisa:,marker:ztentacles=alarmed.png,I-I wouldn’t follow that line of logic if I were, Nagisa! I’ve heard that Japanese schoolgirls are very vulnerable to those kinds of things!
4-male_large_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;captain_america:=alarmed.png,Oh. My. God. Wait. Wait! Did I say that <i>out loud?</i> In <i>English</i>? Um! Can everyone just forget they heard that! P-please?
4-male_large_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;jin:=embarrassed.png,W-well, I-I guess some powers have very impractical applications. Y-yikes, t-that's--!
4-male_large_crotch_is_visible,count-role;other&character;aella:=wink.png,You know, Aella, I think you're the only woman I've met who could handle something like that. Um. Without breaking, anyway.
4-male_large_crotch_is_visible,count-huge_penis&role;target:=alarmed.png,N-no! T-that's-- That's far too large!
4-male_large_crotch_is_visible,count-huge_penis&role;target:=alarmed.png,E-er, how <i>big</i> are the women where you're from <i>~name~</i>!
4-female_chest_will_be_visible=embarrassed.png,Nothing to be ashamed of... You for being undressed, me for... watching out for you.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible=confused.png,O-or maybe you're the imposter? I <i>really</i> never liked illusion powers.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;juri&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,(<i>Oh dear. I kind of want to see them... she's just... </i>so<i> forward!</i>)
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska:=confused.png,(I know what it's like to have a bunch of magic you aren't sure what to do with... I should try and be a little nicer, if just to make her lower her guard so I can break that die of hers and release the akuma.)
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska:=confused.png,(She puts up a tough act. But she's probably just scared and really insecure... I can't even tell if she's Akumatized. I mostly just... Feel bad for her. I should be a little nicer.)
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;sanako:=wink.png,As long as you don't leave things in the oven too long, I can see people liking fluffy pastries like those, Sanako!
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika:=embarrassed.png,At least I had clothes on underneath…
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=confused.png,Did someone shame you for your body? Is that why you're like this?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=alarmed.png,E-er, did you just... Slice that pretty set of underwear?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=alarmed.png,Um! I'm glad you didn't hurt him, but you've hurt your bra, Elaine!
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;felicia:=embarrassed.png,H-hey! Sait a wecond! W-wait a second! Were you naked this whole time!?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;felicia:=embarrassed.png,H-hold on there, Felicia! W-what are you--?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;navi:=alarmed.png,Hmm... And to think, I've offered to make her clothes so many times...
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight:=confident.png,Hmm... That's an interesting trick, Twilight. I'm glad you're staying modest!

4-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;4:=confident.png,I guess you could say you missed the forest for the leaves!
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;kyu:=embarrassed.png,I mean, because that’s how I activate and deactivate my costume…
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;cammy:=confused.png,I really want to help! But they're all so fast! Poor Cammy!
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;6:=wink.png,I wonder if it's a French thing...
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;shantae:=alarmed.png,I’m sorry, it seems you… Um, have gotten rather naked.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;shimakaze:=embarrassed.png,I-I hope that my Lucky Charm can save you if this--
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=alarmed.png,I-I really don't think you should be destroying her clothing, though! It's not super fancy, but that doesn't mean it's not without value!
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;ayano:=alarmed.png,Is... IS THAT BLOOD?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;ayano:=alarmed.png,That’s blood, isn’t it? Possessed or not, you need to be stopped, Ayano! You’re insane! I won’t let you win!
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru:=wink.png,I've only really been naked with my friends too. Don't they have saunas in Labrynna?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=embarrassed.png,Moon, we can already see...

4-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;gwen:=excited.png,Oh, so there’s a good twist, right--
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,Okay so... I guess the next part is easy... unless you have a rabbit coming out or something!
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;4:=excited.png,O-okay, I am kind of interesting in seeing this magic trick, if I'm being honest...
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;uravity:=embarrassed.png,Regarding, er... your questions...
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;shazza:=embarrassed.png,Shazza, you're a lot bigger in person than I expected! I just hadn't gotten the chance to say it.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;daria:=embarrassed.png,Try having two identities and a bunch of friends with crushes on each other, if you want complicated.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;kim:=confident.png,What’s the sitch Kim? Just comparing catchphrases!
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;kim:=calm.png,Don’t bug out, Kim...Just compare our catchphrases!
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;nagisa:=wink.png,Wow, your uniform is surprisingly… Compressive. I-Impressive?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,You can say that again. I know probably <i>un peu trop dans ce moi</i> costume.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;yang:=alarmed.png,You're really confusing, Yang. You seem to be able to really have a lot of fun, but you aren't obnoxious...
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;kimberly:=embarrassed.png,Y-yeah. At least your tanlines are cute!
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;5:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;saki_date:=wink.png,(No vous sente pas gene!) How about we go shopping? You seem to care a lot about your school uniform, but maybe there's other cute clothes you'd like?

4-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight:,count-role;other&character;buffy:=wink.png,Hmm... I wonder if Buffy taught you that, or if she's just a really fast learner...
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;saki:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_date:=wink.png,S-sorry if that's a bit forward, but it's not like you haven't seen her almost naked <i>anyway</i>, so you <i>do</i> kind of owe her a date, I think!

4-female_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-violet_eyes&role;target:=embarrassed.png,Violet is such a cool eye color! You get the best of blue while still seeing wider color palettes. Um. Or so I learned in school.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:ruby=confused.png,O-or maybe you're the imposter? I <i>really</i> never liked illusion powers.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:yang=confused.png,O-or maybe you're the imposter? I <i>really</i> never liked illusion powers.

4-female_small_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-scarred&role;target:=bored.png,Oh ~name~... I'm sorry, whatever happened to you, I wish I could lucky charm it away...
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-scarred&role;target:=bored.png,~name~, your scars look really cool, actually! I-I know that might not make them less... you know, personal. But they're part of you, and I think that's respectable.

4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru&saidmarker;null_possess:=calm.png,If it makes you feel better, Nayru, maybe you could just consider me your friend? I mean, this was <i>quite</i> a get-to-know-you.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;sanako:=confused.png,I-I'm not sure if I should flirt or ask you to help me with my homework. This is such an uncanny feeling...
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;nagisa:=excited.png,Not weird at all. I have to yell out all sorts of things to make the Miraculous de-Akumatize people! Or put on my costume!
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;5:=alarmed.png,Oh no, Joey! I-I don't think this was supposed to be the trick! A-and where did your hair, there go?

4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;juri:=wink.png,They're surprisingly cute for a villain. Juri, when I take away your akuma, I hope you don't feel too resentful!
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;kyu:=alarmed.png,Though I’m a bit horrified to think of what powers you’d give someone.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;7:=confused.png,Well, I've kind of seen these, so I guess that's all that needs to be said...
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=confused.png,Well... this is odd, but I suppose if Nayru was okay with it, I can be too... I'd never <i>ever</i> let someone else do this to me though...
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch:=embarrassed.png,W-well they’re perky, but you can see your hair… there… and that underwear is...um...not my style.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=embarrassed.png,W-well, that's quite the chest. No wonder people always try to plunder you, Elaine.

4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;cammy:,count-role;other&character;juri:=alarmed.png,That's so rude of you, Juri! Why are you accosting your friend like that!?

4-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;yang:=embarrassed.png,I-I'm a bit jealous your figure and personality and friendships come so easily, is all.
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;shantae:=alarmed.png,Maybe your dance is just so distracting that I dreamed the whole conversation up?
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;uravity:=wink.png,No extra bug heroes yet! But it’s always great to meet new teammates!
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;uravity:=embarrassed.png,Er, cat-themed you say? I think one cat-themed superhero is enough for my life.

4-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;felicia:=embarrassed.png,Um... S-sorry Felicia, you look <i>vaguely</i> like someone I've spent a lot of time with... Just... Female and not dark.
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika:=wink.png,Um… I commend you for keeping the mask on, though. Is that for a secret identity, or just dedication to your craft?

4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,priority:306,count-role;target&character;d.va&saidmarker;d.va_high_score:,count-exposed:1-2=bored.png,U-uhm. D.Va, it’s only the high score if you’re winning, right? I don’t really think... Er... Maybe you’re playing another game?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,priority:36,count-bodysuit:2,count-bodysuit:3,count-bodysuit:4,count-role;self&saidmarker;bodysuit:,count-exposed:2-4=embarrassed.png,Um…~name~, do you shave? I get a feeling I’m the only person with a body suit who… Doesn’t.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-rwby&role;target:=embarrassed.png,I heard a rumor from a friend that you all shave down there... Is that like, a bonding experience?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-thong&role;target:=bored.png,At least you'll be out of your thong, ~name~. That <i>can't</i> be comfortable.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-thong&role;target:=confused.png,I think thongs are just... super uncomfortable. But no panty lines... I think I'd have a bigger issue with that if not for my costume.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-thong&role;target:=alarmed.png,At least you don't have to wear your thong anymore, ~name~. How a day-long wedgie is at all comfortable is beyond me.
4-female_crotch_is_visible=embarrassed.png,Oh, I do mine a little differently--I mean, uh, never mind, look at her!
4-female_crotch_is_visible=excited.png,See! It matches for people with non-typical hair colors too!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;aimee:=confused.png,... Did you just... Climax... ?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=alarmed.png,<i>C'est tout à fait le cul!</i>
4-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=alarmed.png,Quite the tattoo, Elaine! You must've had it for a long time!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;kyu:=confident.png,After the game, would you show me where you got those? Or maybe, I could trade you? I bet I could fit!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;lilith:=embarrassed.png,But your tattoos are cool! W-wait, you didn’t think I meant your... piercings or... your... uhm, patterning…
4-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=alarmed.png,E-er... I think it's okay to be excited. I-I mean, it's only natural. Not weird. O-or anything like that. S-so, just yenjoy ourself-- enjoy yourself, Nayru!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;meia:,marker:unusual_blue_hair=bored.png,Er. I’m still not used to seeing women bare like this. It’s unusual to see blue hair in the first place so…
4-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;corrin_f:=alarmed.png,Goodness. Don't you fight a lot of battles? How on earth do you have time to maintain something like that?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;corrin_f:=confused.png,U-uhm. Corrin, with your ears, should I believe that all of your people look like that... or?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;sola:=alarmed.png,Hex, Sola! I-I'm not quite ready f-for whatever you thought I was suggesting even though I'm... In... this game...
4-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;5:=alarmed.png,H-hey! You can't do that! No fair!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;futaba:=alarmed.png,I can't believe you didn't wear underwear!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;kimberly:=excited.png,I tend to prefer lots of sunblock, but that looks <i>super</i> cool, Kimberly! I'll have to try the look. We even... um, trim the same!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;dawn:=embarrassed.png,I-Eep. I’m going to stop talking now.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;palutena:=alarmed.png,I-I suppose a memory is words a thousand worths. Worth a thousand words!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;kyoko:=alarmed.png,I-I'm not saying I'll, I just meant that you, I mean, uhm. Want to try on a Miraculous instead? Maybe... a spider, for making connections?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;navi:=alarmed.png,I'm really awkward about this, I can't think about you except how much you remind me of Tikki and it's so <i>weird</i>!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;cammy:=embarrassed.png,I'm so sorry your clothes keep getting damaged. If um. You want, after this, I can loan you some of my stuff? Because we match! In... various ways!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;uravity:=alarmed.png,It makes your breasts look stunning too! Er, you look stunned, um… erk-- j-just keep at it, Ochako!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;lux:=wink.png,It’s not supposed to match for blondes, is it? So that’s pretty normal. The contrast is pretty striking, given your light magic. Looks like you have a dark spot after all!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;natsuki:=wink.png,Just like my friend Alyx! She also has pink hair. And um, grooms like you do.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;alpha:,marker:smooth_criminal=wink.png,Looks like you were struck by a <i>smooth</i> criminal.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika:=confident.png,Maybe after this, you could show me some grappling stuff, huh, Mika?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;ruby:=wink.png,Oh, I see at least the leader does what she wants.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru&saidmarker;null_possess:=excited.png,Oh, what a relief! We have the same style--of um. You know! I think you must've just trimmed fresh today, though, <i>oui</i>?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;ann:=embarrassed.png,Oh. I see that it is. W-well! It adds a new element to your career! U-uhm. I mean, in modeling. Not this.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;sayaka:=alarmed.png,O-oh! You're... so hairy! I make sure to trim, most of the time, anyway... er... not that anyone needed to know that...
4-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;daria:=bored.png,O-oh. Well, that trick again. I see. Well played, Daria.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;nagisa:=confident.png,Stay with it, Nagisa. If you don’t give up, you might lose, but you’re not defeated!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;annie:=wink.png,Tell me about it, Annie. There’s just not enough hours in the day… But I find that spending time in the shower to trim and groom. If you feel good, and look good, you can do your best!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight:=alarmed.png,That’s definitely not human behavior! Are you a giant Kwami, or something else?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;red:=wink.png,The Kwami inside seems to know you pretty well. It’s weird that you haven’t transformed yet, though.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;gwen:=alarmed.png,Um. I don’t like the sound of this...
4-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;juri:=alarmed.png,U-uhm. Y-you're just very hairy! Most European girls I know um. Take care of that in other ways.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;videl:=confused.png,U-um. I think I have some questions about why you do that. You know. As a fighter.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;raven:=embarrassed.png,We’re both mixed women, we both fight evil, we both like bodysuits... We both don’t... shave our... er... nevermind.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch:=embarrassed.png,Well, that’s not true, my costume just vanishes when I run out of force...
4-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;blackrose:=alarmed.png,Whoa. I haven’t… Erm, seen many, but that’s particularly pretty!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;streaming-chan&stage;7:=alarmed.png,W-wait, you removed your clothes instead of that hat and camera?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;felicia:=confident.png,W-well, I'm sure your partners will appreciate that, anyway...
4-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;shimakaze:=wink.png,W-well, less elaborate than how you groom, I suppose.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;launch:=embarrassed.png,W-well, that's... half of the question answered, I suppose.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;saki:=alarmed.png,W-wow, you sure are hairy, Saki! (Oh come on, Marinette!)
4-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;saki:=alarmed.png,W-well, I think we all see you now, Saki! (Marinette, that's not what you should've said!)
4-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=bored.png,Yikes. That looks rode hard and put away… um… Wet. I believe is the expression.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=alarmed.png,You can climax just by… Thinking? Now <i>That’s</i> a superpower.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;other&character;mulan&saidmarker;duel_lost:=wink.png,You mentioned a spirit guide… and you're from what seems to be Ancient China… do you know anything about the Miraculouses?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska:=confused.png,You're... You're sad. You're just <i>so</i> sad, Vriska. Come here and let me break your die, and just de-Akumatize you already.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska:=confused.png,I'm sorry, Vriska. But you really should just quit.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch:,count-role;other&character;hermione&stage;9-10:=confused.png,A-are you also going to use magic to do… Um… What she did?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;yang:,count-role;other&character;blake&stage;8-10:=alarmed.png,D-does that make it easier for you two to… You know? Soixante neuf?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;juri:,count-role;other&character;d.va&stage;6-8:,marker:korean_trends=embarrassed.png,Er... Hana, does yours... er... get that hairy when you don't shave? Or is Juri just out of touch with Korean beauty trends?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;palutena:,count-role;other&character;lyn:=bored.png,Oh. Well, that’s one way of being unique.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;blake:,count-role;other&character;yang&stage;8-10:=alarmed.png,O-oh I was expecting to say you had a… ah, fuzzy… B-but I guess this way you don’t get hair in each other’s mouths?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;cammy:,count-role;other&character;chun-li:=embarrassed.png,Ow! I don't think I'd let a friend help me undress like that! (Yikes...)
4-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;hotsprings:,count-role;other&character;sheena&stage;8-10:,marker:hotsprings=embarrassed.png,Sheena, you mean explored as in… The area--The area of the water and rocks, not, all of us girls, right?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,count-dark-skinned&role;target:=excited.png,Oh, wow, you really look cool, ~name~!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,count-hairy&role;target:=alarmed.png,T-that’s very... Eastern of you, both European and otherwise.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,count-shaved&role;target:=confused.png,Ow, that seems like it would hurt a lot to maintain.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,count-trimmed&role;target:=excited.png,Oh, maybe I’ll try that style!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7,alsoPlaying:lyn=excited.png,See! It matches for people with non-typical hair colors too!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7,alsoPlaying:palutena=excited.png,See! It matches for people with non-typical hair colors too!

5-male_chest_will_be_visible=bored.png,Everyone can see my bust. This is way less of a big deal than you’re all making it out to be.
5-male_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;5:=alarmed.png,Huh what? Sorry, I sasn’t waring-- Wasn’t staring. Er…
5-male_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;pit:=embarrassed.png,I-I won't look too closely. I-it's not like you're a statue for me to study. Though... Have I seen you carved in marble <i>somewhere</i>?
5-male_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;jin:=calm.png,Okay, we get it, your body's amazing and--
5-male_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;pit:,count-role;other&character;palutena:=excited.png,You two are such a good team!
5-male_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-amber_eyes&role;target:=embarrassed.png,Oh... Would you look at that. Kind of like... A sunset...
5-male_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-blue_eyes&role;target:=embarrassed.png,Oh! The light just caught your eyes and-- <i>So</i> cool, ~name~. I-I hope that doesn't sound self-involved.
5-male_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-blue_eyes&role;target:=alarmed.png,Oh! Our eyes match, ~name~! I-I kind of hope our chests don't, though.
5-male_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-dark_eyes&role;target:=embarrassed.png,You have such deep, pretty eyes, ~name~! Er-- Handsome eyes! Um--! Pick which you like! J-just so you know I'm not staring at your chest!
5-male_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-dark_eyes&role;target:,marker:brown_eyes=wink.png,I heard someone say that boys love it when you show them your brown eyes! You must be really popular, ~name~!
5-male_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-dark-skinned&role;target:=excited.png,Wow, ~name~, you have a really great skin tone!
5-male_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-dark-skinned&role;target:=embarrassed.png,You're lucky to have such a nice complexion! I bet it makes it easy to get a lot of sun! N-not that you would without your ~clothing~, of course!
5-male_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-fair-skinned&role;target:=wink.png,Your skin looks so healthy! Do you use cosmetics, or are you just lucky like that?
5-male_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-green_eyes&role;target:=embarrassed.png,Mmm... S-sorry ~name~. I just really like people with green eyes... Like Adrien... E-er, s-sorry, gack to the bame! B-back to the game!
5-male_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-green_eyes&role;target:=embarrassed.png,O-oh! Those eyes remind me of-- W-well, you probably know who they remind me of, to be honest.
5-male_chest_will_be_visible,count-mystery_inc&role;target:=calm.png,~name~, I get the feeling you’re used to unraveling mysteries of the supernatural variety... Like your current outfit, maybe there’s more than it seems?
5-male_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-pale_eyes&role;target:=embarrassed.png,Huh. I don't think I've seen eyes that color before. N-not in person, anyway.
5-male_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-pale-skinned&role;target:=embarrassed.png,Hm... You really don't see a lot of sun, do you, ~name~?
5-male_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-pale-skinned&role;target:=confused.png,I-I'm not going to lie, pale skin kind of... Makes me a little worried you'll be super creepy, ~name~.
5-male_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-red_eyes&role;target:=alarmed.png,I feel bad for you, ~name~. Red's not a typical eye color. E-er that's not why I feel bad. You losing your... Um... Anyway.
5-male_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-red_eyes&role;target:=embarrassed.png,You know, ~name~, I was kinda worried that red eyes would mean you were something evil... But you're not <i>so</i> bad.
5-male_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-unusual_skin&role;target:=excited.png,I'm... Not going to lie, ~name~, I've... Um. Well, your skin color is usually only common to akuma victims. Since you're in control of yourself... It's kinda... Hot.
5-male_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-unusual_skin&role;target:=embarrassed.png,W-well. ~name~, you're n-not really from my normal palette when it comes to designing clothes...
5-male_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-violet_eyes&role;target:=embarrassed.png,Violet is such a cool eye color! You get the best of blue while still seeing wider color palettes. Um. Or so I learned in school.
5-male_chest_is_visible=embarrassed.png,Oh. W-wow that is pretty nice to see.
5-male_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;jin:=embarrassed.png,O-oh. Oh goodness. Th-that's quite impressive. D-did you just throw hands to get to this point?
5-male_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;pit:=excited.png,Well, you can add me to the list that like your build, Pit. <i>Tres beau!</i>
5-male_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;6:=alarmed.png,You’re really going to hold onto that shield until the very end, aren’t you, Steve? The way you hold it makes your muscles look great! J-just so you know!
5-male_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;pit:,count-role;other&character;palutena:=confident.png,Wow! I'd go to battle for that chest! Um. Against Hawk Moth's akuma. To keep people safe. <i>Oui</i>.
5-male_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-freckles&role;target:=wink.png,When you blush, your freckles really stand out, ~name~!
5-male_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-freckles&role;target:=embarrassed.png,Aww, ~name~ has ladybug spots too! Just, more freckly and less costumey.
5-male_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-pierced_nipples&role;target:=confused.png,Ow! ~name~, doesn't that... well, it's not like my ears hurt but... sat's po tensitive! That's such a sensitive area!
5-male_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-pierced_nipples&role;target:=confused.png,Y-yikes, ~name~. That takes a lot of guts. I mean. Um. Not on your chest! B-but. Erk. N-not to my liking. Mostly.
5-male_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-scarred&role;target:=bored.png,Oh ~name~... I'm sorry, whatever happened to you, I wish I could lucky charm it away...
5-male_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-scarred&role;target:=bored.png,~name~, your scars look really cool, actually! I-I know that might not make them less... you know, personal. But they're part of you, and I think that's respectable.
5-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;captain_america:,marker:normandie=calm.png,I’d let him storm <i>my</i> Normandy.
5-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;pit:=embarrassed.png,Um! I'll-- Um! I-I'm actually really excited to see this.
5-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;pit:=wink.png,Show me what you have, hero.
5-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;jin:=wink.png,W-well, it would be a shame, but I guess you couldn't be so <i>cocky</i> anymore.
5-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;corrin_m:=embarrassed.png,You say this Camilla is your wife? She must be a very patient woman!
5-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;pit:,count-role;other&character;palutena:=alarmed.png,O-oh. Oh no, I have very much misinterpreted this relationship. I am so sorry.
5-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-large_penis&role;target:,count-role;other&character;aella:=embarrassed.png,Um. Aella, I feel like we're due for a random encounter soon. It looks like it's going to be a big one...
5-male_crotch_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-large_penis&role;target:=embarrassed.png,S-surely you're hiding something else in your ~clothing~, ~name~! T-this is a joke, right?
5-male_crotch_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-medium_penis&role;target:=bored.png,W-well, don't you look aroused at the prospect of getting naked in front of strangers...
5-male_crotch_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-small_penis&role;target:=confused.png,Bye bye... um... <i>little</i> butterfly?
5-male_crotch_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-small_penis&role;target:=excited.png,Way to keep your composure, ~name~! It's still so compact!
5-male_small_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;corrin_m:=bored.png,Um. I suppose style and skill count for more? You’re not my type, Corrin, but you should be proud of who you are!
5-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;pit:=alarmed.png,Hm... I think I see a powerup I know <i>I</i> wouldn't mind getting familiar with. E-er. It's over there! Behind Pit's... That's why I'm staring! W-where I'm staring!
5-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,priority:0,count-circumcised&role;target:=confused.png,Um... I think I've seen this in... E-er... Design media. B-but never in person. Not like <i>~name~'s,</i> anyway.
5-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,priority:0,count-uncircumcised&role;target:=confused.png,U-um. N-not that it looks weird, it's just-- I wasn't-- Um. This is a bit strange to me, here, is all.
5-male_large_crotch_is_visible,count-role;other&character;nagisa:,marker:ztentacles=alarmed.png,I-I wouldn’t follow that line of logic if I were, Nagisa! I’ve heard that Japanese schoolgirls are very vulnerable to those kinds of things!
5-male_large_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;captain_america:=alarmed.png,Oh. My. God. Wait. Wait! Did I say that <i>out loud?</i> In <i>English</i>? Um! Can everyone just forget they heard that! P-please?
5-male_large_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;jin:=embarrassed.png,W-well, I-I guess some powers have very impractical applications. Y-yikes, t-that's--!
5-male_large_crotch_is_visible,count-role;other&character;aella:=wink.png,You know, Aella, I think you're the only woman I've met who could handle something like that. Um. Without breaking, anyway.
5-male_large_crotch_is_visible,count-huge_penis&role;target:=alarmed.png,N-no! T-that's-- That's far too large!
5-male_large_crotch_is_visible,count-huge_penis&role;target:=alarmed.png,E-er, how <i>big</i> are the women where you're from <i>~name~</i>!
5-female_chest_will_be_visible=confident.png,Mine might be small but they’re up to the test...
5-female_chest_will_be_visible=confused.png,O-or maybe you're the imposter? I <i>really</i> never liked illusion powers.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;juri&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,(<i>Oh dear. I kind of want to see them... she's just... </i>so<i> forward!</i>)
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska:=confused.png,(I know what it's like to have a bunch of magic you aren't sure what to do with... I should try and be a little nicer, if just to make her lower her guard so I can break that die of hers and release the akuma.)
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska:=confused.png,(She puts up a tough act. But she's probably just scared and really insecure... I can't even tell if she's Akumatized. I mostly just... Feel bad for her. I should be a little nicer.)
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;sanako:=wink.png,As long as you don't leave things in the oven too long, I can see people liking fluffy pastries like those, Sanako!
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika:=embarrassed.png,At least I had clothes on underneath…
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=confused.png,Did someone shame you for your body? Is that why you're like this?
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=alarmed.png,E-er, did you just... Slice that pretty set of underwear?
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=alarmed.png,Um! I'm glad you didn't hurt him, but you've hurt your bra, Elaine!
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;felicia:=embarrassed.png,H-hey! Sait a wecond! W-wait a second! Were you naked this whole time!?
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;felicia:=embarrassed.png,H-hold on there, Felicia! W-what are you--?
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;navi:=alarmed.png,Hmm... And to think, I've offered to make her clothes so many times...
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight:=confident.png,Hmm... That's an interesting trick, Twilight. I'm glad you're staying modest!
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;aimee:=excited.png,I-
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;aimee:=bored.png,Again!?
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;4:=confident.png,I guess you could say you missed the forest for the leaves!
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;kyu:=embarrassed.png,I mean, because that’s how I activate and deactivate my costume…
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;cammy:=confused.png,I really want to help! But they're all so fast! Poor Cammy!
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;6:=wink.png,I wonder if it's a French thing...
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;shantae:=alarmed.png,I’m sorry, it seems you… Um, have gotten rather naked.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;shimakaze:=embarrassed.png,I-I hope that my Lucky Charm can save you if this--
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=alarmed.png,I-I really don't think you should be destroying her clothing, though! It's not super fancy, but that doesn't mean it's not without value!
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;ayano:=alarmed.png,Is... IS THAT BLOOD?
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;ayano:=alarmed.png,That’s blood, isn’t it? Possessed or not, you need to be stopped, Ayano! You’re insane! I won’t let you win!
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru:=wink.png,I've only really been naked with my friends too. Don't they have saunas in Labrynna?
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=embarrassed.png,Moon, we can already see...
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch:=wink.png,Oh! I do. Your breasts are--
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;gwen:=excited.png,Oh, so there’s a good twist, right--
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,Okay so... I guess the next part is easy... unless you have a rabbit coming out or something!
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;4:=excited.png,O-okay, I am kind of interesting in seeing this magic trick, if I'm being honest...
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;uravity:=embarrassed.png,Regarding, er... your questions...
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;shazza:=embarrassed.png,Shazza, you're a lot bigger in person than I expected! I just hadn't gotten the chance to say it.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;daria:=embarrassed.png,Try having two identities and a bunch of friends with crushes on each other, if you want complicated.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;kim:=confident.png,What’s the sitch Kim? Just comparing catchphrases!
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;kim:=calm.png,Don’t bug out, Kim...Just compare our catchphrases!
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;nagisa:=wink.png,Wow, your uniform is surprisingly… Compressive. I-Impressive?
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,You can say that again. I know probably <i>un peu trop dans ce moi</i> costume.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;yang:=alarmed.png,You're really confusing, Yang. You seem to be able to really have a lot of fun, but you aren't obnoxious...
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;kimberly:=embarrassed.png,Y-yeah. At least your tanlines are cute!
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;5:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;saki_date:=wink.png,(No vous sente pas gene!) How about we go shopping? You seem to care a lot about your school uniform, but maybe there's other cute clothes you'd like?
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;5:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;saki_date:=wink.png,(No vous sente pas honteaux!) Why don't we go out for crepes? Obviously because I'm French I'll find the good ones!
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;cammy:,count-role;other&character;juri:=alarmed.png,Cammy! Wash your-- watch out!
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight:,count-role;other&character;buffy:=wink.png,Hmm... I wonder if Buffy taught you that, or if she's just a really fast learner...
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;saki:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_date:=wink.png,S-sorry if that's a bit forward, but it's not like you haven't seen her almost naked <i>anyway</i>, so you <i>do</i> kind of owe her a date, I think!
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;shego:,count-role;other&character;kim:=confident.png,Surrender, Shego! The two of us have you cornered! Give up!
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;nagisa:,count-role;self&saidmarker;marinette_ricebun:=confused.png,W-wait a second!
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-amber_eyes&role;target:=embarrassed.png,Oh... Would you look at that. Kind of like... A sunset...
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-blue_eyes&role;target:=embarrassed.png,Oh! The light just caught your eyes and-- <i>So</i> cool, ~name~. I-I hope that doesn't sound self-involved.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-blue_eyes&role;target:=alarmed.png,Oh! Our eyes match, ~name~! I-I kind of hope our chests don't, though.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-dark_eyes&role;target:=embarrassed.png,You have such deep, pretty eyes, ~name~! Er-- Handsome eyes! Um--! Pick which you like! J-just so you know I'm not staring at your chest!
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-dark_eyes&role;target:,marker:brown_eyes=wink.png,I heard someone say that boys love it when you show them your brown eyes! You must be really popular, ~name~!
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-dark-skinned&role;target:=excited.png,Wow, ~name~, you have a really great skin tone!
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-dark-skinned&role;target:=embarrassed.png,You're lucky to have such a nice complexion! I bet it makes it easy to get a lot of sun! N-not that you would without your ~clothing~, of course!
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-fair-skinned&role;target:=wink.png,Your skin looks so healthy! Do you use cosmetics, or are you just lucky like that?
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-pale_eyes&role;target:=embarrassed.png,Huh. I don't think I've seen eyes that color before. N-not in person, anyway.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-pale-skinned&role;target:=embarrassed.png,Hm... You really don't see a lot of sun, do you, ~name~?
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-pale-skinned&role;target:=confused.png,I-I'm not going to lie, pale skin kind of... Makes me a little worried you'll be super creepy, ~name~.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-red_eyes&role;target:=alarmed.png,I feel bad for you, ~name~. Red's not a typical eye color. E-er that's not why I feel bad. You losing your... Um... Anyway.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-red_eyes&role;target:=embarrassed.png,You know, ~name~, I was kinda worried that red eyes would mean you were something evil... But you're not <i>so</i> bad.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-unusual_skin&role;target:=excited.png,I'm... Not going to lie, ~name~, I've... Um. Well, your skin color is usually only common to akuma victims. Since you're in control of yourself... It's kinda... Hot.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-unusual_skin&role;target:=embarrassed.png,W-well. ~name~, you're n-not really from my normal palette when it comes to designing clothes...
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-violet_eyes&role;target:=embarrassed.png,Violet is such a cool eye color! You get the best of blue while still seeing wider color palettes. Um. Or so I learned in school.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:ruby=confused.png,O-or maybe you're the imposter? I <i>really</i> never liked illusion powers.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:yang=confused.png,O-or maybe you're the imposter? I <i>really</i> never liked illusion powers.
5-female_small_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;navi:=embarrassed.png,Er... I don't think... I <i>know</i> she doesn't have the anatomy you do. I think.
5-female_small_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska&saidmarker;7b:=excited.png,H-hey, Vriska, you can pull off the whole... Sexy mechanic look. There. That's a compliment.
5-female_small_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska&saidmarker;7b:=excited.png,No <i>wonder</i> you looked so good in my costume. You've got a model's figure!
5-female_small_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska&saidmarker;7a:=embarrassed.png,O-oh my. You can really see everything. I'm... Glad you're so comfortable with your grooming habits and chest, Vriska.
5-female_small_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska&saidmarker;7a:=confident.png,I-It <i>does</i> take a certain <i>je ne sais quoi</i> to um. Be so open with your body. You don't have to cheat to make <i>friends</i> with an appearance like that, Vriska!
5-female_small_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;shimakaze:=confused.png,--tits...? I-Er, I mean, this gets! H-ha, yeah! I-I'm glad you're okay, Shimakaze! It looks like you're really strong... (<i>Or maybe the explosions are just for show...</i>)
5-female_small_chest_is_visible,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;angie_boobs:,count-role;other&character;angie:,marker:angie_boobs=wink.png,You know, Angie, it's okay to like breasts. No need to be embarrassed.
5-female_small_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-freckles&role;target:=wink.png,When you blush, your freckles really stand out, ~name~!
5-female_small_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-freckles&role;target:=embarrassed.png,Aww, ~name~ has ladybug spots too! Just, more freckly and less costumey.
5-female_small_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-pierced_nipples&role;target:=confused.png,Ow! ~name~, doesn't that... well, it's not like my ears hurt but... sat's po tensitive! That's such a sensitive area!
5-female_small_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-pierced_nipples&role;target:=confused.png,Y-yikes, ~name~. That takes a lot of guts. I mean. Um. Not on your chest! B-but. Erk. N-not to my liking. Mostly.
5-female_small_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-scarred&role;target:=bored.png,Oh ~name~... I'm sorry, whatever happened to you, I wish I could lucky charm it away...
5-female_small_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-scarred&role;target:=bored.png,~name~, your scars look really cool, actually! I-I know that might not make them less... you know, personal. But they're part of you, and I think that's respectable.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;aimee:=alarmed.png,Aimee, are you okay?
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;aimee:=confused.png,R-really? That's what you consider underwear?! Why would you even- You're crazy! Plain and simple!
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;daria:=wink.png,Aw... Daria, were you just embarrassed because you forgot to shave today?
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;kimberly:=alarmed.png,Don't be so shy, Kimberly! I think your breasts look great! I-I mean your tan! Y-your chest is cute too, though. E-erk.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;shazza:=alarmed.png,Er, my timing seems to be off... like your top, though.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;amalia:=bored.png,Forest for the trees? <i>L'anglais est tellement une langue étrange.</i>
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;sayaka:=alarmed.png,Gah! That's not supposed to be a surprise!! At-at least I put on clothes this morning before adventuring... I've... um similarly been embarrassed.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru&saidmarker;null_possess:=calm.png,If it makes you feel better, Nayru, maybe you could just consider me your friend? I mean, this was <i>quite</i> a get-to-know-you.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;sanako:=confused.png,I-I'm not sure if I should flirt or ask you to help me with my homework. This is such an uncanny feeling...
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;nagisa:=excited.png,Not weird at all. I have to yell out all sorts of things to make the Miraculous de-Akumatize people! Or put on my costume!
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;5:=alarmed.png,Oh no, Joey! I-I don't think this was supposed to be the trick! A-and where did your hair, there go?
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;gwen:=alarmed.png,--Oh. Well, the sexy way sounds. Um. Less dangerous. And, er. More appealing. Hypothetically.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;6:=calm.png,Phew. At least nothing went wrong, this time, and you seem to be having fun, Joey!
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;cammy:=wink.png,She's... You're so impressive, Cammy. I mean. All of you. Um. Your body. And fighting style. All of that.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;nagisa:,marker:battlecry_nagisa=confident.png,That’s impressive, I mean! You have such a good figure, Nagisa!
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;juri:=wink.png,They're surprisingly cute for a villain. Juri, when I take away your akuma, I hope you don't feel too resentful!
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;kyu:=alarmed.png,Though I’m a bit horrified to think of what powers you’d give someone.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;7:=confused.png,Well, I've kind of seen these, so I guess that's all that needs to be said...
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=confused.png,Well... this is odd, but I suppose if Nayru was okay with it, I can be too... I'd never <i>ever</i> let someone else do this to me though...
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch:=embarrassed.png,W-well they’re perky, but you can see your hair… there… and that underwear is...um...not my style.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=embarrassed.png,W-well, that's quite the chest. No wonder people always try to plunder you, Elaine.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=embarrassed.png,<i>C'est tout à fait la poitrine. Pas étonnant que les gens essayent toujours de te piller, Elaine.</i>
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;7:,count-role;other&character;meia:=alarmed.png,E-er, Sei, consider sat you’re waying-- What you’re saying to her!
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;shego:,count-role;other&character;kim:=calm.png,J-just surrender to us, not Hawk Moth. Just because Kim and I are having a crossover doesn't mean our villains need to...
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;cammy:,count-role;other&character;juri:=alarmed.png,That's so rude of you, Juri! Why are you accosting your friend like that!?
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;saki:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_date:=embarrassed.png,Um... S-sorry if matchmaking was a bit... rude of me, all things considered... I just figured you'd look cute together...
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;saki:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_date:=embarrassed.png,Um! Saki looks way cuter than she thinks she does, right? Um. ~player~? (I think she looks pretty!)
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;6:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;saki_date:=confident.png,W-well, up to you, Saki! Consider it a... um... reward! For seeing this through!
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;angie_boobs:,count-role;other&character;angie:,marker:angie_boobs=wink.png,You know, Angie, it's okay to like breasts. No need to be embarrassed.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch:,count-role;other&character;d.va:=confident.png,You know, having a really supportive suit really does help with going braless. Sorry to hear you can’t, D.Va!
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;nagisa:,count-role;self&saidmarker;marinette_ricebun:=alarmed.png,You’re bigger than I expected! This is like biting into a bun and finding a rice cracker!
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;aimee:,count-role;other&character;harley:=bored.png,You're insane. And Harley is right here, Aimee. I'm not trying to be mean but...

5-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;april&stage;3:=excited.png,Donnie? Oh! You have someone special?
5-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;yang:=embarrassed.png,I-I'm a bit jealous your figure and personality and friendships come so easily, is all.
5-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;shantae:=alarmed.png,Maybe your dance is just so distracting that I dreamed the whole conversation up?
5-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;uravity:=wink.png,No extra bug heroes yet! But it’s always great to meet new teammates!
5-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;uravity:=embarrassed.png,Er, cat-themed you say? I think one cat-themed superhero is enough for my life.
5-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;palutena:=excited.png,Oh! I wasn’t expecting...After the belts...Wow. I can see why the statues in your likeness have so many references to heavenly spheres.
5-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;palutena:=embarrassed.png,Oh, don’t be so ashamed. We’re all here having fun, Palutena. There’s nothing wrong with nudity… Except the staring. And embarrassment. Okay, I’m sorry.
5-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;felicia:=alarmed.png,Uh-hm. When I said I worked with another kitty, I did mean another person. N-not something else.
5-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;felicia:=embarrassed.png,Um... S-sorry Felicia, you look <i>vaguely</i> like someone I've spent a lot of time with... Just... Female and not dark.
5-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika:=wink.png,Um… I commend you for keeping the mask on, though. Is that for a secret identity, or just dedication to your craft?
5-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;uravity:,count-role;other&character;gwen:=wink.png,I have a feeling I’ll be making a new teammate after this game, actually... I think she’s more arachnid themed, though!

5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;palutena:=embarrassed.png,D-did you mean to imply you drop them for other people? O-or mostly just yourself?

5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;ann:=alarmed.png,I-I mean if it is, that's great. People like to ask about mine a lot.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;uravity:=wink.png,It must be super cool to be able to fly or float like you do!
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru&saidmarker;null_possess:=wink.png,Just keep a brave face, okay, Nayru?
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;kimberly:=embarrassed.png,Kimberly, I know we just met but... I've never seen tan lines on someone's... you know. I-I hope it doesn't cross a line if I look!
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;launch:=alarmed.png,Launch matches... um... between sneezes... (She doesn't seem <i>too</i> akumatizable, just... irritated...)
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch:=excited.png,Oh my! That’s definitely magic I’ve never seen!
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;blackrose:=confident.png,Oh! Blackrose, I-I know it’s hard to lose but, hopefully whatever you have is particularly um...exotic?
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;sayori:=confident.png,O-oh, well, I wouldn't stare! But I think it's great you're happy with your appearance like this! I like to groom, but I think I get really self-conscious about how I look. I'm proud for you, Sayori!
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=excited.png,O-oh. W-well, this is a nice view, even if <i>I'm</i> not a fan of that style of underwear...
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=excited.png,Y-you know, I have to say, I'm understanding the appeal of that kind of underwear...
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=excited.png,At least it's not <i>entirely</i> up your butt, Elaine.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;red:=excited.png,Or is it something like my earrings? <i>What?</i> Is your <i>sword</i> a Miraculous!?
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska:=bored.png,Or you could roll the die again. I really hope you're not just resetting your clothes...
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska:=bored.png,Just for your consideration: having good luck means <i>not</i> needing to rely on it...
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;sola:=embarrassed.png,Sola, I'm sorry that my original question about the matching is going to be answered... please don't hex me.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight:=confused.png,T-Twilight, usually that's something that comes off last!
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight:=alarmed.png,W-wait everyone will be able to see your-
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;navi:=embarrassed.png,Um, er, no, not, what you're-- about-- no, I mean, the literal--
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;sayaka:=embarrassed.png,Um, Sayaka, I don't think I've ever faced an akuma like this before. Maybe witches are much scarier...
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika:=embarrassed.png,Um. Just less while naked.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;shimakaze:=embarrassed.png,Um... is... all this talk about taking on water... a euphemism, Shimakaze? It's... very elaborate.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;elizabeth:=alarmed.png,Wait I meant running! Oh no, you'll be doing both soon, argh! I'm so sorry!
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;gwen:=embarrassed.png,What?
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;nagisa:=wink.png,W-what, of course you’re cute!
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;nagisa:=embarrassed.png,A-as a friend, court you’re of yute! I- I’m. Er..
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;aimee:=alarmed.png,Y-you're really going to just? Wearing so little?
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;cammy:,count-role;other&character;chun-li:=alarmed.png,...! I-I...!
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;natsuki:,count-role;other&character;monika:,marker:trapsuki=alarmed.png,E-er, what is it you're implying about Natsuki, Monika...?
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;blake:,count-role;other&character;yang&stage;8-10:=alarmed.png,I know you aren’t a fan of… Um… Chat… Jokes, Blake…
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch:,count-role;other&character;hermione:=wink.png,Oh! So like how Hermione has been removing her small stuff. It’s… Interesting you saved it for last!
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;yang:,count-role;other&character;blake&stage;8-10:=embarrassed.png,So, Blake… Um… Shaves… Her… Chat…
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;neo:,count-role;other&character;yang&stage;8-10:=embarrassed.png,Um. Yang, does Neo hate you, or… Like you?
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight:,count-role;other&character;nagisa:=embarrassed.png,U-uh, Nagisa, shouldn't we tell Twilight not to...
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;d.va&saidmarker;d.va_high_score:,count-role;other&character;moon:=confused.png,Wait, is the goal of this game to get naked fastest? Is that why Moon plays like she does?
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;palutena:,count-role;other&character;lyn:=embarrassed.png,Well, two green haired women... Do your... You know... erm, match?
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,priority:306,count-role;target&character;d.va&saidmarker;d.va_high_score:,count-exposed:1-2=bored.png,U-uhm. D.Va, it’s only the high score if you’re winning, right? I don’t really think... Er... Maybe you’re playing another game?
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,priority:36,count-bodysuit:2,count-bodysuit:3,count-bodysuit:4,count-role;self&saidmarker;bodysuit:,count-exposed:2-4=embarrassed.png,Um…~name~, do you shave? I get a feeling I’m the only person with a body suit who… Doesn’t.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-rwby&role;target:=embarrassed.png,I heard a rumor from a friend that you all shave down there... Is that like, a bonding experience?
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-thong&role;target:=bored.png,At least you'll be out of your thong, ~name~. That <i>can't</i> be comfortable.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-thong&role;target:=confused.png,I think thongs are just... super uncomfortable. But no panty lines... I think I'd have a bigger issue with that if not for my costume.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-thong&role;target:=alarmed.png,At least you don't have to wear your thong anymore, ~name~. How a day-long wedgie is at all comfortable is beyond me.
5-female_crotch_is_visible=embarrassed.png,Oh, I do mine a little differently--I mean, uh, never mind, look at her!
5-female_crotch_is_visible=excited.png,See! It matches for people with non-typical hair colors too!
5-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;aimee:=confused.png,... Did you just... Climax... ?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=alarmed.png,<i>C'est tout à fait le cul!</i>
5-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=alarmed.png,Quite the tattoo, Elaine! You must've had it for a long time!
5-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;kyu:=confident.png,After the game, would you show me where you got those? Or maybe, I could trade you? I bet I could fit!
5-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;lilith:=embarrassed.png,But your tattoos are cool! W-wait, you didn’t think I meant your... piercings or... your... uhm, patterning…
5-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=alarmed.png,E-er... I think it's okay to be excited. I-I mean, it's only natural. Not weird. O-or anything like that. S-so, just yenjoy ourself-- enjoy yourself, Nayru!
5-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;meia:,marker:unusual_blue_hair=bored.png,Er. I’m still not used to seeing women bare like this. It’s unusual to see blue hair in the first place so…
5-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;corrin_f:=alarmed.png,Goodness. Don't you fight a lot of battles? How on earth do you have time to maintain something like that?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;corrin_f:=confused.png,U-uhm. Corrin, with your ears, should I believe that all of your people look like that... or?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;sola:=alarmed.png,Hex, Sola! I-I'm not quite ready f-for whatever you thought I was suggesting even though I'm... In... this game...
5-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;5:=alarmed.png,H-hey! You can't do that! No fair!
5-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;futaba:=alarmed.png,I can't believe you didn't wear underwear!
5-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;kimberly:=excited.png,I tend to prefer lots of sunblock, but that looks <i>super</i> cool, Kimberly! I'll have to try the look. We even... um, trim the same!
5-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;dawn:=embarrassed.png,I-Eep. I’m going to stop talking now.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;palutena:=alarmed.png,I-I suppose a memory is words a thousand worths. Worth a thousand words!
5-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;kyoko:=alarmed.png,I-I'm not saying I'll, I just meant that you, I mean, uhm. Want to try on a Miraculous instead? Maybe... a spider, for making connections?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;navi:=alarmed.png,I'm really awkward about this, I can't think about you except how much you remind me of Tikki and it's so <i>weird</i>!
5-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;cammy:=embarrassed.png,I'm so sorry your clothes keep getting damaged. If um. You want, after this, I can loan you some of my stuff? Because we match! In... various ways!
5-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;uravity:=alarmed.png,It makes your breasts look stunning too! Er, you look stunned, um… erk-- j-just keep at it, Ochako!
5-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;lux:=wink.png,It’s not supposed to match for blondes, is it? So that’s pretty normal. The contrast is pretty striking, given your light magic. Looks like you have a dark spot after all!
5-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;natsuki:=wink.png,Just like my friend Alyx! She also has pink hair. And um, grooms like you do.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;alpha:,marker:smooth_criminal=wink.png,Looks like you were struck by a <i>smooth</i> criminal.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika:=confident.png,Maybe after this, you could show me some grappling stuff, huh, Mika?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;ruby:=wink.png,Oh, I see at least the leader does what she wants.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru&saidmarker;null_possess:=excited.png,Oh, what a relief! We have the same style--of um. You know! I think you must've just trimmed fresh today, though, <i>oui</i>?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;ann:=embarrassed.png,Oh. I see that it is. W-well! It adds a new element to your career! U-uhm. I mean, in modeling. Not this.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;sayaka:=alarmed.png,O-oh! You're... so hairy! I make sure to trim, most of the time, anyway... er... not that anyone needed to know that...
5-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;daria:=bored.png,O-oh. Well, that trick again. I see. Well played, Daria.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;nagisa:=confident.png,Stay with it, Nagisa. If you don’t give up, you might lose, but you’re not defeated!
5-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;annie:=wink.png,Tell me about it, Annie. There’s just not enough hours in the day… But I find that spending time in the shower to trim and groom. If you feel good, and look good, you can do your best!
5-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight:=alarmed.png,That’s definitely not human behavior! Are you a giant Kwami, or something else?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;red:=wink.png,The Kwami inside seems to know you pretty well. It’s weird that you haven’t transformed yet, though.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;gwen:=alarmed.png,Um. I don’t like the sound of this...
5-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;juri:=alarmed.png,U-uhm. Y-you're just very hairy! Most European girls I know um. Take care of that in other ways.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;videl:=confused.png,U-um. I think I have some questions about why you do that. You know. As a fighter.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;raven:=embarrassed.png,We’re both mixed women, we both fight evil, we both like bodysuits... We both don’t... shave our... er... nevermind.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch:=embarrassed.png,Well, that’s not true, my costume just vanishes when I run out of force...
5-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;blackrose:=alarmed.png,Whoa. I haven’t… Erm, seen many, but that’s particularly pretty!
5-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;streaming-chan&stage;7:=alarmed.png,W-wait, you removed your clothes instead of that hat and camera?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;felicia:=confident.png,W-well, I'm sure your partners will appreciate that, anyway...
5-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;shimakaze:=wink.png,W-well, less elaborate than how you groom, I suppose.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;launch:=embarrassed.png,W-well, that's... half of the question answered, I suppose.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;saki:=alarmed.png,W-wow, you sure are hairy, Saki! (Oh come on, Marinette!)
5-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;saki:=alarmed.png,W-well, I think we all see you now, Saki! (Marinette, that's not what you should've said!)
5-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=bored.png,Yikes. That looks rode hard and put away… um… Wet. I believe is the expression.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=alarmed.png,You can climax just by… Thinking? Now <i>That’s</i> a superpower.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;other&character;mulan&saidmarker;duel_lost:=wink.png,You mentioned a spirit guide… and you're from what seems to be Ancient China… do you know anything about the Miraculouses?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska:=confused.png,You're... You're sad. You're just <i>so</i> sad, Vriska. Come here and let me break your die, and just de-Akumatize you already.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska:=confused.png,I'm sorry, Vriska. But you really should just quit.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch:,count-role;other&character;hermione&stage;9-10:=confused.png,A-are you also going to use magic to do… Um… What she did?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;yang:,count-role;other&character;blake&stage;8-10:=alarmed.png,D-does that make it easier for you two to… You know? Soixante neuf?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;juri:,count-role;other&character;d.va&stage;6-8:,marker:korean_trends=embarrassed.png,Er... Hana, does yours... er... get that hairy when you don't shave? Or is Juri just out of touch with Korean beauty trends?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;palutena:,count-role;other&character;lyn:=bored.png,Oh. Well, that’s one way of being unique.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;blake:,count-role;other&character;yang&stage;8-10:=alarmed.png,O-oh I was expecting to say you had a… ah, fuzzy… B-but I guess this way you don’t get hair in each other’s mouths?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;cammy:,count-role;other&character;chun-li:=embarrassed.png,Ow! I don't think I'd let a friend help me undress like that! (Yikes...)
5-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;hotsprings:,count-role;other&character;sheena&stage;8-10:,marker:hotsprings=embarrassed.png,Sheena, you mean explored as in… The area--The area of the water and rocks, not, all of us girls, right?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,priority:36,count-bodysuit:2,count-bodysuit:3,count-bodysuit:4,count-role;self&saidmarker;bodysuit:,count-exposed:2-4=alarmed.png,I-it just seems like a lot of work for not a lot of benefit… Does it really feel that much better?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,count-hairy&role;target:=alarmed.png,T-that’s very... Eastern of you, both European and otherwise.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,count-shaved&role;target:=confused.png,Ow, that seems like it would hurt a lot to maintain.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,count-trimmed&role;target:=excited.png,Oh, maybe I’ll try that style!
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7,alsoPlaying:lyn=excited.png,See! It matches for people with non-typical hair colors too!
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7,alsoPlaying:palutena=excited.png,See! It matches for people with non-typical hair colors too!

6-male_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-red_eyes&role;target:=embarrassed.png,You know, ~name~, I was kinda worried that red eyes would mean you were something evil... But you're not <i>so</i> bad.

6-male_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-scarred&role;target:=bored.png,Oh ~name~... I'm sorry, whatever happened to you, I wish I could lucky charm it away...
6-male_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-scarred&role;target:=bored.png,~name~, your scars look really cool, actually! I-I know that might not make them less... you know, personal. But they're part of you, and I think that's respectable.

6-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;pit:=embarrassed.png,Um! I'll-- Um! I-I'm actually really excited to see this.
6-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;pit:=wink.png,Show me what you have, hero.
6-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;jin:=wink.png,W-well, it would be a shame, but I guess you couldn't be so <i>cocky</i> anymore.
6-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;corrin_m:=embarrassed.png,You say this Camilla is your wife? She must be a very patient woman!
6-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;pit:,count-role;other&character;palutena:=alarmed.png,O-oh. Oh no, I have very much misinterpreted this relationship. I am so sorry.
6-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-large_penis&role;target:,count-role;other&character;aella:=embarrassed.png,Um. Aella, I feel like we're due for a random encounter soon. It looks like it's going to be a big one...
6-male_small_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;corrin_m:=bored.png,Um. I suppose style and skill count for more? You’re not my type, Corrin, but you should be proud of who you are!
6-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=embarrassed.png,Hmm... That’s about Cat Noir’s size... N-not that I’ve looked.
6-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;pit:=alarmed.png,Hm... I think I see a powerup I know <i>I</i> wouldn't mind getting familiar with. E-er. It's over there! Behind Pit's... That's why I'm staring! W-where I'm staring!
6-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,priority:0,count-circumcised&role;target:=confident.png,Hmm... I will say, <i>that</i> type of um. Appearance is certainly not without appeal.
6-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,priority:0,count-uncircumcised&role;target:=embarrassed.png,I um. Haven't seen many, but I will say that's the type of equipment I'm used to um. Practicing... designs with?

6-male_large_crotch_is_visible,count-role;other&character;nagisa:,marker:ztentacles=alarmed.png,I-I wouldn’t follow that line of logic if I were, Nagisa! I’ve heard that Japanese schoolgirls are very vulnerable to those kinds of things!

6-male_large_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;jin:=embarrassed.png,W-well, I-I guess some powers have very impractical applications. Y-yikes, t-that's--!
6-male_large_crotch_is_visible,count-role;other&character;aella:=wink.png,You know, Aella, I think you're the only woman I've met who could handle something like that. Um. Without breaking, anyway.
6-female_chest_will_be_visible=calm.png,Mine might be small but they’re up to the test.
6-female_chest_will_be_visible=confused.png,O-or maybe you're the imposter? I <i>really</i> never liked illusion powers.

6-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska:=confused.png,(She puts up a tough act. But she's probably just scared and really insecure... I can't even tell if she's Akumatized. I mostly just... Feel bad for her. I should be a little nicer.)
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;sanako:=wink.png,As long as you don't leave things in the oven too long, I can see people liking fluffy pastries like those, Sanako!
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika:=embarrassed.png,At least I had clothes on underneath…
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=confused.png,Did someone shame you for your body? Is that why you're like this?
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=alarmed.png,E-er, did you just... Slice that pretty set of underwear?
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=alarmed.png,Um! I'm glad you didn't hurt him, but you've hurt your bra, Elaine!

6-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;cammy:=confused.png,I really want to help! But they're all so fast! Poor Cammy!
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;6:=wink.png,I wonder if it's a French thing...
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;shantae:=alarmed.png,I’m sorry, it seems you… Um, have gotten rather naked.
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;shimakaze:=embarrassed.png,I-I hope that my Lucky Charm can save you if this--
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=alarmed.png,I-I really don't think you should be destroying her clothing, though! It's not super fancy, but that doesn't mean it's not without value!
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;ayano:=alarmed.png,Is... IS THAT BLOOD?
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;ayano:=alarmed.png,That’s blood, isn’t it? Possessed or not, you need to be stopped, Ayano! You’re insane! I won’t let you win!
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru:=wink.png,I've only really been naked with my friends too. Don't they have saunas in Labrynna?

6-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,Okay so... I guess the next part is easy... unless you have a rabbit coming out or something!
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;4:=excited.png,O-okay, I am kind of interesting in seeing this magic trick, if I'm being honest...
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;kyu:=excited.png,Oooh! I don’t usually get to see <i>other</i> people do that! Well, Alya a few times…
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;uravity:=embarrassed.png,Regarding, er... your questions...
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;shazza:=embarrassed.png,Shazza, you're a lot bigger in person than I expected! I just hadn't gotten the chance to say it.
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;daria:=embarrassed.png,Try having two identities and a bunch of friends with crushes on each other, if you want complicated.
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;kim:=confident.png,What’s the sitch Kim? Just comparing catchphrases!
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;kim:=calm.png,Don’t bug out, Kim...Just compare our catchphrases!
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;nagisa:=wink.png,Wow, your uniform is surprisingly… Compressive. I-Impressive?
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,You can say that again. I know probably <i>un peu trop dans ce moi</i> costume.
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;yang:=alarmed.png,You're really confusing, Yang. You seem to be able to really have a lot of fun, but you aren't obnoxious...
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;kimberly:=embarrassed.png,Y-yeah. At least your tanlines are cute!
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;5:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;saki_date:=wink.png,(No vous sente pas gene!) How about we go shopping? You seem to care a lot about your school uniform, but maybe there's other cute clothes you'd like?

6-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight:,count-role;other&character;buffy:=wink.png,Hmm... I wonder if Buffy taught you that, or if she's just a really fast learner...
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;saki:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_date:=wink.png,S-sorry if that's a bit forward, but it's not like you haven't seen her almost naked <i>anyway</i>, so you <i>do</i> kind of owe her a date, I think!
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;shego:,count-role;other&character;kim:=confident.png,Surrender, Shego! The two of us have you cornered! Give up!
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;nagisa:,count-role;self&saidmarker;marinette_ricebun:=confused.png,W-wait a second!

6-female_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-pale_eyes&role;target:=embarrassed.png,Huh. I don't think I've seen eyes that color before. N-not in person, anyway.
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-pale-skinned&role;target:=embarrassed.png,Hm... You really don't see a lot of sun, do you, ~name~?
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-pale-skinned&role;target:=confused.png,I-I'm not going to lie, pale skin kind of... Makes me a little worried you'll be super creepy, ~name~.

6-female_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-unusual_skin&role;target:=embarrassed.png,W-well. ~name~, you're n-not really from my normal palette when it comes to designing clothes...
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-violet_eyes&role;target:=embarrassed.png,Violet is such a cool eye color! You get the best of blue while still seeing wider color palettes. Um. Or so I learned in school.
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:ruby=confused.png,O-or maybe you're the imposter? I <i>really</i> never liked illusion powers.
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:yang=confused.png,O-or maybe you're the imposter? I <i>really</i> never liked illusion powers.

6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;kyu:,marker:alya_spoiler=alarmed.png,Er. Is that a spoiler? Um! Ignore that, haha, Alya <i>definitely</i> isn’t Rena Rouge!
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;kyu:,marker:latex_catsuits=wink.png,I hope this satisfies the crowd that’s always wanting me to have nothing on under my costume!
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;amalia:=bored.png,Forest for the trees? <i>L'anglais est tellement une langue étrange.</i>
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;sayaka:=alarmed.png,Gah! That's not supposed to be a surprise!! At-at least I put on clothes this morning before adventuring... I've... um similarly been embarrassed.
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru&saidmarker;null_possess:=calm.png,If it makes you feel better, Nayru, maybe you could just consider me your friend? I mean, this was <i>quite</i> a get-to-know-you.
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;sanako:=confused.png,I-I'm not sure if I should flirt or ask you to help me with my homework. This is such an uncanny feeling...
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;5:=alarmed.png,Oh no, Joey! I-I don't think this was supposed to be the trick! A-and where did your hair, there go?
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;gwen:=alarmed.png,--Oh. Well, the sexy way sounds. Um. Less dangerous. And, er. More appealing. Hypothetically.
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;6:=calm.png,Phew. At least nothing went wrong, this time, and you seem to be having fun, Joey!
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;cammy:=wink.png,She's... You're so impressive, Cammy. I mean. All of you. Um. Your body. And fighting style. All of that.

6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;juri:=wink.png,They're surprisingly cute for a villain. Juri, when I take away your akuma, I hope you don't feel too resentful!
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;7:=confused.png,Well, I've kind of seen these, so I guess that's all that needs to be said...
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=confused.png,Well... this is odd, but I suppose if Nayru was okay with it, I can be too... I'd never <i>ever</i> let someone else do this to me though...
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch:=embarrassed.png,W-well they’re perky, but you can see your hair… there… and that underwear is...um...not my style.
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=embarrassed.png,W-well, that's quite the chest. No wonder people always try to plunder you, Elaine.

6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;shego:,count-role;other&character;kim:=calm.png,J-just surrender to us, not Hawk Moth. Just because Kim and I are having a crossover doesn't mean our villains need to...

6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-scarred&role;target:=bored.png,Oh ~name~... I'm sorry, whatever happened to you, I wish I could lucky charm it away...
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-scarred&role;target:=bored.png,~name~, your scars look really cool, actually! I-I know that might not make them less... you know, personal. But they're part of you, and I think that's respectable.
6-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;april&stage;3:=excited.png,Donnie? Oh! You have someone special?
6-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;yang:=embarrassed.png,I-I'm a bit jealous your figure and personality and friendships come so easily, is all.
6-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;shantae:=alarmed.png,Maybe your dance is just so distracting that I dreamed the whole conversation up?
6-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;uravity:=wink.png,No extra bug heroes yet! But it’s always great to meet new teammates!
6-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;uravity:=embarrassed.png,Er, cat-themed you say? I think one cat-themed superhero is enough for my life.
6-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;palutena:=excited.png,Oh! I wasn’t expecting...After the belts...Wow. I can see why the statues in your likeness have so many references to heavenly spheres.
6-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;palutena:=embarrassed.png,Oh, don’t be so ashamed. We’re all here having fun, Palutena. There’s nothing wrong with nudity… Except the staring. And embarrassment. Okay, I’m sorry.
6-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;felicia:=alarmed.png,Uh-hm. When I said I worked with another kitty, I did mean another person. N-not something else.
6-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;felicia:=embarrassed.png,Um... S-sorry Felicia, you look <i>vaguely</i> like someone I've spent a lot of time with... Just... Female and not dark.
6-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika:=wink.png,Um… I commend you for keeping the mask on, though. Is that for a secret identity, or just dedication to your craft?
6-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;uravity:,count-role;other&character;gwen:=wink.png,I have a feeling I’ll be making a new teammate after this game, actually... I think she’s more arachnid themed, though!
6-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;angie_boobs:,count-role;other&character;angie:,marker:angie_boobs=wink.png,You know, Angie, it's okay to like breasts. No need to be embarrassed.
6-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;uravity:,count-role;other&character;blake:=alarmed.png,You know, I think I could do to meet new cat-themed superheroes… just to compare them to my Cat Noir. N-not <i>mine</i> mine, mind mew. Erk--
6-female_large_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-freckles&role;target:=wink.png,When you blush, your freckles really stand out, ~name~!
6-female_large_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-freckles&role;target:=embarrassed.png,Aww, ~name~ has ladybug spots too! Just, more freckly and less costumey.
6-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-huge_breasts&role;target:=embarrassed.png,E-erk? ~name~? W-w-whay!? I-I mean, w-what!?
6-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-huge_breasts&role;target:=alarmed.png,Y-yikes. D-do you ever worry about smothering people when you sleep with them!?
6-female_large_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-pierced_nipples&role;target:=confused.png,Ow! ~name~, doesn't that... well, it's not like my ears hurt but... sat's po tensitive! That's such a sensitive area!

6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;saki:=embarrassed.png,(I just feel a strong urge to protect her... Especially now...)
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;saki:=embarrassed.png,(I feel such a strong need to protect Saki...)
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;daria:=embarrassed.png,(I'm kind of hoping I get to see it, she's been teasing herself for a while...)
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;cammy:=alarmed.png,Cammy! Why do they keep attacking you!?
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;palutena:=embarrassed.png,D-did you mean to imply you drop them for other people? O-or mostly just yourself?
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;juri:=embarrassed.png,E-er. I guess you really are from Korea!
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;other&character;zone-tan&stage;2:,marker:ztentacles=embarrassed.png,I can imagine more fun things to do involving that than… I-I mean not personally but… Um…!
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;kyoko:=embarrassed.png,I have a really bad feeling that you'd be a very strong supervillain... I-I think I should help you unwind before you get too stressed!
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;dawn&stage;7:=bored.png,I mean, most people already know they’re supposed to match... Mine does, obviously...
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=embarrassed.png,I um. Think your friendship reminds me of Cat Noir and his kwami. They seem to argue a bit more than Tikki and I.
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;felicia:=embarrassed.png,I-I appreciate few yallowing--- You following the rules, Felicia, b-but it's just kind of... Not what I was expecting!
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;ann:=alarmed.png,I-I mean if it is, that's great. People like to ask about mine a lot.
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;uravity:=wink.png,It must be super cool to be able to fly or float like you do!
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru&saidmarker;null_possess:=wink.png,Just keep a brave face, okay, Nayru?
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;kimberly:=embarrassed.png,Kimberly, I know we just met but... I've never seen tan lines on someone's... you know. I-I hope it doesn't cross a line if I look!
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;launch:=alarmed.png,Launch matches... um... between sneezes... (She doesn't seem <i>too</i> akumatizable, just... irritated...)
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch:=excited.png,Oh my! That’s definitely magic I’ve never seen!
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;blackrose:=confident.png,Oh! Blackrose, I-I know it’s hard to lose but, hopefully whatever you have is particularly um...exotic?
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;kyu:=embarrassed.png,Oh, here I was expecting some pink hair! N-not that I mind...
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;sayori:=confident.png,O-oh, well, I wouldn't stare! But I think it's great you're happy with your appearance like this! I like to groom, but I think I get really self-conscious about how I look. I'm proud for you, Sayori!
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=excited.png,O-oh. W-well, this is a nice view, even if <i>I'm</i> not a fan of that style of underwear...
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=excited.png,Y-you know, I have to say, I'm understanding the appeal of that kind of underwear...
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=excited.png,At least it's not <i>entirely</i> up your butt, Elaine.
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;red:=excited.png,Or is it something like my earrings? <i>What?</i> Is your <i>sword</i> a Miraculous!?
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska:=bored.png,Or you could roll the die again. I really hope you're not just resetting your clothes...
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska:=bored.png,Just for your consideration: having good luck means <i>not</i> needing to rely on it...
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;sola:=embarrassed.png,Sola, I'm sorry that my original question about the matching is going to be answered... please don't hex me.
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight:=confused.png,T-Twilight, usually that's something that comes off last!
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight:=alarmed.png,W-wait everyone will be able to see your-
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;navi:=embarrassed.png,Um, er, no, not, what you're-- about-- no, I mean, the literal--
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;sayaka:=embarrassed.png,Um, Sayaka, I don't think I've ever faced an akuma like this before. Maybe witches are much scarier...
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika:=embarrassed.png,Um. Just less while naked.
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;shimakaze:=embarrassed.png,Um... is... all this talk about taking on water... a euphemism, Shimakaze? It's... very elaborate.
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;elizabeth:=alarmed.png,Wait I meant running! Oh no, you'll be doing both soon, argh! I'm so sorry!
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;gwen:=embarrassed.png,What?
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;nagisa:=wink.png,W-what, of course you’re cute!
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;nagisa:=embarrassed.png,A-as a friend, court you’re of yute! I- I’m. Er..
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;aimee:=alarmed.png,Y-you're really going to just? Wearing so little?
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;cammy:,count-role;other&character;chun-li:=alarmed.png,...! I-I...!
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;natsuki:,count-role;other&character;monika:,marker:trapsuki=alarmed.png,E-er, what is it you're implying about Natsuki, Monika...?
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;blake:,count-role;other&character;yang&stage;8-10:=alarmed.png,I know you aren’t a fan of… Um… Chat… Jokes, Blake…
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch:,count-role;other&character;hermione:=wink.png,Oh! So like how Hermione has been removing her small stuff. It’s… Interesting you saved it for last!
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;yang:,count-role;other&character;blake&stage;8-10:=embarrassed.png,So, Blake… Um… Shaves… Her… Chat…
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;neo:,count-role;other&character;yang&stage;8-10:=embarrassed.png,Um. Yang, does Neo hate you, or… Like you?
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight:,count-role;other&character;nagisa:=embarrassed.png,U-uh, Nagisa, shouldn't we tell Twilight not to...
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;d.va&saidmarker;d.va_high_score:,count-role;other&character;moon:=confused.png,Wait, is the goal of this game to get naked fastest? Is that why Moon plays like she does?
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;palutena:,count-role;other&character;lyn:=embarrassed.png,Well, two green haired women... Do your... You know... erm, match?
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,priority:306,count-role;target&character;d.va&saidmarker;d.va_high_score:,count-exposed:1-2=bored.png,U-uhm. D.Va, it’s only the high score if you’re winning, right? I don’t really think... Er... Maybe you’re playing another game?
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,priority:36,count-bodysuit:2,count-bodysuit:3,count-bodysuit:4,count-role;self&saidmarker;bodysuit:,count-exposed:2-4=embarrassed.png,Um…~name~, do you shave? I get a feeling I’m the only person with a body suit who… Doesn’t.
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-ginger&role;target:=alarmed.png,Y-you know, I did say your hair was pretty earlier but I’d be super shocked if it matched.
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-pink_hair:2,count-role;target&character;kyu:=wink.png,I suppose the other pink-haired lady can show me if it can be natural or not!
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-rwby&role;target:=embarrassed.png,I heard a rumor from a friend that you all shave down there... Is that like, a bonding experience?
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-thong&role;target:=bored.png,At least you'll be out of your thong, ~name~. That <i>can't</i> be comfortable.
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-thong&role;target:=confused.png,I think thongs are just... super uncomfortable. But no panty lines... I think I'd have a bigger issue with that if not for my costume.
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-thong&role;target:=alarmed.png,At least you don't have to wear your thong anymore, ~name~. How a day-long wedgie is at all comfortable is beyond me.
6-female_crotch_is_visible=alarmed.png,O-Oh, I like that style a lot. I think I’ll try it... at some point. T-the style. Not the  p-pussy.
6-female_crotch_is_visible=excited.png,See! It matches for people with non-typical hair colors too!
6-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;aimee:=confused.png,... Did you just... Climax... ?
6-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=alarmed.png,<i>C'est tout à fait le cul!</i>
6-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=alarmed.png,Quite the tattoo, Elaine! You must've had it for a long time!
6-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;blackrose:=embarrassed.png,Between your tattoos...and hue...and...um...even your cute little tangle… I-it might even entice a straight girl into doing… Um… you know…
6-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;lilith:=embarrassed.png,But your tattoos are cool! W-wait, you didn’t think I meant your... piercings or... your... uhm, patterning…
6-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=alarmed.png,E-er... I think it's okay to be excited. I-I mean, it's only natural. Not weird. O-or anything like that. S-so, just yenjoy ourself-- enjoy yourself, Nayru!
6-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;meia:,marker:unusual_blue_hair=bored.png,Er. I’m still not used to seeing women bare like this. It’s unusual to see blue hair in the first place so…
6-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;corrin_f:=alarmed.png,Goodness. Don't you fight a lot of battles? How on earth do you have time to maintain something like that?
6-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;corrin_f:=confused.png,U-uhm. Corrin, with your ears, should I believe that all of your people look like that... or?
6-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;sola:=alarmed.png,Hex, Sola! I-I'm not quite ready f-for whatever you thought I was suggesting even though I'm... In... this game...
6-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;5:=alarmed.png,H-hey! You can't do that! No fair!
6-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;futaba:=alarmed.png,I can't believe you didn't wear underwear!
6-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;kyu:=calm.png,I definitely don’t like to take care of myself like that… But I will admit that look seems nice on you!
6-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;kimberly:=excited.png,I tend to prefer lots of sunblock, but that looks <i>super</i> cool, Kimberly! I'll have to try the look. We even... um, trim the same!
6-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;dawn:=embarrassed.png,I-Eep. I’m going to stop talking now.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;palutena:=alarmed.png,I-I suppose a memory is words a thousand worths. Worth a thousand words!
6-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;kyoko:=alarmed.png,I-I'm not saying I'll, I just meant that you, I mean, uhm. Want to try on a Miraculous instead? Maybe... a spider, for making connections?
6-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;navi:=alarmed.png,I'm really awkward about this, I can't think about you except how much you remind me of Tikki and it's so <i>weird</i>!
6-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;cammy:=embarrassed.png,I'm so sorry your clothes keep getting damaged. If um. You want, after this, I can loan you some of my stuff? Because we match! In... various ways!
6-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;uravity:=alarmed.png,It makes your breasts look stunning too! Er, you look stunned, um… erk-- j-just keep at it, Ochako!
6-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;lux:=wink.png,It’s not supposed to match for blondes, is it? So that’s pretty normal. The contrast is pretty striking, given your light magic. Looks like you have a dark spot after all!
6-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;natsuki:=wink.png,Just like my friend Alyx! She also has pink hair. And um, grooms like you do.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;alpha:,marker:smooth_criminal=wink.png,Looks like you were struck by a <i>smooth</i> criminal.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika:=confident.png,Maybe after this, you could show me some grappling stuff, huh, Mika?
6-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;ruby:=wink.png,Oh, I see at least the leader does what she wants.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru&saidmarker;null_possess:=excited.png,Oh, what a relief! We have the same style--of um. You know! I think you must've just trimmed fresh today, though, <i>oui</i>?
6-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;ann:=embarrassed.png,Oh. I see that it is. W-well! It adds a new element to your career! U-uhm. I mean, in modeling. Not this.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;sayaka:=alarmed.png,O-oh! You're... so hairy! I make sure to trim, most of the time, anyway... er... not that anyone needed to know that...
6-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;daria:=bored.png,O-oh. Well, that trick again. I see. Well played, Daria.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;nagisa:=confident.png,Stay with it, Nagisa. If you don’t give up, you might lose, but you’re not defeated!
6-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;annie:=wink.png,Tell me about it, Annie. There’s just not enough hours in the day… But I find that spending time in the shower to trim and groom. If you feel good, and look good, you can do your best!
6-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight:=alarmed.png,That’s definitely not human behavior! Are you a giant Kwami, or something else?
6-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;red:=wink.png,The Kwami inside seems to know you pretty well. It’s weird that you haven’t transformed yet, though.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;gwen:=alarmed.png,Um. I don’t like the sound of this...
6-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;juri:=alarmed.png,U-uhm. Y-you're just very hairy! Most European girls I know um. Take care of that in other ways.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;videl:=confused.png,U-um. I think I have some questions about why you do that. You know. As a fighter.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;raven:=embarrassed.png,We’re both mixed women, we both fight evil, we both like bodysuits... We both don’t... shave our... er... nevermind.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch:=embarrassed.png,Well, that’s not true, my costume just vanishes when I run out of force...
6-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;streaming-chan&stage;7:=alarmed.png,W-wait, you removed your clothes instead of that hat and camera?
6-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;felicia:=confident.png,W-well, I'm sure your partners will appreciate that, anyway...
6-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;shimakaze:=wink.png,W-well, less elaborate than how you groom, I suppose.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;launch:=embarrassed.png,W-well, that's... half of the question answered, I suppose.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;saki:=alarmed.png,W-wow, you sure are hairy, Saki! (Oh come on, Marinette!)
6-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;saki:=alarmed.png,W-well, I think we all see you now, Saki! (Marinette, that's not what you should've said!)
6-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=bored.png,Yikes. That looks rode hard and put away… um… Wet. I believe is the expression.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=alarmed.png,You can climax just by… Thinking? Now <i>That’s</i> a superpower.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;other&character;mulan&saidmarker;duel_lost:=wink.png,You mentioned a spirit guide… and you're from what seems to be Ancient China… do you know anything about the Miraculouses?
6-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska:=confused.png,You're... You're sad. You're just <i>so</i> sad, Vriska. Come here and let me break your die, and just de-Akumatize you already.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska:=confused.png,I'm sorry, Vriska. But you really should just quit.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch:,count-role;other&character;hermione&stage;9-10:=confused.png,A-are you also going to use magic to do… Um… What she did?
6-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;yang:,count-role;other&character;blake&stage;8-10:=alarmed.png,D-does that make it easier for you two to… You know? Soixante neuf?
6-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;juri:,count-role;other&character;d.va&stage;6-8:,marker:korean_trends=embarrassed.png,Er... Hana, does yours... er... get that hairy when you don't shave? Or is Juri just out of touch with Korean beauty trends?
6-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;palutena:,count-role;other&character;lyn:=bored.png,Oh. Well, that’s one way of being unique.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;blake:,count-role;other&character;yang&stage;8-10:=alarmed.png,O-oh I was expecting to say you had a… ah, fuzzy… B-but I guess this way you don’t get hair in each other’s mouths?
6-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;cammy:,count-role;other&character;chun-li:=embarrassed.png,Ow! I don't think I'd let a friend help me undress like that! (Yikes...)

7-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;jin:=bored.png,I think I speak for myself and the other ladies that I'd be pretty annoyed if you can't keep up with your attitude.

7-female_small_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska&saidmarker;7b:=excited.png,No <i>wonder</i> you looked so good in my costume. You've got a model's figure!
7-female_small_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska&saidmarker;7a:=embarrassed.png,O-oh my. You can really see everything. I'm... Glad you're so comfortable with your grooming habits and chest, Vriska.
7-female_small_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska&saidmarker;7a:=confident.png,I-It <i>does</i> take a certain <i>je ne sais quoi</i> to um. Be so open with your body. You don't have to cheat to make <i>friends</i> with an appearance like that, Vriska!
7-female_small_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;shimakaze:=confused.png,--tits...? I-Er, I mean, this gets! H-ha, yeah! I-I'm glad you're okay, Shimakaze! It looks like you're really strong... (<i>Or maybe the explosions are just for show...</i>)
7-female_small_chest_is_visible,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;angie_boobs:,count-role;other&character;angie:,marker:angie_boobs=wink.png,You know, Angie, it's okay to like breasts. No need to be embarrassed.
7-female_small_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-freckles&role;target:=wink.png,When you blush, your freckles really stand out, ~name~!
7-female_small_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-freckles&role;target:=embarrassed.png,Aww, ~name~ has ladybug spots too! Just, more freckly and less costumey.
7-female_small_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-pierced_nipples&role;target:=confused.png,Ow! ~name~, doesn't that... well, it's not like my ears hurt but... sat's po tensitive! That's such a sensitive area!
7-female_small_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-pierced_nipples&role;target:=confused.png,Y-yikes, ~name~. That takes a lot of guts. I mean. Um. Not on your chest! B-but. Erk. N-not to my liking. Mostly.
7-female_small_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-scarred&role;target:=bored.png,Oh ~name~... I'm sorry, whatever happened to you, I wish I could lucky charm it away...
7-female_small_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-scarred&role;target:=bored.png,~name~, your scars look really cool, actually! I-I know that might not make them less... you know, personal. But they're part of you, and I think that's respectable.
7-female_medium_chest_is_visible=confident.png,Hmm... I weirdly feel like touching you.
7-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;aimee:=alarmed.png,Aimee, are you okay?
7-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;aimee:=confused.png,R-really? That's what you consider underwear?! Why would you even- You're crazy! Plain and simple!
7-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;nagisa:=embarrassed.png,Anpan! Tonkatsu! Hmm... I think it does help, Nagisa!
7-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;daria:=wink.png,Aw... Daria, were you just embarrassed because you forgot to shave today?
7-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;shazza:=alarmed.png,Er, my timing seems to be off... like your top, though.
7-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;kyu:,marker:alya_spoiler=alarmed.png,Er. Is that a spoiler? Um! Ignore that, haha, Alya <i>definitely</i> isn’t Rena Rouge!
7-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;kyu:,marker:latex_catsuits=wink.png,I hope this satisfies the crowd that’s always wanting me to have nothing on under my costume!
7-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;amalia:=bored.png,Forest for the trees? <i>L'anglais est tellement une langue étrange.</i>
7-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;sayaka:=alarmed.png,Gah! That's not supposed to be a surprise!! At-at least I put on clothes this morning before adventuring... I've... um similarly been embarrassed.
7-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru&saidmarker;null_possess:=calm.png,If it makes you feel better, Nayru, maybe you could just consider me your friend? I mean, this was <i>quite</i> a get-to-know-you.
7-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;sanako:=confused.png,I-I'm not sure if I should flirt or ask you to help me with my homework. This is such an uncanny feeling...
7-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;5:=alarmed.png,Oh no, Joey! I-I don't think this was supposed to be the trick! A-and where did your hair, there go?
7-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;gwen:=alarmed.png,--Oh. Well, the sexy way sounds. Um. Less dangerous. And, er. More appealing. Hypothetically.
7-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;6:=calm.png,Phew. At least nothing went wrong, this time, and you seem to be having fun, Joey!
7-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;cammy:=wink.png,She's... You're so impressive, Cammy. I mean. All of you. Um. Your body. And fighting style. All of that.
7-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;nagisa:,marker:battlecry_nagisa=confident.png,That’s impressive, I mean! You have such a good figure, Nagisa!
7-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;juri:=wink.png,They're surprisingly cute for a villain. Juri, when I take away your akuma, I hope you don't feel too resentful!
7-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;7:=confused.png,Well, I've kind of seen these, so I guess that's all that needs to be said...
7-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=confused.png,Well... this is odd, but I suppose if Nayru was okay with it, I can be too... I'd never <i>ever</i> let someone else do this to me though...
7-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch:=embarrassed.png,W-well they’re perky, but you can see your hair… there… and that underwear is...um...not my style.
7-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=embarrassed.png,W-well, that's quite the chest. No wonder people always try to plunder you, Elaine.
7-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=embarrassed.png,<i>C'est tout à fait la poitrine. Pas étonnant que les gens essayent toujours de te piller, Elaine.</i>
7-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;7:,count-role;other&character;meia:=alarmed.png,E-er, Sei, consider sat you’re waying-- What you’re saying to her!
7-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;kyu:,count-role;other&character;alya&stage;2-10:=confident.png,It’s not like you all haven’t seen Alya lose her costume yet…
7-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;shego:,count-role;other&character;kim:=calm.png,J-just surrender to us, not Hawk Moth. Just because Kim and I are having a crossover doesn't mean our villains need to...
7-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;cammy:,count-role;other&character;juri:=alarmed.png,That's so rude of you, Juri! Why are you accosting your friend like that!?
7-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;saki:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_date:=embarrassed.png,Um... S-sorry if matchmaking was a bit... rude of me, all things considered... I just figured you'd look cute together...
7-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;saki:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_date:=embarrassed.png,Um! Saki looks way cuter than she thinks she does, right? Um. ~player~? (I think she looks pretty!)
7-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;kyu:,count-role;other&character;alya&stage;0-1:=wink.png,Whoops, I guess the fox’s out of the henhouse with that statement. Sorry, Alya.
7-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;6:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;saki_date:=confident.png,W-well, up to you, Saki! Consider it a... um... reward! For seeing this through!
7-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;angie_boobs:,count-role;other&character;angie:,marker:angie_boobs=wink.png,You know, Angie, it's okay to like breasts. No need to be embarrassed.
7-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;nagisa:,count-role;self&saidmarker;marinette_ricebun:=alarmed.png,You’re bigger than I expected! This is like biting into a bun and finding a rice cracker!
7-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;aimee:,count-role;other&character;harley:=bored.png,You're insane. And Harley is right here, Aimee. I'm not trying to be mean but...
7-female_medium_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-freckles&role;target:=wink.png,When you blush, your freckles really stand out, ~name~!
7-female_medium_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-freckles&role;target:=embarrassed.png,Aww, ~name~ has ladybug spots too! Just, more freckly and less costumey.

7-female_medium_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-scarred&role;target:=bored.png,Oh ~name~... I'm sorry, whatever happened to you, I wish I could lucky charm it away...
7-female_medium_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-scarred&role;target:=bored.png,~name~, your scars look really cool, actually! I-I know that might not make them less... you know, personal. But they're part of you, and I think that's respectable.
7-female_large_chest_is_visible=embarrassed.png,Ouch, it must be hard finding clothes for that. I’m  not   jealous.
7-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;april&stage;3:=excited.png,Donnie? Oh! You have someone special?
7-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;shantae:=alarmed.png,Maybe your dance is just so distracting that I dreamed the whole conversation up?
7-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;uravity:=wink.png,No extra bug heroes yet! But it’s always great to meet new teammates!
7-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;uravity:=embarrassed.png,Er, cat-themed you say? I think one cat-themed superhero is enough for my life.
7-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;palutena:=excited.png,Oh! I wasn’t expecting...After the belts...Wow. I can see why the statues in your likeness have so many references to heavenly spheres.
7-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;palutena:=embarrassed.png,Oh, don’t be so ashamed. We’re all here having fun, Palutena. There’s nothing wrong with nudity… Except the staring. And embarrassment. Okay, I’m sorry.
7-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;felicia:=alarmed.png,Uh-hm. When I said I worked with another kitty, I did mean another person. N-not something else.
7-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;felicia:=embarrassed.png,Um... S-sorry Felicia, you look <i>vaguely</i> like someone I've spent a lot of time with... Just... Female and not dark.
7-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika:=wink.png,Um… I commend you for keeping the mask on, though. Is that for a secret identity, or just dedication to your craft?
7-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;uravity:,count-role;other&character;gwen:=wink.png,I have a feeling I’ll be making a new teammate after this game, actually... I think she’s more arachnid themed, though!
7-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;uravity:,count-role;other&character;daria:=wink.png,Somehow, I don't think Ochako could go for that. If it were just me, though, maybe that'd even be kinda fun... M-maybe.
7-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;angie_boobs:,count-role;other&character;angie:,marker:angie_boobs=wink.png,You know, Angie, it's okay to like breasts. No need to be embarrassed.
7-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;uravity:,count-role;other&character;blake:=alarmed.png,You know, I think I could do to meet new cat-themed superheroes… just to compare them to my Cat Noir. N-not <i>mine</i> mine, mind mew. Erk--
7-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-boob_envy:2,count-huge_breasts&role;target:=alarmed.png,Nope. Nope. I do not want anything to do with those. I am <i>very</i> happy with small breasts compared to those... <i>Gran tetons.</i>

7-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-huge_breasts&role;target:=alarmed.png,Y-yikes. D-do you ever worry about smothering people when you sleep with them!?

7-female_crotch_will_be_visible=calm.png,Hmm...
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;saki:=embarrassed.png,(I just feel a strong urge to protect her... Especially now...)
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;saki:=embarrassed.png,(I feel such a strong need to protect Saki...)
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;daria:=embarrassed.png,(I'm kind of hoping I get to see it, she's been teasing herself for a while...)
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;cammy:=alarmed.png,Cammy! Why do they keep attacking you!?
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;palutena:=embarrassed.png,D-did you mean to imply you drop them for other people? O-or mostly just yourself?
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;juri:=embarrassed.png,E-er. I guess you really are from Korea!
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;other&character;zone-tan&stage;2:,marker:ztentacles=embarrassed.png,I can imagine more fun things to do involving that than… I-I mean not personally but… Um…!7-
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;kyoko:=embarrassed.png,I have a really bad feeling that you'd be a very strong supervillain... I-I think I should help you unwind before you get too stressed!
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;dawn&stage;7:=bored.png,I mean, most people already know they’re supposed to match... Mine does, obviously...
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=embarrassed.png,I um. Think your friendship reminds me of Cat Noir and his kwami. They seem to argue a bit more than Tikki and I.
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;felicia:=embarrassed.png,I-I appreciate few yallowing--- You following the rules, Felicia, b-but it's just kind of... Not what I was expecting!
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;ann:=alarmed.png,I-I mean if it is, that's great. People like to ask about mine a lot.
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;uravity:=wink.png,It must be super cool to be able to fly or float like you do!
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru&saidmarker;null_possess:=wink.png,Just keep a brave face, okay, Nayru?
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;kimberly:=embarrassed.png,Kimberly, I know we just met but... I've never seen tan lines on someone's... you know. I-I hope it doesn't cross a line if I look!
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;launch:=alarmed.png,Launch matches... um... between sneezes... (She doesn't seem <i>too</i> akumatizable, just... irritated...)
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch:=excited.png,Oh my! That’s definitely magic I’ve never seen!
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;blackrose:=confident.png,Oh! Blackrose, I-I know it’s hard to lose but, hopefully whatever you have is particularly um...exotic?
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;kyu:=embarrassed.png,Oh, here I was expecting some pink hair! N-not that I mind...
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;sayori:=confident.png,O-oh, well, I wouldn't stare! But I think it's great you're happy with your appearance like this! I like to groom, but I think I get really self-conscious about how I look. I'm proud for you, Sayori!
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=excited.png,O-oh. W-well, this is a nice view, even if <i>I'm</i> not a fan of that style of underwear...
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=excited.png,Y-you know, I have to say, I'm understanding the appeal of that kind of underwear...
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=excited.png,At least it's not <i>entirely</i> up your butt, Elaine.
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;red:=excited.png,Or is it something like my earrings? <i>What?</i> Is your <i>sword</i> a Miraculous!?
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska:=bored.png,Or you could roll the die again. I really hope you're not just resetting your clothes...
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska:=bored.png,Just for your consideration: having good luck means <i>not</i> needing to rely on it...
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;sola:=embarrassed.png,Sola, I'm sorry that my original question about the matching is going to be answered... please don't hex me.
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight:=confused.png,T-Twilight, usually that's something that comes off last!
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight:=alarmed.png,W-wait everyone will be able to see your-
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;navi:=embarrassed.png,Um, er, no, not, what you're-- about-- no, I mean, the literal--
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;sayaka:=embarrassed.png,Um, Sayaka, I don't think I've ever faced an akuma like this before. Maybe witches are much scarier...
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika:=embarrassed.png,Um. Just less while naked.
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;shimakaze:=embarrassed.png,Um... is... all this talk about taking on water... a euphemism, Shimakaze? It's... very elaborate.
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;elizabeth:=alarmed.png,Wait I meant running! Oh no, you'll be doing both soon, argh! I'm so sorry!
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;gwen:=embarrassed.png,What?
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;nagisa:=wink.png,W-what, of course you’re cute!
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;nagisa:=embarrassed.png,A-as a friend, court you’re of yute! I- I’m. Er..
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;aimee:=alarmed.png,Y-you're really going to just? Wearing so little?
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;cammy:,count-role;other&character;chun-li:=alarmed.png,...! I-I...!
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;natsuki:,count-role;other&character;monika:,marker:trapsuki=alarmed.png,E-er, what is it you're implying about Natsuki, Monika...?
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;blake:,count-role;other&character;yang&stage;8-10:=alarmed.png,I know you aren’t a fan of… Um… Chat… Jokes, Blake…
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch:,count-role;other&character;hermione:=wink.png,Oh! So like how Hermione has been removing her small stuff. It’s… Interesting you saved it for last!
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;yang:,count-role;other&character;blake&stage;8-10:=embarrassed.png,So, Blake… Um… Shaves… Her… Chat…
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;neo:,count-role;other&character;yang&stage;8-10:=embarrassed.png,Um. Yang, does Neo hate you, or… Like you?
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight:,count-role;other&character;nagisa:=embarrassed.png,U-uh, Nagisa, shouldn't we tell Twilight not to...
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;d.va&saidmarker;d.va_high_score:,count-role;other&character;moon:=confused.png,Wait, is the goal of this game to get naked fastest? Is that why Moon plays like she does?
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;palutena:,count-role;other&character;lyn:=embarrassed.png,Well, two green haired women... Do your... You know... erm, match?
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,priority:306,count-role;target&character;d.va&saidmarker;d.va_high_score:,count-exposed:1-2=bored.png,U-uhm. D.Va, it’s only the high score if you’re winning, right? I don’t really think... Er... Maybe you’re playing another game?

7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-ginger&role;target:=alarmed.png,Y-you know, I did say your hair was pretty earlier but I’d be super shocked if it matched.
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-pink_hair:2,count-role;target&character;kyu:=wink.png,I suppose the other pink-haired lady can show me if it can be natural or not!
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-rwby&role;target:=embarrassed.png,I heard a rumor from a friend that you all shave down there... Is that like, a bonding experience?
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-thong&role;target:=bored.png,At least you'll be out of your thong, ~name~. That <i>can't</i> be comfortable.
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-thong&role;target:=confused.png,I think thongs are just... super uncomfortable. But no panty lines... I think I'd have a bigger issue with that if not for my costume.
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-thong&role;target:=alarmed.png,At least you don't have to wear your thong anymore, ~name~. How a day-long wedgie is at all comfortable is beyond me.
7-female_crotch_is_visible=alarmed.png,O-Oh, I like that style a lot. I think I’ll try it... at some point. T-the style. Not the  p-pussy.
7-female_crotch_is_visible=excited.png,See! It matches for people with non-typical hair colors too!
7-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;aimee:=confused.png,... Did you just... Climax... ?
7-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=alarmed.png,<i>C'est tout à fait le cul!</i>
7-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=alarmed.png,Quite the tattoo, Elaine! You must've had it for a long time!
7-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;blackrose:=embarrassed.png,Between your tattoos...and hue...and...um...even your cute little tangle… I-it might even entice a straight girl into doing… Um… you know…
7-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;lilith:=embarrassed.png,But your tattoos are cool! W-wait, you didn’t think I meant your... piercings or... your... uhm, patterning…
7-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=alarmed.png,E-er... I think it's okay to be excited. I-I mean, it's only natural. Not weird. O-or anything like that. S-so, just yenjoy ourself-- enjoy yourself, Nayru!
7-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;meia:,marker:unusual_blue_hair=bored.png,Er. I’m still not used to seeing women bare like this. It’s unusual to see blue hair in the first place so…
7-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;corrin_f:=alarmed.png,Goodness. Don't you fight a lot of battles? How on earth do you have time to maintain something like that?
7-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;corrin_f:=confused.png,U-uhm. Corrin, with your ears, should I believe that all of your people look like that... or?
7-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;5:=alarmed.png,H-hey! You can't do that! No fair!
7-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;futaba:=alarmed.png,I can't believe you didn't wear underwear!
7-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;kyu:=calm.png,I definitely don’t like to take care of myself like that… But I will admit that look seems nice on you!
7-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;sola:=alarmed.png,I said hex but if you wanted to... Sex... Uhm... I've... with a woman, never... ?
7-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;kimberly:=excited.png,I tend to prefer lots of sunblock, but that looks <i>super</i> cool, Kimberly! I'll have to try the look. We even... um, trim the same!
7-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;dawn:=embarrassed.png,I-Eep. I’m going to stop talking now.
7-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;palutena:=alarmed.png,I-I suppose a memory is words a thousand worths. Worth a thousand words!
7-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;kyoko:=alarmed.png,I-I'm not saying I'll, I just meant that you, I mean, uhm. Want to try on a Miraculous instead? Maybe... a spider, for making connections?
7-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;navi:=alarmed.png,I'm really awkward about this, I can't think about you except how much you remind me of Tikki and it's so <i>weird</i>!
7-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;cammy:=embarrassed.png,I'm so sorry your clothes keep getting damaged. If um. You want, after this, I can loan you some of my stuff? Because we match! In... various ways!
7-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;uravity:=alarmed.png,It makes your breasts look stunning too! Er, you look stunned, um… erk-- j-just keep at it, Ochako!
7-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;lux:=wink.png,It’s not supposed to match for blondes, is it? So that’s pretty normal. The contrast is pretty striking, given your light magic. Looks like you have a dark spot after all!
7-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;natsuki:=wink.png,Just like my friend Alyx! She also has pink hair. And um, grooms like you do.
7-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska:=confident.png,Looks like luck's still right where it belongs, Vriska. Here we go! One more hand!
7-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;alpha:,marker:smooth_criminal=wink.png,Looks like you were struck by a <i>smooth</i> criminal.
7-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika:=confident.png,Maybe after this, you could show me some grappling stuff, huh, Mika?
7-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;ruby:=wink.png,Oh, I see at least the leader does what she wants.
7-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru&saidmarker;null_possess:=excited.png,Oh, what a relief! We have the same style--of um. You know! I think you must've just trimmed fresh today, though, <i>oui</i>?
7-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;ann:=embarrassed.png,Oh. I see that it is. W-well! It adds a new element to your career! U-uhm. I mean, in modeling. Not this.
7-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;sayaka:=alarmed.png,O-oh! You're... so hairy! I make sure to trim, most of the time, anyway... er... not that anyone needed to know that...
7-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;daria:=bored.png,O-oh. Well, that trick again. I see. Well played, Daria.
7-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;nagisa:=confident.png,Stay with it, Nagisa. If you don’t give up, you might lose, but you’re not defeated!
7-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;annie:=wink.png,Tell me about it, Annie. There’s just not enough hours in the day… But I find that spending time in the shower to trim and groom. If you feel good, and look good, you can do your best!
7-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight:=alarmed.png,That’s definitely not human behavior! Are you a giant Kwami, or something else?
7-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;red:=wink.png,The Kwami inside seems to know you pretty well. It’s weird that you haven’t transformed yet, though.
7-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;juri:=alarmed.png,U-uhm. Y-you're just very hairy! Most European girls I know um. Take care of that in other ways.
7-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;videl:=confused.png,U-um. I think I have some questions about why you do that. You know. As a fighter.
7-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;raven:=embarrassed.png,We’re both mixed women, we both fight evil, we both like bodysuits... We both don’t... shave our... er... nevermind.
7-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch:=embarrassed.png,Well, that’s not true, my costume just vanishes when I run out of force...
7-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;streaming-chan&stage;7:=alarmed.png,W-wait, you removed your clothes instead of that hat and camera?
7-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;felicia:=confident.png,W-well, I'm sure your partners will appreciate that, anyway...
7-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;shimakaze:=wink.png,W-well, less elaborate than how you groom, I suppose.
7-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;launch:=embarrassed.png,W-well, that's... half of the question answered, I suppose.
7-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;saki:=alarmed.png,W-wow, you sure are hairy, Saki! (Oh come on, Marinette!)
7-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;saki:=alarmed.png,W-well, I think we all see you now, Saki! (Marinette, that's not what you should've said!)
7-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=bored.png,Yikes. That looks rode hard and put away… um… Wet. I believe is the expression.
7-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=alarmed.png,You can climax just by… Thinking? Now <i>That’s</i> a superpower.
7-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;other&character;mulan&saidmarker;duel_lost:=wink.png,You mentioned a spirit guide… and you're from what seems to be Ancient China… do you know anything about the Miraculouses?
7-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch:,count-role;other&character;hermione&stage;9-10:=confused.png,A-are you also going to use magic to do… Um… What she did?
7-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;yang:,count-role;other&character;blake&stage;8-10:=alarmed.png,D-does that make it easier for you two to… You know? Soixante neuf?
7-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;juri:,count-role;other&character;d.va&stage;6-8:,marker:korean_trends=embarrassed.png,Er... Hana, does yours... er... get that hairy when you don't shave? Or is Juri just out of touch with Korean beauty trends?
7-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;palutena:,count-role;other&character;lyn:=bored.png,Oh. Well, that’s one way of being unique.
7-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;blake:,count-role;other&character;yang&stage;8-10:=alarmed.png,O-oh I was expecting to say you had a… ah, fuzzy… B-but I guess this way you don’t get hair in each other’s mouths?
7-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;cammy:,count-role;other&character;chun-li:=embarrassed.png,Ow! I don't think I'd let a friend help me undress like that! (Yikes...)
7-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;hotsprings:,count-role;other&character;sheena&stage;8-10:,marker:hotsprings=wink.png,Sheena, I have to admit a certain agreement… About exploring. For. Um. Adventuring purposes.
7-female_crotch_is_visible,priority:36,count-bodysuit:2,count-bodysuit:3,count-bodysuit:4,count-role;self&saidmarker;bodysuit:,count-exposed:2-4=alarmed.png,I-it just seems like a lot of work for not a lot of benefit… Does it really feel that much better?
7-female_crotch_is_visible,count-ginger&role;target:=excited.png,That’s so cool, ~name~! I bet you get complimented on it whenever you take off your underwear. Not that it happens a lot. Or if it did that’s your business? Either way, tres belle!
7-female_crotch_is_visible,count-hairy&role;target:=confident.png,Hmm. ~name~, I’m not usually a fan of the all natural look… Many people seem to like it, though!
7-female_crotch_is_visible,count-shaved&role;target:=embarrassed.png,Y-yikes, ~name~, how do you get it so...shiny?
7-female_crotch_is_visible,count-trimmed&role;target:=wink.png,Oh! That’s cute, ~name~. I-I mean, aesthetically!
7-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7,alsoPlaying:lyn=excited.png,See! It matches for people with non-typical hair colors too!
7-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7,alsoPlaying:palutena=excited.png,See! It matches for people with non-typical hair colors too!

-3-male_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-red_eyes&role;target:=embarrassed.png,You know, ~name~, I was kinda worried that red eyes would mean you were something evil... But you're not <i>so</i> bad.

-3-male_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-unusual_skin&role;target:=embarrassed.png,W-well. ~name~, you're n-not really from my normal palette when it comes to designing clothes...
-3-male_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-violet_eyes&role;target:=embarrassed.png,Violet is such a cool eye color! You get the best of blue while still seeing wider color palettes. Um. Or so I learned in school.

-3-male_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;jin:=wink.png,I don't need superpowers to see why Jin's so confident. Though um. It would be nice to have my suit back...

-3-male_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-scarred&role;target:=bored.png,~name~, your scars look really cool, actually! I-I know that might not make them less... you know, personal. But they're part of you, and I think that's respectable.

-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;jin:=bored.png,I think I speak for myself and the other ladies that I'd be pretty annoyed if you can't keep up with your attitude.

-3-female_chest_will_be_visible=confused.png,O-or maybe you're the imposter? I <i>really</i> never liked illusion powers.

-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;kyu:,marker:alya_spoiler=alarmed.png,Er. Is that a spoiler? Um! Ignore that, haha, Alya <i>definitely</i> isn’t Rena Rouge!
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;kyu:,marker:latex_catsuits=wink.png,I hope this satisfies the crowd that’s always wanting me to have nothing on under my costume!
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;amalia:=bored.png,Forest for the trees? <i>L'anglais est tellement une langue étrange.</i>

-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;kimberly:=wink.png,I have to say, I wonder what I'd look like with tanlines like that. They're kind of a cool statement. Very cute, Kimberly!
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru&saidmarker;null_possess:=calm.png,If it makes you feel better, Nayru, maybe you could just consider me your friend? I mean, this was <i>quite</i> a get-to-know-you.

-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;7:=confused.png,Well, I've kind of seen these, so I guess that's all that needs to be said...
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=confused.png,Well... this is odd, but I suppose if Nayru was okay with it, I can be too... I'd never <i>ever</i> let someone else do this to me though...
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch:=embarrassed.png,W-well they’re perky, but you can see your hair… there… and that underwear is...um...not my style.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=embarrassed.png,W-well, that's quite the chest. No wonder people always try to plunder you, Elaine.

-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;other&character;zone-tan&stage;2:,marker:ztentacles=embarrassed.png,I can imagine more fun things to do involving that than… I-I mean not personally but… Um…!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;kyoko:=embarrassed.png,I have a really bad feeling that you'd be a very strong supervillain... I-I think I should help you unwind before you get too stressed!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;dawn&stage;7:=bored.png,I mean, most people already know they’re supposed to match... Mine does, obviously...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=embarrassed.png,I um. Think your friendship reminds me of Cat Noir and his kwami. They seem to argue a bit more than Tikki and I.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;felicia:=embarrassed.png,I-I appreciate few yallowing--- You following the rules, Felicia, b-but it's just kind of... Not what I was expecting!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;ann:=alarmed.png,I-I mean if it is, that's great. People like to ask about mine a lot.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;uravity:=wink.png,It must be super cool to be able to fly or float like you do!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru&saidmarker;null_possess:=wink.png,Just keep a brave face, okay, Nayru?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;kimberly:=embarrassed.png,Kimberly, I know we just met but... I've never seen tan lines on someone's... you know. I-I hope it doesn't cross a line if I look!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;launch:=alarmed.png,Launch matches... um... between sneezes... (She doesn't seem <i>too</i> akumatizable, just... irritated...)
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;tracer:=wink.png,Maybe you should zip over here and help me finish?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch:=excited.png,Oh my! That’s definitely magic I’ve never seen!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;blackrose:=confident.png,Oh! Blackrose, I-I know it’s hard to lose but, hopefully whatever you have is particularly um...exotic?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;kyu:=embarrassed.png,Oh, here I was expecting some pink hair! N-not that I mind...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;sayori:=confident.png,O-oh, well, I wouldn't stare! But I think it's great you're happy with your appearance like this! I like to groom, but I think I get really self-conscious about how I look. I'm proud for you, Sayori!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=excited.png,O-oh. W-well, this is a nice view, even if <i>I'm</i> not a fan of that style of underwear...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=excited.png,Y-you know, I have to say, I'm understanding the appeal of that kind of underwear...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=excited.png,At least it's not <i>entirely</i> up your butt, Elaine.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;red:=excited.png,Or is it something like my earrings? <i>What?</i> Is your <i>sword</i> a Miraculous!?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska:=bored.png,Or you could roll the die again. I really hope you're not just resetting your clothes...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska:=bored.png,Just for your consideration: having good luck means <i>not</i> needing to rely on it...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;sola:=embarrassed.png,Sola, I'm sorry that my original question about the matching is going to be answered... please don't hex me.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight:=confused.png,T-Twilight, usually that's something that comes off last!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight:=alarmed.png,W-wait everyone will be able to see your-
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;navi:=embarrassed.png,Um, er, no, not, what you're-- about-- no, I mean, the literal--
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;sayaka:=embarrassed.png,Um, Sayaka, I don't think I've ever faced an akuma like this before. Maybe witches are much scarier...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika:=embarrassed.png,Um. Just less while naked.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;shimakaze:=embarrassed.png,Um... is... all this talk about taking on water... a euphemism, Shimakaze? It's... very elaborate.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;elizabeth:=alarmed.png,Wait I meant running! Oh no, you'll be doing both soon, argh! I'm so sorry!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;nagisa:=wink.png,W-what, of course you’re cute!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;nagisa:=embarrassed.png,A-as a friend, court you’re of yute! I- I’m. Er..
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;gwen:=alarmed.png,You are so-so frustrated! Frustrating! Gah!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;aimee:=alarmed.png,Y-you're really going to just? Wearing so little?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;cammy:,count-role;other&character;chun-li:=alarmed.png,...! I-I...!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;natsuki:,count-role;other&character;monika:,marker:trapsuki=alarmed.png,E-er, what is it you're implying about Natsuki, Monika...?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;blake:,count-role;other&character;yang&stage;8-10:=alarmed.png,I know you aren’t a fan of… Um… Chat… Jokes, Blake…
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch:,count-role;other&character;hermione:=wink.png,Oh! So like how Hermione has been removing her small stuff. It’s… Interesting you saved it for last!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;yang:,count-role;other&character;blake&stage;8-10:=embarrassed.png,So, Blake… Um… Shaves… Her… Chat…
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;neo:,count-role;other&character;yang&stage;8-10:=embarrassed.png,Um. Yang, does Neo hate you, or… Like you?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight:,count-role;other&character;nagisa:=embarrassed.png,U-uh, Nagisa, shouldn't we tell Twilight not to...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;d.va&saidmarker;d.va_high_score:,count-role;other&character;moon:=confused.png,Wait, is the goal of this game to get naked fastest? Is that why Moon plays like she does?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;palutena:,count-role;other&character;lyn:=embarrassed.png,Well, two green haired women... Do your... You know... erm, match?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,priority:306,count-role;target&character;d.va&saidmarker;d.va_high_score:,count-exposed:1-2=bored.png,U-uhm. D.Va, it’s only the high score if you’re winning, right? I don’t really think... Er... Maybe you’re playing another game?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,priority:6,count-role;self&saidmarker;bodysuit:,count-exposed:2-4=wink.png,Er… ~name~, do you shave under there? Given that everyone else here in a bodysuit seems to, maybe I should see how it feels?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-pink_hair:2,count-role;target&character;kyu:=wink.png,I suppose the other pink-haired lady can show me if it can be natural or not!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-rwby&role;target:=embarrassed.png,I heard a rumor from a friend that you all shave down there... Is that like, a bonding experience?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-thong&role;target:=bored.png,At least you'll be out of your thong, ~name~. That <i>can't</i> be comfortable.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-thong&role;target:=confused.png,I think thongs are just... super uncomfortable. But no panty lines... I think I'd have a bigger issue with that if not for my costume.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-thong&role;target:=alarmed.png,At least you don't have to wear your thong anymore, ~name~. How a day-long wedgie is at all comfortable is beyond me.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible=alarmed.png,O-Oh, I like that style a lot. I think I’ll try it... at some point. T-the style. Not the  p-pussy.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible=excited.png,See! It matches for people with non-typical hair colors too!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;aimee:=confused.png,... Did you just... Climax... ?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=alarmed.png,<i>C'est tout à fait le cul!</i>
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=alarmed.png,Quite the tattoo, Elaine! You must've had it for a long time!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;blackrose:=embarrassed.png,Between your tattoos...and hue...and...um...even your cute little tangle… I-it might even entice a straight girl into doing… Um… you know…
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;lilith:=embarrassed.png,But your tattoos are cool! W-wait, you didn’t think I meant your... piercings or... your... uhm, patterning…
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=alarmed.png,E-er... I think it's okay to be excited. I-I mean, it's only natural. Not weird. O-or anything like that. S-so, just yenjoy ourself-- enjoy yourself, Nayru!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;meia:,marker:unusual_blue_hair=bored.png,Er. I’m still not used to seeing women bare like this. It’s unusual to see blue hair in the first place so…
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;corrin_f:=alarmed.png,Goodness. Don't you fight a lot of battles? How on earth do you have time to maintain something like that?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;corrin_f:=confused.png,U-uhm. Corrin, with your ears, should I believe that all of your people look like that... or?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;5:=alarmed.png,H-hey! You can't do that! No fair!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;futaba:=alarmed.png,I can't believe you didn't wear underwear!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;kyu:=calm.png,I definitely don’t like to take care of myself like that… But I will admit that look seems nice on you!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;sola:=alarmed.png,I said hex but if you wanted to... Sex... Uhm... I've... with a woman, never... ?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;kimberly:=excited.png,I tend to prefer lots of sunblock, but that looks <i>super</i> cool, Kimberly! I'll have to try the look. We even... um, trim the same!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;dawn:=embarrassed.png,I-Eep. I’m going to stop talking now.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;palutena:=alarmed.png,I-I suppose a memory is words a thousand worths. Worth a thousand words!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;kyoko:=alarmed.png,I-I'm not saying I'll, I just meant that you, I mean, uhm. Want to try on a Miraculous instead? Maybe... a spider, for making connections?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;navi:=alarmed.png,I'm really awkward about this, I can't think about you except how much you remind me of Tikki and it's so <i>weird</i>!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;cammy:=embarrassed.png,I'm so sorry your clothes keep getting damaged. If um. You want, after this, I can loan you some of my stuff? Because we match! In... various ways!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;uravity:=alarmed.png,It makes your breasts look stunning too! Er, you look stunned, um… erk-- j-just keep at it, Ochako!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;lux:=wink.png,It’s not supposed to match for blondes, is it? So that’s pretty normal. The contrast is pretty striking, given your light magic. Looks like you have a dark spot after all!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;natsuki:=wink.png,Just like my friend Alyx! She also has pink hair. And um, grooms like you do.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska:=confident.png,Looks like luck's still right where it belongs, Vriska. Here we go! One more hand!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;alpha:,marker:smooth_criminal=wink.png,Looks like you were struck by a <i>smooth</i> criminal.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika:=confident.png,Maybe after this, you could show me some grappling stuff, huh, Mika?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;ruby:=wink.png,Oh, I see at least the leader does what she wants.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru&saidmarker;null_possess:=embarrassed.png,Oh, what a relief! We have the same style! I think you must've just trimmed fresh today, though, <i>oui</i>? N-not that you need to answer that. I mean, I didn't do mine just today. Er... I'll stop now.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;ann:=embarrassed.png,Oh. I see that it is. W-well! It adds a new element to your career! U-uhm. I mean, in modeling. Not this.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;sayaka:=wink.png,O-oh! You're... so hairy! I make sure to trim, most of the time, anyway. I guess being a magical girl professionally really keeps you busy!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;daria:=bored.png,O-oh. Well, that trick again. I see. Well played, Daria.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;gwen:=wink.png,Somehow, I think you’re doing this just to push my buttons.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;nagisa:=confident.png,Stay with it, Nagisa. If you don’t give up, you might lose, but you’re not defeated!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;annie:=wink.png,Tell me about it, Annie. There’s just not enough hours in the day… But I find that spending time in the shower to trim and groom. If you feel good, and look good, you can do your best!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight:=alarmed.png,That’s definitely not human behavior! Are you a giant Kwami, or something else?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;red:=wink.png,The Kwami inside seems to know you pretty well. It’s weird that you haven’t transformed yet, though.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;juri:=alarmed.png,U-uhm. Y-you're just very hairy! Most European girls I know um. Take care of that in other ways.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;videl:=confused.png,U-um. I think I have some questions about why you do that. You know. As a fighter.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;raven:=embarrassed.png,We’re both mixed women, we both fight evil, we both like bodysuits... We both don’t... shave our... er... nevermind.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch:=embarrassed.png,Well, that’s not true, my costume just vanishes when I run out of force...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;streaming-chan&stage;7:=alarmed.png,W-wait, you removed your clothes instead of that hat and camera?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;felicia:=confident.png,W-well, I'm sure your partners will appreciate that, anyway...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;shimakaze:=wink.png,W-well, less elaborate than how you groom, I suppose.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;launch:=embarrassed.png,W-well, that's... half of the question answered, I suppose.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;saki:=alarmed.png,W-wow, you sure are hairy, Saki! (Oh come on, Marinette!)
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;saki:=alarmed.png,W-well, I think we all see you now, Saki! (Marinette, that's not what you should've said!)
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=bored.png,Yikes. That looks rode hard and put away… um… Wet. I believe is the expression.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=alarmed.png,You can climax just by… Thinking? Now <i>That’s</i> a superpower.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;other&character;mulan&saidmarker;duel_lost:=wink.png,You mentioned a spirit guide… and you're from what seems to be Ancient China… do you know anything about the Miraculouses?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch:,count-role;other&character;hermione&stage;9-10:=confused.png,A-are you also going to use magic to do… Um… What she did?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;yang:,count-role;other&character;blake&stage;8-10:=alarmed.png,D-does that make it easier for you two to… You know? Soixante neuf?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;juri:,count-role;other&character;d.va&stage;6-8:,marker:korean_trends=embarrassed.png,Er... Hana, does yours... er... get that hairy when you don't shave? Or is Juri just out of touch with Korean beauty trends?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;palutena:,count-role;other&character;lyn:=bored.png,Oh. Well, that’s one way of being unique.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;blake:,count-role;other&character;yang&stage;8-10:=alarmed.png,O-oh I was expecting to say you had a… ah, fuzzy… B-but I guess this way you don’t get hair in each other’s mouths?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;cammy:,count-role;other&character;chun-li:=embarrassed.png,Ow! I don't think I'd let a friend help me undress like that! (Yikes...)
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;hotsprings:,count-role;other&character;sheena&stage;8-10:,marker:hotsprings=wink.png,Sheena, I have to admit a certain agreement… About exploring. For. Um. Adventuring purposes.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,priority:6,count-role;self&saidmarker;bodysuit:,count-exposed:2-4=excited.png,Unf. Okay. I can see the appeal of that.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-blue_hair:3,count-naked:3-5,marker:blue_hair_elsewhere=bored.png,Sheesh. Am I the only person with natural blue hair that doesn't... Ugh...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-hairy&role;target:=confident.png,Hmm. ~name~, I’m not usually a fan of the all natural look… Many people seem to like it, though!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-shaved&role;target:=embarrassed.png,Y-yikes, ~name~, how do you get it so...shiny?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-trimmed&role;target:=wink.png,Oh! That’s cute, ~name~. I-I mean, aesthetically!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7,alsoPlaying:lyn=excited.png,See! It matches for people with non-typical hair colors too!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7,alsoPlaying:palutena=excited.png,See! It matches for people with non-typical hair colors too!

-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;ayano:=alarmed.png,That’s blood, isn’t it? Possessed or not, you need to be stopped, Ayano! You’re insane! I won’t let you win!
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru:=wink.png,I've only really been naked with my friends too. Don't they have saunas in Labrynna?

-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=confused.png,Well... this is odd, but I suppose if Nayru was okay with it, I can be too... I'd never <i>ever</i> let someone else do this to me though...
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch:=embarrassed.png,W-well they’re perky, but you can see your hair… there… and that underwear is...um...not my style.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=embarrassed.png,W-well, that's quite the chest. No wonder people always try to plunder you, Elaine.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=embarrassed.png,<i>C'est tout à fait la poitrine. Pas étonnant que les gens essayent toujours de te piller, Elaine.</i>
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;7:,count-role;other&character;meia:=alarmed.png,E-er, Sei, consider sat you’re waying-- What you’re saying to her!
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;kyu:,count-role;other&character;alya&stage;2-10:=confident.png,It’s not like you all haven’t seen Alya lose her costume yet…
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;shego:,count-role;other&character;kim:=calm.png,J-just surrender to us, not Hawk Moth. Just because Kim and I are having a crossover doesn't mean our villains need to...
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;cammy:,count-role;other&character;juri:=alarmed.png,That's so rude of you, Juri! Why are you accosting your friend like that!?
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;saki:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_date:=embarrassed.png,Um... S-sorry if matchmaking was a bit... rude of me, all things considered... I just figured you'd look cute together...
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;saki:,count-role;self&saidmarker;saki_date:=embarrassed.png,Um! Saki looks way cuter than she thinks she does, right? Um. ~player~? (I think she looks pretty!)
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;kyu:,count-role;other&character;alya&stage;0-1:=wink.png,Whoops, I guess the fox’s out of the henhouse with that statement. Sorry, Alya.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;6:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;saki_date:=confident.png,W-well, up to you, Saki! Consider it a... um... reward! For seeing this through!
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;angie_boobs:,count-role;other&character;angie:,marker:angie_boobs=wink.png,You know, Angie, it's okay to like breasts. No need to be embarrassed.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;nagisa:,count-role;self&saidmarker;marinette_ricebun:=alarmed.png,You’re bigger than I expected! This is like biting into a bun and finding a rice cracker!
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;aimee:,count-role;other&character;harley:=bored.png,You're insane. And Harley is right here, Aimee. I'm not trying to be mean but...
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-freckles&role;target:=wink.png,When you blush, your freckles really stand out, ~name~!
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-freckles&role;target:=embarrassed.png,Aww, ~name~ has ladybug spots too! Just, more freckly and less costumey.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-pierced_nipples&role;target:=confused.png,Ow! ~name~, doesn't that... well, it's not like my ears hurt but... sat's po tensitive! That's such a sensitive area!
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-pierced_nipples&role;target:=confused.png,Y-yikes, ~name~. That takes a lot of guts. I mean. Um. Not on your chest! B-but. Erk. N-not to my liking. Mostly.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-scarred&role;target:=bored.png,Oh ~name~... I'm sorry, whatever happened to you, I wish I could lucky charm it away...
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-scarred&role;target:=bored.png,~name~, your scars look really cool, actually! I-I know that might not make them less... you know, personal. But they're part of you, and I think that's respectable.
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible=wink.png,My goodness, I’d be jealous if it weren’t right in front of me...
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;april&stage;3:=excited.png,Donnie? Oh! You have someone special?
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;shantae:=alarmed.png,Maybe your dance is just so distracting that I dreamed the whole conversation up?
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;uravity:=wink.png,No extra bug heroes yet! But it’s always great to meet new teammates!
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;uravity:=embarrassed.png,Er, cat-themed you say? I think one cat-themed superhero is enough for my life.
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;palutena:=excited.png,Oh! I wasn’t expecting...After the belts...Wow. I can see why the statues in your likeness have so many references to heavenly spheres.
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;palutena:=embarrassed.png,Oh, don’t be so ashamed. We’re all here having fun, Palutena. There’s nothing wrong with nudity… Except the staring. And embarrassment. Okay, I’m sorry.
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;felicia:=alarmed.png,Uh-hm. When I said I worked with another kitty, I did mean another person. N-not something else.
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;felicia:=embarrassed.png,Um... S-sorry Felicia, you look <i>vaguely</i> like someone I've spent a lot of time with... Just... Female and not dark.
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika:=wink.png,Um… I commend you for keeping the mask on, though. Is that for a secret identity, or just dedication to your craft?
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;uravity:,count-role;other&character;gwen:=wink.png,I have a feeling I’ll be making a new teammate after this game, actually... I think she’s more arachnid themed, though!
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;angie_boobs:,count-role;other&character;angie:,marker:angie_boobs=wink.png,You know, Angie, it's okay to like breasts. No need to be embarrassed.
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;uravity:,count-role;other&character;blake:=alarmed.png,You know, I think I could do to meet new cat-themed superheroes… just to compare them to my Cat Noir. N-not <i>mine</i> mine, mind mew. Erk--
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-boob_envy:2,count-huge_breasts&role;target:=alarmed.png,Nope. Nope. I do not want anything to do with those. I am <i>very</i> happy with small breasts compared to those... <i>Gran tetons.</i>

-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible=confident.png,Are you ready to show us all your miraculous secret?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible=excited.png,Is it about time to show us how wet you’ve gotten?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;saki:=embarrassed.png,(I just feel a strong urge to protect her... Especially now...)
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;saki:=embarrassed.png,(I feel such a strong need to protect Saki...)
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;daria:=embarrassed.png,(I'm kind of hoping I get to see it, she's been teasing herself for a while...)
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;cammy:=alarmed.png,Cammy! Why do they keep attacking you!?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;palutena:=embarrassed.png,D-did you mean to imply you drop them for other people? O-or mostly just yourself?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;juri:=embarrassed.png,E-er. I guess you really are from Korea!
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;other&character;zone-tan&stage;2:,marker:ztentacles=embarrassed.png,I can imagine more fun things to do involving that than… I-I mean not personally but… Um…!
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;kyoko:=embarrassed.png,I have a really bad feeling that you'd be a very strong supervillain... I-I think I should help you unwind before you get too stressed!
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;dawn&stage;7:=bored.png,I mean, most people already know they’re supposed to match... Mine does, obviously...
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=embarrassed.png,I um. Think your friendship reminds me of Cat Noir and his kwami. They seem to argue a bit more than Tikki and I.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;felicia:=embarrassed.png,I-I appreciate few yallowing--- You following the rules, Felicia, b-but it's just kind of... Not what I was expecting!
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;ann:=alarmed.png,I-I mean if it is, that's great. People like to ask about mine a lot.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;uravity:=wink.png,It must be super cool to be able to fly or float like you do!
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru&saidmarker;null_possess:=wink.png,Just keep a brave face, okay, Nayru?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;kimberly:=embarrassed.png,Kimberly, I know we just met but... I've never seen tan lines on someone's... you know. I-I hope it doesn't cross a line if I look!
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;launch:=alarmed.png,Launch matches... um... between sneezes... (She doesn't seem <i>too</i> akumatizable, just... irritated...)
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch:=excited.png,Oh my! That’s definitely magic I’ve never seen!
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;blackrose:=confident.png,Oh! Blackrose, I-I know it’s hard to lose but, hopefully whatever you have is particularly um...exotic?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;kyu:=embarrassed.png,Oh, here I was expecting some pink hair! N-not that I mind...
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;sayori:=confident.png,O-oh, well, I wouldn't stare! But I think it's great you're happy with your appearance like this! I like to groom, but I think I get really self-conscious about how I look. I'm proud for you, Sayori!
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=excited.png,O-oh. W-well, this is a nice view, even if <i>I'm</i> not a fan of that style of underwear...
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=excited.png,Y-you know, I have to say, I'm understanding the appeal of that kind of underwear...
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=excited.png,At least it's not <i>entirely</i> up your butt, Elaine.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;red:=excited.png,Or is it something like my earrings? <i>What?</i> Is your <i>sword</i> a Miraculous!?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska:=bored.png,Or you could roll the die again. I really hope you're not just resetting your clothes...
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska:=bored.png,Just for your consideration: having good luck means <i>not</i> needing to rely on it...
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;sola:=embarrassed.png,Sola, I'm sorry that my original question about the matching is going to be answered... please don't hex me.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight:=confused.png,T-Twilight, usually that's something that comes off last!
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight:=alarmed.png,W-wait everyone will be able to see your-
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;navi:=embarrassed.png,Um, er, no, not, what you're-- about-- no, I mean, the literal--
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;sayaka:=embarrassed.png,Um, Sayaka, I don't think I've ever faced an akuma like this before. Maybe witches are much scarier...
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika:=embarrassed.png,Um. Just less while naked.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;shimakaze:=embarrassed.png,Um... is... all this talk about taking on water... a euphemism, Shimakaze? It's... very elaborate.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;elizabeth:=alarmed.png,Wait I meant running! Oh no, you'll be doing both soon, argh! I'm so sorry!
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;nagisa:=wink.png,W-what, of course you’re cute!
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;nagisa:=embarrassed.png,A-as a friend, court you’re of yute! I- I’m. Er..
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;gwen:=alarmed.png,You are so-so frustrated! Frustrating! Gah!
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;aimee:=alarmed.png,Y-you're really going to just? Wearing so little?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;cammy:,count-role;other&character;chun-li:=alarmed.png,...! I-I...!
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;natsuki:,count-role;other&character;monika:,marker:trapsuki=alarmed.png,E-er, what is it you're implying about Natsuki, Monika...?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;blake:,count-role;other&character;yang&stage;8-10:=alarmed.png,I know you aren’t a fan of… Um… Chat… Jokes, Blake…
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch:,count-role;other&character;hermione:=wink.png,Oh! So like how Hermione has been removing her small stuff. It’s… Interesting you saved it for last!
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;yang:,count-role;other&character;blake&stage;8-10:=embarrassed.png,So, Blake… Um… Shaves… Her… Chat…
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;neo:,count-role;other&character;yang&stage;8-10:=embarrassed.png,Um. Yang, does Neo hate you, or… Like you?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight:,count-role;other&character;nagisa:=embarrassed.png,U-uh, Nagisa, shouldn't we tell Twilight not to...
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;d.va&saidmarker;d.va_high_score:,count-role;other&character;moon:=confused.png,Wait, is the goal of this game to get naked fastest? Is that why Moon plays like she does?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;palutena:,count-role;other&character;lyn:=embarrassed.png,Well, two green haired women... Do your... You know... erm, match?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,priority:306,count-role;target&character;d.va&saidmarker;d.va_high_score:,count-exposed:1-2=bored.png,U-uhm. D.Va, it’s only the high score if you’re winning, right? I don’t really think... Er... Maybe you’re playing another game?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,priority:6,count-role;self&saidmarker;bodysuit:,count-exposed:2-4=wink.png,Er… ~name~, do you shave under there? Given that everyone else here in a bodysuit seems to, maybe I should see how it feels?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-pink_hair:2,count-role;target&character;kyu:=wink.png,I suppose the other pink-haired lady can show me if it can be natural or not!
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-rwby&role;target:=embarrassed.png,I heard a rumor from a friend that you all shave down there... Is that like, a bonding experience?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-thong&role;target:=bored.png,At least you'll be out of your thong, ~name~. That <i>can't</i> be comfortable.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-thong&role;target:=confused.png,I think thongs are just... super uncomfortable. But no panty lines... I think I'd have a bigger issue with that if not for my costume.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-thong&role;target:=alarmed.png,At least you don't have to wear your thong anymore, ~name~. How a day-long wedgie is at all comfortable is beyond me.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible=confident.png,Oh my, that’s... very nice to look at.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible=embarrassed.png,You’re soaked... c-could I get a touch?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible=excited.png,See! It matches for people with non-typical hair colors too!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;aimee:=confused.png,... Did you just... Climax... ?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=alarmed.png,<i>C'est tout à fait le cul!</i>
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=alarmed.png,Quite the tattoo, Elaine! You must've had it for a long time!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;blackrose:=embarrassed.png,Between your tattoos...and hue...and...um...even your cute little tangle… I-it might even entice a straight girl into doing… Um… you know…
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;lilith:=embarrassed.png,But your tattoos are cool! W-wait, you didn’t think I meant your... piercings or... your... uhm, patterning…
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=alarmed.png,E-er... I think it's okay to be excited. I-I mean, it's only natural. Not weird. O-or anything like that. S-so, just yenjoy ourself-- enjoy yourself, Nayru!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;meia:,marker:unusual_blue_hair=bored.png,Er. I’m still not used to seeing women bare like this. It’s unusual to see blue hair in the first place so…
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;corrin_f:=alarmed.png,Goodness. Don't you fight a lot of battles? How on earth do you have time to maintain something like that?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;corrin_f:=confused.png,U-uhm. Corrin, with your ears, should I believe that all of your people look like that... or?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;5:=alarmed.png,H-hey! You can't do that! No fair!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;futaba:=alarmed.png,I can't believe you didn't wear underwear!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;kyu:=calm.png,I definitely don’t like to take care of myself like that… But I will admit that look seems nice on you!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;sola:=alarmed.png,I said hex but if you wanted to... Sex... Uhm... I've... with a woman, never... ?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;kimberly:=excited.png,I tend to prefer lots of sunblock, but that looks <i>super</i> cool, Kimberly! I'll have to try the look. We even... um, trim the same!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;dawn:=embarrassed.png,I-Eep. I’m going to stop talking now.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;palutena:=alarmed.png,I-I suppose a memory is words a thousand worths. Worth a thousand words!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;kyoko:=alarmed.png,I-I'm not saying I'll, I just meant that you, I mean, uhm. Want to try on a Miraculous instead? Maybe... a spider, for making connections?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;navi:=alarmed.png,I'm really awkward about this, I can't think about you except how much you remind me of Tikki and it's so <i>weird</i>!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;cammy:=embarrassed.png,I'm so sorry your clothes keep getting damaged. If um. You want, after this, I can loan you some of my stuff? Because we match! In... various ways!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;uravity:=alarmed.png,It makes your breasts look stunning too! Er, you look stunned, um… erk-- j-just keep at it, Ochako!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;lux:=wink.png,It’s not supposed to match for blondes, is it? So that’s pretty normal. The contrast is pretty striking, given your light magic. Looks like you have a dark spot after all!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;natsuki:=wink.png,Just like my friend Alyx! She also has pink hair. And um, grooms like you do.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;alpha:,marker:smooth_criminal=wink.png,Looks like you were struck by a <i>smooth</i> criminal.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika:=confident.png,Maybe after this, you could show me some grappling stuff, huh, Mika?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;ruby:=wink.png,Oh, I see at least the leader does what she wants.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru&saidmarker;null_possess:=embarrassed.png,Oh, what a relief! We have the same style! I think you must've just trimmed fresh today, though, <i>oui</i>? N-not that you need to answer that. I mean, I didn't do mine just today. Er... I'll stop now.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;ann:=embarrassed.png,Oh. I see that it is. W-well! It adds a new element to your career! U-uhm. I mean, in modeling. Not this.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;sayaka:=wink.png,O-oh! You're... so hairy! I make sure to trim, most of the time, anyway. I guess being a magical girl professionally really keeps you busy!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;daria:=bored.png,O-oh. Well, that trick again. I see. Well played, Daria.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;gwen:=wink.png,Somehow, I think you’re doing this just to push my buttons.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;nagisa:=confident.png,Stay with it, Nagisa. If you don’t give up, you might lose, but you’re not defeated!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;annie:=wink.png,Tell me about it, Annie. There’s just not enough hours in the day… But I find that spending time in the shower to trim and groom. If you feel good, and look good, you can do your best!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight:=alarmed.png,That’s definitely not human behavior! Are you a giant Kwami, or something else?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;red:=wink.png,The Kwami inside seems to know you pretty well. It’s weird that you haven’t transformed yet, though.

-2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;shimakaze:=wink.png,W-well, less elaborate than how you groom, I suppose.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;launch:=embarrassed.png,W-well, that's... half of the question answered, I suppose.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska:=wink.png,W-well, you g-get to see me, s-so, really, luck isn't on <i>either</i> of our sides...
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska:=wink.png,M-maybe luck is on <i>both</i> of our sides... This is eartinly chexiting... certainly exciting!

-2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;palutena:,count-role;other&character;lyn:=bored.png,Oh. Well, that’s one way of being unique.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;blake:,count-role;other&character;yang&stage;8-10:=alarmed.png,O-oh I was expecting to say you had a… ah, fuzzy… B-but I guess this way you don’t get hair in each other’s mouths?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;cammy:,count-role;other&character;chun-li:=embarrassed.png,Ow! I don't think I'd let a friend help me undress like that! (Yikes...)

-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-dark-skinned&role;target:=embarrassed.png,You're lucky to have such a nice complexion! I bet it makes it easy to get a lot of sun! N-not that you would without your ~clothing~, of course!

-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,count-mystery_inc&role;target:=calm.png,~name~, I get the feeling you’re used to unraveling mysteries of the supernatural variety... Like your current outfit, maybe there’s more than it seems?
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-pale_eyes&role;target:=embarrassed.png,Huh. I don't think I've seen eyes that color before. N-not in person, anyway.

-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-unusual_skin&role;target:=embarrassed.png,W-well. ~name~, you're n-not really from my normal palette when it comes to designing clothes...
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-violet_eyes&role;target:=embarrassed.png,Violet is such a cool eye color! You get the best of blue while still seeing wider color palettes. Um. Or so I learned in school.
-1-male_chest_is_visible=wink.png,You look like you have a strong chest. Now that I'm done I wouldn't mind resting on it.
-1-male_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;jin:=wink.png,I don't need superpowers to see why Jin's so confident. Though um. It would be nice to have my suit back...
-1-male_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;pit:=excited.png,Well, you can add me to the list that like your build, Pit. <i>Tres beau!</i>
-1-male_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;6:=alarmed.png,You’re really going to hold onto that shield until the very end, aren’t you, Steve? The way you hold it makes your muscles look great! J-just so you know!

-1-male_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-scarred&role;target:=bored.png,~name~, your scars look really cool, actually! I-I know that might not make them less... you know, personal. But they're part of you, and I think that's respectable.
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible=calm.png,Hmm...
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;jin:=bored.png,I think I speak for myself and the other ladies that I'd be pretty annoyed if you can't keep up with your attitude.
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;captain_america:,marker:normandie=calm.png,I’d let him storm <i>my</i> Normandy.
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;pit:=embarrassed.png,Um! I'll-- Um! I-I'm actually really excited to see this.
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;pit:=wink.png,Show me what you have, hero.
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;corrin_m:=embarrassed.png,You say this Camilla is your wife? She must be a very patient woman!
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;pit:,count-role;other&character;palutena:=alarmed.png,O-oh. Oh no, I have very much misinterpreted this relationship. I am so sorry.

-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-small_penis&role;target:=embarrassed.png,(I'm hoping ~name~'s a grower and not a shower about now...)
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-small_penis&role;target:=embarrassed.png,(I can make do with a lot, but sometimes is it so wrong to want just a big, fat...)
-1-male_small_crotch_is_visible=bored.png,If that were a lucky charm I'm sure someone could find a use for it? Someone else.
-1-male_small_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;corrin_m:=bored.png,Um. I suppose style and skill count for more? You’re not my type, Corrin, but you should be proud of who you are!
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=alarmed.png,It would’ve been nice to see earlier.
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;pit:=alarmed.png,Hm... I think I see a powerup I know <i>I</i> wouldn't mind getting familiar with. E-er. It's over there! Behind Pit's... That's why I'm staring! W-where I'm staring!
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,priority:0,count-circumcised&role;target:=confident.png,Hmm... I will say, <i>that</i> type of um. Appearance is certainly not without appeal.
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,priority:0,count-uncircumcised&role;target:=embarrassed.png,I um. Haven't seen many, but I will say that's the type of equipment I'm used to um. Practicing... designs with?

-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible=confused.png,Yikes.
-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,count-role;other&character;nagisa:,marker:ztentacles=alarmed.png,I-I wouldn’t follow that line of logic if I were, Nagisa! I’ve heard that Japanese schoolgirls are very vulnerable to those kinds of things!
-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;captain_america:=alarmed.png,Oh. My. God. Wait. Wait! Did I say that <i>out loud?</i> In <i>English</i>? Um! Can everyone just forget they heard that! P-please?
-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;jin:=excited.png,Say, Jin, does-- um... does that special power of yours see where I'll be in about forty minutes? Need a hint?
-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;jin:=wink.png,You know, you're lucky I'm such a brave hero and up to all kinds of tests. Want to see if that works like a normal one, Jin?
-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,count-role;other&character;aella:=wink.png,You know, Aella, I think you're the only woman I've met who could handle something like that. Um. Without breaking, anyway.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible=calm.png,In Paris a lot of our statues are topless, and many advocate for “freeing the nipple.”
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible=confused.png,O-or maybe you're the imposter? I <i>really</i> never liked illusion powers.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;juri&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,(<i>Oh dear. I kind of want to see them... she's just... </i>so<i> forward!</i>)
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska:=confused.png,(I know what it's like to have a bunch of magic you aren't sure what to do with... I should try and be a little nicer, if just to make her lower her guard so I can break that die of hers and release the akuma.)
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska:=confused.png,(She puts up a tough act. But she's probably just scared and really insecure... I can't even tell if she's Akumatized. I mostly just... Feel bad for her. I should be a little nicer.)
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;sanako:=wink.png,As long as you don't leave things in the oven too long, I can see people liking fluffy pastries like those, Sanako!
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika:=embarrassed.png,At least I had clothes on underneath…
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=confused.png,Did someone shame you for your body? Is that why you're like this?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=alarmed.png,E-er, did you just... Slice that pretty set of underwear?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=alarmed.png,Um! I'm glad you didn't hurt him, but you've hurt your bra, Elaine!
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;felicia:=embarrassed.png,H-hey! Sait a wecond! W-wait a second! Were you naked this whole time!?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;felicia:=embarrassed.png,H-hold on there, Felicia! W-what are you--?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;navi:=alarmed.png,Hmm... And to think, I've offered to make her clothes so many times...
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight:=confident.png,Hmm... That's an interesting trick, Twilight. I'm glad you're staying modest!

-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;6:=wink.png,I wonder if it's a French thing...
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;shantae:=alarmed.png,I’m sorry, it seems you… Um, have gotten rather naked.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;shimakaze:=embarrassed.png,I-I hope that my Lucky Charm can save you if this--
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=alarmed.png,I-I really don't think you should be destroying her clothing, though! It's not super fancy, but that doesn't mean it's not without value!
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;ayano:=alarmed.png,Is... IS THAT BLOOD?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;ayano:=alarmed.png,That’s blood, isn’t it? Possessed or not, you need to be stopped, Ayano! You’re insane! I won’t let you win!
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru:=wink.png,I've only really been naked with my friends too. Don't they have saunas in Labrynna?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=embarrassed.png,Moon, we can already see…
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch:=wink.png,Oh! I do. Your breasts are--
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;gwen:=excited.png,Oh, so there’s a good twist, right--
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,Okay so... I guess the next part is easy... unless you have a rabbit coming out or something!
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;4:=excited.png,O-okay, I am kind of interesting in seeing this magic trick, if I'm being honest...
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;kyu:=excited.png,Oooh! I don’t usually get to see <i>other</i> people do that! Well, Alya a few times…

-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;shazza:=embarrassed.png,Shazza, you're a lot bigger in person than I expected! I just hadn't gotten the chance to say it.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;daria:=embarrassed.png,Try having two identities and a bunch of friends with crushes on each other, if you want complicated.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;kim:=confident.png,What’s the sitch Kim? Just comparing catchphrases!
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;kim:=calm.png,Don’t bug out, Kim...Just compare our catchphrases!

-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,You can say that again. I know probably <i>un peu trop dans ce moi</i> costume.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;kimberly:=embarrassed.png,Y-yeah. At least your tanlines are cute!
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;saki&stage;5:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;saki_date:=wink.png,(No vous sente pas gene!) How about we go shopping? You seem to care a lot about your school uniform, but maybe there's other cute clothes you'd like?

-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-pink_hair:2,count-role;target&character;kyu:=wink.png,I suppose the other pink-haired lady can show me if it can be natural or not!
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-rwby&role;target:=embarrassed.png,I heard a rumor from a friend that you all shave down there... Is that like, a bonding experience?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-thong&role;target:=bored.png,At least you'll be out of your thong, ~name~. That <i>can't</i> be comfortable.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-thong&role;target:=confused.png,I think thongs are just... super uncomfortable. But no panty lines... I think I'd have a bigger issue with that if not for my costume.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-thong&role;target:=alarmed.png,At least you don't have to wear your thong anymore, ~name~. How a day-long wedgie is at all comfortable is beyond me.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible=excited.png,Hmm, that's not what I imagined when I was playing with myself.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible=excited.png,See! It matches for people with non-typical hair colors too!

-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;meia:,marker:unusual_blue_hair=bored.png,Er. I’m still not used to seeing women bare like this. It’s unusual to see blue hair in the first place so…
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;corrin_f:=alarmed.png,Goodness. Don't you fight a lot of battles? How on earth do you have time to maintain something like that?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;corrin_f:=confused.png,U-uhm. Corrin, with your ears, should I believe that all of your people look like that... or?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;5:=alarmed.png,H-hey! You can't do that! No fair!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;futaba:=alarmed.png,I can't believe you didn't wear underwear!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;kyu:=calm.png,I definitely don’t like to take care of myself like that… But I will admit that look seems nice on you!

-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;kimberly:=excited.png,I tend to prefer lots of sunblock, but that looks <i>super</i> cool, Kimberly! I'll have to try the look. We even... um, trim the same!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;dawn:=embarrassed.png,I-Eep. I’m going to stop talking now.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;palutena:=alarmed.png,I-I suppose a memory is words a thousand worths. Worth a thousand words!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;kyoko:=alarmed.png,I-I'm not saying I'll, I just meant that you, I mean, uhm. Want to try on a Miraculous instead? Maybe... a spider, for making connections?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;navi:=alarmed.png,I'm really awkward about this, I can't think about you except how much you remind me of Tikki and it's so <i>weird</i>!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;cammy:=embarrassed.png,I'm so sorry your clothes keep getting damaged. If um. You want, after this, I can loan you some of my stuff? Because we match! In... various ways!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;uravity:=alarmed.png,It makes your breasts look stunning too! Er, you look stunned, um… erk-- j-just keep at it, Ochako!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;lux:=wink.png,It’s not supposed to match for blondes, is it? So that’s pretty normal. The contrast is pretty striking, given your light magic. Looks like you have a dark spot after all!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;natsuki:=wink.png,Just like my friend Alyx! She also has pink hair. And um, grooms like you do.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;alpha:,marker:smooth_criminal=wink.png,Looks like you were struck by a <i>smooth</i> criminal.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika:=confident.png,Maybe after this, you could show me some grappling stuff, huh, Mika?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;ruby:=wink.png,Oh, I see at least the leader does what she wants.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru&saidmarker;null_possess:=embarrassed.png,Oh, what a relief! We have the same style! I think you must've just trimmed fresh today, though, <i>oui</i>? N-not that you need to answer that. I mean, I didn't do mine just today. Er... I'll stop now.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;ann:=embarrassed.png,Oh. I see that it is. W-well! It adds a new element to your career! U-uhm. I mean, in modeling. Not this.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;sayaka:=wink.png,O-oh! You're... so hairy! I make sure to trim, most of the time, anyway. I guess being a magical girl professionally really keeps you busy!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;daria:=bored.png,O-oh. Well, that trick again. I see. Well played, Daria.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;gwen:=wink.png,Somehow, I think you’re doing this just to push my buttons.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;nagisa:=confident.png,Stay with it, Nagisa. If you don’t give up, you might lose, but you’re not defeated!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;annie:=wink.png,Tell me about it, Annie. There’s just not enough hours in the day… But I find that spending time in the shower to trim and groom. If you feel good, and look good, you can do your best!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight:=alarmed.png,That’s definitely not human behavior! Are you a giant Kwami, or something else?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;red:=wink.png,The Kwami inside seems to know you pretty well. It’s weird that you haven’t transformed yet, though.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;juri:=alarmed.png,U-uhm. Y-you're just very hairy! Most European girls I know um. Take care of that in other ways.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;videl:=confused.png,U-um. I think I have some questions about why you do that. You know. As a fighter.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;raven:=embarrassed.png,We’re both mixed women, we both fight evil, we both like bodysuits... We both don’t... shave our... er... nevermind.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch:=embarrassed.png,Well, that’s not true, my costume just vanishes when I run out of force…
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;streaming-chan&stage;7:=alarmed.png,W-wait, you removed your clothes instead of that hat and camera?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;felicia:=confident.png,W-well, I'm sure your partners will appreciate that, anyway...
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;shimakaze:=wink.png,W-well, less elaborate than how you groom, I suppose.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;launch:=embarrassed.png,W-well, that's... half of the question answered, I suppose.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska:=wink.png,W-well, you g-get to see me, s-so, really, luck isn't on <i>either</i> of our sides...
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska:=wink.png,M-maybe luck is on <i>both</i> of our sides... This is eartinly chexiting... certainly exciting!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;saki:=alarmed.png,W-wow, you sure are hairy, Saki! (Oh come on, Marinette!)
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;saki:=alarmed.png,W-well, I think we all see you now, Saki! (Marinette, that's not what you should've said!)
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=bored.png,Yikes. That looks rode hard and put away… um… Wet. I believe is the expression.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=alarmed.png,You can climax just by… Thinking? Now <i>That’s</i> a superpower.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;other&character;mulan&saidmarker;duel_lost:=wink.png,You mentioned a spirit guide… and you're from what seems to be Ancient China… do you know anything about the Miraculouses?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch:,count-role;other&character;hermione&stage;9-10:=confused.png,A-are you also going to use magic to do… Um… What she did?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;yang:,count-role;other&character;blake&stage;8-10:=alarmed.png,D-does that make it easier for you two to… You know? Soixante neuf?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;juri:,count-role;other&character;d.va&stage;6-8:,marker:korean_trends=embarrassed.png,Er... Hana, does yours... er... get that hairy when you don't shave? Or is Juri just out of touch with Korean beauty trends?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;palutena:,count-role;other&character;lyn:=bored.png,Oh. Well, that’s one way of being unique.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;blake:,count-role;other&character;yang&stage;8-10:=alarmed.png,O-oh I was expecting to say you had a… ah, fuzzy… B-but I guess this way you don’t get hair in each other’s mouths?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;cammy:,count-role;other&character;chun-li:=embarrassed.png,Ow! I don't think I'd let a friend help me undress like that! (Yikes...)
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;hotsprings:,count-role;other&character;sheena&stage;8-10:,marker:hotsprings=wink.png,Sheena, I have to admit a certain agreement… About exploring. For. Um. Adventuring purposes.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,priority:6,count-role;self&saidmarker;bodysuit:,count-exposed:2-4=excited.png,Unf. Okay. I can see the appeal of that.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-blue_hair:3,count-naked:3-5,marker:blue_hair_elsewhere=bored.png,Sheesh. Am I the only person with natural blue hair that doesn't... Ugh...
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-hairy&role;target:=confident.png,Mmf. I wouldn’t mind running my fingers in that, i-if I were honest.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-shaved&role;target:=embarrassed.png,Ouch. T-though I would… Rather not do that myself, c-could I see how that feels? W-with my… fingers, of course!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-trimmed&role;target:=wink.png,Yes! How do you maintain that, ~name~? It looks really classy! I would know!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7,alsoPlaying:lyn=excited.png,See! It matches for people with non-typical hair colors too!

#OPPONENT MASTURBATING
#When an opponent is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must pay the penalty by masturbating in front of everyone.
#The "must_masturbate" line is for just before it happens, and the "start_masturbating" line immediately follows.
#The "masturbating" line will be spoken a little after the opponent has started but before they climax.

4-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch:,count-role;other&character;zizou&stage;0-7:=confused.png,Zizou, is this Scarlet Witch Magic, or do Dark Witches learn it too?
4-female_start_masturbating,count-silent&role;target:=alarmed.png,I-I’m sorry, that was a poor choice of words on my part. Not that you’re lacking in words and... oh... wow, this is really cool to watch.

#SELF MASTURBATING
#If your character is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must masturbate.
#These lines only come up in the relevant stages, so you don't need to include the stage numbers here. Just remember which stage is which when you make the images. The "starting" image is still in the naked stage.
#The "finished_masturbating" line will repeat many times if the game is not yet finished. This plays as opponents comment on the how good their hands are.

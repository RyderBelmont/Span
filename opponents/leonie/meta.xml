    <description>Leonie is a student of the Officers Academy who hails from the Leicester Alliance, and is thus a member of the Golden Deer house. She is a hunter's daughter from the village of Sauin, and wishes to become a mercenary like Jeralt, the 'Blade Breaker'. Competitive and emotionally honest, Leonie doesn't hold back.</description>

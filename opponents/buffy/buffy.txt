#You can have more than one start line, but make_xml won't pick them up automatically and they must be added manually after the xml is generated.

#CLOTHING
#Items of clothing should be listed here in order of removal.
#The values are formal name, lower case name, how much they cover, what they cover
#Please do not put spaces around the commas.
#How much they cover = important (covering nudity), major (a lot of skin), minor (small amount of skin), extra (accessories, boots, etc)
#What they cover = upper (upper body), lower (lower body), other (neither).
#There must be 2-8 entries, and at least one "important" piece of clothing on each of the upper and lower locations.
#Below is an example of Rosalina's clothing. Please adjust these values to match your character's clothing.
clothes=Jacket,jacket,minor,upper
clothes=Shoes,shoes,minor,lower
clothes=Socks,socks,minor,lower
clothes=Necklace,necklace,extra,other
clothes=Bra,bra,major,upper
clothes=Pants,pants,major,lower
clothes=Top,top,important,upper
clothes=Panties,panties,important,lower

#Notes on dialogue
#All lines that start with a # symbol are comments and will be ignored by the tool that converts this file into a xml file for the game.
#Where more than one line has an identical type, like "swap_cards" and "swap_cards", the game will randomly select one of these lines each time the character is in that situation.
#A character goes through multiple stages as they undress. The stage number starts at zero and indicates how many layers they have removed. Special stage numbers are used when they are nude (-3), masturbating (-2), and finished (-1).
#Line types that start with a number will only display during that stage. The will override any numberless stage-generic lines. For example, in stage 4 "4-swap_cards" will be used over "swap_cards" if it is not blank here. Giving a character unique dialogue for each stage is an effective way of showing their changing openness/shyness as the game progresses.
#You can combine the above points and make multiple lines for a particular situation in a particular stage, like "4-swap_cards" and "4-swap_cards".
#Some special words can be used that will be substituted by the game for context-appropriate ones: ~name~ is the name of the character they're speaking to, but this only works if someone else is in focus. ~clothing~ is the type of clothing that is being removed by another player. ~Clothing~ is almost the same, but it starts with a capital letter in case you want to start a sentence with it.
#Lines can be written that are only spoken when specific other characters are present. For a detailed explanation, read this guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/spnati/comments/6nhaj0/the_easy_way_to_write_targeted_lines/
#Example emotions are sometimes used in the lines below, but you can replace these as needed. Your specified emotions should match your posed image names. If you don't have posed images yet, you can write the dialogue first and fill these in later.
#The template below presumes that your character has a full eight layers of clothing. Remove unneeded stages if your character has fewer layers.



#EXCHANGING CARDS
#This is what a character says while they're exchanging cards.
#The game will automatically put a display a number between 0-5 where you write ~cards~.
#These lines display on the screen for only a brief time, so it is important to make them short enough to read at a glance.
#The lines written here are examples only and should be replaced.
swap_cards=I'll take ~cards~.
swap_cards=~cards~, please!
swap_cards=calm,Give me ~cards~.
swap_cards=calm,Let's say ~cards~ this time.



#HAND QUALITY
#These lines appear each round when a character is commenting on how good or bad their hand is.
#The lines written here are examples only and should be replaced.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

#The character thinks they have a good hand

0-stripping=stripping,Let me just take off my jacket.
1-stripped=happy,Why waste time being all shy and worrying about if you're gonna laugh at me. Seize the moment, 'cause tomorrow we might be dead, you know?

#losing shoes (minor)
1-must_strip_winning=sassy,Slaying entails certain sacrifices. Like stripping, apparently.

2-stripping=stripping,Socks? No socks.
3-stripped=embarrassed,...You're not loving this choice.
3-stripped=angry,Hey, I'm putting myself on the line here. The least you could do is exhibit some casual interest.

#losing necklace (accessory)
3-must_strip_winning=angry,See? I play. I have big fun! I came here tonight, didn't I?
3-must_strip_winning=interested,I am the Chosen One, and I choose to strip.

6-must_strip_normal=calm,After <i>this</i> I'm going to try and vent a little hormonal angst by going out there and killing a vamp.
6-must_strip_normal=angry,Normally you'd have to crawl on your hands and knees to get me to do this.
6-must_strip_losing=calm,Giles would have a very British aneurism if he could see me now. Which is actually kind of tempting.

#These lines are spoken when an opponent removes a small item that does not cover any skin.
#Typically, characters are fine with this when they are fully dressed but less satisfied as they become more naked.

#OPPONENT MASTURBATING
#When an opponent is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must pay the penalty by masturbating in front of everyone.
#The "must_masturbate" line is for just before it happens, and the "start_masturbating" line immediately follows.
#The "masturbating" line will be spoken a little after the opponent has started but before they climax.
#When the opponent climaxes, your character will say the "finished_masturbating" line.

#CLOTHING
#Items of clothing should be listed here in order of removal.
#The values are formal name, lower case name, how much they cover, what they cover
#Please do not put spaces around the commas.
#How much they cover = important (covering nudity), major (a lot of skin), minor (small amount of skin), extra (accessories, boots, etc)
#What they cover = upper (upper body), lower (lower body), other (neither).
#There must be 2-8 entries, and at least one "important" piece of clothing on each of the upper and lower locations.
#Below is an example of Rosalina's clothing. Please adjust these values to match your character's clothing.
clothes=Jacket,jacket,minor,upper

#Notes on dialogue
#All lines that start with a # symbol are comments and will be ignored by the tool that converts this file into a xml file for the game.
#Where more than one line has an identical type, like "swap_cards" and "swap_cards", the game will randomly select one of these lines each time the character is in that situation.
#A character goes through multiple stages as they undress. The stage number starts at zero and indicates how many layers they have removed. Special stage numbers are used when they are nude (-3), masturbating (-2), and finished (-1).
#Line types that start with a number will only display during that stage. The will override any numberless stage-generic lines. For example, in stage 4 "4-swap_cards" will be used over "swap_cards" if it is not blank here. Giving a character unique dialogue for each stage is an effective way of showing their changing openness/shyness as the game progresses.
#You can combine the above points and make multiple lines for a particular situation in a particular stage, like "4-swap_cards" and "4-swap_cards".
#Some special words can be used that will be substituted by the game for context-appropriate ones: ~name~ is the name of the character they're speaking to, but this only works if someone else is in focus. ~clothing~ is the type of clothing that is being removed by another player. ~Clothing~ is almost the same, but it starts with a capital letter in case you want to start a sentence with it.
#Lines can be written that are only spoken when specific other characters are present. For a detailed explanation, read this guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/spnati/comments/6nhaj0/the_easy_way_to_write_targeted_lines/
#Example emotions are sometimes used in the lines below, but you can replace these as needed. Your specified emotions should match your posed image names. If you don't have posed images yet, you can write the dialogue first and fill these in later.
#The template below presumes that your character has a full eight layers of clothing. Remove unneeded stages if your character has fewer layers.



#EXCHANGING CARDS
#This is what a character says while they're exchanging cards.
#The game will automatically put a display a number between 0-5 where you write ~cards~.
#These lines display on the screen for only a brief time, so it is important to make them short enough to read at a glance.
#The lines written here are examples only and should be replaced.
swap_cards=I'll take ~cards~.
swap_cards=~cards~, please!
swap_cards=calm,Give me ~cards~.
swap_cards=calm,Let's say ~cards~ this time.



#HAND QUALITY
#These lines appear each round when a character is commenting on how good or bad their hand is.
#The lines written here are examples only and should be replaced.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

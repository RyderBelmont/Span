BUFFY LINES

#shocked,Are you-- are you looking at me while you strip?

FEMALE FINISHES


SURPRISE (BAD)
Oh, drop dead.
Don't tick me off!

Mister, you got a lot to learn about defenceless young girls.
Does the word 'duhhh' mean anything to you?
Running now would be a good idea.

No kidding.
Don't even, ~name~.
Point: me. Yay!
I just have to deal.
Hmph. Your ~clothing~ makes your butt look big, anyway.
Tomorrow I'm gonna think about what we did, and I'm gonna blush, and then I'm gonna smile.
And somehow you're still single.
They don't make enough nutella (to make this worth while).
Can't say I didn't warn you!
Holy cats! You're you!
I'm having trouble concentrating.

XANDER
Must you crush all my dreams?
I'm cool, too! I've spent years cultivating an air of mysterious indifference.
Leave me alone with my sweaty, shirtless shame.
This counts as "bad".
Good call.

WILLOW
Give it a shot, ~name~.
I'd like to try something new. Like art. It would be fun to try something so... outside my usual... things. 
The whole point was to challenge myself and try something new.
Glad to help. Also, I hate you.
I'd like to test that theory.

OKAY HAND LINES

Willow: Willow! This seems a little, uh, out of character for you. Did something happen?
Zoey: So, Zoey, you fight the undead, right? Do we have some kind of super team-up or something now?
Kim: You were a cheerleader, Kim? I was too! For, um, a couple of days.
Spooky: Just for the record: I'm the <i>Vampire</i> Slayer. I don't do ghosts.
So you're part of the Scooby Gang, ~name~? Wow, that's... actually kind of awkward. I thought that was just made up for TV.

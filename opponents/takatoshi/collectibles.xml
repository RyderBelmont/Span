        <title>Yakisoba Pan</title>
        <subtitle>Much better than your stupid hemborger.</subtitle>
        <text>A processed food that combines sweet and salty yakisoba with a slightly sweet hot dog bun. Takatoshi Hijiyama's favorite thing to eat. Because he once let a yakisoba pan go to waste after a punk knocked it from his hands, he's decided that the proper etiquette is to enjoy it somewhere alone so that no one can interfere.</text>

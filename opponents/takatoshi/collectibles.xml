        <subtitle>Much better than your stupid hemborger.</subtitle>
        <text>A processed food that combines sweet and salty yakisoba with a slightly sweet hot dog bun. Takatoshi Hijiyama's favorite thing to eat.

        <text>A jacket worn by a male student at Nigakuri Tech High School. Generously offered to Takatoshi by a punk who picked a fight with him, and no violence was involved whatsoever. Be careful where you wear it, lest its owner come to reclaim it...</text>

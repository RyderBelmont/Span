-------------------

BACKGROUND #1: Basic House Party
(Camera slowly pans to Mae and Bea, who are going over what they discussed. They are looking at each other with a neutral expression.)

Bea: "Remember the ground rules we established, Mae."
Mae: "Right. One, no alcohol."
Bea: "Correct."
Mae: "Two, don't accept anything a stranger offers you."
Bea: "Yes."
Mae: "Three, if I happen to get a soda or something, don't leave my cup out in the open."
Bea: "Right."
Mae: "Four, don't mention ANYTHING about your life back in Possum Springs when you happen to be chatting with some college boys."
Bea: "...."
Mae: "It won't happen again, I promise."

(Mae's sprite changes to a determined sprite)

Mae: "This is your night, remember!? And I won't ruin it like last time, big mouth be damned! I swear I'll be on my best behavior tonight, Bea. Pinkie-promise."

(Bea's sprite changes to a slight smile.)

Bea: "I trust you, Mae. I wouldn't have brought you here otherwise."

(Her sprite changes back to the previous)

Bea: "Alright, I'll be off talking with Jackie. If you break your promise, <i>so help me</i>, just... give me a call, alright?"
Bea: "Have a nice time."

(Bea heads off, leaving Mae alone. Her sprite *jumps*, and changes to an anxious one)

Mae: <i>(...This was a terrible idea. Would Bombshell even be here!? Am I just deluding myself. Oh god, it's already going wrong. Maybe just one beer.)</i>
(Mae's sprite changes to look more panicked)
Mae: <i>(No!! I promised Bea I wouldn't drink. Oh no, what do I do? What do I do!? What do I--)</i>

(Her sprite changes to a surprised one as she notices the player)

Mae: ~Player~!? What are you doing here!?
Mae: Huh? This is <i>your</i> house? Sooooo, you know Jackie?
Mae: And you let her host a party at your house? 

(Mae's expression changes to sprite "eh".)

That's... That's weird. Do people usually let other people host parties at their house?
Mae: I wouldn't know. I never hosted a college party. In fact, I don't... like college parties. Social awkwardness, bad experiences, blah blah blah. Ugh, you wouldn't want to hear about it.

(Mae's expression changes to "neutral")

Mae: Hm? A tour? Err, I guess. Since you're offering, and this is still your house.
Mae: Alright, I'll follow you. But don't introduce me to any of your friends, alright?

(Screen fades to black)

NARRATOR: And so, you gave Mae a tour around your place. 
NARRATOR: The entire time, Mae seemed fidgety and on-edge, talking much less than she normally does and flinching when strangers danced too close to her. You can't help but notice she kept glancing at two people--her blue-haired goth friend and a bespectled blonde woman with many piercings, laughing and chatting with a large group of college students--whenever they came into view. You quickly got the sense Mae actually did not want to be at this party, and only came her for one specific thing. But you couldn't tell what it is.
(speech bubbles disappear to make place for a new one.)
NARRATOR: You tried to ask her, make sure she's okay. She remains guarded, constantly dodging your questions or insisting she's fine. You knew from the poker game how snippy she could be, so after a while, you decide not to press further. Poor girl; she's too stubborn for her own good. You know she was kind of into you, though. And she was really cute. So maybe, you thought, you can make this night better for her...

Mae: Huh? Where are we going now?

(Screen fades into a bedroom, Mae sitting on the bed with her leg crossed, looking bemused.)
Mae: Sooooo, this is your bedroom? And you took me here <i>why</i>?
Mae: What do you mean it should be obvious? Give me a break here, ~Player~, I don't know about your social cues or whatever.
(Sprite changes to look shocked)
Mae: H-Huh? Well, I... uh...
Mae: You... You really want this? I-I didn't think you bested me in strip poker just to get me naked. Did you even know about the masturbation rule?
(Sprite changes to look nervous, blushing.)
Mae: ...Right. Okay. J-Just to let you know, I never did this before. Ever. A-And I never even expected to get laid in the first place.
Mae: I didn't think you'd be i-into me. Or anyone, for that matter.

(Screen fades to black, and back in again. Mae is now naked save for her boots, looking bemused again.)
Mae: ...
Mae: I-Is there a reason why you asked me to wear just my boots? Do you have a boot fetish or something?
(Mae's sprite jumps and looks surprised)
Mae: Oh, uhh... That's... Hey, I thought I was the one dodging all the questions here!
(Screen fades to black, and back in again. The player is fingering Mae now.)
Mae: Ah!
Mae: Hhhhh...
Mae: Ah...
Mae: Ahh...
Mae: Mmm!!
Mae: Oh... <i>Ohhhhhgod</i>, that's---
Mae: H-How the hell are you so good with your fingers!?
Mae: It d-didn't even <i>feel</i> that good when I fingered myselllFFFFF!!

(THIS SCENE ONLY PLAYS IF THE PLAYER IS FEMALE.)
Mae: Wh... I-Is that?
Mae: A strap-on?
Mae: ~Player~, that's... C-Can that even fit in me!?
Mae: Where'd you even get that from!?

(Screen fades to black, and back in [AGAIN] to Mae riding the player)

Mae: I... I---ahh---didn't think it'd feel <i>this</i> good...
Mae: ~Player~...
Mae: C-C'mon, faster!
(Mae speeds up, sprite changes)
Mae: <i>Faaaster!!</i> I-I can take it, I can take ITTT---
(She climaxes)
Mae: Okayokayokay... hfff... I need a moment... from that...
Mae: That was....

(Scene changes to Mae sitting on the bed.)
Mae: Holy hell, what a night...
Mae: That was... well, fun would be an under statement.
Mae: It <i>was</i> really sexy though.

(Mae's sprite changes to bashful)

Mae: Thanks, ~Player~... I really enjoyed that.
Mae: Umm... I don't know what happens after that.
Mae: But I <i>do</i> know I want to keep in touch, so...
Mae: Can I have your phone number?

(Mae's sprite changes to a happy one.)
Mae: I promise I'll call you!
Mae: And we'll have a proper hangout! And I actually give you the tour of my town!

(Sprite change)

Mae: Would you like that, ~Player~?

#Items of clothing should be listed here in order of removal.
#The values are formal name, lower case name, how much they cover, what they cover
#Please do not put spaces around the commas.
#"Important" clothes cover genitals (lower) or chest/breasts (upper). For example: bras, panties, a skirt when going commando.
#"Major" clothes cover underwear. For example: skirts, pants, shirts, dresses.
#"Minor" clothes cover skin or are large pieces of clothing that do not cover skin. For example: jackets, socks, stockings, gloves.
#"Extra" clothes are small items that may or may not be clothing but do not cover anything interesting. For example: jewelry, shoes or boots with socks underneath, belts, hats. In the rest of the code, "extra" clothes are called "accessory".
#If for some reason you write another word for the type of clothes (e.g. "accessory"), other characters will not react at all when the clothing is removed.
#What they cover = upper (upper body), lower (lower body), other (neither).
#The game can support any number of entries, but typically we use 2-8, with at least one "important" layer for upper and lower (each).

#Notes on dialogue
#All lines that start with a # symbol are comments and will be ignored by the tool that converts this file into a xml file for the game.
#Where more than one line has an identical type, like "swap_cards" and "swap_cards", the game will randomly select one of these lines each time the character is in that situation.
#You should try to include multiple lines for most stages, especially the final (finished) stage, -1. 

#A character goes through multiple stages as they undress. The stage number starts at zero and indicates how many layers they have removed. Special stage numbers are used when they are nude (-3), masturbating (-2), and finished (-1).
#Line types that start with a number will only display during that stage. The will override any numberless stage-generic lines. For example, in stage 4 "4-swap_cards" will be used over "swap_cards" if it is not blank here. Giving a character unique dialogue for each stage is an effective way of showing their changing openness/shyness as the game progresses.
#You can combine the above points and make multiple lines for a particular situation in a particular stage, like "4-swap_cards" and "4-swap_cards".

#Some special words can be used that will be substituted by the game for context-appropriate ones: ~name~ is the name of the character they're speaking to, but this only works if someone else is in focus. ~clothing~ is the type of clothing that is being removed by another player. ~Clothing~ is almost the same, but it starts with a capital letter in case you want to start a sentence with it.
#~name~ can be used any time a line targets an opponent (game_over_defeat, _must_strip, _removing_, _removed, _must_masturbate, etc).
#~clothing~ can be used only when clothing is being removed (_removing and _removed, but NOT _must_strip).
#~player~ can be used at any time and refers to the human player.
#~cards~ can be used only in the swap_cards lines.
#All wildcards can be used once per line only! If you use ~name~ twice, the code will show up the second time.

#Lines can be written that are only spoken when specific other characters are present. For a detailed explanation, read this guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/spnati/comments/6nhaj0/the_easy_way_to_write_targeted_lines/
#Here is an example line (note that targeted lines must have a stage number):
#0-female_must_strip,target:hermione=happy,Looks like your magic doesn't help with poker!




#INTRODUCTION
#These lines are used to say different things depending on which other characters are present when the character

0-must_strip=happy.png,Heh, it had to be my turn eventually.
0-must_strip=happy.png,Well, this is <i>strip</i> poker. I didn't expect to go the whole game fully clothed.
0-must_strip=happy.png,I guess it's my turn now?
0-must_strip=happy.png,My turn? That's okay, I still have plenty of HP left!
0-must_strip,alsoPlaying:akko=happy.png,If you think <i>I'm</i> huge, you should've seen my father! He was even bigger than I am!
0-must_strip,alsoPlaying:cammy=calm.png,Believe me, Cammy, I know size isn't everything. I've fought plenty of formidable opponents who were smaller than me.
0-must_strip,alsoPlaying:coco=calm.png,If <i>my</i> height impresses you, Coco, you should've seen my father!
0-must_strip,alsoPlaying:jenetta=happy.png,I sure am! I've been to many places in this past year alone! Adventuring is so much fun!
0-must_strip,alsoPlaying:jotaro=happy.png,And you're the first man I've met in a while that's taller than me. It's actually kind of nice!

0-must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu=interested.png,You realize I'm a warrior, not a knight, right? Armor like that is too heavy for my class.
0-must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu=calm.png,Try telling that to my father! He fought in <i>and survived</i> a war wearing armor like this!
0-must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu=calm.png,That's not necessary. My hit points more than make up for my defense.
0-must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu=interested.png,Do you... not know how classes work? Armor like that isn't fit for a warrior. That's something more suited for a knight or paladin.

0-must_strip,alsoPlaying:revy,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=happy.png,Thanks for the suggestion, but I'm set on money.

0-stripping=stripping.png,This reminds me of the first time I ever left the house; the first step into a brand new world.
0-stripping=stripping.png,My armor set is pretty similar to the set my dad wore. Except his had more rounded accents to it.
0-stripping=stripping.png,My dad always said "A true warrior doesn't need much armor. With the proper technique, a thrust to the chest can be easily countered."
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:akko=stripping.png,I'm on more of a quest than an adventure. My friend Etsuko opened up a portal and wanted me to find out where it lead to.

0-stripping,alsoPlaying:coco=stripping.png,No, I bought this set at a shop. It's similar to a set my father got me, but with better stats.
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=stripping.png,That's a common misconception, Elizabeth. Armor <i>can't</i> be heavy, or else it becomes more trouble than it's worth.

0-stripping,alsoPlaying:sakura=stripping.png,Yeah, I guess it was quite a long journey, considering I went from Lofous Village to Paralimnio Village to get to the portal to this world.

1-stripped=stripped.png,Don't let me slow things down. Let's keep this game going.
1-stripped=stripped.png,My dad said "A true warrior doesn't need much armor. With proper technique, a thrust to the chest can be easily countered."
1-stripped=stripped.png,It's kind of funny how no matter what shops I visit, they always have that exact armor set for sale but with different stats.
1-stripped=angry.png,First person to comment how little my armor covers gets smacked! It doesn't affect my defense stat, I tell you!
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:akko=stripped.png,Uh, thanks. Honestly, it's not hard to make me happy, so you'll at least have that!
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:beatrix=stripped.png,You'd better! My dad survived a war, he knows what he's talking about!
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:clover=stripped.png,Oh, see, it's a metaphor, Clover. I don't mean a literal world, I mean it's a a brand new experience.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:coco=flustered.png,<i>Amateur...?</i>
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=stripped.png,I'm sure you could walk in it, just probably not very far. It doesn't require a lot of <i>strength</i>, but it can be very trying on your <i>stamina</i>,
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:joey=stripped.png,Is that what you see stripping as, Joey?
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:kamina=stripped.png,Uh, yeah, I guess so.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia=stripped.png,Aha, funny, I've played a lot of poker too. Er, <i>regular</i> poker.

1-stripped,alsoPlaying:phoebe=stripped.png,I know that. It was just a simile.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:rinkah=stripped.png,Yeah. You can never know when a goblin ambush might happen.

3-stripped,alsoPlaying:akko=stripped.png,I appreciate that, Akko. Though, I'm sure I have enough magical defense where you couldn't do much harm on accident.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:beatrix=stripped.png,I mean, I could've taken off my leggings instead, but my legs get cold easily, so this is the better option.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:clover=stripped.png,Nowhere. I have to make them myself. I outgrew every dress size by the time I was 15.

#OPPONENT MUST STRIP
#These lines are spoken when an opponent must strip, but the character does not yet know what they will take off.
#Writing different variations is important here, as these lines will be spoken about thirty times per game.
#The "human" versions of the lines will only be spoken if the human player is stripping.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

#OPPONENT REMOVING ACCESSORY
#These lines are spoken when an opponent removes a small item that does not cover any skin.
#Typically, characters are fine with this when they are fully dressed but less satisfied as they become more naked.
#Note that all "removing" lines are NOT spoken to human players. Characters will skip straight from "6-male_human_must_strip" to "6-male_removed_accessory", for example.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

0-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested.png,Oh, you were just hiding cat ears? I've had stranger-looking allies than a person with cat ears.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested.png,Um, not to put you down or anything, Blake, but I've fought alongside a walking flower and the Demon Lord of Wounds; cat ears are not shocking to me.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested.png,Uh, sorry but, is that it? Just cat ears? My friend Pernilla is a walking flower. You look normal compared to her.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested.png,Sorry, but after dealing with a formless, mind-bending monster, everyone else looks normal to me.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested.png,Sorry, but I'm not surprised. I guess I got desensitized by the evil, formless monster I defeated not too long ago. He was quite a weird one...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested.png,Sorry, Blake, but I'm not surprised at all. With all the weird creatures I've seen, I've learned to stop questioning peoples' appearance.

0-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1=interested.png,Uh, I guess so...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:2=interested.png,Huh. Yeah. I guess that would do the trick too.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=interested.png,So, by that logic, you must be a Ladybug Mage, right?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:meia=calm.png,Oh, so it's just a decoration? It sure looks like it has a purpose.

1-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=interested.png,Oh! Uh, is she going to come back?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=interested.png,Oh! Uh, should we just continue without her?...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:bracelets=calm.png,Oh, well, that's cool too, I guess.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0=interested.png,If by "get lucky" you mean "get critical hits," then no, I don't get them very often.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1=interested.png,Wouldn't that require your shoes to be small and cramped?

1-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=interested.png,You had to be <i>told</i> to do that? I thought that was just common sense.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=interested.png,You forgot already? Where's your head at?

1-female_removing_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:5=calm.png,Yeah, I guess you could say that.

1-female_removing_accessory,target:ribbon_girl,targetStage:0=interested.png,"Sparkies," huh? Is that just a nickname or is that the word for "gloves" where you come from?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,targetSaying:cold=calm.png,I could use some boots like that, myself. I have trouble with the cold.

1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1-3=embarrassed.png,I'm afraid of what will happen if you roll a 20...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1-3=embarrassed.png,Th-the die can't effect anyone but you, right, Vriska? I fear that it might...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1-3=embarrassed.png,Th-the die can't effect <i>my</i> clothes, can it?...
1-female_removing_accessory,targetStatus:naked=flustered.png,Oh, I didn't realize you still had that.
1-female_removed_accessory=happy.png,I know I'd stall with every single one of my accessories if I wore more of them.
1-female_removed_accessory=calm.png,Definitely a sensible choice.
1-female_removed_accessory=happy.png,No big deal.
1-female_removed_accessory=calm.png,A reasonable choice.
1-female_removed_accessory=calm.png,A perfectly legal move.
1-female_removed_accessory=calm.png,No reason to rush.
1-female_removed_accessory=calm.png,A trifle, really.
1-female_removed_accessory=interested.png,That's a nice outfit, I suppose, but why is it missing a sleeve?
1-female_removed_accessory=interested.png,Well, uh... I think you're actually wearing <i>more</i> clothes now, but I guess if it's up to luck, maybe you'll lose more next time?
1-female_removed_accessory=interested.png,Well, uh... I think you're wearing <i>more</i> clothing now, but since it's luck-based, I guess it's okay?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:alice_mgq=shocked.png,Whoa! Y-your a Lamia? So it <i>is</i> true that you can disguise yourselves!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested.png,Oh, you were just hiding cat ears? I've had stranger-looking allies than a person with cat ears.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested.png,Um, not to put you down or anything, Blake, but I've fought alongside a walking flower and the Demon Lord of Wounds; cat ears are not shocking to me.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested.png,Uh, sorry but, is that it? Just cat ears? My friend Pernilla is a walking flower. You look normal compared to her.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested.png,Sorry, but after dealing with a formless, mind-bending monster, everyone else looks normal to me.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested.png,Sorry, but I'm not surprised. I guess I got desensitized by the evil, formless monster I defeated not too long ago. He was quite a weird one...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested.png,Sorry, Blake, but I'm not surprised at all. With all the weird creatures I've seen, I've learned to stop questioning peoples' appearance.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,targetSaying:HP=happy.png,Good! I wouldn't want you dying on us in the middle of a match!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=happy.png,Well, at least you came back!

1-female_removed_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:2=sad.png,Oh no. That's unfortunate.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1=interested.png,Uh, I guess so...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:2=interested.png,Huh. Yeah. I guess that would do the trick too.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=interested.png,So, by that logic, you must be a Ladybug Mage, right?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:meia=calm.png,Oh, so it's just a decoration? It sure looks like it has a purpose.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=flustered.png,You're really, uh... enthusiastic about this game, huh?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=flustered.png,You, uh... sure are eager to get n-naked, huh?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=interested.png,If you hate the accessories rule so much, why'd you wear any?... I mean, except for your shoes.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:4=interested.png,Um... Moon?... Did you hear my question?...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:2=happy.png,You'd have to be pretty low-level for <i>bats</i> to give you trouble, anyhow!

1-female_removed_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:pinka_start,targetNotSaidMarker:pinka_end2=sad.png,Oh, never mind. I think that was a death threat...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:4=angry.png,No one was trying to touch your things!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=flustered.png,I wish I could say the same. I get cold even in Summer...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=shocked.png,D-did you do that intentionally? You're oddly calm.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=interested.png,This is... really bizarre.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:dizzy=shocked.png,Are you okay, Shimakaze?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1=angry.png,Yeah, you'd <i>better</i> put the knife down!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:chun-li=calm.png,She's right, Chun-Li. The die technically counts... for better or worse.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1a,alsoPlaying:link,marker:VriskaLink=interested.png,Oh, you, uh... copied Link's outfit?

1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2b,saidMarker:VriskaDress=happy.png,You still look lovely, Vriska.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2a=interested.png,Oh. I guess you re-classed into a Swashbuckler now?

1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2b=happy.png,Oh! What a lovely outfit!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2c,targetNotSaidMarker:1c=interested.png,That's a nice outfit, I suppose, but why is it missing a sleeve?

2-female_removed_accessory=interested.png,Well, uh... I think you're wearing <i>more</i> clothing now, but since it's luck-based, I guess it's okay?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:alice_mgq=shocked.png,Whoa! Y-your a Lamia? So it <i>is</i> true that you can disguise yourselves!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested.png,Oh, you were just hiding cat ears? I've had stranger-looking allies than a person with cat ears.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested.png,Um, not to put you down or anything, Blake, but I've fought alongside a walking flower and the Demon Lord of Wounds; cat ears are not shocking to me.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested.png,Uh, sorry but, is that it? Just cat ears? My friend Pernilla is a walking flower. You look normal compared to her.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested.png,Sorry, but after dealing with a formless, mind-bending monster, everyone else looks normal to me.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested.png,Sorry, but I'm not surprised. I guess I got desensitized by the evil, formless monster I defeated not too long ago. He was quite a weird one...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested.png,Sorry, Blake, but I'm not surprised at all. With all the weird creatures I've seen, I've learned to stop questioning peoples' appearance.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,targetSaying:HP=happy.png,Good! I wouldn't want you dying on us in the middle of a match!

2-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:2=interested.png,Huh. Yeah. I guess that would do the trick too.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=interested.png,So, by that logic, you must be a Ladybug Mage, right?

2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2b=happy.png,Oh! What a lovely outfit!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2c,targetNotSaidMarker:1c=interested.png,That's a nice outfit, I suppose, but why is it missing a sleeve?

#lost dress
3-male_removing_accessory,marker:JotaroStarPlatinum=interested.png,Uh, what's "star platinum?"
3-male_removing_accessory=calm.png,Your ~clothing~? That's fair.
3-male_removing_accessory=calm.png,Well, your ~clothing~ needed to come off eventually anyway.
3-male_removing_accessory=calm.png,The rules do allow your ~clothing~ to count as an item.
3-male_removing_accessory=happy.png,That's fine. It's not like we're racing here.
3-male_removing_accessory=happy.png,Off ~clothing.ifPlural(come|comes)~ your ~clothing~, eh?
3-male_removing_accessory=happy.png,Farewell, ~clothing~.
3-male_removing_accessory=calm.png,Rules are rules, and they allow your ~clothing~ to count.
3-male_removing_accessory=interested.png,Well, the rules say your ~clothing~ ~clothing.ifPlural(count|counts)~, so I guess I do too?
3-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetSaying:platinum,marker:JotaroStarPlatinum=interested.png,Uh, what's "star platinum?"

3-female_removing_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:5=calm.png,Don't worry, Blake, if anyone judges you, I'll punch them in the face!

3-female_removing_accessory,target:croix,targetStage:1=interested.png,That's really cool. What are "magitronics," though?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=happy.png,That's the right way to play this game in my book: keep your modesty for as long as possible!

3-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0=interested.png,If by "get lucky" you mean "get critical hits," then no, I don't get them very often.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1=interested.png,Wouldn't that require your shoes to be small and cramped?

3-female_removing_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:0=interested.png,"Earth bending?" You can't bend the ground... Can you?...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=interested.png,Where I come from, ~name~, people don't dress in weird outfits unless it relates to their magic specialization.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:meia=interested.png,Does your monocle really mean that much to you, Meia? You can still see fine in your other eye, right?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=interested.png,You, uh... had to be <i>told</i> to do that?...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=interested.png,You had to be <i>told</i> to do that? I thought that was just common sense.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=interested.png,You forgot already? Where's your head at?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=happy.png,Is your bag magic at all, Moon? I recently started using magic bag myself, and they're really fantastic.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:1=interested.png,To be clear, I'm not afraid of bats, but I reserve the right to punch them if they get too close.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:2=calm.png,Oh, I don't mind at all. Get more comfortable.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:5=calm.png,Yeah, I guess you could say that.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:pinka_start,targetNotSaidMarker:pinka_end2=calm.png,No knife accident? No death threat? I think she's turning back to normal!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:ribbon_girl,targetStage:0=interested.png,"Sparkies," huh? Is that just a nickname or is that the word for "gloves" where you come from?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,targetSaying:cold=calm.png,I could use some boots like that, myself. I have trouble with the cold.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:0,targetSayingMarker:sayla_boots_back_later=interested.png,Of course... I think...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=shocked.png,Shimakaze! Your gloves are on fire!

3-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0=angry.png,Hey, wait, you had a knife? You weren't going to hurt anyone, were you?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:0,marker:SewingMagic=happy.png,Oh! Sewing magic, huh? Did you study Etsuko's books too?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:0,marker:SewingMagic=happy.png,Oh! Sewing magic, huh? I'm a practitioner of it myself.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:0,saidMarker:SewingMagic=happy.png,Oh, you know Sewing Magic too, Vriska? What're the odds that the three of us all would?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:0,saidMarker:SewingMagic=happy.png,Oh, you know Sewing Magic too, Vriska? Gosh, Etsuko's books must be more popular than I thought!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1-3=interested.png,I wonder what the outcome will be this time?

3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1-3=embarrassed.png,I'm afraid of what will happen if you roll a 20...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1-3=embarrassed.png,Th-the die can't effect anyone but you, right, Vriska? I fear that it might...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1-3=embarrassed.png,Th-the die can't effect <i>my</i> clothes, can it?...
3-female_removing_accessory,targetStatus:naked=flustered.png,Oh, I didn't realize you still had that.
3-female_removed_accessory=happy.png,I know I'd stall with every single one of my accessories if I wore more of them.
3-female_removed_accessory=calm.png,Definitely a sensible choice.
3-female_removed_accessory=happy.png,No big deal.
3-female_removed_accessory=calm.png,A reasonable choice.
3-female_removed_accessory=calm.png,A perfectly legal move.
3-female_removed_accessory=calm.png,No reason to rush.

4-female_removed_accessory=interested.png,Well, uh... I think you're wearing <i>more</i> clothing now, but since it's luck-based, I guess it's okay?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:alice_mgq=shocked.png,Whoa! Y-your a Lamia? So it <i>is</i> true that you can disguise yourselves!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested.png,Oh, you were just hiding cat ears? I've had stranger-looking allies than a person with cat ears.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested.png,Um, not to put you down or anything, Blake, but I've fought alongside a walking flower and the Demon Lord of Wounds; cat ears are not shocking to me.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested.png,Uh, sorry but, is that it? Just cat ears? My friend Pernilla is a walking flower. You look normal compared to her.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested.png,Sorry, but after dealing with a formless, mind-bending monster, everyone else looks normal to me.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested.png,Sorry, but I'm not surprised. I guess I got desensitized by the evil, formless monster I defeated not too long ago. He was quite a weird one...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested.png,Sorry, Blake, but I'm not surprised at all. With all the weird creatures I've seen, I've learned to stop questioning peoples' appearance.

4-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:2=interested.png,Huh. Yeah. I guess that would do the trick too.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=interested.png,So, by that logic, you must be a Ladybug Mage, right?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:meia=calm.png,Oh, so it's just a decoration? It sure looks like it has a purpose.

4-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:4=interested.png,Um... Moon?... Did you hear my question?...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:2=happy.png,You'd have to be pretty low-level for <i>bats</i> to give you trouble, anyhow!

4-female_removed_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:pinka_start,targetNotSaidMarker:pinka_end2=sad.png,Oh, never mind. I think that was a death threat...

5-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:0=calm.png,Uh, alright, that's fine.
5-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1=flustered.png,I mean, you <i>did</i> agree to do this, Jotaro.

5-male_removed_accessory=angry.png,I'm not afraid to hurt you if you keep doing that!
5-male_removed_accessory=angry.png,At this point, you're basically mocking me!
5-male_removed_accessory=facepalm.png,Who even wrote these rules?!
5-male_removed_accessory=angry.png,How rude!
5-male_removed_accessory=angry.png,My THAC0 is still low when I'm without my axe, I'll have you know, so you'd better be good at dodging punches!
5-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1=shocked.png,W-what just happened? Where'd your belts go?
5-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:2=shocked.png,Y-your shoes! I didn't even see you take them off!

5-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:3,notSaidMarker:KaminaIsCool=facepalm.png,... Sure... I'm sure you will be serious...
5-male_removed_accessory,targetStatus:naked=flustered.png,Well, I can't say I wouldn't have done the same thing...
5-male_removed_accessory,targetStatus:naked=flustered.png,I-I'm going to let that slide, since you're... you know...
5-female_removing_accessory=angry.png,I know it's just a game, but I don't appreciate you casually remove your ~clothing~ while my body is on display!
5-female_removing_accessory=angry.png,Could you at least not look so happy while you remove your ~clothing~?!
5-female_removing_accessory=angry.png,You're not breaking the rules, so I can't stop you, but I'm not happy about this!
5-female_removing_accessory=angry.png,I hope you're happy with yourself, removing your ~clothing~ while I stand here covering my breasts with my hands!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:alice_mgq=calm.png,Well, whatever it is, it'd better be worth stalling for.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:5=calm.png,Don't worry, Blake, if anyone judges you, I'll punch them in the face!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:catria,targetStage:0=happy.png,Don't worry, Catria, if anyone attacks us, <i>I'll</i> deal with them. I certainly don't need weapons to deal with threats!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,targetSaying:debuffs=happy.png,I'm certain you won't. <i>I</i> can't cast any, at least!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,targetSaying:debuffs=happy.png,You won't have to worry about any debuffs from <i>me</i> at least! All of my debuffs are dealt on-hit, and I won't be hitting you any time soon!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:croix,targetStage:1=interested.png,That's really cool. What are "magitronics," though?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=happy.png,That's the right way to play this game in my book: keep your modesty for as long as possible!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=interested.png,Oh! Uh, is she going to come back?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=interested.png,Oh! Uh, should we just continue without her?...
5-female_removing_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:bracelets=calm.png,Oh, well, that's cool too, I guess.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0=interested.png,If by "get lucky" you mean "get critical hits," then no, I don't get them very often.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1=interested.png,Wouldn't that require your shoes to be small and cramped?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:0=interested.png,"Earth bending?" How do you bend earth?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:0=interested.png,"Earth bending?" You can't bend the ground... Can you?...
5-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=interested.png,Where I come from, ~name~, people don't dress in weird outfits unless it relates to their magic specialization.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:meia=interested.png,Does your monocle really mean that much to you, Meia? You can still see fine in your other eye, right?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=interested.png,You, uh... had to be <i>told</i> to do that?...
5-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=interested.png,You had to be <i>told</i> to do that? I thought that was just common sense.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=interested.png,You forgot already? Where's your head at?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=happy.png,Is your bag magic at all, Moon? I recently started using magic bag myself, and they're really fantastic.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:1=interested.png,To be clear, I'm not afraid of bats, but I reserve the right to punch them if they get too close.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:2=calm.png,I mind a little bit...
5-female_removing_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:5=flustered.png,Uh... Y-yeah, I guess I can say it's been fun...
5-female_removing_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:pinka_start,targetNotSaidMarker:pinka_end2=calm.png,No knife accident? No death threat? I think she's turning back to normal!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:ribbon_girl,targetStage:0=interested.png,"Sparkies," huh? Is that just a nickname or is that the word for "gloves" where you come from?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,targetSaying:cold=calm.png,I could use some boots like that, myself. I have trouble with the cold.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:0,targetSayingMarker:sayla_boots_back_later=interested.png,Of course... I think...
5-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=shocked.png,Shimakaze! Your gloves are on fire!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=shocked.png,Your gloves! They're on fire!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=shocked.png,Your boots! Where did those holes come from?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0=angry.png,Hey, wait, you had a knife? You weren't going to hurt anyone, were you?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:0,marker:SewingMagic=happy.png,Oh! Sewing magic, huh? Did you study Etsuko's books too?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:0,marker:SewingMagic=happy.png,Oh! Sewing magic, huh? I'm a practitioner of it myself.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:0,saidMarker:SewingMagic=happy.png,Oh, you know Sewing Magic too, Vriska? What're the odds that the three of us all would?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:0,saidMarker:SewingMagic=happy.png,Oh, you know Sewing Magic too, Vriska? Gosh, Etsuko's books must be more popular than I thought!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1-3=interested.png,I wonder what the outcome will be this time?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1-3=interested.png,I hope the outcome will be good.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1-3=interested.png,How likely is a bad roll?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1-3=interested.png,What could possibly go wrong?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1-3=interested.png,I'm sure the odds are in your favor, huh?
5-female_removed_accessory=angry.png,I'm not afraid to hurt you if you keep doing that!
5-female_removed_accessory=angry.png,At this point, you're basically mocking me!
5-female_removed_accessory=facepalm.png,Who even wrote these rules?!
5-female_removed_accessory=angry.png,How rude!
5-female_removed_accessory=angry.png,My THAC0 is still low when I'm without my axe, I'll have you know, so you'd better be good at dodging punches!
5-female_removed_accessory=interested.png,That's a nice outfit, I suppose, but why is it missing a sleeve?
5-female_removed_accessory=interested.png,Well, uh... I think you're actually wearing <i>more</i> clothes now, but I guess if it's up to luck, maybe you'll lose more next time?
5-female_removed_accessory=interested.png,Well, uh... I think you're wearing <i>more</i> clothing now, but since it's luck-based, I guess it's okay?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:alice_mgq=shocked.png,Whoa! Y-your a Lamia? So it <i>is</i> true that you can disguise yourselves!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested.png,Oh, you were just hiding cat ears? I've had stranger-looking allies than a person with cat ears.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested.png,Um, not to put you down or anything, Blake, but I've fought alongside a walking flower and the Demon Lord of Wounds; cat ears are not shocking to me.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested.png,Uh, sorry but, is that it? Just cat ears? My friend Pernilla is a walking flower. You look normal compared to her.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested.png,Sorry, but after dealing with a formless, mind-bending monster, everyone else looks normal to me.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested.png,Sorry, but I'm not surprised. I guess I got desensitized by the evil, formless monster I defeated not too long ago. He was quite a weird one...
5-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested.png,Sorry, Blake, but I'm not surprised at all. With all the weird creatures I've seen, I've learned to stop questioning peoples' appearance.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,targetSaying:HP=happy.png,Good! I wouldn't want you dying on us in the middle of a match!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=happy.png,Well, at least you came back!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=happy.png,Don't sweat it, Florina! You came back, at least!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:2=sad.png,Oh no. That's unfortunate.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1=interested.png,Uh, I guess so...
5-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:2=interested.png,Huh. Yeah. I guess that would do the trick too.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=interested.png,So, by that logic, you must be a Ladybug Mage, right?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:meia=calm.png,Oh, so it's just a decoration? It sure looks like it has a purpose.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=flustered.png,You're really, uh... enthusiastic about this game, huh?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=flustered.png,You, uh... sure are eager to get n-naked, huh?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=interested.png,If you hate the accessories rule so much, why'd you wear any?... I mean, except for your shoes.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:4=interested.png,Um... Moon?... Did you hear my question?...
5-female_removed_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:2=happy.png,You'd have to be pretty low-level for <i>bats</i> to give you trouble, anyhow!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:6=flustered.png,W-why does that make me nervous...?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:pinka_start,targetNotSaidMarker:pinka_end2=sad.png,Oh, never mind. I think that was a death threat...
5-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:4=angry.png,No one was trying to touch your things!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=flustered.png,I wish I could say the same. I get cold even in Summer...
5-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=shocked.png,D-did you do that intentionally? You're oddly calm.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=interested.png,This is... really bizarre.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:dizzy=shocked.png,Are you okay, Shimakaze?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1=angry.png,A-are you going to count that? That's barely fair!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:chun-li=calm.png,She's right, Chun-Li. The die technically counts... for better or worse.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1a,alsoPlaying:link,marker:VriskaLink=interested.png,Oh, you, uh... copied Link's outfit?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1a,alsoPlaying:link,marker:VriskaLink=interested.png,Oh. You must really like Link's outfit, huh?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1a=interested.png,Well, uh... I think you're actually wearing <i>more</i> clothes now, but I guess if it's up to luck, maybe you'll lose more next time?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1a=interested.png,Well, uh... I think you're wearing <i>more</i> clothing now, but since it's luck-based, I guess it's okay?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1b=interested.png,Well, uh... I think you're actually wearing <i>more</i> clothes now, but I guess if it's up to luck, maybe you'll lose more next time?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1b=interested.png,Well, uh... I think you're wearing <i>more</i> clothing now, but since it's luck-based, I guess it's okay?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1c,marker:VriskaDress=happy.png,Oh wow! What a lovely dress!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1c,marker:VriskaDress=happy.png,Oh wow! You look very lovely now, Vriska!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1c=happy.png,Oh wow! What a grand dress! I honestly wasn't expecting that!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2b,saidMarker:VriskaDress=happy.png,You still look lovely, Vriska.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2a=interested.png,Oh. I guess you re-classed into a Swashbuckler now?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2a=interested.png,Oh, did you re-class into a Swashbuckler?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2b=happy.png,Oh! What a lovely outfit!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2c,targetNotSaidMarker:1c=interested.png,That's a nice outfit, I suppose, but why is it missing a sleeve?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3a,alsoPlaying:ruby,saidMarker:VriskaLink=interested.png,You copied Zone-tan's outfit now? Why do you keep doing that?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3a,alsoPlaying:ruby,saidMarker:VriskaLink=interested.png,Why do you keep copying people's outfits?

5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3a,alsoPlaying:ruby=interested.png,Oh. You must really like Ruby's outfit, huh?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3b,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,saidMarker:VriskaLink=interested.png,You copied Ruby's outfit now? Why do you keep doing that?

5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3a=interested.png,Oh. I guess you re-classed into a Ranger now?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3a=happy.png,Oh, are you a Ranger now? My sister is a Ranger! Well, technically a Thief, but same thing, basically.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3b=interested.png,That's a nice outfit, I suppose, but why is it missing a sleeve?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3c=happy.png,Oh, what a nice sweater!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3c=happy.png,Ooh, I like that sweater!

-3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1-3=interested.png,I'm sure the odds are in your favor, huh?
-3-female_removed_accessory=facepalm.png,If this kind of behavior is common for this game, then I couldn't play it again. I could never get used to this!
-3-female_removed_accessory=angry.png,Could you maybe show some empathy for the woman standing here completely naked?!
-3-female_removed_accessory=facepalm.png,Is this normal for this game, or is ~name~ just rude?
-3-female_removed_accessory=angry.png,Count yourself lucky that I'm not a black mage, or I'd summon a monster to punish you with!
-3-female_removed_accessory=angry.png,You'd better hope I never tell Etsuko about this! She'll make you pay for it for the rest of your life!
-3-female_removed_accessory=angry.png,Count yourself lucky that I'm not a red mage, or I'd hit you with a magic missile!

-3-female_removed_accessory=interested.png,Well, uh... I think you're wearing <i>more</i> clothing now, but since it's luck-based, I guess it's okay?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:alice_mgq=shocked.png,Whoa! Y-your a Lamia? So it <i>is</i> true that you can disguise yourselves!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested.png,Oh, you were just hiding cat ears? I've had stranger-looking allies than a person with cat ears.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested.png,Um, not to put you down or anything, Blake, but I've fought alongside a walking flower and the Demon Lord of Wounds; cat ears are not shocking to me.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested.png,Uh, sorry but, is that it? Just cat ears? My friend Pernilla is a walking flower. You look normal compared to her.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested.png,Sorry, but after dealing with a formless, mind-bending monster, everyone else looks normal to me.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested.png,Sorry, but I'm not surprised. I guess I got desensitized by the evil, formless monster I defeated not too long ago. He was quite a weird one...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested.png,Sorry, Blake, but I'm not surprised at all. With all the weird creatures I've seen, I've learned to stop questioning peoples' appearance.

-3-female_removed_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:2=sad.png,Oh no. That's unfortunate.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1=interested.png,Uh, I guess so...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:2=interested.png,Huh. Yeah. I guess that would do the trick too.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=interested.png,So, by that logic, you must be a Ladybug Mage, right?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:meia=calm.png,Oh, so it's just a decoration? It sure looks like it has a purpose.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=flustered.png,You're really, uh... enthusiastic about this game, huh?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=flustered.png,You, uh... sure are eager to get n-naked, huh?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=interested.png,If you hate the accessories rule so much, why'd you wear any?... I mean, except for your shoes.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:4=interested.png,Um... Moon?... Did you hear my question?...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:2=happy.png,You'd have to be pretty low-level for <i>bats</i> to give you trouble, anyhow!

-3-female_removed_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:pinka_start,targetNotSaidMarker:pinka_end2=sad.png,Oh, never mind. I think that was a death threat...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:4=angry.png,No one was trying to touch your things!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=flustered.png,I wish I could say the same. I get cold even in Summer...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=shocked.png,D-did you do that intentionally? You're oddly calm.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=interested.png,This is... really bizarre.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:dizzy=shocked.png,Are you okay, Shimakaze?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1=angry.png,A-are you going to count that? That's barely fair!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:chun-li=calm.png,She's right, Chun-Li. The die technically counts... for better or worse.

-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2a=interested.png,Oh. I guess you re-classed into a Swashbuckler now?

-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2b=happy.png,Oh! What a lovely outfit!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2c,targetNotSaidMarker:1c=interested.png,That's a nice outfit, I suppose, but why is it missing a sleeve?

-1-female_removing_accessory,target:catria,targetStage:0=happy.png,Don't worry, Catria, if anyone attacks us, <i>I'll</i> deal with them. I certainly don't need weapons to deal with threats!

-1-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0=interested.png,If by "get lucky" you mean "get critical hits," then no, I don't get them very often.

-1-female_removing_accessory,target:meia=interested.png,Does your monocle really mean that much to you, Meia? You can still see fine in your other eye, right?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=interested.png,You, uh... had to be <i>told</i> to do that?...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=interested.png,You had to be <i>told</i> to do that? I thought that was just common sense.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=interested.png,You forgot already? Where's your head at?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=happy.png,Is your bag magic at all, Moon? I recently started using magic bag myself, and they're really fantastic.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:1=interested.png,To be clear, I'm not afraid of bats, but I reserve the right to punch them if they get too close.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:2=calm.png,I mind a little bit...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:5=flustered.png,Uh... Y-yeah, I guess I can say it's been fun...

-1-female_removing_accessory,target:ribbon_girl,targetStage:0=interested.png,"Sparkies," huh? Is that just a nickname or is that the word for "gloves" where you come from?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,targetSaying:cold=calm.png,I could use some boots like that, myself. I have trouble with the cold.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:0,targetSayingMarker:sayla_boots_back_later=interested.png,Of course... I think...

-1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:0,marker:SewingMagic=happy.png,Oh! Sewing magic, huh? I'm a practitioner of it myself.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:0,saidMarker:SewingMagic=happy.png,Oh, you know Sewing Magic too, Vriska? What're the odds that the three of us all would?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:0,saidMarker:SewingMagic=happy.png,Oh, you know Sewing Magic too, Vriska? Gosh, Etsuko's books must be more popular than I thought!

-1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1-3=interested.png,I hope the outcome will be good.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1-3=interested.png,How likely is a bad roll?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1-3=interested.png,What could possibly go wrong?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1-3=interested.png,I'm sure the odds are in your favor, huh?
-1-female_removed_accessory=interested.png,That's a nice outfit, I suppose, but why is it missing a sleeve?

-1-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested.png,Oh, you were just hiding cat ears? I've had stranger-looking allies than a person with cat ears.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested.png,Um, not to put you down or anything, Blake, but I've fought alongside a walking flower and the Demon Lord of Wounds; cat ears are not shocking to me.

2-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1=interested.png,I mean, it's not really my fault that you look so much like her.
2-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1=interested.png,Like I said, you look a lot like her. I think my train of thought is perfectly reasonable.
2-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=interested.png,I know an alchemist who might be able to help; curatives are his specialty. He's sure to have something for burn scars.
2-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=sad.png,Wait, I think I have something that'll help in my... Oh right, I don't have my pouch anymore...

2-female_removed_minor,target:sakura,targetStage:3=calm.png,Oh! You're undead! I thought I smelled something... dead.
2-female_removed_minor,target:sakura,targetStage:4=flustered.png,I don't know any healing magic, so I can't help you if you can't reattach your head on your own.
2-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetSaidMarker:damage_reduction=interested.png,Oh, that's cool. One question, though: what's a "shotgun?" Whatever it is must be powerful, right?
2-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetSaidMarker:dna_lock=happy.png,Wow, that's pretty cool! Maybe I should put the same kind of enchantment on my armor too?
2-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetSaidMarker:pauldrons=happy.png,Haha. Of course they're articulated, Sei. If you couldn't move your arms well, how would you swing your weapon?
2-female_removed_minor,target:sheena,targetStage:3=interested.png,I'll admit, that's what I was thinking too, Sheena.

#lost dress
3-male_removing_minor,target:jotaro,targetStage:2=flustered.png,I wonder what'll disappear now...
3-male_removing_minor,target:jotaro,targetStage:3=calm.png,That <i>is</i> a really nice coat. I'd be sad to lose it if it were my coat.
3-male_removing_minor,target:jotaro,targetStage:3,targetSaying:platinum,notSaidMarker:JotaroStarPlatinum,marker:JotaroStarPlatinum=interested.png,Uh, what's star platinum?
3-male_removing_minor,target:jotaro,targetStage:3,targetSaying:platinum,saidMarker:JotaroStarPlatinum,marker:JotaroStarPlatinum2=interested.png,There's those words again. Are you casting a spell?
3-male_removing_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:4=calm.png,No. No it wasn't.
3-male_removing_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:6=sad.png,...
3-male_removed_minor=happy.png,Well, at least we're even!
3-male_removed_minor=happy.png,See? That wasn't so bad, now, was it?
3-male_removed_minor=happy.png,It's good that you're keeping up!
3-male_removed_minor=happy.png,Glad you're keeping up!
3-male_removed_minor,target:jotaro,targetStage:3=flustered.png,O-oh, s-sorry...
3-male_removed_minor,target:jotaro,targetStage:3,targetSaying:hat=calm.png,I wouldn't have expected you to go easy on us.
3-male_removed_minor,target:jotaro,targetStage:3,targetSaying:time=flustered.png,I'm still not used to your clothes vanishing...
3-male_removed_minor,target:jotaro,targetStage:4=flustered.png,P-please calm down, Jotaro. You'll get your clothes back. I think...
3-male_removed_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:5=interested.png,That is... also factual.
3-male_removed_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:7=interested.png,A-are you still talking about your... you know...?
3-male_removed_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:7=interested.png,A-are you... still using a euphemism...?
3-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=interested.png,Well, I guess this method does make your item choice more of a surprise.
3-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=sad.png,I don't think I'll ever get used to that sound...
3-female_removing_minor,target:catria,targetStage:1,targetSaying:strip both=interested.png,I don't think you <i>have</i> to, but it would feel more fair.
3-female_removing_minor,target:catria,targetStage:1,targetSaying:strip both=interested.png,I don't think you <i>have</i> to, but it is nice to remove a pair at once.
3-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:2,targetSaying:uniform=interested.png,I... don't think that's how a uniform works.
3-female_removing_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=interested.png,Sure, it's a nice set - I just noticed; you're not wearing shoes. Why wear armor on all of your body but your feet?
3-female_removing_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=interested.png,Sure, it's a nice set - I just noticed; you're not wearing shoes. Why wear gloves, yet not shoes?
3-female_removing_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=interested.png,Sure, it's a nice set - I just noticed; you're not wearing shoes. Your feet are arguably one of the most important parts of your body to cover.
3-female_removing_minor,target:croix,targetStage:4=interested.png,I'm... okay with that.
3-female_removing_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:1=calm.png,It's just your jacket. That shouldn't be so bad.

3-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0=flustered.png,S-sorry! I didn't mean to insult your height...
3-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=shocked.png,Oh gosh! No wonder you didn't want to take off your gloves!
3-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1=happy.png,It's always fun to compare different cultures' armor sets. So what can you tell me about your armor, Meia?
3-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,targetSaying:pressurized,marker:MeiaPressurizedArmor=interested.png,Pressurized? What's that for?
3-female_removing_minor,target:moon,targetStage:4=flustered.png,Personally, I'm glad you have to remove your hat first...
3-female_removing_minor,target:sakura,targetStage:3,id:4=shocked.png,Oh no! Y-you can reattach that, right?
3-female_removing_minor,target:sonya=interested.png,Oh? What are you doing?

3-female_removed_minor=happy.png,See? That wasn't so bad, now, was it?
3-female_removed_minor=happy.png,It's good that you're keeping up!
3-female_removed_minor=happy.png,Glad you're keeping up!
3-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=calm.png,Case in point; I had no idea you were removing your footwear.
3-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=interested.png,You... don't actually have this under control, do you?
3-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1=calm.png,Have you ever tried sandals? I'm sure they'd be a good middle ground between not wearing shoes and protecting your feet.
3-female_removed_minor,target:croix,targetStage:5=flustered.png,To be honest, I wouldn't have been surprised...
3-female_removed_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2=happy.png,See, you look fine! It's just your shoulders!
3-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:bee2,targetNotSaidMarker:bee_stop=flustered.png,That was... Odd. Uh, sorry about your tunic, Florina.

5-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1=calm.png,Have you ever tried sandals? I'm sure they'd be a good middle ground between not wearing shoes and protecting your feet.
5-female_removed_minor,target:croix,targetStage:5=flustered.png,To be honest, I wouldn't have been surprised...

5-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:bee2,targetNotSaidMarker:bee_stop=flustered.png,That was... Odd. Uh, sorry about your tunic, Florina.
5-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:bee2,targetNotSaidMarker:bee_stop=interested.png,That was... Bizarre. You wouldn't happen to have any Bee mage enemies, would you?
5-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:bee2,targetNotSaidMarker:bee_stop=interested.png,That was... Strange. You wouldn't happen to have any enemies who know Bee magic, would you?
5-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1=interested.png,I mean, it's not really my fault that you look so much like her.
5-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1=interested.png,Like I said, you look a lot like her. I think my train of thought is perfectly reasonable.
5-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=interested.png,I know an alchemist who might be able to help; curatives are his specialty. He's sure to have something for burn scars.

5-female_removed_minor,target:sakura,targetStage:4=flustered.png,I don't know any healing magic, so I can't help you if you can't reattach your head on your own.
5-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetSaidMarker:damage_reduction=interested.png,Oh, that's cool. One question, though: what's a "shotgun?" Whatever it is must be powerful, right?
5-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetSaidMarker:dna_lock=happy.png,Wow, that's pretty cool! Maybe I should put the same kind of enchantment on my armor too?
5-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetSaidMarker:pauldrons=happy.png,Haha. Of course they're articulated, Sei. If you couldn't move your arms well, how would you swing your weapon?
5-female_removed_minor,target:sheena,targetStage:3=interested.png,I'll admit, that's what I was thinking too, Sheena.

-1-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1=happy.png,It's always fun to compare different cultures' armor sets. So what can you tell me about your armor, Meia?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,targetSaying:pressurized,marker:MeiaPressurizedArmor=interested.png,Pressurized? What's that for?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:moon,targetStage:4=flustered.png,Personally, I'm glad you have to remove your hat first...
-1-female_removing_minor,target:sakura,targetStage:3,id:4=shocked.png,Oh no! Y-you can reattach that, right?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:sonya=interested.png,Oh? What are you doing?
-1-female_removed_minor=sad.png,I don't know whether to be mad at you or myself for that.
-1-female_removed_minor=sad.png,I guess I have no one to blame but luck...
-1-female_removed_minor=sad.png,I guess it's no one's fault in particular...
-1-female_removed_minor=sad.png,Well, it's nobody's fault, so I can't get mad...
-1-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=calm.png,Case in point; I had no idea you were removing your footwear.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=interested.png,You... don't actually have this under control, do you?
-1-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1=calm.png,Have you ever tried sandals? I'm sure they'd be a good middle ground between not wearing shoes and protecting your feet.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:croix,targetStage:5=flustered.png,To be honest, I wouldn't have been surprised...
-1-female_removed_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2=happy.png,See, you look fine! It's just your shoulders!
-1-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:bee2,targetNotSaidMarker:bee_stop=flustered.png,That was... Odd. Uh, sorry about your tunic, Florina.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:bee2,targetNotSaidMarker:bee_stop=interested.png,That was... Bizarre. You wouldn't happen to have any Bee mage enemies, would you?
-1-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:bee2,targetNotSaidMarker:bee_stop=interested.png,That was... Strange. You wouldn't happen to have any enemies who know Bee magic, would you?
-1-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1=interested.png,I mean, it's not really my fault that you look so much like her.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1=interested.png,Like I said, you look a lot like her. I think my train of thought is perfectly reasonable.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=interested.png,I know an alchemist who might be able to help; curatives are his specialty. He's sure to have something for burn scars.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=sad.png,Wait, I think I have something that'll help in my... Oh right, I don't have my pouch anymore...
-1-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=sad.png,Wait, I think I have a potion in my... Oh right, I don't have my pouch anymore...
-1-female_removed_minor,target:moon=sad.png,I never thought it'd ever be so uncomfortable with someone taking off their hat...
-1-female_removed_minor,target:sakura,targetStage:3=calm.png,Oh! You're undead! I thought I smelled something... dead.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:sakura,targetStage:4=flustered.png,I don't know any healing magic, so I can't help you if you can't reattach your head on your own.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetSaidMarker:damage_reduction=interested.png,Oh, that's cool. One question, though: what's a "shotgun?" Whatever it is must be powerful, right?
-1-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetSaidMarker:dna_lock=happy.png,Wow, that's pretty cool! Maybe I should put the same kind of enchantment on my armor too?
-1-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetSaidMarker:pauldrons=happy.png,Haha. Of course they're articulated, Sei. If you couldn't move your arms well, how would you swing your weapon?
-1-female_removed_minor,target:sheena,targetStage:3=interested.png,I'll admit, that's what I was thinking too, Sheena.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:sonya=interested.png,Face paint? Here? Now? Why?




#OPPONENT REMOVING MAJOR CLOTHING
#Major clothing reveals a significant amount of skin and likely underwear.
#However, as we don't know if the opponent is taking off the top or the bottom, we can't presume that nice abs are showing; maybe she took of her skirt before her shirt.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

male_removing_major=shocked.png,Oh dear! You're really gonna take off your ~clothing~?!

0-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2=interested.png,That was a neat trick, but why didn't you start like this? Isn't changing outfits mid-game cheating?
0-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2=interested.png,That was a neat trick, but aren't you technically cheating?
0-female_removed_major,target:misato=embarrassed.png,I'm not looking away because of the scar, I'm looking away because you're nearly n-naked...

3-female_removing_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:4,targetSaying:HP=interested.png,Do you need a healing item? I think I have one on me.
3-female_removing_major,target:croix,targetStage:2=interested.png,Uh, yeah, what about them?
3-female_removing_major,target:elaine,targetStage:5=interested.png,Oh, you're just removing your stockings? That's not so bad, I guess.
3-female_removing_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2=flustered.png,Oh, uh, sure. I'll look away.
3-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:2,targetNotSaidMarker:NonMagicStrip1=interested.png,Anyhow, I suppose this'll be interesting to watch.
3-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:3=embarrassed.png,W-what? W-why would there be a banana in your...? And what does that have to do with being excited...?
3-female_removing_major,target:kizuna,targetStage:0,targetSaying:torn,marker:KizunaTorn=happy.png,Oh? I can probably fix it for you, if you'd like! I know Sewing Magic!
3-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1=happy.png,Oh! Sewing magic, huh? Did you study Etsuko's books too?
3-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1=happy.png,Oh! Sewing magic, huh? I'm a practitioner of it myself.
3-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1,saidMarker:SewingMagic=happy.png,Oh, you know Sewing Magic too, ~name~? What're the odds that the three of us all would?
3-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1,saidMarker:SewingMagic=happy.png,Oh, you know Sewing Magic too, ~name~? Gosh, Etsuko's books must be more popular than I thought!
3-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=flustered.png,S-so are, uh... tight long johns like that common where you come from, Meia?
3-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura=flustered.png,S-so are, uh... tight long johns like that the common thing where you come from, or is Jura's outfit more common?
3-female_removing_major,target:moon,targetStage:0=embarrassed.png,Y-you're taking off your b-bra already? You have so many other options...
3-female_removing_major,target:morrigan,targetStage:2=embarrassed.png,Uh... G-good to know?...
3-female_removing_major,target:nayru,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=shocked.png,Y-your dress!
3-female_removing_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:0=shocked.png,Oh! W-well I guess undressing is the name of the game, but you don't have to start with big items!
3-female_removing_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:1=flustered.png,Uh, k-kind of...
3-female_removing_major,target:raven=calm.png,Your cloak, huh? Is it magical at all?
3-female_removing_major,target:sayla,targetStage:2,targetSayingMarker:sayla_tights_no_steal=calm.png,Of course I won steal them. Stealing isn't in my class description!
3-female_removing_major,target:sayla,targetStage:2,targetSayingMarker:sayla_tights_valuable=happy.png,Don't worry, I won't steal them. They wouldn't even fit me, anyway!
3-female_removing_major,target:sayla,targetStage:3=interested.png,Oh dear. That's. uh... unfortunate?
3-female_removing_major,target:sheena,targetStage:3=interested.png,W-well, your kimono wasn't exactly hiding your underwear from the start.
3-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:4-5=interested.png,I wonder what the outcome will be this time?
3-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:4-5=interested.png,I hope the outcome will be good.
3-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:4-5=interested.png,How likely is a bad roll?
3-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:4-5=interested.png,What could possibly go wrong?
3-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:4-5=interested.png,I'm sure the odds are in your favor, huh?
3-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:4-5=embarrassed.png,I'm afraid of what will happen if you roll a 20...
3-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:4-5=embarrassed.png,Th-the die can't effect anyone but you, right, Vriska? I fear that it might...
3-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:4-5=embarrassed.png,Th-the die can't effect <i>my</i> clothes, can it?...
3-female_removed_major=happy.png,Only slightly embarrassing, right?
3-female_removed_major=calm.png,It's not so bad once you get used to it.
3-female_removed_major=calm.png,I'm still getting used to it, myself. The embarrassment, that is.
3-female_removed_major=calm.png,I'm still getting used to the embarrassment, myself.
3-female_removed_major,targetStartingLayers:3-4=flustered.png,I guess you don't have that much to take off, anyway...
3-female_removed_major,targetStartingLayers:3-4=flustered.png,I guess you didn't exactly have a choice...
3-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=embarrassed.png,<i>Oh!</i> S-so that's what your spell does... Uh, neat, I guess. I hope you know some sewing magic, too...
3-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=embarrassed.png,<i>Oh!</i> S-so that was just a fancy sewing spell, huh? F-for cutting, clearly...
3-female_removed_major,target:april,targetStage:4=embarrassed.png,W-wait, your jumpsuit shouldn't count as two items. That's kind of against the rules.
3-female_removed_major,target:beatrix,alsoPlaying:joey=flustered.png,No, it's fine, Joey. Her words are the part of this that bothers me...
3-female_removed_major,target:buffy,targetStage:5=embarrassed.png,O-oh dear. I wasn't aware that one could... do that.
3-female_removed_major,target:catria,targetStage:5=embarrassed.png,I-it was? I d-didn't notice...
3-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:6=embarrassed.png,J-jugs?... I... think I get that...
3-female_removed_major,target:croix,targetStage:3=flustered.png,I am a little bit.
3-female_removed_major,target:elaine,targetStage:4=embarrassed.png,O-oh, I see you came prepared...
3-female_removed_major,target:elaine,targetStage:5=embarrassed.png,N-no, you are, I just didn't expect it...
3-female_removed_major,target:elaine,targetStage:6=calm.png,My thought exactly. Bare feet aren't as bad as bare, er... something else.
3-female_removed_major,target:ini,targetStage:4=flustered.png,That's nice. Uh, it's a nice set, too.
3-female_removed_major,target:jasmine,targetStage:2=interested.png,Oh, uh... Sorry. I've never heard of you before. Should I have?
3-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:3,targetNotSaidMarker:NonMagicStrip1=shocked.png,Oh dear! Y-your shirt!
3-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:3,targetNotSaidMarker:NonMagicStrip1=shocked.png,Y-your shirt! Y-you didn't plan that, did you...?

3-female_removed_major,target:kizuna,targetStage:1=flustered.png,Uh, y-yeah, definitely c-cute...
3-female_removed_major,target:kizuna,targetStage:1,targetSaying:off,marker:KizunaDidntKnow=interested.png,You... didn't know your shirt comes off?...
3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2=angry.png,Hey, wait a moment, that's cheating! You have more items now!
3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2=angry.png,Hey, no fair! I'm running out of clothes, and you go and conjure <i>more</i>?! That's cheating!
3-female_removed_major,target:misato=embarrassed.png,I'm not looking away because of the scar, I'm looking away because you're nearly n-naked...
3-female_removed_major,target:misato=embarrassed.png,I'm not off-put by the scar. My dad had a ton. I'm moreoff-putt by your state of dress...
3-female_removed_major,target:moon=embarrassed.png,We can, uh... Y-your shirt is, uh...
3-female_removed_major,target:morrigan,targetStage:3=embarrassed.png,Your bats sure are loyal, I guess...

3-female_removed_major,target:morrigan,targetStage:4=embarrassed.png,Th-that's fine. I'm fine with waiting...
3-female_removed_major,target:nayru,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=shocked.png,A-are you okay? Do you need healing?
3-female_removed_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:1=flustered.png,It's, uh... a very nice b-bra, Pinkie.
3-female_removed_major,target:raven=happy.png,My sister has a cloak just like that, and you would <i>swear</i> it's enchanted because of how stealthy she is, but it's just a normal cloak.
3-female_removed_major,target:revy=facepalm.png,<i>Oh my gosh, this woman is more insufferable than Niccolo...</i>
3-female_removed_major,target:revy=facepalm.png,<i>Ugh, this woman makes Niccolo seem pleasant...</i>
3-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=flustered.png,Uh... W-we can, uh... Y-your, um, <i>hair</i> is...
3-female_removed_major,target:sayla,targetStage:3,targetSayingMarker:sayla_tights_hope_not_ripped=happy.png,If they do, I can fix them for you!
3-female_removed_major,target:sayla,targetStage:4=interested.png,I suppose that's fair.
3-female_removed_major,target:sayla,targetStage:4=interested.png,I can't argue with that.
3-female_removed_major,target:sheena,targetStage:4=flustered.png,Wow. I... didn't know assassins had custom underwear...
3-female_removed_major,target:shego=embarrassed.png,Y-You prepared for this, didn't you? No one wears l-lingerie casually...
3-female_removed_major,target:spooky=embarrassed.png,Apparate underwear? Y-you mean you weren't wearing any before...?
3-female_removed_major,target:spooky=embarrassed.png,W-wait, you weren't wearing underwear already...?
3-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5a=embarrassed.png,Oh dear. That's... quite the outfit.
3-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5b=happy.png,Oh. I like the hair for this outfit.
3-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5c=happy.png,Haha! You sure do look like a fairy right now!
3-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6a=interested.png,Oh dear. Would anyone happen to have towels prepared?
3-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6b=embarrassed.png,Oh dear... That's a... strange outfit...
3-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6b=embarrassed.png,Oh my... That outfit is... strange... Among other things...
3-female_removed_major,target:wiifitfemale=embarrassed.png,Um, no offense, but I think your bra needs washed...

5-male_removing_major=happy.png,Hey, looks like we're about to be even.
5-male_removing_major=happy.png,You didn't expect to go the whole game with your ~clothing~ on, did you?
5-male_removing_major=happy.png,Time for you to do some catching up.
5-male_removing_major=happy.png,Well, you'll have to do it eventually, so why not now?
5-male_removing_major,target:kamina,targetStage:3=interested.png,Well, it's mostly luck, so...
5-male_removed_major=happy.png,Welcome to my level. Er, not, like, experience points, I meant - never mind...
5-male_removed_major=happy.png,It's nice that you're keeping pace.
5-male_removed_major=happy.png,This game is more fun when you're not the only one in your underwear.
5-male_removed_major=happy.png,I think I'm starting to have fun again.
5-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:7=interested.png,Well, uh... It's not against the rules to cover yourself, so I can't really get mad about it.
5-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:7=flustered.png,Maybe I should do the same with my axe?...
5-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:7=flustered.png,I'd do the same with my axe, if I weren't concerned with accidentally cutting myself...
5-male_removed_major,target:corrin_m,targetStage:5=embarrassed.png,Y-you're wearing... panties?... O-okay, I guess...
5-male_removed_major,target:corrin_m,targetStage:5=embarrassed.png,W-why are y-you, uh... N-never mind. I don't think I want to know.
5-male_removed_major,target:jotaro,targetStage:6=flustered.png,I-I'm sorry you had to take off your... expensive pants? I'm sure they'll be safe...
5-male_removed_major,target:kamina,targetStage:4=sad.png,...
5-female_removing_major=happy.png,Hey, looks like we're about to be even.
5-female_removing_major=happy.png,You didn't expect to go the whole game with your ~clothing~ on, did you?
5-female_removing_major=happy.png,Time for you to do some catching up.
5-female_removing_major=happy.png,Well, you'll have to do it eventually, so why not now?
5-female_removing_major,target:aimee,targetStage:0=shocked.png,Is this a spell of some kind? I hope you have it under control!
5-female_removing_major,target:aimee,targetStage:0=shocked.png,Th-this has to be a spell, right? I hope you've practiced it well!
5-female_removing_major,target:alice_degracia,targetStage:3=calm.png,Ah! Etsuko has a whole line of clothes like that! I never could get the magic to work myself, though...
5-female_removing_major,target:april,targetStage:3=angry.png,Looks like it's time to get even!
5-female_removing_major,target:april,targetStage:3=angry.png,Rules are rules, ~name~! Take something off already!
5-female_removing_major,target:april,targetStage:3=angry.png,Well? We're waiting, ~name~!
5-female_removing_major,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=shocked.png,Oh dear! You're taking it off already? A-are you sure you don't have anything else to take off?
5-female_removing_major,target:buffy,targetStage:4=interested.png,I, uh, don't see what you're getting at.
5-female_removing_major,target:catria,targetStage:4,targetSaying:underwear=flustered.png,Yeah, that is kind of weird. I don't understand why people think that either...
5-female_removing_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:4,targetSaying:HP=interested.png,Do you need a healing item? I think I have one on me.
5-female_removing_major,target:croix,targetStage:2=interested.png,Uh, yeah, what about them?
5-female_removing_major,target:elaine,targetStage:5=interested.png,Oh, you're just removing your stockings? That's not so bad, I guess.
5-female_removing_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2=flustered.png,Oh, uh, sure. I'll look away.
5-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:2,targetNotSaidMarker:NonMagicStrip1=interested.png,Anyhow, I suppose this'll be interesting to watch.
5-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:3=embarrassed.png,W-what? W-why would there be a banana in your...? And what does that have to do with being excited...?
5-female_removing_major,target:kizuna,targetStage:0,targetSaying:torn,marker:KizunaTorn=happy.png,Oh? I can probably fix it for you, if you'd like! I know Sewing Magic!
5-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1=happy.png,Oh! Sewing magic, huh? Did you study Etsuko's books too?
5-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1=happy.png,Oh! Sewing magic, huh? I'm a practitioner of it myself.
5-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1,saidMarker:SewingMagic=happy.png,Oh, you know Sewing Magic too, ~name~? What're the odds that the three of us all would?
5-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1,saidMarker:SewingMagic=happy.png,Oh, you know Sewing Magic too, ~name~? Gosh, Etsuko's books must be more popular than I thought!
5-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=flustered.png,S-so are, uh... tight long johns like that common where you come from, Meia?
5-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura=flustered.png,S-so are, uh... tight long johns like that the common thing where you come from, or is Jura's outfit more common?
5-female_removing_major,target:moon,targetStage:0=embarrassed.png,Y-you're taking off your b-bra already? You have so many other options...
5-female_removing_major,target:morrigan,targetStage:2=embarrassed.png,Uh... G-good to know?...
5-female_removing_major,target:nayru,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=shocked.png,Y-your dress!
5-female_removing_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:0=shocked.png,Oh! W-well I guess undressing is the name of the game, but you don't have to start with big items!
5-female_removing_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:1=flustered.png,Uh, k-kind of...
5-female_removing_major,target:raven=calm.png,Your cloak, huh? Is it magical at all?
5-female_removing_major,target:sayla,targetStage:2,targetSayingMarker:sayla_tights_no_steal=calm.png,Of course I won steal them. Stealing isn't in my class description!
5-female_removing_major,target:sayla,targetStage:2,targetSayingMarker:sayla_tights_valuable=happy.png,Don't worry, I won't steal them. They wouldn't even fit me, anyway!
5-female_removing_major,target:sayla,targetStage:3=interested.png,Oh dear. That's. uh... unfortunate?
5-female_removing_major,target:sheena,targetStage:3=interested.png,W-well, your kimono wasn't exactly hiding your underwear from the start.
5-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:4-5=interested.png,I wonder what the outcome will be this time?
5-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:4-5=interested.png,I hope the outcome will be good.
5-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:4-5=interested.png,How likely is a bad roll?
5-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:4-5=interested.png,What could possibly go wrong?
5-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:4-5=interested.png,I'm sure the odds are in your favor, huh?
5-female_removed_major=happy.png,Welcome to my level. Er, not, like, experience points, I meant - never mind...
5-female_removed_major=happy.png,It's nice that you're keeping pace.
5-female_removed_major=happy.png,This game is more fun when you're not the only one in your underwear.
5-female_removed_major=happy.png,I think I'm starting to have fun again.
5-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=embarrassed.png,<i>Oh!</i> Well, I, uh... Wanted you to lose clothes quickly, but you didn't have to... Explode them.
5-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=embarrassed.png,<i>Oh!</i> Well, I, uh... Wanted you to lose clothes quickly, but not like <i>that</i>.
5-female_removed_major,target:april,targetStage:4=angry.png,H-hey, wait a minute! You're jumpsuit shouldn't count as two items! That's not fair!
5-female_removed_major,target:beatrix,alsoPlaying:joey=flustered.png,No, it's fine, Joey. Her words are the part of this that bothers me...
5-female_removed_major,target:buffy,targetStage:5=embarrassed.png,O-oh dear. I wasn't aware that one could... do that.
5-female_removed_major,target:catria,targetStage:5=embarrassed.png,I-it was? I d-didn't notice...
5-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:6=embarrassed.png,J-jugs?... I... think I get that...
5-female_removed_major,target:croix,targetStage:3=flustered.png,I am a little bit.
5-female_removed_major,target:elaine,targetStage:4=embarrassed.png,O-oh, I see you came prepared...
5-female_removed_major,target:elaine,targetStage:5=embarrassed.png,N-no, you are, I just didn't expect it...
5-female_removed_major,target:elaine,targetStage:6=calm.png,My thought exactly. Bare feet aren't as bad as bare, er... something else.
5-female_removed_major,target:ini,targetStage:4=flustered.png,That's nice. Uh, it's a nice set, too.
5-female_removed_major,target:jasmine,targetStage:2=interested.png,Oh, uh... Sorry. I've never heard of you before. Should I have?
5-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:3,targetNotSaidMarker:NonMagicStrip1=shocked.png,Oh dear! Y-your shirt!
5-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:3,targetNotSaidMarker:NonMagicStrip1=shocked.png,Y-your shirt! Y-you didn't plan that, did you...?
5-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:4=shocked.png,<i>What? B-but how?</i> Th-that doesn't make any sense!
5-female_removed_major,target:kizuna,targetStage:1=flustered.png,Uh, y-yeah, definitely c-cute...
5-female_removed_major,target:kizuna,targetStage:1,targetSaying:off,marker:KizunaDidntKnow=interested.png,You... didn't know your shirt comes off?...
5-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2=angry.png,Hey, wait a moment, that's cheating! You have more items now!
5-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2=angry.png,Hey, no fair! I'm running out of clothes, and you go and conjure <i>more</i>?! That's cheating!
5-female_removed_major,target:misato=embarrassed.png,I'm not looking away because of the scar, I'm looking away because you're nearly n-naked...
5-female_removed_major,target:misato=embarrassed.png,I'm not off-put by the scar. My dad had a ton. I'm moreoff-putt by your state of dress...
5-female_removed_major,target:moon=embarrassed.png,We can, uh... Y-your shirt is, uh...
5-female_removed_major,target:morrigan,targetStage:3=embarrassed.png,Your bats sure are loyal, I guess...
5-female_removed_major,target:morrigan,targetStage:4=embarrassed.png,Oh my. Your bats are <i>really</i> loyal...
5-female_removed_major,target:morrigan,targetStage:4=embarrassed.png,Th-that's fine. I'm fine with waiting...
5-female_removed_major,target:nayru,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=shocked.png,A-are you okay? Do you need healing?
5-female_removed_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:1=flustered.png,It's, uh... a very nice b-bra, Pinkie.
5-female_removed_major,target:raven=happy.png,My sister has a cloak just like that, and you would <i>swear</i> it's enchanted because of how stealthy she is, but it's just a normal cloak.
5-female_removed_major,target:revy=facepalm.png,<i>Oh my gosh, this woman is more insufferable than Niccolo...</i>
5-female_removed_major,target:revy=facepalm.png,<i>Ugh, this woman makes Niccolo seem pleasant...</i>
5-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=flustered.png,Uh... W-we can, uh... Y-your, um, <i>hair</i> is...
5-female_removed_major,target:sayla,targetStage:3,targetSayingMarker:sayla_tights_hope_not_ripped=happy.png,If they do, I can fix them for you!
5-female_removed_major,target:sayla,targetStage:4=interested.png,I suppose that's fair.
5-female_removed_major,target:sayla,targetStage:4=interested.png,I can't argue with that.
5-female_removed_major,target:sheena,targetStage:4=flustered.png,Wow. I... didn't know assassins had custom underwear...
5-female_removed_major,target:shego=embarrassed.png,Y-You prepared for this, didn't you? No one wears l-lingerie casually...
5-female_removed_major,target:spooky=angry.png,H-hey! Did you just gain more clothes? That's cheating!
5-female_removed_major,target:spooky=angry.png,H-hey! You can't do that! You can't just gain more clothes!
5-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5a=embarrassed.png,Oh dear. That's... quite the outfit.
5-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5b=happy.png,Oh. I like the hair for this outfit.
5-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5c=happy.png,Haha! You sure do look like a fairy right now!
5-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6a=interested.png,Oh dear. Would anyone happen to have towels prepared?
5-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6b=embarrassed.png,Oh dear... That's a... strange outfit...
5-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6b=embarrassed.png,Oh my... That outfit is... strange... Among other things...
5-female_removed_major,target:wiifitfemale=embarrassed.png,Um, no offense, but I think your bra needs washed...

male_chest_will_be_visible=happy.png,You're not hiding any battle scars, are you? You don't have to be shy about them; my dad had a bunch!
male_chest_is_visible=happy.png,Wow, your pectoral muscles sure are well-defined!
male_chest_is_visible=happy.png,A lot of warriors in my world go shirtless, so this is a pretty common sight to me.
male_chest_is_visible=happy.png,You must go shirtless often, huh?
male_chest_is_visible=happy.png,I bet you go shirtless often!
male_chest_is_visible=happy.png,See! Nothing to be ashamed of!
male_crotch_will_be_visible=interested.png,You won't mind if I take a peek, right? For curiosity's sake?
male_crotch_will_be_visible=calm.png,Hope you don't mind me looking... f-for curiosity's sake.
male_crotch_will_be_visible=flustered.png,Well, showing off is part of the game, right? S-so it'd be okay to look?
male_crotch_will_be_visible=flustered.png,I-it's okay if I look, right? I mean, th-that's what you came here for, right?
male_small_crotch_is_visible=shocked.png,Oh my! It's smaller than I thought it'd be!... Oh, sorry! I didn't mean it like that!
male_small_crotch_is_visible=shocked.png,<i>It's so small...</i> Oops! Did I say that out loud?
male_small_crotch_is_visible=shocked.png,Oh dear! I-is that it?
male_small_crotch_is_visible=flustered.png,I guess that illustration was life-sized...
male_small_crotch_is_visible=interested.png,Uh... Does it get b-bigger at all?...
male_small_crotch_is_visible=interested.png,Oh, uh... You wouldn't happen to know any spells to make it bigger, would you...?
male_small_crotch_is_visible=interested.png,Oh, uh... Maybe we can find a potion that'll make it bigger?

male_large_crotch_is_visible=shocked.png,Oh my goodness! I didn't even know they could get that big!
male_large_crotch_is_visible=shocked.png,Goodness! That size must be some sort of record!
male_large_crotch_is_visible=shocked.png,W-what?! They can get that big?!
male_large_crotch_is_visible=shocked.png,I-it's enormous! I-is that normal?
male_large_crotch_is_visible=shocked.png,Oh my goodness! That's... huge!
male_large_crotch_is_visible=shocked.png,I-is that normal? I mean, is the size average? That can't be average!
female_chest_will_be_visible=flustered.png,I really shouldn't look... It's not like I can't just look at my own in the mirror...
female_chest_will_be_visible=flustered.png,I knew this would happen when I agreed to play, but... that doesn't make this any less awkward...
female_chest_will_be_visible=flustered.png,Well, I did read that it's good to let your, uh... chest... breathe every now and then...
female_chest_will_be_visible=flustered.png,I once read that it's good to let your, uh... chest... breathe, so I guess this is a good thing.
female_small_chest_is_visible=happy.png,Hey, there's no shame in a small bust. Some people are into that... statistically speaking.
female_small_chest_is_visible=happy.png,Size doesn't impact function, you know; they may not be big, but they work just the same.
female_small_chest_is_visible=flustered.png,Well, I'd say they'll get bigger, but if you're here, you're too old for them to grow any...
female_small_chest_is_visible=sad.png,I guess you don't have much trouble finding clothes that fit you, huh? That must be nice...
female_small_chest_is_visible=flustered.png,O-oh, well, there's nothing to be ashamed of. Y-you are as the gods made you.
female_medium_chest_is_visible=flustered.png,Heh heh, they look just like in the anatomy diagrams... Sorry, I shouldn't be laughing...
female_medium_chest_is_visible=embarrassed.png,Nothing to be embarrassed about. They're just breasts; every woman has them...
female_medium_chest_is_visible=embarrassed.png,I know some cultures consider this perfectly acceptable, but not where I grew up...
female_medium_chest_is_visible=flustered.png,Th-they look just like the anatomy diagrams...
female_medium_chest_is_visible=flustered.png,They're, uh... neat, I guess...?
female_large_chest_is_visible=interested.png,If you ever have back problems, let me know. I know a guy who might be able to help.
female_large_chest_is_visible=interested.png,I've heard rumors that some women enhanced the size of their busts, but I don't know how. Would you know anything about that, by chance?
female_large_chest_is_visible=flustered.png,Wow. They're, uh... quite big.
female_large_chest_is_visible=sad.png,If <i>I</i> have a hard time finding clothes that fit, I can't imagine how hard it must be for <i>you</i>.
female_crotch_will_be_visible=flustered.png,I'll try not to stare...
female_crotch_will_be_visible=flustered.png,You shouldn't have to worry about <i>me</i> staring, at least...
female_crotch_will_be_visible=embarrassed.png,J-just get it over with, ~name~.
female_crotch_will_be_visible=flustered.png,I guess you have no choice, huh?
female_crotch_will_be_visible=flustered.png,Oh no. This is your last item, huh...?
female_crotch_is_visible=flustered.png,That's... It's, uh, cute?... I don't know what to say...
female_crotch_is_visible=flustered.png,It looks, uh... like a flower, I guess? <i>I don't know...</i>
female_crotch_is_visible=flustered.png,I, uh... I don't know what to say...
female_crotch_is_visible=flustered.png,Um... C-can we move on now, please?
female_crotch_is_visible=flustered.png,L-let's not linger on this moment.
female_crotch_is_visible=flustered.png,I'm, uh... I'm sorry you're naked...

5-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:catria,targetSaying:Tiny tits=interested.png,W-why would we laugh? There's nothing funny about your chest.
5-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:futaba=embarrassed.png,O-okay. I guess that's fair...
5-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:marinette,targetStage:7=interested.png,Well, I guess I'll take your word for it.

5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetNotSaidMarker:NonMagicStrip3=embarrassed.png,Oh... Your tie... That's... an acceptable surprise...
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetSaidMarker:JoeyButt=embarrassed.png,Uh... J-Joey, y-your, um... y-your tie...
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jolyne=happy.png,Well, you may not have your bra anymore, but at least you didn't forget it. That would've been pretty humiliating.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=embarrassed.png,Sorry, Moon, but I'm really not interested in your b-body...
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:nayru,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=embarrassed.png,O-oh. Sorry, I-I can't repair <i>burnt</i> clothing items...

5-female_large_chest_is_visible=interested.png,I can't tell if those are more of a blessing or a curse.
5-female_large_chest_is_visible=interested.png,I... actually feel kind of bad for you. Those must be quite a burden to live with.
5-female_large_chest_is_visible=calm.png,Those are definitely bigger than mine. N-not that I care, I just thought it was worth noting.
5-female_large_chest_is_visible,filter:confident=happy.png,W-well, I guess I can see what you're so proud of...

5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=embarrassed.png,Y-you're not about to... you know... are you?
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=embarrassed.png,Not again...

5-female_crotch_is_visible=calm.png,All things considered, I'll probably be naked too, soon...

5-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:princess=calm.png,I'm sorry you had to do that, princess, but that's the rules.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:princess=angry.png,L-let's try to be respectful and not stare too much! Got that, ~player~?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=embarrassed.png,Y-you did... I can't believe that...
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=embarrassed.png,I guess y-you did... Uh, does that mean you're out now?

5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ini=interested.png,So you lied about your personality <i>and</i> your hair color. Are there any other lies you care to come clean on, Ini?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ini=interested.png,You lied about your personality, your hair, what, next you're going to tell is you're name isn't Ini?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ini=interested.png,Are there any more lies you'd like to come clean on, Ini?... Your name <i>is</i> actually Ini, right?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:joey,targetNotSaidMarker:NonMagicStrip2=shocked.png,<i>W-wait what?</i> W-was that another magic trick?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jolyne=embarrassed.png,O-oh. I guess your reminder was of no help...

#OPPONENT MASTURBATING
#When an opponent is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must pay the penalty by masturbating in front of everyone.
#The "must_masturbate" line is for just before it happens, and the "start_masturbating" line immediately follows.
#The "masturbating" line will be spoken a little after the opponent has started but before they climax.
#When the opponent climaxes, your character will say the "finished_masturbating" line.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

#SELF MASTURBATING
#If your character is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must masturbate.
#These lines only come up in the relevant stages, so you don't need to include the stage numbers here. Just remember which stage is which when you make the images. The "starting" image is still in the naked stage.
#The "finished_masturbating" line will repeat many times if the game is not yet finished. This plays as opponents comment on the how good their hands are.

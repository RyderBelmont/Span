#Items of clothing should be listed here in order of removal.
#The values are formal name, lower case name, how much they cover, what they cover
#Please do not put spaces around the commas.
#"Important" clothes cover genitals (lower) or chest/breasts (upper). For example: bras, panties, a skirt when going commando.
#"Major" clothes cover underwear. For example: skirts, pants, shirts, dresses.
#"Minor" clothes cover skin or are large pieces of clothing that do not cover skin. For example: jackets, socks, stockings, gloves.
#"Extra" clothes are small items that may or may not be clothing but do not cover anything interesting. For example: jewelry, shoes or boots with socks underneath, belts, hats. In the rest of the code, "extra" clothes are called "accessory".
#If for some reason you write another word for the type of clothes (e.g. "accessory"), other characters will not react at all when the clothing is removed.
#What they cover = upper (upper body), lower (lower body), other (neither).
#The game can support any number of entries, but typically we use 2-8, with at least one "important" layer for upper and lower (each).

#Notes on dialogue
#All lines that start with a # symbol are comments and will be ignored by the tool that converts this file into a xml file for the game.
#Where more than one line has an identical type, like "swap_cards" and "swap_cards", the game will randomly select one of these lines each time the character is in that situation.
#You should try to include multiple lines for most stages, especially the final (finished) stage, -1. 

#A character goes through multiple stages as they undress. The stage number starts at zero and indicates how many layers they have removed. Special stage numbers are used when they are nude (-3), masturbating (-2), and finished (-1).
#Line types that start with a number will only display during that stage. The will override any numberless stage-generic lines. For example, in stage 4 "4-swap_cards" will be used over "swap_cards" if it is not blank here. Giving a character unique dialogue for each stage is an effective way of showing their changing openness/shyness as the game progresses.
#You can combine the above points and make multiple lines for a particular situation in a particular stage, like "4-swap_cards" and "4-swap_cards".

#Some special words can be used that will be substituted by the game for context-appropriate ones: ~name~ is the name of the character they're speaking to, but this only works if someone else is in focus. ~clothing~ is the type of clothing that is being removed by another player. ~Clothing~ is almost the same, but it starts with a capital letter in case you want to start a sentence with it.
#~name~ can be used any time a line targets an opponent (game_over_defeat, _must_strip, _removing_, _removed, _must_masturbate, etc).
#~clothing~ can be used only when clothing is being removed (_removing and _removed, but NOT _must_strip).
#~player~ can be used at any time and refers to the human player.
#~cards~ can be used only in the swap_cards lines.
#All wildcards can be used once per line only! If you use ~name~ twice, the code will show up the second time.

#Lines can be written that are only spoken when specific other characters are present. For a detailed explanation, read this guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/spnati/comments/6nhaj0/the_easy_way_to_write_targeted_lines/
#Here is an example line (note that targeted lines must have a stage number):
#0-female_must_strip,target:hermioine=happy,Looks like your magic doesn't help with poker!

#This is what a character says while they're exchanging cards and commenting on their hands afterwards.
#When swapping cards, the game will automatically put a display a number between 0-5 where you write ~cards~.
#These lines display on the screen for only a brief time, so it is important to make them short enough to read at a glance.

#OPPONENT REMOVING ACCESSORY
#These lines are spoken when an opponent removes a small item that does not cover any skin.
#Typically, characters are fine with this when they are fully dressed but less satisfied as they become more naked.
#Note that all "removing" lines are NOT spoken to human players. Characters will skip straight from "6-male_human_must_strip" to "6-male_removed_accessory", for example.

-3-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested,Oh, you were just hiding cat ears? I've had stranger-looking allies than a person with cat ears.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested,Um, not to put you down or anything, Blake, but I've fought alongside a walking flower and the Demon Lord of Wounds; cat ears are not shocking to me.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested,Uh, sorry but, is that it? Just cat ears? My friend Pernilla is a walking flower. You look normal compared to her.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested,Sorry, but after dealing with a formless, mind-bending monster, everything else looks normal to me.

-3-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=interested,Does your monocle really mean that much to you, Meia? You can still see fine in your other eye, right?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1b=interested,Well, uh... I think you're actually wearing <i>more</i> clothes now, but I guess if it's up to luck, maybe you'll lose more next time?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1b=interested,Well, uh... I think you're wearing <i>more</i> clothing now, but since it's luck-based, I guess it's okay?

-1-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0=interested,If by "get lucky" you mean "get critical hits," then no, I don't get them very often.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:5=calm,Don't worry, Blake, if anyone judges you, I'll punch them in the face!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=shocked,Shimakaze! Your gloves are on fire!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=shocked,Your gloves! They're on fire!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=interested,You, uh... had to be <i>told</i> to do that?...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=interested,You had to be <i>told</i> to do that? I thought that was just common sense.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:1=interested,To be clear, I'm not afraid of bats, but I reserve the right to punch them if they get too close.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:0,saidMarker:SewingMagic=happy,Oh, you know Sewing Magic too, Vriska? What're the odds that the three of us all would?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:0,saidMarker:SewingMagic=happy,Oh, you know Sewing Magic too, Vriska? Gosh, Etsuko's books must be more popular than I thought!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=happy,Is your bag magic at all, Moon? I recently started using magic bag myself, and they're really fantastic.

-1-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested,Oh, you were just hiding cat ears? I've had stranger-looking allies than a person with cat ears.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested,Um, not to put you down or anything, Blake, but I've fought alongside a walking flower and the Demon Lord of Wounds; cat ears are not shocking to me.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested,Uh, sorry but, is that it? Just cat ears? My friend Pernilla is a walking flower. You look normal compared to her.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested,Sorry, but after dealing with a formless, mind-bending monster, everything else looks normal to me.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested,Sorry, but I'm not surprised. I guess I got desensitized by the evil, formless monster I defeated not too long ago. He was quite a weird one...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested,Sorry, Blake, but I'm not surprised at all. With all the weird creatures I've seen, I've learned to stop questioning peoples' appearance.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3b=interested,That's a nice outfit, I suppose, but why is it missing a sleeve?

-1-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=interested,This is... really bizarre.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=shocked,D-did you do that intentionally? You're oddly calm.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3a=interested,Oh, did you re-class into a Ranger?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3a=interested,Oh. I guess you re-classed into a Ranger now?

-1-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=interested,Does your monocle really mean that much to you, Meia? You can still see fine in your other eye, right?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1c,marker:VriskaDress=happy,Oh wow! What a lovely dress!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1c,marker:VriskaDress=happy,Oh wow! You look very lovely now, Vriska!

-1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2c,targetNotSaidMarker:1c=interested,That's a nice outfit, I suppose, but why is it missing a sleeve?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1b=interested,Well, uh... I think you're actually wearing <i>more</i> clothes now, but I guess if it's up to luck, maybe you'll lose more next time?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1b=interested,Well, uh... I think you're wearing <i>more</i> clothing now, but since it's luck-based, I guess it's okay?

3-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetSaidMarker:dna_lock=happy,Wow, that's pretty cool! Maybe I should put the same kind of enchantment on my armor too?
3-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetSaidMarker:pauldrons=happy,Haha. Of course they're articulated, Sei. If you couldn't move your arms well, how would you swing your weapon?

-1-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=sad,Wait, I think I have something that'll help in my... Oh right, I don't have my pouch anymore...
-1-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=sad,Wait, I think I have a potion in my... Oh right, I don't have my pouch anymore...
-1-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:bee2,targetNotSaidMarker:bee_stop=interested,That was... Odd. Uh, sorry about your tunic, Florina.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:bee2,targetNotSaidMarker:bee_stop=interested,That was... Bizarre. You wouldn't happen to have any Bee mage enemies, would you?
-1-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:bee2,targetNotSaidMarker:bee_stop=interested,That was... Strange. You wouldn't happen to have any enemies who know Bee magic, would you?

-1-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1=interested,Like I said, you look a lot like her. I think my train of thought is perfectly reasonable.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1=calm,Have you ever tried sandals? I'm sure they'd be a good middle ground between not wearing shoes and protecting your feet.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=interested,You... don't actually have this under control, do you?
-1-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=calm,Case in point; I had no idea you were removing your footwear.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetSaidMarker:dna_lock=happy,Wow, that's pretty cool! Maybe I should put the same kind of enchantment on my armor too?

-1-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=interested,I know an alchemist who might be able to help; curatives are his specialty. He's sure to have something for burn scars.




#OPPONENT REMOVING MAJOR CLOTHING
#Major clothing reveals a significant amount of skin and likely underwear.
#However, as we don't know if the opponent is taking off the top or the bottom, we can't presume that nice abs are showing; maybe she took of her skirt before her shirt.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

#OPPONENT MASTURBATING
#When an opponent is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must pay the penalty by masturbating in front of everyone.
#The "must_masturbate" line is for just before it happens, and the "start_masturbating" line immediately follows.
#The "masturbating" line will be spoken a little after the opponent has started but before they climax.
#When the opponent climaxes, your character will say the "finished_masturbating" line.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

female_masturbating=embarrassed,That's, um... interesting to watch.
female_masturbating=embarrassed,I'll have to remember what you're doing, in case I lose too...
female_masturbating=embarrassed,I sure wish I had a book to tell me how to do this, instead of learning through watching.
female_masturbating=embarrassed,I'm not making you uncomfortable, am I, ~name~? I certainly feel uncomfortable myself...
female_masturbating=embarrassed,C-can we maybe get, like, a curtain or something to put in front of ~name~? You know, for privacy?
female_finished_masturbating=shocked,Oh! I wasn't prepared for... <i>That.</i>
female_finished_masturbating=shocked,Gosh, that looked intense! Are you okay?!

#SELF MASTURBATING
#If your character is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must masturbate.
#These lines only come up in the relevant stages, so you don't need to include the stage numbers here. Just remember which stage is which when you make the images. The "starting" image is still in the naked stage.
#The "finished_masturbating" line will repeat many times if the game is not yet finished. This plays as opponents comment on the how good their hands are.

-1-finished_masturbating=calm,I have to admit, I do feel a little... refreshed... Not quite "a night at an inn" refreshed, but still...

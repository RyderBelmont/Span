#When selecting the characters to play the game, the first line will always play, then it randomly picks from any of the start lines after you commence the game but before you deal the first hand.


#Items of clothing should be listed here in order of removal.
#The values are formal name, lower case name, how much they cover, what they cover
#Please do not put spaces around the commas.
#"Important" clothes cover genitals (lower) or chest/breasts (upper). For example: bras, panties, a skirt when going commando.
#"Major" clothes cover underwear. For example: skirts, pants, shirts, dresses.
#"Minor" clothes cover skin or are large pieces of clothing that do not cover skin. For example: jackets, socks, stockings, gloves.
#"Extra" clothes are small items that may or may not be clothing but do not cover anything interesting. For example: jewelry, shoes or boots with socks underneath, belts, hats. In the rest of the code, "extra" clothes are called "accessory".
#If for some reason you write another word for the type of clothes (e.g. "accessory"), other characters will not react at all when the clothing is removed.
#What they cover = upper (upper body), lower (lower body), other (neither).
#The game can support any number of entries, but typically we use 2-8, with at least one "important" layer for upper and lower (each).

#Notes on dialogue
#All lines that start with a # symbol are comments and will be ignored by the tool that converts this file into a xml file for the game.
#Where more than one line has an identical type, like "swap_cards" and "swap_cards", the game will randomly select one of these lines each time the character is in that situation.
#You should try to include multiple lines for most stages, especially the final (finished) stage, -1. 

#A character goes through multiple stages as they undress. The stage number starts at zero and indicates how many layers they have removed. Special stage numbers are used when they are nude (-3), masturbating (-2), and finished (-1).
#Line types that start with a number will only display during that stage. The will override any numberless stage-generic lines. For example, in stage 4 "4-swap_cards" will be used over "swap_cards" if it is not blank here. Giving a character unique dialogue for each stage is an effective way of showing their changing openness/shyness as the game progresses.
#You can combine the above points and make multiple lines for a particular situation in a particular stage, like "4-swap_cards" and "4-swap_cards".

#Some special words can be used that will be substituted by the game for context-appropriate ones: ~name~ is the name of the character they're speaking to, but this only works if someone else is in focus. ~clothing~ is the type of clothing that is being removed by another player. ~Clothing~ is almost the same, but it starts with a capital letter in case you want to start a sentence with it.
#~name~ can be used any time a line targets an opponent (game_over_defeat, _must_strip, _removing_, _removed, _must_masturbate, etc).
#~clothing~ can be used only when clothing is being removed (_removing and _removed, but NOT _must_strip).
#~player~ can be used at any time and refers to the human player.
#~cards~ can be used only in the swap_cards lines.
#All wildcards can be used once per line only! If you use ~name~ twice, the code will show up the second time.

#Lines can be written that are only spoken when specific other characters are present. For a detailed explanation, read this guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/spnati/comments/6nhaj0/the_easy_way_to_write_targeted_lines/
#Here is an example line (note that targeted lines must have a stage number):
#0-female_must_strip,target:hermioine=happy,Looks like your magic doesn't help with poker!




#INTRODUCTION
#These lines are used to say different things depending on which other characters are present when the character
#is selected and when the game starts.

#This is what a character says while they're exchanging cards and commenting on their hands afterwards.
#When swapping cards, the game will automatically put a display a number between 0-5 where you write ~cards~.
#These lines display on the screen for only a brief time, so it is important to make them short enough to read at a glance.

must_strip=happy,Heh, it had to be my turn eventually.
must_strip=happy,Well, this is <i>strip</i> poker. I didn't expect to go the whole game fully clothed.
must_strip=happy,Lost another hand, but I'm still having fun!
must_strip=happy,I guess it's my turn now?
must_strip=happy,My turn? That's okay, I still have plenty of HP left!

0-must_strip,totalRounds:0=happy,Me first, huh?
0-must_strip,totalRounds:0=happy,Me first? No worries, I'm used to my speed making my turn come up first!
0-must_strip,alsoPlaying:jura=calm,Oh, it's not that I was never invited out, I just wasn't allowed to leave in the first place.
0-must_strip,hasHand:Royal Flush=shocked,W-what? But a Royal Flush is an unbeatable hand!
0-must_strip,hasHand:Royal Flush=shocked,W-what? Me? But I have a Royal Flush!

0-must_strip,alsoPlaying:rinkah=interested,Like yours, I guess. There's grass, and trees, and the occasional dragon.
0-must_strip,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=interested,Um... Who? Are they some kind of legend in this world?
0-must_strip,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=interested,Um... Who? Is that one of this world's legendary heroes?
0-must_strip,hasHand:Straight Flush=sad,Geez. I knew my luck was bad, but this is ridiculous.

0-must_strip,alsoPlaying:palutena,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=happy,If you think <i>I'm</i> tall, you should've seen my father!
0-must_strip,alsoPlaying:navi=shocked,W-what? How do you know that?
0-must_strip,alsoPlaying:rainbow_mika=happy,I'd be glad to wrestle you. I should warn you, though, I could nearly take down my father, and he was bigger than I am!
0-must_strip,alsoPlaying:cammy=calm,Believe me, Cammy, I know size isn't everything. I've fought plenty of formidable opponents who were smaller than me.
0-must_strip,alsoPlaying:mulan,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=happy,Haha, sorry to say that you still haven't. I'm not a giant, I'm just a tall human.
0-must_strip,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:hiaella=interested,Uh... Who? What? Sorry, you've lost me.
0-must_strip,alsoPlaying:jenetta=happy,I sure am! I've been to many places in this past year alone! Adventuring is so much fun!

0-stripping=stripping,This reminds me of the first time I ever left the house; the first step into a brand new world.
0-stripping=stripping,My armor set is pretty similar to the set my dad wore. Except his had more rounded accents to it.

0-stripping,alsoPlaying:sei=stripping,Uh, thanks, I guess? To be honest, I don't see how this is brave. I've faced greater trials than this.
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:joey=stripping,This reminds me of the first time I ever left the house; the first step into a brand new world.
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=stripping,That's a common misconception, Elizabeth. Armor <i>can't</i> be heavy, or else it becomes more trouble than it's worth.
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:mulan,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=stripping,While that's a correct assumption, I'm not actually part of any army. I'm just a wandering warrior.
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:beatrix=stripping,I know. My dad always said "A true warrior doesn't need much armor. With the proper technique, a thrust to the chest can be easily countered."

#losing boots
1-stripped=stripped,Don't let me slow things down. Let's keep this game going.
1-stripped=stripped,My dad said "A true warrior doesn't need much armor. With proper technique, a thrust to the chest can be easily countered."
1-stripped=stripped,It's kind of funny how no matter what shops I visit, they always have that exact armor set for sale but with different stats.
1-stripped=angry,First person to comment how little my armor covers gets smacked! It doesn't affect my defense stat, I tell you!
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:rinkah=stripped,Yeah. You can never know when a goblin ambush might happen.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:phoebe=stripped,I know that. It was just a simile.
1-stripped,count-festival_aella:1=stripped,I'll take off <i>all</i> of my accessories. It feels more fair that way.
1-stripped,count-festival_aella:1=stripped,I don't want to slow things down too much, so I'll take off <i>all</i> of my accessories.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:beatrix=stripped,You'd better! My dad survived a war; he know's what he's talking about!
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:clover=stripped,Oh, see, it's a metaphor, Clover. I don't mean a literal world, I mean it's a a brand new experience.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=stripped,I'm sure you could walk in it, just probably not very far. It doesn't require a lot of <i>strength</i>, but it can be very trying on your <i>stamina</i>,
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:sei=stripped,No, thank you. I don't drink. I appreciate the offer, though.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:joey=stripped,Is that what you see stripping as, Joey?
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia=stripped,Aha, funny, I've played a lot of poker too. Er, <i>regular</i> poker.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia=stripped,Aha, funny coincidence, I've played a lot of poker too.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:twilight=stripped,That would be cool, but no, I'm just a regular adventurer.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:palutena=stripped,Don't let me slow things down. Let's keep this game going.
1-must_strip,hasHand:Royal Flush=shocked,W-what? But a Royal Flush is an unbeatable hand!
1-must_strip,hasHand:Royal Flush=shocked,W-what? Me? But I have a Royal Flush!
1-must_strip,hasHand:Royal Flush=shocked,W-what? <i>I</i> have to strip? But how? <i>Why?</i>
1-must_strip,alsoPlaying:navi=happy,Haha, you know, I don't get it either. People come in all sorts of shapes and sizes, so why single people out?
1-must_strip,alsoPlaying:mulan,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=interested,Is that so, Ping? I wonder why?
1-must_strip,hasHand:Straight Flush=sad,Geez. I knew my luck was bad, but this is ridiculous.
1-must_strip,hasHand:Straight Flush=sad,Aw. Curse my terrible luck.
1-must_strip,hasHand:Straight Flush=sad,Aw, darn it! I thought for sure I couldn't lose with that hand!
1-must_strip_winning=happy,Well, this is <i>strip</i> poker. I didn't expect to go the whole game fully clothed.
1-must_strip_normal=happy,Well, at least I'm keeping pace with the rest of you.
1-must_strip_losing=happy,My turn again? Oh well, at least we're still early on in the game.
1-stripping=stripping,Suppose it's time for my boots to go.
1-stripping=stripping,Alright, I'll take off my boots next. It only makes sense.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=stripping,Indeed it is. I've studied many books on strategy and war tactics. They're very fasinating!
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:sei=stripping,Not really. Mercenaries ask for pay, whereas I do things for free.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:sei=stripping,Not really. I don't work for pay, so "mercenary" doesn't really apply to me.
1-stripping,count-festival_aella:1=stripping,I would've worn high heals, but I can't walk in them, so I stuck with boots.
1-stripping,count-festival_aella:1=stripping,Etsuko suggested I wear high-healed shoes, but I can't walk in them, so I stuck with boots.
1-stripping,count-festival_aella:1=stripping,I would've worn high heals, but my dexterity stat isn't high enough for me to walk in them, so I stuck with boots.


#losing dress
2-stripped=stripped,Shame; those boots are super comfy. They're like standing on clouds.
2-stripped=stripped,They may not be Boots of Leaping or anything like that, but they're super comfortable.
2-stripped=stripped,They may not be Boots of Speed or anything like that, but they're super comfortable.
2-stripped=stripped,They may not be Boots of Strength or anything like that, but they're super comfortable.
2-stripped=happy,Not a big deal. It's like I just came home!
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:beatrix=stripped,Is this really that boring to you, Beatrix?
2-stripped,count-festival_aella:1=stripped,It feels kind of weird wearing a dress like this without footwear...
2-stripped,count-festival_aella:1=stripped,I feel both underdressed and overdressed at the same time...
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=happy,Haha! Poker has nothing to do with strategy. You should be more afraid of how I've studied books on poker tactics!
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=happy,Haha! Poker has nothing to do with strategy. You should be more afraid of how many times I've played poker against my parents!
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:sei=interested,Uh, thanks, I guess? I wouldn't exactly call them "old motifs," though.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:mulan,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=flustered,Uh, okay, thanks, I guess?
2-must_strip,hasHand:Straight Flush=sad,Geez. I knew my luck was bad, but this is ridiculous.
2-must_strip,hasHand:Straight Flush=sad,Aw. Curse my terrible luck.
2-must_strip,hasHand:Straight Flush=sad,Aw, darn it! I thought for sure I couldn't lose with that hand!
2-must_strip,alsoPlaying:navi=happy,I absolutely do! I love exploring dungeons!
2-must_strip,hasHand:Royal Flush=shocked,W-what? But a Royal Flush is an unbeatable hand!
2-must_strip,hasHand:Royal Flush=shocked,W-what? Me? But I have a Royal Flush!
2-must_strip,hasHand:Royal Flush=shocked,W-what? <i>I</i> have to strip? But how? <i>Why?</i>
2-must_strip_winning=happy,Lost another hand, but I'm still having fun!
2-must_strip_normal=happy,Well, I may not be winning, but at least I'm not losing either.
2-must_strip_losing=sad,Shoot, I'm losing, aren't I?
2-stripping=stripping,Uh... I guess I can take off my dress.
2-stripping=stripping,I guess my dress will be next.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:clover=stripping,Uh, I guess so.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:palutena=stripping,Uh... I guess I can take off my dress.
2-stripping,count-festival_aella:1=stripping,So much for my fancy outfit...
2-stripping,count-festival_aella:1=stripping,There goes all the effort I put into dressing up...


#losing leggings
3-stripped,marker:Leggings=stripped,My leggings are very form-fitting, so this is a little embarrassing, but at least I'm still not showing much skin.
3-stripped,marker:NoShops=stripped,I had to make that dress myself since no one in town makes clothes for women as large as me.
3-stripped=stripped,I made that dress myself using Sewing magic. It's one of the few magic types I'm good at...
3-stripped=stripped,I made that dress myself using Sewing magic. I'm not good at many other  magic types. Just self-buffing spells and Stick to Snakes.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:rinkah=stripped,Sure, but definitely once we're both fully clothed again.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:saki=stripped,Uh, sure, Saki, but maybe we can talk about that later? Now doesn't seem to be the most opportune time.
3-stripped,count-festival_aella:1=stripped,Normally I wear a warmer undershirt, but longer sleeves would've stuck out from under the dress.
3-stripped,count-festival_aella:1=stripped,I normally wear a warmer undershirt, but I had to go with short sleeves for this outfit.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit=stripped,I didn't think I'd lose this much. I used to play poker with my dad all the time.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:joey=stripped,Uh, thanks, I guess...
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:palutena,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=stripped,They're not meant to be fashionable. The dress is the part that makes this outfit work.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:palutena,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=stripped,They're not meant to be fashionable. At least, not without the dress they're not.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:clover=stripped,Nowhere. I have to make them myself. I outgrew every dress size by the time I was 15.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:beatrix=stripped,I mean, I could've taken off my leggings instead, but my legs get cold easily, so this is the better option.
3-must_strip=flustered,I don't really want to strip any more than I have, but I'll honor the game's rules...
3-must_strip=flustered,I guess there's no getting around this...
3-must_strip=facepalm,I should've known I'd do poorly in a game that's mostly luck...
3-must_strip=flustered,Well, I <i>did</i> agree to this...
3-must_strip,hasHand:Royal Flush=shocked,W-what? But a Royal Flush is an unbeatable hand!
3-must_strip,hasHand:Royal Flush=shocked,W-what? Me? But I have a Royal Flush!
3-must_strip,hasHand:Royal Flush=shocked,W-what? <i>I</i> have to strip? But how? <i>Why?</i>
3-must_strip,hasHand:Straight Flush=sad,Geez. I knew my luck was bad, but this is ridiculous.
3-must_strip,hasHand:Straight Flush=sad,Aw. Curse my terrible luck.
3-must_strip,hasHand:Straight Flush=sad,Aw, darn it! I thought for sure I couldn't lose with that hand!
3-must_strip_winning=calm,I can still win with dignity if I avoid losing another hand.
3-must_strip_normal=interested,Tit for tat, I suppose.
3-must_strip_losing=sad,I knew luck was my weakest trait, but this is ridiculous...
3-stripping=stripping,Well... I'm not wearing anything under my shirt, so it'd be better if I took off my leggings...
3-stripping=stripping,It'd be better to take off my leggings. Better for <i>me</i>, anyway... I-I'm not wearing a bra...
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:joey=stripping,Right, but they are covering a lot of skin...
3-stripping,count-festival_aella:1=stripping,W-well, I did prepare for this, so...
3-stripping,count-festival_aella:1=stripping,I... actually prepared for this...

4-stripped=stripped,I sleep dressed like this, so it's not too uncomfortable, but I always put something on before leaving my room...
4-stripped,marker:Panties=stripped,Much like the rest of my clothes, I made these p-panties myself. I saw the design in a catalog...
4-stripped,marker:Panties=stripped,I saw these p-panties in a catalog and decided to make them myself...
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:palutena,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=stripped,I <i>had</i> more protection, but I lost it all...
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:palutena,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=stripped,Protection isn't my specialty. I focus more on damage-dealing...
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:joey=stripped,Y-yeah... It's just my legs... and my u-underwear...
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:clover=stripped,No, they stop at my feet.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:clover=stripped,Thanks, I guess...?
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:beatrix=stripped,I mean... a little bit...
4-stripped,count-festival_aella:1=stripped,I... I figured I'd match my panties with my dress. You know, for the occasion...
4-stripped,count-festival_aella:1=stripped,I don't normally, uh... coordinate my underwear with the rest of my outfit, but I figured it was appropriate for the occasion.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit=stripped,Not sure "daring" is the word I'd use for that.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit=stripped,T-too daring. Far too daring.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit=stripped,This option at least leaves me <i>some</i> covering.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:sei=stripped,Uh... what's a "roleplayer?" Is that someone who pretends? I'm not pretending to be anything.
4-must_strip=flustered,I don't really want to strip any more than I have, but I'll honor the game's rules...
4-must_strip=flustered,I guess there's no getting around this...
4-must_strip=facepalm,I should've known I'd do poorly in a game that's mostly luck...
4-must_strip=flustered,Well, I <i>did</i> agree to this...
4-must_strip,marker:AellaStalling=stalling,W-wait! I think I hear a village being attacked by a, uh... a dragon! Yeah!... <i>No?</i>... Fine...
4-must_strip,marker:AellaStalling=stalling,W-wait! I hear a, uh... a cyclops! Yeah! I should go stop it before... <i>No?</i>... Oh well...
4-must_strip=facepalm,Stupid cards...
4-must_strip=facepalm,Ugh... A-alright, j-just give me a moment...
4-must_strip=stripped,I honestly didn't think I'd have to take off so much...
4-must_strip,hasHand:Royal Flush=shocked,W-what? But a Royal Flush is an unbeatable hand!
4-must_strip,hasHand:Royal Flush=shocked,W-what? Me? But I have a Royal Flush!
4-must_strip,hasHand:Royal Flush=shocked,W-what? <i>I</i> have to strip? But how? <i>Why?</i>

4-must_strip_winning=calm,Gee, I may be winning, but I sure am losing more than I'd like to.
4-must_strip_normal=sad,<i>Sigh</i>... At least I'm not alone in this endeavor...
4-must_strip_losing=sad,Oh boy... I wasn't prepared for this...
4-stripping=stripping,This is a lot more naked than I care to get, but rules are rules...
4-stripping=stripping,I hope Asvaldr isn't watching me from the underworld...
4-stripping,notSaidMarker:AellaStalling,priority:0=stripping,Best two out of three?... No?... It was worth a shot...
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:beatrix=stripping,My offense always was better than my defense, anyhow...
4-stripping,count-festival_aella:1=stripping,I didn't prepare for this part of the occasion...
4-stripping,count-festival_aella:1=stripping,Don't expect any more special clothing items under this... There aren't any...
4-stripping,timeInStage:1=stripping,Y'know, thinking about it, compared to this, fighting hypnotized demon soul infused weapons is a cakewalk...
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:joey,saidMarker:AellaStalling=stripping,M-maybe you're right... Well, there's only one way to find out...
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:joey,notSaidMarker:AellaStalling=stripping,Oh, I don't know... I'm not sure I <i>can</i> get used to it...


#losing panties
5-stripped,marker:NoBra=stripped,I don't wear a b-bra because they don't have any proven benefits that outweigh the discomfort...
5-stripped=stripped,I sure would like to win right now...

5-stripped,alsoPlaying:twilight=stripped,I don't wear a b-bra because they don't have any proven benefits that outweigh the discomfort...
5-stripped,count-festival_aella:1=stripped,M-maybe I should've worn a bra just this once... t-to match my panties...
5-stripped,count-festival_aella:1=stripped,M-maybe I should've listened to Etsuko about wearing a... more complete set...
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:sei=embarrassed,P-please stay back, Sei.
5-must_strip=sad,You'd think I'd be used to the exposure by now, but no... I'm still not used to it...
5-must_strip=sad,Oh boy... I wasn't prepared for this...

#OPPONENT MUST STRIP
#These lines are spoken when an opponent must strip, but the character does not yet know what they will take off.
#Writing different variations is important here, as these lines will be spoken about thirty times per game.

#OPPONENT REMOVING ACCESSORY
#These lines are spoken when an opponent removes a small item that does not cover any skin.
#Typically, characters are fine with this when they are fully dressed but less satisfied as they become more naked.
#Note that all "removing" lines are NOT spoken to human players. Characters will skip straight from "6-male_human_must_strip" to "6-male_removed_accessory", for example.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

5-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested,Um, not to put you down or anything, Blake, but I've fought alongside a walking flower and the Demon Lord of Wounds; cat ears are not shocking to me.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested,Uh, sorry but, is that it? Just cat ears? My friend Pernilla is a walking flower. You look normal compared to her.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested,Sorry, but after dealing with a formless, mind-bending monster, everyone else looks normal to me.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested,Sorry, but I'm not surprised. I guess I got desensitized by the evil, formless monster I defeated not too long ago. He was quite a weird one...
5-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested,Sorry, Blake, but I'm not surprised at all. With all the weird creatures I've seen, I've learned to stop questioning peoples' appearance.

5-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=interested,If you hate the accessories rule so much, why'd you wear any?... I mean, except for your shoes.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4b=interested,Gosh, that is quite the small shirt.

5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3b=interested,That's a nice outfit, I suppose, but why is it missing a sleeve?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=interested,Does your monocle really mean that much to you, Meia? You can still see fine in your other eye, right?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3c=happy,Oh, what a nice sweater!

5-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=interested,This is... really bizarre.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:chun-li=calm,She's right, Chun-Li. The die technically counts... for better or worse.

5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1b=interested,Well, uh... I think you're actually wearing <i>more</i> clothes now, but I guess if it's up to luck, maybe you'll lose more next time?

0-female_removing_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=interested,Sure, it's a nice set - I just noticed; you're not wearing shoes. Your feet are arguably one of the most important parts of your body to cover.

0-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=calm,Case in point; I had no idea you were removing your footwear.
0-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=interested,I know an alchemist who might be able to help; curatives are his specialty. He's sure to have something for burn scars.

#OPPONENT REMOVING MAJOR CLOTHING

#However, as we don't know if the opponent is taking off the top or the bottom, we can't presume that nice abs are showing; maybe she took of her skirt before her shirt.

-1-female_removed_major,target:misato=embarrassed,I'm not offput by the scar. My dad had a ton. I'm more offput by your state of dress...

female_small_chest_is_visible=happy,Hey, there's no shame in a small bust. Some people are into that... statistically speaking.
female_small_chest_is_visible=happy,Size doesn't impact function, you know; they may not be big, but they work just the same.
female_small_chest_is_visible=flustered,Well, I'd say they'll get bigger, but if you're here, you're too old for them to grow any...

#OPPONENT MASTURBATING
#When an opponent is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must pay the penalty by masturbating in front of everyone.
#The "must_masturbate" line is for just before it happens, and the "start_masturbating" line immediately follows.
#The "masturbating" line will be spoken a little after the opponent has started but before they climax.
#When the opponent climaxes, your character will say the "finished_masturbating" line.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

female_masturbating=flustered,I'll have to remember what you're doing, in case I lose too...
female_masturbating=flustered,I kinda wish I had a book to tell me how to do this, instead of learning through watching...
female_masturbating=interested,I'm not making you uncomfortable, am I, ~name~?
female_masturbating=interested,S-so, uh... is... this normally a... group activity?
female_finished_masturbating=shocked,Oh! I wasn't prepared for... <i>that.</i>

#SELF MASTURBATING
#If your character is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must masturbate.
#These lines only come up in the relevant stages, so you don't need to include the stage numbers here. Just remember which stage is which when you make the images. The "starting" image is still in the naked stage.
#The "finished_masturbating" line will repeat many times if the game is not yet finished. This plays as opponents comment on the how good their hands are.

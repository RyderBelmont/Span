#Items of clothing should be listed here in order of removal.
#The values are formal name, lower case name, how much they cover, what they cover
#Please do not put spaces around the commas.
#"Important" clothes cover genitals (lower) or chest/breasts (upper). For example: bras, panties, a skirt when going commando.
#"Major" clothes cover underwear. For example: skirts, pants, shirts, dresses.
#"Minor" clothes cover skin or are large pieces of clothing that do not cover skin. For example: jackets, socks, stockings, gloves.
#"Extra" clothes are small items that may or may not be clothing but do not cover anything interesting. For example: jewelry, shoes or boots with socks underneath, belts, hats. In the rest of the code, "extra" clothes are called "accessory".
#If for some reason you write another word for the type of clothes (e.g. "accessory"), other characters will not react at all when the clothing is removed.
#What they cover = upper (upper body), lower (lower body), other (neither).
#The game can support any number of entries, but typically we use 2-8, with at least one "important" layer for upper and lower (each).

#Notes on dialogue
#All lines that start with a # symbol are comments and will be ignored by the tool that converts this file into a xml file for the game.
#Where more than one line has an identical type, like "swap_cards" and "swap_cards", the game will randomly select one of these lines each time the character is in that situation.
#You should try to include multiple lines for most stages, especially the final (finished) stage, -1. 

#A character goes through multiple stages as they undress. The stage number starts at zero and indicates how many layers they have removed. Special stage numbers are used when they are nude (-3), masturbating (-2), and finished (-1).
#Line types that start with a number will only display during that stage. The will override any numberless stage-generic lines. For example, in stage 4 "4-swap_cards" will be used over "swap_cards" if it is not blank here. Giving a character unique dialogue for each stage is an effective way of showing their changing openness/shyness as the game progresses.
#You can combine the above points and make multiple lines for a particular situation in a particular stage, like "4-swap_cards" and "4-swap_cards".

#Some special words can be used that will be substituted by the game for context-appropriate ones: ~name~ is the name of the character they're speaking to, but this only works if someone else is in focus. ~clothing~ is the type of clothing that is being removed by another player. ~Clothing~ is almost the same, but it starts with a capital letter in case you want to start a sentence with it.
#~name~ can be used any time a line targets an opponent (game_over_defeat, _must_strip, _removing_, _removed, _must_masturbate, etc).
#~clothing~ can be used only when clothing is being removed (_removing and _removed, but NOT _must_strip).
#~player~ can be used at any time and refers to the human player.
#~cards~ can be used only in the swap_cards lines.
#All wildcards can be used once per line only! If you use ~name~ twice, the code will show up the second time.

#Lines can be written that are only spoken when specific other characters are present. For a detailed explanation, read this guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/spnati/comments/6nhaj0/the_easy_way_to_write_targeted_lines/
#Here is an example line (note that targeted lines must have a stage number):
#0-female_must_strip,target:hermione=happy,Looks like your magic doesn't help with poker!

0-okay_hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;1v1:=happy.png,Normally, this hand would be decent, but when it's just us two, it could mean I've lost a round.
0-okay_hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;1v1:=happy.png,Haha. This hand is almost like a coin flip!
0-okay_hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;1v1:=happy.png,Ah, I've probably lost this round, but I'm doing okay all things considered, so it's not so bad.
0-okay_hand,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:86=calm.png,Nothing to report.
0-okay_hand,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:86=calm.png,Nothing of note here.
0-okay_hand,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:86=calm.png,This hand is as standard issue as they come.
0-okay_hand,totalRounds:0,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:147=calm.png,A fine start.
0-okay_hand,totalRounds:0=interested.png,Not a particularly <i>bad</i> start, but not great either...
0-okay_hand,totalRounds:0=interested.png,I guess this is an okay start.
0-bad_hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;1v1:=happy.png,Oh darn! You've won this round for sure!
0-bad_hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;1v1:=happy.png,Aha, there's no way your hand is worse than what <i>I've</i> got!
0-bad_hand,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:88=facepalm.png,Ugh. High card...
0-bad_hand,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:88=annoyed.png,Drat...
0-bad_hand,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:88=annoyed.png,Dang it. High card...
0-bad_hand,totalRounds:0,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:149=facepalm.png,Ugh. What a terrible start.
0-bad_hand,totalRounds:0=sad.png,This is not a good start.
0-bad_hand,totalRounds:0=sad.png,Ugh, this is not a good way to start.
0-bad_hand,totalRounds:0=sad.png,This doesn't bode well for the rest of the game...
0-bad_hand,totalRounds:0=sad.png,I'm off to a bad start.
0-hand,count-role;other&character;mulan&sayingmarker;honorable_others:=flustered.png,A match? Like a romantic partner...? I never really thought about it...
0-hand,count-role;other&character;pinkie_pie&saidmarker;pinka_start&notsaidmarker;pinka_end2:=angry.png,A-anyway, don't you threaten us! If you think I'll let you hurt anyone, you're daft!
0-hand,count-role;other&character;rinkah&stage;4&timeinstage;0:=interested.png,A-anyway, um... That u-underwear looks rather uncomfortable, a-and maybe a bit impractical. Am I right at all?
0-hand,count-role;other&character;kyu&stage;1&timeinstage;0:=thinking.png,But then begs the question: what do you have to gain from lying to us like that...?
0-hand,count-role;other&character;mary&stage;3&sayingmarker;dakku:,id:285,marker:MaryDucks=interested.png,Ducks...? Yeah, I guess you could carry ducks in it. You mean fully grown ones, right? Four sounds about right.
0-hand,oneShotId:19,count-role;other&character;shantae&saidmarker;hearts2:,id:310,marker:Shantae_Hearts=thinking.png,Half a heart, huh, Shantae? Bumping your toe couldn't have been more than 3 HP, so you must have a lot of hearts! Unless you bumped it particularly hard...
0-hand,count-role;other&character;palutena&saying;I have hearts:,marker:PaluHearts1=shocked.png,H-hearts? L-like the symbol, o-or m-maybe cow hearts? N-not <i>human</i> hearts, right?
0-hand,count-role;other&character;mulan&stage;8&saidmarker;duel_lost&notsaidmarker;challenge_answer&sayingmarker;challenge_answer:,marker:Mulan_Question=interested.png,I guess I get to ask you a question now?... Uh... What's your culture like?
0-hand,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;4&timeinstage;0:,marker:RevyCoolIt=annoyed.png,I must say, Revy, I don't appreciate your overly aggressive attitude. You need to cool down!
0-hand,count-role;other&character;mary&sayingmarker;weird_fetish:,id:286=flustered.png,I-I'm not sure. I don't even know if I have... any of those...
0-hand,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;4&timeinstage;2:=angry.png,I'm not scared, I'm just bad at tough talk! I assure you that my arms and legs are better at being tough than my voice is!
0-hand,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;4&timeinstage;2:=angry.png,I'm not scared, I just don't like being so mean! I'm not afraid of putting up a fight, though!
0-hand,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;4&timeinstage;2:=angry.png,I'm not scared, I'm just bad at intimidation checks because of my low charisma stat! I've got more than enough strength to make up for it, though!
0-hand,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;4&timeinstage;2:=angry.png,I'm not scared, I just stutter sometimes! It's never stopped me from taking down dragons, I'll have you know!
0-hand,oneShotId:18,count-role;other&character;orendi&saidmarker;Aella_Quest:,marker:Orendi_Quest=flustered.png,I'm still processing that quest you told me about, Orendi. How do you destroy stuff with math...?
0-hand,count-role;other&character;nayru&stage;5&timeinstage;0&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=flustered.png,I'm, uh... I'm sorry about your dress, Nayru. I can fix it up for you, if you like.
0-hand,count-role;other&character;ini&stage;5&timeinstage;0:=facepalm.png,I've <i>been</i> using my brain, I just wanted to believe that you were who you were saying you were.
0-hand,count-role;other&character;marinette&stage;1&timeinstage;0:=calm.png,I've never seen any Ladybug Mages before. Did you invent the school?
0-hand,count-role;other&character;marinette&sayingmarker;aella_bookclub:=enthused.png,I've read quite a few of them, yeah! I should show you my collection of them. We could compare our worlds' fashion trends!
0-hand,oneShotId:21,count-role;other&character;shantae&saidmarker;adventures:,id:307=happy.png,My adventure involved a lot of that too, Shantae! Except for the transformations part.
0-hand,count-role;other&character;meia&stage;5&saidmarker;aella_slaughter:,id:107,marker:MeiaSafeKill=flustered.png,N-no, Meia, I don't mean things that are beneth me, I mean things that <i>endanger</i> me. Things that you <i>need</i> to kill to be safe.
0-hand,count-role;other&character;meia&stage;5&saidmarker;aella_slaughter:,id:107,marker:MeiaSafeKill=flustered.png,You make it sound like I enjoy killing bunnies and squirrels, Meia... I meant <i>dangerous</i> things. Things that you need to kill to be safe.
0-hand,count-role;other&character;marinette&sayingmarker;aella_adventures:=happy.png,No no, that's okay, the demon weapon problem has already been taken care of!
0-hand,count-role;other&character;ini&stage;6&timeinstage;0:=facepalm.png,Of course it is... Well, you're right, there's nothing I can do with that information, but thank you for your honesty.
0-hand,count-role;other&character;amalia&stage;5&timeinstage;0:=shocked.png,Oh! F-flowers! Good thinking!
0-hand,count-role;other&character;amalia&stage;5&timeinstage;0:=shocked.png,F-flowers! F-for cover. Good thinking!
0-hand,count-role;other&character;erufuda&stage;3&timeinstage;0:,id:290,marker:ErufudaPants1=happy.png,Oh, and don't worry about the tear. I can fix that for you so you don't have to wear them home like that!
0-hand,count-role;other&character;futaba&sayingmarker;futaba_bookclub:=happy.png,Oh, I agree! The mind is very fascinating!
0-hand,count-role;other&character;meia&stage;1&timeinstage;0:=interested.png,Oh, I see... What's an "Oma?"
0-hand,oneShotId:7,count-role;self&saidmarker;AellaHP:,id:269,marker:AellaHP2=interested.png,Oh, uh, you guys know about HP, right? The life force of all living things? I just realized this world might operate on different rules than mine.
0-hand,count-role;other&character;spooky&stage;1&timeinstage;0:=annoyed.png,Oh, you think I can't hit a ghost? I have spells for that, you know, so don't try anything funny.
0-hand,count-role;other&character;ribbon_girl&stage;3&sayingmarker;AellaChargeArms:=calm.png,Okay. You'll have to introduce us later, then.
0-hand,count-role;other&character;futaba&sayingmarker;futaba_adventures:=enthused.png,Ooh, I've always wanted to go overseas! Uh, in my world, that is, but I'm sure overseas in this world is great too!
0-hand,count-role;other&character;joey&sayingmarker;CandyHat:=interested.png,Really?... What kind of candy?
0-hand,count-role;other&character;joey&sayingmarker;CandyHat:=interested.png,Really? Wouldn't that make your head sticky?
0-hand,count-role;other&character;joey&sayingmarker;CandyHat:=interested.png,Really? Well, I hope it doesn't melt on you.
0-hand,oneShotId:24,count-role;other&character;erufuda&saidmarker;aella_fries2:,id:313=flustered.png,Shoot, I just remembered I'm in a foreign region. Unless restaurants around here accept gold, I'm gonna need some new currency before I can get some fries...
0-hand,oneShotId:22,count-role;other&character;erufuda&saidmarker;aella_fries:,id:287=happy.png,So where can I get some of these "fries" for myself?
0-hand,oneShotId:9,count-role;self&saidmarker;AellaHP3:,marker:AellaHP4=interested.png,Some people theorize that HP is a kind of shield-like energy that protects your soul. Which I guess makes sense when you consider healing magic.
0-hand,count-role;other&character;saki_zls&stage;6&timeinstage;0:=interested.png,S-so what happened to your body? Th-the scars, I mean.
0-hand,oneShotId:4,count-role;other&character;lucina&stage;1:=flustered.png,S-sorry, I don't mean to undermine your status... Let me start over. Hi, Princess Lucina, I'm Aella. Nice to meet you.
0-hand,count-role;other&character;mavis&stage;3&timeinstage;0:=happy.png,Staying at home is no excuse for not working out. Just look at me! I spent my whole life inside, and I can suplex orcs!
0-hand,count-role;other&character;mavis&stage;3&timeinstage;0:=happy.png,Staying at home is no excuse for not working out. If anything, it's a reason to do it more! That's what <i>I</i> did, anyway!
0-hand,count-role;other&character;meia&stage;1&timeinstage;1:=calm.png,That's interesting, Meia! It's certainly not unheard of for women to love each other in my world, but I didn't think they could have children.
0-hand,oneShotId:25,count-role;other&character;erufuda&saidmarker;aella_book_club2:,id:314,marker:ErufudaBook2=interested.png,The book you're talking about must be in a foreign language, huh, Erufuda? I still only caught "elf" from the title.
0-hand,count-role;other&character;mavis&stage;5&timeinstage;0:=interested.png,To be honest, no, that isn't.
0-hand,oneShotId:20,count-role;other&character;shantae&stage;1:,id:311,marker:Shantae_Transformations=interested.png,Transformations, you say? Don't you know transformation magic is dangerous?... Or is it safer for you because you're a magical being?
0-hand,count-role;other&character;mary&sayingmarker;imnotlooking:,id:282,marker:MaryBlind=interested.png,Uh, okay. I guess you have a point, but telling us that makes about as much of a difference as actually doing it.
0-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;AellaHP2&notsaidmarker;AellaHP3:,id:268,marker:AellaHP3=calm.png,Uh, right, so HP is your life force in my world. You lose it when you experience bodily harm, and you gain it when you eat or sleep.
0-hand,count-role;other&character;rainbow_dash&sayingmarker;adventurer_what_do:,marker:RDAdventures1=happy.png,Well, I didn't go around finding relics, but I did go on a pretty crazy adventure to kill these demon weapons that were causing havoc.
0-hand,count-role;other&character;nami&stage;3:=competitive.png,Well, uh, don't worry about me trying to turn you in, Nami. At least, not unless you start to cause trouble.
0-hand,count-role;other&character;erufuda&stage;1:=interested.png,What is that you're eating, Erufuda? It sure does smell appetizing.
0-hand,count-role;other&character;meia&stage;5&saidmarker;aella_menkill:,id:256,marker:MeiaSeesPsycho=sad.png,You really just don't want to see me as anything other than an amoral psycho, huh?
0-hand,count-role;other&character;natsuki&stage;1&timeinstage;0:=interested.png,You seem to... really not want to be here, Natsuki. No offense - again - but why are you here?
0-hand,count-role;other&character;akko&stage;4&timeinstage;0:=interested.png,You'd be able to cast spells that you couldn't before, but you'd lose what makes you <i>you</i> too, so you can see why it's bad.
0-hand,count-role;other&character;meia&stage;5&saidmarker;aella_menkill2:,id:270,marker:MeiaNotListening=annoyed.png,You're not listening to me, Meia! My point is that it's fun to fight, but only when it's with something you can't reason with! <i>Killing</i> isn't fun!
0-hand,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;4&timeinstage;1:,marker:HadEnough=angry.png,Y-you'd better watch yourself! I-I'm not afraid to fight you!
0-hand,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;4&timeinstage;1:,marker:HadEnough=angry.png,Y-you'd better watch yourself! I-I've fought bigger things than you!
0-hand,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;4&timeinstage;1:,marker:HadEnough=angry.png,Y-you want a fight? My THAC0 is low even <i>without</i> my axe, s-so you'd be no match for me!
0-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;RGWager&notsaidmarker;RGWagerNotSure:,count-role;other&character;ribbon_girl:,marker:RGWagerNotSure=flustered.png,Aha, well, I'm sure I could beat you, but... <i>anything?</i> I don't like the sound of that...
0-hand,oneShotId:16,count-role;self&saidmarker;AellaAdventures:,count-role;other&character;chara_dreemurr:,marker:CharaDemon=flustered.png,Are you a demon, Chara? I don't remember freeing you from a weapon prison...
0-hand,count-role;other&character;tharja&saidmarker;cheating1:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;TharjaCheating:,marker:TharjaCheating=annoyed.png,H-hey, wait a minute, did you just say you've been cheating? You'd better stop!
0-hand,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;DoneWithRevy:,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;5&timeinstage;2:=angry.png,I don't care how often you're rude to people! You shouldn't be rude because it makes people feel bad!
0-hand,count-role;other&character;jolyne:,count-role;self&saidmarker;AellaAdventures:,id:303,marker:JolyneAdventure=happy.png,I don't know about that, Jolyne, my adventure was pretty bizarre too! I'd like to hear about yours!
0-hand,oneShotId:13,count-role;self&saidmarker;MaryDucks:,count-role;other&character;mary&sayingmarker;AellaDucks:,id:295,marker:MaryDucks2=thinking.png,I don't know about that. I think my dress could only carry... maybe seven? Eight at best.
0-hand,count-role;other&character;erufuda&stage;3:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ErufudaPants1:,id:316,marker:ErufudaPants2=interested.png,I don't know where you've been getting your clothes from, but human craftsmanship is usually pretty good. Not the best, but good. My sister's dress is human-made and lasted for years.
0-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;TimeStopAttempt&notsaidmarker;TimeStopFail:,count-role;other&character;jotaro:,marker:TimeStopFail=sad.png,I guess I can't cast the time stop spell like you can, Jotaro.
0-hand,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;RevyCoolIt:,count-role;other&character;revy&sayingmarker;music:,marker:AellaMusic=happy.png,I like piano and violin music the best. Does anyone here know how to play either of those instruments?
0-hand,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;DoneWithRevy:,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;5&timeinstage;0:=angry.png,I said "Niccolo," not "Nicole!" Are you hard of hearing? Start being nicer and I'll tell you about a guy who can help!
0-hand,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;DoneWithRevy:,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;5&timeinstage;0:=angry.png,I said "Niccolo," not "Nicole!" You messed that up on purpose, didn't you?
0-hand,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;DoneWithRevy:,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;5&timeinstage;0:=angry.png,I said "Niccolo," not "Nicole!" Funny, you're as tall, uncharming, and <i>almost</i> as masculine as him.
0-hand,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;DoneWithRevy:,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;5&timeinstage;0:=angry.png,I said "Niccolo," not "Nicole!" And if you try to lay a single dirty hand on me, I... I'll break your arm!
0-hand,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;DoneWithRevy:,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;5&timeinstage;0:=angry.png,I said "Niccolo," not "Nicole!" If I didn't know he's an only child, I'd swear your his sister!
0-hand,oneShotId:17,count-role;other&character;chara_dreemurr:,count-role;self&saidmarker;CharaDemon:,marker:CharaDemon2=competitive.png,I'll give you a fair warning, Chara, I'm no stranger to demon-slaying, so don't try anything funny, okay?
0-hand,count-role;other&character;revy:,count-role;self&saidmarker;SorryMeia&notsaidmarker;NotAMurderer:,marker:NotAMurderer=annoyed.png,I'm not a <i>murderer</i>, no, but just because I don't <i>murder</i> doesn't mean I haven't <i>killed</i>, Revy.
0-hand,count-role;other&character;revy:,count-role;self&saidmarker;SorryMeia&notsaidmarker;NotAMurderer:,marker:NotAMurderer=annoyed.png,I'm not a <i>murderer</i>, Revy, but I've killed orcs, dragons, even <i>demons</i>, but I don't make a game of it.
0-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;JotaroStopTime:,count-role;other&character;jotaro&stage;2&timeinstage;0:=enthused.png,I've only ever met "time" mages who could cast speed-based spells. You must be a <i>true</i> time mage, Jotaro!
0-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;JotaroStopTime2&notsaidmarker;TimeStopAttempt:,count-role;other&character;jotaro:,marker:TimeStopAttempt=competitive.png,Let's see if I can stop time too. <i>Star platinum!</i>
0-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;AellaAdventures:,count-role;other&character;kizuna&sayingmarker;ai_ventures:=happy.png,Not really the kind of adventure I was asking about, but that's a good answer anyway, Kizuna!
0-hand,count-role;other&character;saki_zls&stage;6:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;ZLS1:=calm.png,Oh! You're undead! I thought I smelled something... dead.
0-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;AellaAdventures:,count-role;other&character;mulan&notsaidmarker;MulanAdventures&sayingmarker;MulanAdventures:=enthused.png,Oh, it definitely counts! I love tales of adventures involving rescuing royalty!
0-hand,count-role;other&character;saki_zls&stage;6:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ZLS1:=happy.png,Oh, you're undead too? Were you two risen by the same necromancer, by chance?
0-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;AellaHP2:,count-role;other&character;shantae&saidmarker;hearts:,id:304,marker:AellaHP3=happy.png,Right, Shantae, a lot of people associate hearts with HP, but there's actually no connect to the heart or blood. You'd lose HP if you broke a bone, even if there's no bleeding.
0-hand,count-role;other&character;croix&saidmarker;AellaFrench:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;Languages1:,marker:Languages1=embarrassed.png,Uh, y-yeah, I speak French. Khadoric and Dragonic, too. Dreh hi mindok niin?
0-hand,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;RGWager:,count-role;other&character;ribbon_girl&saidmarker;WagerStart:,marker:RGWager=interested.png,Um, does that wager apply to everyone, or just ~player~, Ribbon Girl?
0-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;Joey5&notsaidmarker;Joey6:,count-role;other&character;joey:,marker:Joey6=interested.png,Um, why have a "no touching" rule? No offense, but you already go pretty far, why stop there?
0-hand,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;DoneWithRevy:,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;5&timeinstage;1:=angry.png,Well, I'm sorry about your bad hearing, Revy, but you can't just mishear a name and start assuming you know my life! It's very rude!
0-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;AellaAdventures&notsaidmarker;Jessie1:,count-role;other&character;jessie&saidmarker;jessieAdventure:,marker:Jessie1=interested.png,What kind of adventure do you mean, Jessie?
0-hand,oneShotId:23,count-role;other&character;erufuda:,count-role;self&saidmarker;AellaBookClub:,id:288,marker:ErufudaBook1=flustered.png,What was that book you mentioned again, Erufuda? The only part of it I caught was "Elf."
0-hand,count-role;other&character;meia:,count-role;self&saidmarker;SorryMeia&notsaidmarker;SorryMeia2:,marker:SorryMeia2=flustered.png,W-well, I just meant that there isn't really a way to know if I'm really stronger than you without putting it to the test, you know...?
0-hand,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;DoneWithRevy:,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;4&timeinstage;2:=angry.png,W-what? No! Why would I ever... do <i>that</i> with <i>you</i>? I like nice men, not rude women!
0-hand,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;DoneWithRevy:,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;4&timeinstage;2:,marker:RevyNotPretty=angry.png,W-what? No! Why would I ever... do <i>that</i> with <i>you</i>? You're not even that pretty!
0-hand,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;DoneWithRevy:,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;4&timeinstage;2:,marker:RevyProbablyHasAnSTD=angry.png,W-what? Why would I ever let <i>you</i> touch <i>me</i>? I'd probably catch a disease!

0-hand,oneShotId:6,count-role;other&character;kamina&stage;1:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:188=calm.png,You don't get to be a Sergeant by letting your teammates play make-believe to their deaths.
0-hand,priority:381,count-role;other&character;akko&stage;4&timeinstage;0:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:243=interested.png,You'd be able to cast spells that you couldn't before, but you'd lose what makes you <i>you</i> too, so you can see why it's dangerous .

0-hand,count-role;other&character;akko&stage;5&timeinstage;0:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0,marker:RecycleMana=interested.png,For example: did you know that your black magic summons can be sacrificed to recycle the mana cost?
0-hand,count-role;other&character;akko&stage;5&timeinstage;0:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0,marker:ManaRegen=calm.png,For example: do you think when a spell ends, the mana vanishes? It doesn't. It spreads out across the ether, allowing regeneration.
0-hand,count-role;other&character;akko&stage;5&timeinstage;0:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0,marker:CastAnySpell=calm.png,For example: anyone can cast any spell. The reason people <i>don't</i> cast any spell they want is all a matter of psychology.
0-hand,count-role;other&character;akko&stage;5&timeinstage;0:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0,marker:HPCast=interested.png,For example: it's possible to use your HP instead of mana to cast spells. Though, you really shouldn't try, for obvious reasons.
0-hand,count-role;other&character;akko&stage;5&timeinstage;0:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0,marker:WhiteMagic=calm.png,For example: white magic isn't quite like other magic types. Healing spells convert mana into HP, and cures merely dissipate spells.

1-hand,count-role;other&character;amalia&stage;5&timeinstage;0:=shocked.png,F-flowers! F-for cover. Good thinking!

1-hand,oneShotId:22,count-role;other&character;erufuda&saidmarker;aella_fries:,id:287=happy.png,So where can I get some of these "fries" for myself?
1-hand,oneShotId:9,count-role;self&saidmarker;AellaHP3:,marker:AellaHP4=interested.png,Some people theorize that HP is a kind of shield-like energy that protects your soul. Which I guess makes sense when you consider healing magic.
1-hand,count-role;other&character;saki_zls&stage;6&timeinstage;0:=interested.png,S-so what happened to your body? Th-the scars, I mean.
1-hand,oneShotId:4,count-role;other&character;lucina&stage;1:=flustered.png,S-sorry, I don't mean to undermine your status... Let me start over. Hi, Princess Lucina, I'm Aella. Nice to meet you.

1-hand,count-role;other&character;mavis&stage;3&timeinstage;0:=happy.png,Staying at home is no excuse for not working out. If anything, it's a reason to do it more! That's what <i>I</i> did, anyway!
1-hand,count-role;other&character;meia&stage;1&timeinstage;1:=calm.png,That's interesting, Meia! It's certainly not unheard of for women to love each other in my world, but I didn't think they could have children.
1-hand,oneShotId:25,count-role;other&character;erufuda&saidmarker;aella_book_club2:,id:314,marker:ErufudaBook2=interested.png,The book you're talking about must be in a foreign language, huh, Erufuda? I still only caught "elf" from the title.
1-hand,count-role;other&character;mavis&stage;5&timeinstage;0:=interested.png,To be honest, no, that isn't.
1-hand,oneShotId:20,count-role;other&character;shantae&stage;1:,id:311,marker:Shantae_Transformations=interested.png,Transformations, you say? Don't you know transformation magic is dangerous?... Or is it safer for you because you're a magical being?
1-hand,count-role;other&character;mary&sayingmarker;imnotlooking:,id:282,marker:MaryBlind=interested.png,Uh, okay. I guess you have a point, but telling us that makes about as much of a difference as actually doing it.
1-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;AellaHP2&notsaidmarker;AellaHP3:,id:268,marker:AellaHP3=calm.png,Uh, right, so HP is your life force in my world. You lose it when you experience bodily harm, and you gain it when you eat or sleep.
1-hand,count-role;other&character;rainbow_dash&sayingmarker;adventurer_what_do:,marker:RDAdventures1=happy.png,Well, I didn't go around finding relics, but I did go on a pretty crazy adventure to kill these demon weapons that were causing havoc.
1-hand,count-role;other&character;nami&stage;3:=competitive.png,Well, uh, don't worry about me trying to turn you in, Nami. At least, not unless you start to cause trouble.
1-hand,count-role;other&character;erufuda&stage;1:=interested.png,What is that you're eating, Erufuda? It sure does smell appetizing.
1-hand,count-role;other&character;meia&stage;5&saidmarker;aella_menkill:,id:256,marker:MeiaSeesPsycho=sad.png,You really just don't want to see me as anything other than an amoral psycho, huh?
1-hand,count-role;other&character;akko&stage;4&timeinstage;0:=interested.png,You'd be able to cast spells that you couldn't before, but you'd lose what makes you <i>you</i> too, so you can see why it's bad.
1-hand,count-role;other&character;meia&stage;5&saidmarker;aella_menkill2:,id:270,marker:MeiaNotListening=annoyed.png,You're not listening to me, Meia! My point is that it's fun to fight, but only when it's with something you can't reason with! <i>Killing</i> isn't fun!
1-hand,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;4&timeinstage;1:,marker:HadEnough=angry.png,Y-you'd better watch yourself! I-I'm not afraid to fight you!
1-hand,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;4&timeinstage;1:,marker:HadEnough=angry.png,Y-you'd better watch yourself! I-I've fought bigger things than you!
1-hand,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;4&timeinstage;1:,marker:HadEnough=angry.png,Y-you want a fight? My THAC0 is low even <i>without</i> my axe, s-so you'd be no match for me!

1-hand,oneShotId:16,count-role;self&saidmarker;AellaAdventures:,count-role;other&character;chara_dreemurr:,marker:CharaDemon=flustered.png,Are you a demon, Chara? I don't remember freeing you from a weapon prison...
1-hand,count-role;other&character;tharja&saidmarker;cheating1:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;TharjaCheating:,marker:TharjaCheating=annoyed.png,H-hey, wait a minute, did you just say you've been cheating? You'd better stop!
1-hand,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;DoneWithRevy:,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;5&timeinstage;2:=angry.png,I don't care how often you're rude to people! You shouldn't be rude because it makes people feel bad!
1-hand,count-role;other&character;jolyne:,count-role;self&saidmarker;AellaAdventures:,id:303,marker:JolyneAdventure=happy.png,I don't know about that, Jolyne, my adventure was pretty bizarre too! I'd like to hear about yours!
1-hand,oneShotId:13,count-role;self&saidmarker;MaryDucks:,count-role;other&character;mary&sayingmarker;AellaDucks:,id:295,marker:MaryDucks2=thinking.png,I don't know about that. I think my dress could only carry... maybe seven? Eight at best.
1-hand,count-role;other&character;erufuda&stage;3:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ErufudaPants1:,id:316,marker:ErufudaPants2=interested.png,I don't know where you've been getting your clothes from, but human craftsmanship is usually pretty good. Not the best, but good. My sister's dress is human-made and lasted for years.
1-hand,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;RevyCoolIt:,count-role;other&character;revy&sayingmarker;music:,marker:AellaMusic=happy.png,I like piano and violin music the best. Does anyone here know how to play either of those instruments?
1-hand,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;DoneWithRevy:,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;5&timeinstage;0:=angry.png,I said "Niccolo," not "Nicole!" Are you hard of hearing? Start being nicer and I'll tell you about a guy who can help!
1-hand,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;DoneWithRevy:,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;5&timeinstage;0:=angry.png,I said "Niccolo," not "Nicole!" You messed that up on purpose, didn't you?
1-hand,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;DoneWithRevy:,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;5&timeinstage;0:=angry.png,I said "Niccolo," not "Nicole!" Funny, you're as tall, uncharming, and <i>almost</i> as masculine as him.
1-hand,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;DoneWithRevy:,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;5&timeinstage;0:=angry.png,I said "Niccolo," not "Nicole!" And if you try to lay a single dirty hand on me, I... I'll break your arm!
1-hand,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;DoneWithRevy:,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;5&timeinstage;0:=angry.png,I said "Niccolo," not "Nicole!" If I didn't know he's an only child, I'd swear your his sister!
1-hand,oneShotId:17,count-role;other&character;chara_dreemurr:,count-role;self&saidmarker;CharaDemon:,marker:CharaDemon2=competitive.png,I'll give you a fair warning, Chara, I'm no stranger to demon-slaying, so don't try anything funny, okay?
1-hand,count-role;other&character;revy:,count-role;self&saidmarker;SorryMeia&notsaidmarker;NotAMurderer:,marker:NotAMurderer=annoyed.png,I'm not a <i>murderer</i>, no, but just because I don't <i>murder</i> doesn't mean I haven't <i>killed</i>, Revy.
1-hand,count-role;other&character;revy:,count-role;self&saidmarker;SorryMeia&notsaidmarker;NotAMurderer:,marker:NotAMurderer=annoyed.png,I'm not a <i>murderer</i>, Revy, but I've killed orcs, dragons, even <i>demons</i>, but I don't make a game of it.
1-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;Joey3&notsaidmarker;Joey4:,count-role;other&character;joey:,marker:Joey4=interested.png,Isn't it, uh... kind of dangerous to be naked in public?
1-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;JotaroStopTime:,count-role;other&character;jotaro&stage;2&timeinstage;0:=enthused.png,I've only ever met "time" mages who could cast speed-based spells. You must be a <i>true</i> time mage, Jotaro!
1-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;JotaroStopTime2&notsaidmarker;TimeStopAttempt:,count-role;other&character;jotaro:,marker:TimeStopAttempt=competitive.png,Let's see if I can stop time too. <i>Star platinum!</i>
1-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;AellaAdventures:,count-role;other&character;kizuna&sayingmarker;ai_ventures:=happy.png,Not really the kind of adventure I was asking about, but that's a good answer anyway, Kizuna!

1-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;AellaHP2:,count-role;other&character;shantae&saidmarker;hearts:,id:304,marker:AellaHP3=happy.png,Right, Shantae, a lot of people associate hearts with HP, but there's actually no connect to the heart or blood. You'd lose HP if you broke a bone, even if there's no bleeding.
1-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;Joey1&notsaidmarker;Joey2:,count-role;other&character;joey:,marker:Joey2=interested.png,So wait, Joey, you get paid to s-strip?

1-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;Joey5&notsaidmarker;Joey6:,count-role;other&character;joey:,marker:Joey6=interested.png,Um, why have a "no touching" rule? No offense, but you already go pretty far, why stop there?
1-hand,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;DoneWithRevy:,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;5&timeinstage;1:=angry.png,Well, I'm sorry about your bad hearing, Revy, but you can't just mishear a name and start assuming you know my life! It's very rude!
1-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;Joey4&notsaidmarker;Joey5:,count-role;other&character;joey:,marker:Joey5=interested.png,What are some of the stipulations you have, Joey?
1-hand,count-role;self&timeinstage;0:,count-role;other&character;joey:,marker:Joey1=interested.png,What do you mean by that, Joey?
1-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;AellaAdventures&notsaidmarker;Jessie1:,count-role;other&character;jessie&saidmarker;jessieAdventure:,marker:Jessie1=interested.png,What kind of adventure do you mean, Jessie?

1-hand,count-meia:1,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;7&timeinstage;1:=happy.png,Well just because you're pirates doesn't mean I want you hurt. Resolving conflict with bloodshed is only fun against monsters.
1-hand,count-meia:1,count-role;self&saidmarker;HadEnough:,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;9&timeinstage;0:,marker:CouldntTakeMe=angry.png,Ha! I knew you were all talk! If you couldn't take down Meia, what makes you think you'll best <i>me</i>?
1-hand,count-meia:1,count-role;self&saidmarker;CouldntTakeMe&notsaidmarker;SorryMeia:,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;7:,marker:SorryMeia=flustered.png,Oh, uh, sorry, Meia. I didn't mean to imply you look weak. I just mean I'm probably stronger...
1-hand,totalRounds:28=flustered.png,Gosh, this game is taking longer than I thought it would...
1-hand,totalRounds:28=flustered.png,It's a good thing I'm used to standing for long periods of time. This game is taking quite a while...
1-hand,totalRounds:28=flustered.png,I'm used to long fights, but this is... not as fun, to be honest. I mean, not that it's <i>boring</i>, just... never mind...
1-hand,totalRounds:28=interested.png,Do these games normally go on for this long? Not that I'm complaining, I'm just curious.

2-good_hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;1v1:=competitive.png,Aha! With this hand, I've won this round for sure!
2-good_hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;1v1:=happy.png,You're going to need something really good to beat me this round!
2-good_hand,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:84=happy.png,Exactly as planned.
2-good_hand,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:84=happy.png,Good luck beating me this round. Your gonna need it.
2-okay_hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;1v1:=happy.png,Normally, this hand would be decent, but when it's just us two, it could mean I've lost a round.
2-okay_hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;1v1:=happy.png,Haha. This hand is almost like a coin flip!
2-okay_hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;1v1:=happy.png,Ah, I've probably lost this round, but I'm doing okay all things considered, so it's not so bad.
2-okay_hand,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:86=calm.png,Nothing to report.
2-okay_hand,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:86=calm.png,Nothing of note here.

2-bad_hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;1v1:=happy.png,Aha, there's no way your hand is worse than what <i>I've</i> got!
2-bad_hand,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:88=facepalm.png,Ugh. High card...

2-bad_hand,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:88=annoyed.png,Dang it. High card...
2-hand,count-role;other&character;mulan&sayingmarker;honorable_others:=flustered.png,A match? Like a romantic partner...? I never really thought about it...
2-hand,count-role;other&character;rinkah&stage;4&timeinstage;0:=interested.png,A-anyway, um... That u-underwear looks rather uncomfortable, a-and maybe a bit impractical. Am I right at all?
2-hand,count-role;other&character;kyu&stage;1&timeinstage;0:=thinking.png,But then begs the question: what do you have to gain from lying to us like that...?
2-hand,count-role;other&character;mary&stage;3&sayingmarker;dakku:,id:285,marker:MaryDucks=interested.png,Ducks...? Yeah, I guess you could carry ducks in it. You mean fully grown ones, right? Four sounds about right.
2-hand,oneShotId:19,count-role;other&character;shantae&saidmarker;hearts2:,id:310,marker:Shantae_Hearts=thinking.png,Half a heart, huh, Shantae? Bumping your toe couldn't have been more than 3 HP, so you must have a lot of hearts! Unless you bumped it particularly hard...
2-hand,count-role;other&character;palutena&saying;I have hearts:,marker:PaluHearts1=shocked.png,H-hearts? L-like the symbol, o-or m-maybe cow hearts? N-not <i>human</i> hearts, right?
2-hand,count-role;other&character;mulan&stage;8&saidmarker;duel_lost&notsaidmarker;challenge_answer&sayingmarker;challenge_answer:,marker:Mulan_Question=interested.png,I guess I get to ask you a question now?... Uh... What's your culture like?
2-hand,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;4&timeinstage;0:,marker:RevyCoolIt=annoyed.png,I must say, Revy, I don't appreciate your overly aggressive attitude. You need to cool down!
2-hand,count-role;other&character;mary&sayingmarker;weird_fetish:,id:286=flustered.png,I-I'm not sure. I don't even know if I have... any of those...
2-hand,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;4&timeinstage;2:=angry.png,I'm not scared, I'm just bad at tough talk! I assure you that my arms and legs are better at being tough than my voice is!
2-hand,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;4&timeinstage;2:=angry.png,I'm not scared, I just don't like being so mean! I'm not afraid of putting up a fight, though!
2-hand,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;4&timeinstage;2:=angry.png,I'm not scared, I'm just bad at intimidation checks because of my low charisma stat! I've got more than enough strength to make up for it, though!
2-hand,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;4&timeinstage;2:=angry.png,I'm not scared, I just stutter sometimes! It's never stopped me from taking down dragons, I'll have you know!
2-hand,oneShotId:18,count-role;other&character;orendi&saidmarker;Aella_Quest:,marker:Orendi_Quest=flustered.png,I'm still processing that quest you told me about, Orendi. How do you destroy stuff with math...?
2-hand,count-role;other&character;nayru&stage;5&timeinstage;0&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=flustered.png,I'm, uh... I'm sorry about your dress, Nayru. I can fix it up for you, if you like.
2-hand,count-role;other&character;ini&stage;5&timeinstage;0:=facepalm.png,I've <i>been</i> using my brain, I just wanted to believe that you were who you were saying you were.
2-hand,count-role;other&character;marinette&stage;1&timeinstage;0:=calm.png,I've never seen any Ladybug Mages before. Did you invent the school?
2-hand,count-role;other&character;marinette&sayingmarker;aella_bookclub:=enthused.png,I've read quite a few of them, yeah! I should show you my collection of them. We could compare our worlds' fashion trends!
2-hand,oneShotId:21,count-role;other&character;shantae&saidmarker;adventures:,id:307=happy.png,My adventure involved a lot of that too, Shantae! Except for the transformations part.
2-hand,count-role;other&character;meia&stage;5&saidmarker;aella_slaughter:,id:107,marker:MeiaSafeKill=flustered.png,N-no, Meia, I don't mean things that are beneth me, I mean things that <i>endanger</i> me. Things that you <i>need</i> to kill to be safe.
2-hand,count-role;other&character;meia&stage;5&saidmarker;aella_slaughter:,id:107,marker:MeiaSafeKill=flustered.png,You make it sound like I enjoy killing bunnies and squirrels, Meia... I meant <i>dangerous</i> things. Things that you need to kill to be safe.
2-hand,count-role;other&character;marinette&sayingmarker;aella_adventures:=happy.png,No no, that's okay, the demon weapon problem has already been taken care of!
2-hand,count-role;other&character;ini&stage;6&timeinstage;0:=facepalm.png,Of course it is... Well, you're right, there's nothing I can do with that information, but thank you for your honesty.
2-hand,count-role;other&character;amalia&stage;5&timeinstage;0:=shocked.png,Oh! F-flowers! Good thinking!
2-hand,count-role;other&character;amalia&stage;5&timeinstage;0:=shocked.png,F-flowers! F-for cover. Good thinking!
2-hand,count-role;other&character;erufuda&stage;3&timeinstage;0:,id:290,marker:ErufudaPants1=happy.png,Oh, and don't worry about the tear. I can fix that for you so you don't have to wear them home like that!
2-hand,count-role;other&character;futaba&sayingmarker;futaba_bookclub:=happy.png,Oh, I agree! The mind is very fascinating!
2-hand,count-role;other&character;meia&stage;1&timeinstage;0:=interested.png,Oh, I see... What's an "Oma?"
2-hand,oneShotId:7,count-role;self&saidmarker;AellaHP:,id:269,marker:AellaHP2=interested.png,Oh, uh, you guys know about HP, right? The life force of all living things? I just realized this world might operate on different rules than mine.
2-hand,count-role;other&character;spooky&stage;1&timeinstage;0:=annoyed.png,Oh, you think I can't hit a ghost? I have spells for that, you know, so don't try anything funny.
2-hand,count-role;other&character;ribbon_girl&stage;3&sayingmarker;AellaChargeArms:=calm.png,Okay. You'll have to introduce us later, then.
2-hand,count-role;other&character;futaba&sayingmarker;futaba_adventures:=enthused.png,Ooh, I've always wanted to go overseas! Uh, in my world, that is, but I'm sure overseas in this world is great too!
2-hand,count-role;other&character;joey&sayingmarker;CandyHat:=interested.png,Really?... What kind of candy?
2-hand,count-role;other&character;joey&sayingmarker;CandyHat:=interested.png,Really? Wouldn't that make your head sticky?
2-hand,count-role;other&character;joey&sayingmarker;CandyHat:=interested.png,Really? Well, I hope it doesn't melt on you.
2-hand,oneShotId:24,count-role;other&character;erufuda&saidmarker;aella_fries2:,id:313=flustered.png,Shoot, I just remembered I'm in a foreign region. Unless restaurants around here accept gold, I'm gonna need some new currency before I can get some fries...
2-hand,oneShotId:22,count-role;other&character;erufuda&saidmarker;aella_fries:,id:287=happy.png,So where can I get some of these "fries" for myself?
2-hand,oneShotId:9,count-role;self&saidmarker;AellaHP3:,marker:AellaHP4=interested.png,Some people theorize that HP is a kind of shield-like energy that protects your soul. Which I guess makes sense when you consider healing magic.
2-hand,count-role;other&character;saki_zls&stage;6&timeinstage;0:=interested.png,S-so what happened to your body? Th-the scars, I mean.
2-hand,oneShotId:4,count-role;other&character;lucina&stage;1:=flustered.png,S-sorry, I don't mean to undermine your status... Let me start over. Hi, Princess Lucina, I'm Aella. Nice to meet you.
2-hand,count-role;other&character;mavis&stage;3&timeinstage;0:=happy.png,Staying at home is no excuse for not working out. Just look at me! I spent my whole life inside, and I can suplex orcs!
2-hand,count-role;other&character;mavis&stage;3&timeinstage;0:=happy.png,Staying at home is no excuse for not working out. If anything, it's a reason to do it more! That's what <i>I</i> did, anyway!
2-hand,count-role;other&character;meia&stage;1&timeinstage;1:=calm.png,That's interesting, Meia! It's certainly not unheard of for women to love each other in my world, but I didn't think they could have children.
2-hand,oneShotId:25,count-role;other&character;erufuda&saidmarker;aella_book_club2:,id:314,marker:ErufudaBook2=interested.png,The book you're talking about must be in a foreign language, huh, Erufuda? I still only caught "elf" from the title.
2-hand,count-role;other&character;mavis&stage;5&timeinstage;0:=interested.png,To be honest, no, that isn't.
2-hand,oneShotId:20,count-role;other&character;shantae&stage;1:,id:311,marker:Shantae_Transformations=interested.png,Transformations, you say? Don't you know transformation magic is dangerous?... Or is it safer for you because you're a magical being?
2-hand,count-role;other&character;mary&sayingmarker;imnotlooking:,id:282,marker:MaryBlind=interested.png,Uh, okay. I guess you have a point, but telling us that makes about as much of a difference as actually doing it.
2-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;AellaHP2&notsaidmarker;AellaHP3:,id:268,marker:AellaHP3=calm.png,Uh, right, so HP is your life force in my world. You lose it when you experience bodily harm, and you gain it when you eat or sleep.
2-hand,count-role;other&character;rainbow_dash&sayingmarker;adventurer_what_do:,marker:RDAdventures1=happy.png,Well, I didn't go around finding relics, but I did go on a pretty crazy adventure to kill these demon weapons that were causing havoc.
2-hand,count-role;other&character;nami&stage;3:=competitive.png,Well, uh, don't worry about me trying to turn you in, Nami. At least, not unless you start to cause trouble.
2-hand,count-role;other&character;erufuda&stage;1:=interested.png,What is that you're eating, Erufuda? It sure does smell appetizing.
2-hand,count-role;other&character;meia&stage;5&saidmarker;aella_menkill:,id:256,marker:MeiaSeesPsycho=sad.png,You really just don't want to see me as anything other than an amoral psycho, huh?
2-hand,count-role;other&character;akko&stage;4&timeinstage;0:=interested.png,You'd be able to cast spells that you couldn't before, but you'd lose what makes you <i>you</i> too, so you can see why it's bad.
2-hand,count-role;other&character;meia&stage;5&saidmarker;aella_menkill2:,id:270,marker:MeiaNotListening=annoyed.png,You're not listening to me, Meia! My point is that it's fun to fight, but only when it's with something you can't reason with! <i>Killing</i> isn't fun!
2-hand,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;4&timeinstage;1:,marker:HadEnough=angry.png,Y-you'd better watch yourself! I-I'm not afraid to fight you!
2-hand,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;4&timeinstage;1:,marker:HadEnough=angry.png,Y-you'd better watch yourself! I-I've fought bigger things than you!
2-hand,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;4&timeinstage;1:,marker:HadEnough=angry.png,Y-you want a fight? My THAC0 is low even <i>without</i> my axe, s-so you'd be no match for me!
2-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;RGWager&notsaidmarker;RGWagerNotSure:,count-role;other&character;ribbon_girl:,marker:RGWagerNotSure=flustered.png,Aha, well, I'm sure I could beat you, but... <i>anything?</i> I don't like the sound of that...
2-hand,oneShotId:16,count-role;self&saidmarker;AellaAdventures:,count-role;other&character;chara_dreemurr:,marker:CharaDemon=flustered.png,Are you a demon, Chara? I don't remember freeing you from a weapon prison...
2-hand,count-role;other&character;tharja&saidmarker;cheating1:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;TharjaCheating:,marker:TharjaCheating=annoyed.png,H-hey, wait a minute, did you just say you've been cheating? You'd better stop!
2-hand,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;DoneWithRevy:,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;5&timeinstage;2:=angry.png,I don't care how often you're rude to people! You shouldn't be rude because it makes people feel bad!
2-hand,count-role;other&character;jolyne:,count-role;self&saidmarker;AellaAdventures:,id:303,marker:JolyneAdventure=happy.png,I don't know about that, Jolyne, my adventure was pretty bizarre too! I'd like to hear about yours!
2-hand,oneShotId:13,count-role;self&saidmarker;MaryDucks:,count-role;other&character;mary&sayingmarker;AellaDucks:,id:295,marker:MaryDucks2=thinking.png,I don't know about that. I think my dress could only carry... maybe seven? Eight at best.
2-hand,count-role;other&character;erufuda&stage;3:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ErufudaPants1:,id:316,marker:ErufudaPants2=interested.png,I don't know where you've been getting your clothes from, but human craftsmanship is usually pretty good. Not the best, but good. My sister's dress is human-made and lasted for years.
2-hand,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;RevyCoolIt:,count-role;other&character;revy&sayingmarker;music:,marker:AellaMusic=happy.png,I like piano and violin music the best. Does anyone here know how to play either of those instruments?
2-hand,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;DoneWithRevy:,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;5&timeinstage;0:=angry.png,I said "Niccolo," not "Nicole!" Are you hard of hearing? Start being nicer and I'll tell you about a guy who can help!
2-hand,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;DoneWithRevy:,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;5&timeinstage;0:=angry.png,I said "Niccolo," not "Nicole!" You messed that up on purpose, didn't you?
2-hand,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;DoneWithRevy:,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;5&timeinstage;0:=angry.png,I said "Niccolo," not "Nicole!" Funny, you're as tall, uncharming, and <i>almost</i> as masculine as him.
2-hand,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;DoneWithRevy:,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;5&timeinstage;0:=angry.png,I said "Niccolo," not "Nicole!" And if you try to lay a single dirty hand on me, I... I'll break your arm!
2-hand,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;DoneWithRevy:,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;5&timeinstage;0:=angry.png,I said "Niccolo," not "Nicole!" If I didn't know he's an only child, I'd swear your his sister!
2-hand,oneShotId:17,count-role;other&character;chara_dreemurr:,count-role;self&saidmarker;CharaDemon:,marker:CharaDemon2=competitive.png,I'll give you a fair warning, Chara, I'm no stranger to demon-slaying, so don't try anything funny, okay?
2-hand,count-role;other&character;revy:,count-role;self&saidmarker;SorryMeia&notsaidmarker;NotAMurderer:,marker:NotAMurderer=annoyed.png,I'm not a <i>murderer</i>, no, but just because I don't <i>murder</i> doesn't mean I haven't <i>killed</i>, Revy.
2-hand,count-role;other&character;revy:,count-role;self&saidmarker;SorryMeia&notsaidmarker;NotAMurderer:,marker:NotAMurderer=annoyed.png,I'm not a <i>murderer</i>, Revy, but I've killed orcs, dragons, even <i>demons</i>, but I don't make a game of it.
2-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;Joey3&notsaidmarker;Joey4:,count-role;other&character;joey:,marker:Joey4=interested.png,Isn't it, uh... kind of dangerous to be naked in public?
2-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;JotaroStopTime:,count-role;other&character;jotaro&stage;2&timeinstage;0:=enthused.png,I've only ever met "time" mages who could cast speed-based spells. You must be a <i>true</i> time mage, Jotaro!
2-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;JotaroStopTime2&notsaidmarker;TimeStopAttempt:,count-role;other&character;jotaro:,marker:TimeStopAttempt=competitive.png,Let's see if I can stop time too. <i>Star platinum!</i>
2-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;AellaAdventures:,count-role;other&character;kizuna&sayingmarker;ai_ventures:=happy.png,Not really the kind of adventure I was asking about, but that's a good answer anyway, Kizuna!
2-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;AellaAdventures:,count-role;other&character;mulan&notsaidmarker;MulanAdventures&sayingmarker;MulanAdventures:=enthused.png,Oh, it definitely counts! I love tales of adventures involving rescuing royalty!
2-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;AellaHP2:,count-role;other&character;shantae&saidmarker;hearts:,id:304,marker:AellaHP3=happy.png,Right, Shantae, a lot of people associate hearts with HP, but there's actually no connect to the heart or blood. You'd lose HP if you broke a bone, even if there's no bleeding.

3-hand,count-role;other&character;erufuda&stage;3&timeinstage;0:,id:290,marker:ErufudaPants1=happy.png,Oh, and don't worry about the tear. I can fix that for you so you don't have to wear them home like that!
3-hand,count-role;other&character;futaba&sayingmarker;futaba_bookclub:=happy.png,Oh, I agree! The mind is very fascinating!
3-hand,count-role;other&character;meia&stage;1&timeinstage;0:=interested.png,Oh, I see... What's an "Oma?"
3-hand,oneShotId:7,count-role;self&saidmarker;AellaHP:,id:269,marker:AellaHP2=interested.png,Oh, uh, you guys know about HP, right? The life force of all living things? I just realized this world might operate on different rules than mine.
3-hand,count-role;other&character;spooky&stage;1&timeinstage;0:=annoyed.png,Oh, you think I can't hit a ghost? I have spells for that, you know, so don't try anything funny.
3-hand,count-role;other&character;ribbon_girl&stage;3&sayingmarker;AellaChargeArms:=calm.png,Okay. You'll have to introduce us later, then.
3-hand,count-role;other&character;futaba&sayingmarker;futaba_adventures:=enthused.png,Ooh, I've always wanted to go overseas! Uh, in my world, that is, but I'm sure overseas in this world is great too!
3-hand,count-role;other&character;joey&sayingmarker;CandyHat:=interested.png,Really?... What kind of candy?
3-hand,count-role;other&character;joey&sayingmarker;CandyHat:=interested.png,Really? Wouldn't that make your head sticky?
3-hand,count-role;other&character;joey&sayingmarker;CandyHat:=interested.png,Really? Well, I hope it doesn't melt on you.
3-hand,oneShotId:24,count-role;other&character;erufuda&saidmarker;aella_fries2:,id:313=flustered.png,Shoot, I just remembered I'm in a foreign region. Unless restaurants around here accept gold, I'm gonna need some new currency before I can get some fries...
3-hand,oneShotId:22,count-role;other&character;erufuda&saidmarker;aella_fries:,id:287=happy.png,So where can I get some of these "fries" for myself?
3-hand,oneShotId:9,count-role;self&saidmarker;AellaHP3:,marker:AellaHP4=interested.png,Some people theorize that HP is a kind of shield-like energy that protects your soul. Which I guess makes sense when you consider healing magic.
3-hand,count-role;other&character;saki_zls&stage;6&timeinstage;0:=interested.png,S-so what happened to your body? Th-the scars, I mean.
3-hand,oneShotId:4,count-role;other&character;lucina&stage;1:=flustered.png,S-sorry, I don't mean to undermine your status... Let me start over. Hi, Princess Lucina, I'm Aella. Nice to meet you.
3-hand,count-role;other&character;mavis&stage;3&timeinstage;0:=happy.png,Staying at home is no excuse for not working out. Just look at me! I spent my whole life inside, and I can suplex orcs!
3-hand,count-role;other&character;mavis&stage;3&timeinstage;0:=happy.png,Staying at home is no excuse for not working out. If anything, it's a reason to do it more! That's what <i>I</i> did, anyway!
3-hand,count-role;other&character;meia&stage;1&timeinstage;1:=calm.png,That's interesting, Meia! It's certainly not unheard of for women to love each other in my world, but I didn't think they could have children.
3-hand,oneShotId:25,count-role;other&character;erufuda&saidmarker;aella_book_club2:,id:314,marker:ErufudaBook2=interested.png,The book you're talking about must be in a foreign language, huh, Erufuda? I still only caught "elf" from the title.
3-hand,count-role;other&character;mavis&stage;5&timeinstage;0:=interested.png,To be honest, no, that isn't.
3-hand,oneShotId:20,count-role;other&character;shantae&stage;1:,id:311,marker:Shantae_Transformations=interested.png,Transformations, you say? Don't you know transformation magic is dangerous?... Or is it safer for you because you're a magical being?
3-hand,count-role;other&character;mary&sayingmarker;imnotlooking:,id:282,marker:MaryBlind=interested.png,Uh, okay. I guess you have a point, but telling us that makes about as much of a difference as actually doing it.
3-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;AellaHP2&notsaidmarker;AellaHP3:,id:268,marker:AellaHP3=calm.png,Uh, right, so HP is your life force in my world. You lose it when you experience bodily harm, and you gain it when you eat or sleep.
3-hand,count-role;other&character;rainbow_dash&sayingmarker;adventurer_what_do:,marker:RDAdventures1=happy.png,Well, I didn't go around finding relics, but I did go on a pretty crazy adventure to kill these demon weapons that were causing havoc.
3-hand,count-role;other&character;nami&stage;3:=competitive.png,Well, uh, don't worry about me trying to turn you in, Nami. At least, not unless you start to cause trouble.
3-hand,count-role;other&character;erufuda&stage;1:=interested.png,What is that you're eating, Erufuda? It sure does smell appetizing.
3-hand,count-role;other&character;meia&stage;5&saidmarker;aella_menkill:,id:256,marker:MeiaSeesPsycho=sad.png,You really just don't want to see me as anything other than an amoral psycho, huh?
3-hand,count-role;other&character;akko&stage;4&timeinstage;0:=interested.png,You'd be able to cast spells that you couldn't before, but you'd lose what makes you <i>you</i> too, so you can see why it's bad.
3-hand,count-role;other&character;meia&stage;5&saidmarker;aella_menkill2:,id:270,marker:MeiaNotListening=annoyed.png,You're not listening to me, Meia! My point is that it's fun to fight, but only when it's with something you can't reason with! <i>Killing</i> isn't fun!
3-hand,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;4&timeinstage;1:,marker:HadEnough=angry.png,Y-you'd better watch yourself! I-I'm not afraid to fight you!
3-hand,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;4&timeinstage;1:,marker:HadEnough=angry.png,Y-you'd better watch yourself! I-I've fought bigger things than you!
3-hand,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;4&timeinstage;1:,marker:HadEnough=angry.png,Y-you want a fight? My THAC0 is low even <i>without</i> my axe, s-so you'd be no match for me!
3-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;RGWager&notsaidmarker;RGWagerNotSure:,count-role;other&character;ribbon_girl:,marker:RGWagerNotSure=flustered.png,Aha, well, I'm sure I could beat you, but... <i>anything?</i> I don't like the sound of that...
3-hand,oneShotId:16,count-role;self&saidmarker;AellaAdventures:,count-role;other&character;chara_dreemurr:,marker:CharaDemon=flustered.png,Are you a demon, Chara? I don't remember freeing you from a weapon prison...
3-hand,count-role;other&character;tharja&saidmarker;cheating1:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;TharjaCheating:,marker:TharjaCheating=annoyed.png,H-hey, wait a minute, did you just say you've been cheating? You'd better stop!
3-hand,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;DoneWithRevy:,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;5&timeinstage;2:=angry.png,I don't care how often you're rude to people! You shouldn't be rude because it makes people feel bad!
3-hand,count-role;other&character;jolyne:,count-role;self&saidmarker;AellaAdventures:,id:303,marker:JolyneAdventure=happy.png,I don't know about that, Jolyne, my adventure was pretty bizarre too! I'd like to hear about yours!
3-hand,oneShotId:13,count-role;self&saidmarker;MaryDucks:,count-role;other&character;mary&sayingmarker;AellaDucks:,id:295,marker:MaryDucks2=thinking.png,I don't know about that. I think my dress could only carry... maybe seven? Eight at best.
3-hand,count-role;other&character;erufuda&stage;3:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ErufudaPants1:,id:316,marker:ErufudaPants2=interested.png,I don't know where you've been getting your clothes from, but human craftsmanship is usually pretty good. Not the best, but good. My sister's dress is human-made and lasted for years.
3-hand,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;RevyCoolIt:,count-role;other&character;revy&sayingmarker;music:,marker:AellaMusic=happy.png,I like piano and violin music the best. Does anyone here know how to play either of those instruments?
3-hand,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;DoneWithRevy:,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;5&timeinstage;0:=angry.png,I said "Niccolo," not "Nicole!" Are you hard of hearing? Start being nicer and I'll tell you about a guy who can help!
3-hand,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;DoneWithRevy:,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;5&timeinstage;0:=angry.png,I said "Niccolo," not "Nicole!" You messed that up on purpose, didn't you?
3-hand,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;DoneWithRevy:,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;5&timeinstage;0:=angry.png,I said "Niccolo," not "Nicole!" Funny, you're as tall, uncharming, and <i>almost</i> as masculine as him.
3-hand,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;DoneWithRevy:,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;5&timeinstage;0:=angry.png,I said "Niccolo," not "Nicole!" And if you try to lay a single dirty hand on me, I... I'll break your arm!
3-hand,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;DoneWithRevy:,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;5&timeinstage;0:=angry.png,I said "Niccolo," not "Nicole!" If I didn't know he's an only child, I'd swear your his sister!
3-hand,oneShotId:17,count-role;other&character;chara_dreemurr:,count-role;self&saidmarker;CharaDemon:,marker:CharaDemon2=competitive.png,I'll give you a fair warning, Chara, I'm no stranger to demon-slaying, so don't try anything funny, okay?
3-hand,count-role;other&character;revy:,count-role;self&saidmarker;SorryMeia&notsaidmarker;NotAMurderer:,marker:NotAMurderer=annoyed.png,I'm not a <i>murderer</i>, no, but just because I don't <i>murder</i> doesn't mean I haven't <i>killed</i>, Revy.
3-hand,count-role;other&character;revy:,count-role;self&saidmarker;SorryMeia&notsaidmarker;NotAMurderer:,marker:NotAMurderer=annoyed.png,I'm not a <i>murderer</i>, Revy, but I've killed orcs, dragons, even <i>demons</i>, but I don't make a game of it.
3-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;Joey3&notsaidmarker;Joey4:,count-role;other&character;joey:,marker:Joey4=interested.png,Isn't it, uh... kind of dangerous to be naked in public?
3-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;JotaroStopTime:,count-role;other&character;jotaro&stage;2&timeinstage;0:=enthused.png,I've only ever met "time" mages who could cast speed-based spells. You must be a <i>true</i> time mage, Jotaro!
3-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;JotaroStopTime2&notsaidmarker;TimeStopAttempt:,count-role;other&character;jotaro:,marker:TimeStopAttempt=competitive.png,Let's see if I can stop time too. <i>Star platinum!</i>
3-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;AellaAdventures:,count-role;other&character;kizuna&sayingmarker;ai_ventures:=happy.png,Not really the kind of adventure I was asking about, but that's a good answer anyway, Kizuna!
3-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;AellaAdventures:,count-role;other&character;mulan&notsaidmarker;MulanAdventures&sayingmarker;MulanAdventures:=enthused.png,Oh, it definitely counts! I love tales of adventures involving rescuing royalty!
3-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;AellaHP2:,count-role;other&character;shantae&saidmarker;hearts:,id:304,marker:AellaHP3=happy.png,Right, Shantae, a lot of people associate hearts with HP, but there's actually no connect to the heart or blood. You'd lose HP if you broke a bone, even if there's no bleeding.
3-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;Joey1&notsaidmarker;Joey2:,count-role;other&character;joey:,marker:Joey2=interested.png,So wait, Joey, you get paid to s-strip?
3-hand,oneShotId:5,count-role;other&character;yuelia:,count-role;self:=interested.png,Tailor life? No, I'm not a tailor. I work on my own clothes and no one else's. At least, not regularly.
3-hand,count-role;other&character;croix&saidmarker;AellaFrench:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;Languages1:,marker:Languages1=embarrassed.png,Uh, y-yeah, I speak French. Khadoric and Dragonic, too. Dreh hi mindok niin?
3-hand,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;RGWager:,count-role;other&character;ribbon_girl&saidmarker;WagerStart:,marker:RGWager=interested.png,Um, does that wager apply to everyone, or just ~player~, Ribbon Girl?
3-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;Joey5&notsaidmarker;Joey6:,count-role;other&character;joey:,marker:Joey6=interested.png,Um, why have a "no touching" rule? No offense, but you already go pretty far, why stop there?
3-hand,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;DoneWithRevy:,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;5&timeinstage;1:=angry.png,Well, I'm sorry about your bad hearing, Revy, but you can't just mishear a name and start assuming you know my life! It's very rude!
3-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;Joey4&notsaidmarker;Joey5:,count-role;other&character;joey:,marker:Joey5=interested.png,What are some of the stipulations you have, Joey?
3-hand,count-role;other&character;beatrix:,count-role;self:=interested.png,What do you think could be the cause, Beatrix?
3-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;AellaAdventures&notsaidmarker;Jessie1:,count-role;other&character;jessie&saidmarker;jessieAdventure:,marker:Jessie1=interested.png,What kind of adventure do you mean, Jessie?
3-hand,oneShotId:23,count-role;other&character;erufuda:,count-role;self&saidmarker;AellaBookClub:,id:288,marker:ErufudaBook1=flustered.png,What was that book you mentioned again, Erufuda? The only part of it I caught was "Elf."
3-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;Joey2&notsaidmarker;Joey3:,count-role;other&character;joey:,marker:Joey3=interested.png,What's it like? Getting paid to take your clothes off?
3-hand,count-role;other&character;meia:,count-role;self&saidmarker;SorryMeia&notsaidmarker;SorryMeia2:,marker:SorryMeia2=flustered.png,W-well, I just meant that there isn't really a way to know if I'm really stronger than you without putting it to the test, you know...?
3-hand,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;DoneWithRevy:,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;4&timeinstage;2:=angry.png,W-what? No! Why would I ever... do <i>that</i> with <i>you</i>? I like nice men, not rude women!
3-hand,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;DoneWithRevy:,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;4&timeinstage;2:,marker:RevyNotPretty=angry.png,W-what? No! Why would I ever... do <i>that</i> with <i>you</i>? You're not even that pretty!
3-hand,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;DoneWithRevy:,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;4&timeinstage;2:,marker:RevyProbablyHasAnSTD=angry.png,W-what? Why would I ever let <i>you</i> touch <i>me</i>? I'd probably catch a disease!

3-hand,oneShotId:15,count-role;other&character;jolyne&saidmarker;Stand:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;JolyneStand:,id:301,marker:JolyneStand=interested.png,You mentioned something about a "Stand," Jolyne? I can't see it. Is that bad?

4-swap_cards,count-role;self&hashand;High Card:=sad.png,Aw. Might as well give me a whole new hand...
4-swap_cards,count-role;self&hashand;Two Pair:=happy.png,Just one card, please!
4-swap_cards,count-role;self&hashand;Two Pair:=happy.png,I only need one, thanks!
4-swap_cards,count-role;self&hashand;Two Pair:=happy.png,Let's see if I can make this any better. One, please!
4-swap_cards,count-role;self&hashand;Four of a Kind:,id:82=happy.png,No cards necessary.
4-swap_cards,count-role;self&hashand;Royal Flush:=happy.png,No cards, thanks! This hand is perfect!
4-swap_cards,count-role;self&hashand;Royal Flush:=enthused.png,Oh boy, this hand is awesome!
4-swap_cards,count-role;self&hashand;Royal Flush:=enthused.png,Alright! No cards for me!
4-swap_cards,count-role;self&hashand;Royal Flush:=happy.png,Ha, like you can improve upon perfection!... Er, no cards, I mean.
4-swap_cards,count-role;self&hashand;Full House:=happy.png,Oh, I guess I don't need any cards!

4-swap_cards,priority:1,test:~cards~:1=happy.png,Just one, please!
4-swap_cards,priority:1,test:~cards~:1=calm.png,One should suffice.
4-swap_cards,priority:1,test:~cards~:1=calm.png,One should be enough.
4-swap_cards,priority:1,test:~cards~:1=happy.png,Just one card, please!
4-swap_cards,priority:1,test:~cards~:1=happy.png,I only need one, thanks!
4-good_hand=happy.png,I should be safe for now.
4-good_hand=happy.png,Good. These cards are hard to beat.
4-good_hand=happy.png,What a relief, a hard hand to beat.
4-good_hand=enthused.png,Ah, I think things are starting to look up.
4-good_hand,count-role;self&hashand;Royal Flush&saidmarker;1v1:=enthused.png,Aha! A royal flush! No way you're beating me this round!
4-good_hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;1v1:=happy.png,Sorry, but I'm pretty sure you lost this round.
4-good_hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;1v1:=happy.png,Looks like I'm safe this round, unless you happen to have something better.
4-good_hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;1v1:=happy.png,Oh, thank goodness. I'm safe. Unless my luck decides otherwise...
4-good_hand,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:85=happy.png,If you think you're getting me out of my underwear this round, think again.
4-good_hand,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:85=competitive.png,It's gonna take more than <i>that</i> to see my sensitive bits!... Unless you're a doctor performing a routine check-up...
4-good_hand,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:85=happy.png,Hope you don't plan on seeing more of me, because I sure don't.
4-okay_hand=flustered.png,Not bad, but I still don't like the look of these cards...
4-okay_hand=flustered.png,I don't trust this hand...
4-okay_hand=flustered.png,Well, the cards aren't bad, but it's not a sure thing...
4-okay_hand=sad.png,This hand doesn't inspire much confidence...
4-okay_hand=calm.png,I should be fine. A pair isn't total junk...
4-okay_hand=calm.png,At least it's not high card...
4-okay_hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;1v1:=sad.png,I really don't like the look of this hand right now...
4-okay_hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;1v1:=calm.png,This is <i>not</i> a good hand to have in this situation...
4-okay_hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;1v1:=sad.png,I could very well have lost this round with a hand like this...
4-okay_hand,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:109=calm.png,A pair should be fine enough.
4-bad_hand=sad.png,This can't end well...
4-bad_hand=sad.png,I fear for my modesty...
4-bad_hand=flustered.png,I was hoping I would've won before we reached this point...
4-bad_hand=facepalm.png,I knew I shouldn't have traded that card...
4-bad_hand=sad.png,I'm... I'm certain I've lost this round...
4-bad_hand=flustered.png,I... should really work on improving my luck stat...
4-bad_hand=flustered.png,I guess someone could have a lower high card than mine...
4-bad_hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;1v1:=sad.png,Aw, there's no way what you have is worse than this...
4-bad_hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;1v1:=sad.png,You've won this round for sure...
4-bad_hand,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:89=annoyed.png,If my scars weren't proof enough, it'll take more than losing this hand to frazzle me.
4-bad_hand,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:89=annoyed.png,If I lose this hand, so be it. I didn't come to this game just to back out.
4-bad_hand,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:89=facepalm.png,Oh, for the love of...
4-hand,count-role;other&character;mulan&sayingmarker;honorable_others:=flustered.png,A match? Like a romantic partner...? I never really thought about it...
4-hand,count-role;other&character;rinkah&stage;4&timeinstage;0:=interested.png,A-anyway, um... That u-underwear looks rather uncomfortable, a-and maybe a bit impractical. Am I right at all?
4-hand,count-role;other&character;kyu&stage;1&timeinstage;0:=thinking.png,But then begs the question: what do you have to gain from lying to us like that...?
4-hand,count-role;other&character;mary&stage;3&sayingmarker;dakku:,id:285,marker:MaryDucks=interested.png,Ducks...? Yeah, I guess you could carry ducks in it. You mean fully grown ones, right? Four sounds about right.
4-hand,oneShotId:19,count-role;other&character;shantae&saidmarker;hearts2:,id:310,marker:Shantae_Hearts=thinking.png,Half a heart, huh, Shantae? Bumping your toe couldn't have been more than 3 HP, so you must have a lot of hearts! Unless you bumped it particularly hard...
4-hand,count-role;other&character;palutena&saying;I have hearts:,marker:PaluHearts1=shocked.png,H-hearts? L-like the symbol, o-or m-maybe cow hearts? N-not <i>human</i> hearts, right?
4-hand,count-role;other&character;mulan&stage;8&saidmarker;duel_lost&notsaidmarker;challenge_answer&sayingmarker;challenge_answer:,marker:Mulan_Question=interested.png,I guess I get to ask you a question now?... Uh... What's your culture like?
4-hand,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;4&timeinstage;0:,marker:RevyCoolIt=annoyed.png,I must say, Revy, I don't appreciate your overly aggressive attitude. You need to cool down!
4-hand,count-role;other&character;mary&sayingmarker;weird_fetish:,id:286=flustered.png,I-I'm not sure. I don't even know if I have... any of those...
4-hand,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;4&timeinstage;2:=angry.png,I'm not scared, I'm just bad at tough talk! I assure you that my arms and legs are better at being tough than my voice is!
4-hand,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;4&timeinstage;2:=angry.png,I'm not scared, I just don't like being so mean! I'm not afraid of putting up a fight, though!
4-hand,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;4&timeinstage;2:=angry.png,I'm not scared, I'm just bad at intimidation checks because of my low charisma stat! I've got more than enough strength to make up for it, though!
4-hand,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;4&timeinstage;2:=angry.png,I'm not scared, I just stutter sometimes! It's never stopped me from taking down dragons, I'll have you know!
4-hand,oneShotId:18,count-role;other&character;orendi&saidmarker;Aella_Quest:,marker:Orendi_Quest=flustered.png,I'm still processing that quest you told me about, Orendi. How do you destroy stuff with math...?
4-hand,count-role;other&character;nayru&stage;5&timeinstage;0&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=flustered.png,I'm, uh... I'm sorry about your dress, Nayru. I can fix it up for you, if you like.
4-hand,count-role;other&character;ini&stage;5&timeinstage;0:=facepalm.png,I've <i>been</i> using my brain, I just wanted to believe that you were who you were saying you were.
4-hand,count-role;other&character;marinette&stage;1&timeinstage;0:=calm.png,I've never seen any Ladybug Mages before. Did you invent the school?
4-hand,count-role;other&character;marinette&sayingmarker;aella_bookclub:=enthused.png,I've read quite a few of them, yeah! I should show you my collection of them. We could compare our worlds' fashion trends!
4-hand,oneShotId:21,count-role;other&character;shantae&saidmarker;adventures:,id:307=happy.png,My adventure involved a lot of that too, Shantae! Except for the transformations part.
4-hand,count-role;other&character;meia&stage;5&saidmarker;aella_slaughter:,id:107,marker:MeiaSafeKill=flustered.png,N-no, Meia, I don't mean things that are beneth me, I mean things that <i>endanger</i> me. Things that you <i>need</i> to kill to be safe.
4-hand,count-role;other&character;meia&stage;5&saidmarker;aella_slaughter:,id:107,marker:MeiaSafeKill=flustered.png,You make it sound like I enjoy killing bunnies and squirrels, Meia... I meant <i>dangerous</i> things. Things that you need to kill to be safe.
4-hand,count-role;other&character;marinette&sayingmarker;aella_adventures:=happy.png,No no, that's okay, the demon weapon problem has already been taken care of!
4-hand,count-role;other&character;ini&stage;6&timeinstage;0:=facepalm.png,Of course it is... Well, you're right, there's nothing I can do with that information, but thank you for your honesty.
4-hand,count-role;other&character;amalia&stage;5&timeinstage;0:=sad.png,Oh! You can summon flowers? I wish I could do the same...
4-hand,count-role;other&character;amalia&stage;5&timeinstage;0:=sad.png,Oh! Flowers... I wish I had some too...
4-hand,count-role;other&character;amalia&stage;5&timeinstage;0:=calm.png,Can you summon some flowers for me too, please...?
4-hand,count-role;other&character;erufuda&stage;3&timeinstage;0:,id:290,marker:ErufudaPants1=happy.png,Oh, and don't worry about the tear. I can fix that for you so you don't have to wear them home like that!
4-hand,count-role;other&character;futaba&sayingmarker;futaba_bookclub:=happy.png,Oh, I agree! The mind is very fascinating!
4-hand,count-role;other&character;meia&stage;1&timeinstage;0:=interested.png,Oh, I see... What's an "Oma?"
4-hand,oneShotId:7,count-role;self&saidmarker;AellaHP:,id:269,marker:AellaHP2=interested.png,Oh, uh, you guys know about HP, right? The life force of all living things? I just realized this world might operate on different rules than mine.
4-hand,count-role;other&character;ribbon_girl&stage;3&sayingmarker;AellaChargeArms:=calm.png,Okay. You'll have to introduce us later, then.
4-hand,count-role;other&character;futaba&sayingmarker;futaba_adventures:=enthused.png,Ooh, I've always wanted to go overseas! Uh, in my world, that is, but I'm sure overseas in this world is great too!
4-hand,count-role;other&character;joey&sayingmarker;CandyHat:=interested.png,Really?... What kind of candy?
4-hand,count-role;other&character;joey&sayingmarker;CandyHat:=interested.png,Really? Wouldn't that make your head sticky?
4-hand,count-role;other&character;joey&sayingmarker;CandyHat:=interested.png,Really? Well, I hope it doesn't melt on you.
4-hand,oneShotId:24,count-role;other&character;erufuda&saidmarker;aella_fries2:,id:313=flustered.png,Shoot, I just remembered I'm in a foreign region. Unless restaurants around here accept gold, I'm gonna need some new currency before I can get some fries...
4-hand,oneShotId:22,count-role;other&character;erufuda&saidmarker;aella_fries:,id:287=happy.png,So where can I get some of these "fries" for myself?
4-hand,count-role;self&timeinstage;0:,id:3,marker:AellaBookClub=calm.png,So, uh... anyone read any good books lately?
4-hand,count-role;self&timeinstage;0:,id:3,marker:AellaBookClub=calm.png,Uh... A-anyone read anything interesting lately?
4-hand,oneShotId:9,count-role;self&saidmarker;AellaHP3:,marker:AellaHP4=interested.png,Some people theorize that HP is a kind of shield-like energy that protects your soul. Which I guess makes sense when you consider healing magic.
4-hand,count-role;other&character;saki_zls&stage;6&timeinstage;0:=interested.png,S-so what happened to your body? Th-the scars, I mean.
4-hand,oneShotId:4,count-role;other&character;lucina&stage;1:=flustered.png,S-sorry, I don't mean to undermine your status... Let me start over. Hi, Princess Lucina, I'm Aella. Nice to meet you.
4-hand,count-role;other&character;mavis&stage;3&timeinstage;0:=happy.png,Staying at home is no excuse for not working out. Just look at me! I spent my whole life inside, and I can suplex orcs!
4-hand,count-role;other&character;mavis&stage;3&timeinstage;0:=happy.png,Staying at home is no excuse for not working out. If anything, it's a reason to do it more! That's what <i>I</i> did, anyway!
4-hand,count-role;other&character;meia&stage;1&timeinstage;1:=calm.png,That's interesting, Meia! It's certainly not unheard of for women to love each other in my world, but I didn't think they could have children.
4-hand,oneShotId:25,count-role;other&character;erufuda&saidmarker;aella_book_club2:,id:314,marker:ErufudaBook2=interested.png,The book you're talking about must be in a foreign language, huh, Erufuda? I still only caught "elf" from the title.
4-hand,count-role;other&character;mavis&stage;5&timeinstage;0:=interested.png,To be honest, no, that isn't.
4-hand,oneShotId:20,count-role;other&character;shantae&stage;1:,id:311,marker:Shantae_Transformations=interested.png,Transformations, you say? Don't you know transformation magic is dangerous?... Or is it safer for you because you're a magical being?
4-hand,count-role;other&character;mary&sayingmarker;imnotlooking:,id:282,marker:MaryBlind=interested.png,Uh, okay. I guess you have a point, but telling us that makes about as much of a difference as actually doing it.
4-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;AellaHP2&notsaidmarker;AellaHP3:,id:268,marker:AellaHP3=calm.png,Uh, right, so HP is your life force in my world. You lose it when you experience bodily harm, and you gain it when you eat or sleep.
4-hand,count-role;other&character;sayaka&timeinstage;0&sayingmarker;aellabookclub:=interested.png,Um, what's manga? I mean, a form of writing, clearly, but what's it like?
4-hand,count-role;other&character;rainbow_dash&sayingmarker;adventurer_what_do:,marker:RDAdventures1=happy.png,Well, I didn't go around finding relics, but I did go on a pretty crazy adventure to kill these demon weapons that were causing havoc.
4-hand,count-role;other&character;nami&stage;3:=competitive.png,Well, uh, don't worry about me trying to turn you in, Nami. At least, not unless you start to cause trouble.
4-hand,count-role;other&character;erufuda&stage;1:=interested.png,What is that you're eating, Erufuda? It sure does smell appetizing.
4-hand,count-role;other&character;meia&stage;5&saidmarker;aella_menkill:,id:256,marker:MeiaSeesPsycho=sad.png,You really just don't want to see me as anything other than an amoral psycho, huh?
4-hand,count-role;other&character;akko&stage;4&timeinstage;0:=interested.png,You'd be able to cast spells that you couldn't before, but you'd lose what makes you <i>you</i> too, so you can see why it's bad.
4-hand,count-role;other&character;meia&stage;5&saidmarker;aella_menkill2:,id:270,marker:MeiaNotListening=annoyed.png,You're not listening to me, Meia! My point is that it's fun to fight, but only when it's with something you can't reason with! <i>Killing</i> isn't fun!
4-hand,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;4&timeinstage;1:,marker:HadEnough=angry.png,Y-you'd better watch yourself! I-I'm not afraid to fight you!
4-hand,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;4&timeinstage;1:,marker:HadEnough=angry.png,Y-you'd better watch yourself! I-I've fought bigger things than you!
4-hand,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;4&timeinstage;1:,marker:HadEnough=angry.png,Y-you want a fight? My THAC0 is low even <i>without</i> my axe, s-so you'd be no match for me!
4-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;RGWager&notsaidmarker;RGWagerNotSure:,count-role;other&character;ribbon_girl:,marker:RGWagerNotSure=flustered.png,Aha, well, I'm sure I could beat you, but... <i>anything?</i> I don't like the sound of that...
4-hand,oneShotId:16,count-role;self&saidmarker;AellaAdventures:,count-role;other&character;chara_dreemurr:,marker:CharaDemon=flustered.png,Are you a demon, Chara? I don't remember freeing you from a weapon prison...
4-hand,count-role;other&character;tharja&saidmarker;cheating1:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;TharjaCheating:,marker:TharjaCheating=annoyed.png,H-hey, wait a minute, did you just say you've been cheating? You'd better stop!
4-hand,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;DoneWithRevy:,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;5&timeinstage;2:=angry.png,I don't care how often you're rude to people! You shouldn't be rude because it makes people feel bad!
4-hand,count-role;other&character;jolyne:,count-role;self&saidmarker;AellaAdventures:,id:303,marker:JolyneAdventure=happy.png,I don't know about that, Jolyne, my adventure was pretty bizarre too! I'd like to hear about yours!
4-hand,oneShotId:13,count-role;self&saidmarker;MaryDucks:,count-role;other&character;mary&sayingmarker;AellaDucks:,id:295,marker:MaryDucks2=thinking.png,I don't know about that. I think my dress could only carry... maybe seven? Eight at best.
4-hand,count-role;other&character;erufuda&stage;3:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ErufudaPants1:,id:316,marker:ErufudaPants2=interested.png,I don't know where you've been getting your clothes from, but human craftsmanship is usually pretty good. Not the best, but good. My sister's dress is human-made and lasted for years.
4-hand,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;RevyCoolIt:,count-role;other&character;revy&sayingmarker;music:,marker:AellaMusic=happy.png,I like piano and violin music the best. Does anyone here know how to play either of those instruments?
4-hand,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;DoneWithRevy:,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;5&timeinstage;0:=angry.png,I said "Niccolo," not "Nicole!" Are you hard of hearing? Start being nicer and I'll tell you about a guy who can help!
4-hand,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;DoneWithRevy:,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;5&timeinstage;0:=angry.png,I said "Niccolo," not "Nicole!" You messed that up on purpose, didn't you?
4-hand,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;DoneWithRevy:,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;5&timeinstage;0:=angry.png,I said "Niccolo," not "Nicole!" Funny, you're as tall, uncharming, and <i>almost</i> as masculine as him.
4-hand,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;DoneWithRevy:,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;5&timeinstage;0:=angry.png,I said "Niccolo," not "Nicole!" And if you try to lay a single dirty hand on me, I... I'll break your arm!
4-hand,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;DoneWithRevy:,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;5&timeinstage;0:=angry.png,I said "Niccolo," not "Nicole!" If I didn't know he's an only child, I'd swear your his sister!
4-hand,oneShotId:17,count-role;other&character;chara_dreemurr:,count-role;self&saidmarker;CharaDemon:,marker:CharaDemon2=competitive.png,I'll give you a fair warning, Chara, I'm no stranger to demon-slaying, so don't try anything funny, okay?
4-hand,count-role;other&character;revy:,count-role;self&saidmarker;SorryMeia&notsaidmarker;NotAMurderer:,marker:NotAMurderer=annoyed.png,I'm not a <i>murderer</i>, no, but just because I don't <i>murder</i> doesn't mean I haven't <i>killed</i>, Revy.
4-hand,count-role;other&character;revy:,count-role;self&saidmarker;SorryMeia&notsaidmarker;NotAMurderer:,marker:NotAMurderer=annoyed.png,I'm not a <i>murderer</i>, Revy, but I've killed orcs, dragons, even <i>demons</i>, but I don't make a game of it.
4-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;Joey3&notsaidmarker;Joey4:,count-role;other&character;joey:,marker:Joey4=interested.png,Isn't it, uh... kind of dangerous to be naked in public?
4-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;JotaroStopTime:,count-role;other&character;jotaro&stage;2&timeinstage;0:=enthused.png,I've only ever met "time" mages who could cast speed-based spells. You must be a <i>true</i> time mage, Jotaro!
4-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;JotaroStopTime2&notsaidmarker;TimeStopAttempt:,count-role;other&character;jotaro:,marker:TimeStopAttempt=competitive.png,Let's see if I can stop time too. <i>Star platinum!</i>
4-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;AellaAdventures:,count-role;other&character;kizuna&sayingmarker;ai_ventures:=happy.png,Not really the kind of adventure I was asking about, but that's a good answer anyway, Kizuna!
4-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;AellaAdventures:,count-role;other&character;mulan&notsaidmarker;MulanAdventures&sayingmarker;MulanAdventures:=enthused.png,Oh, it definitely counts! I love tales of adventures involving rescuing royalty!
4-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;AellaHP2:,count-role;other&character;shantae&saidmarker;hearts:,id:304,marker:AellaHP3=happy.png,Right, Shantae, a lot of people associate hearts with HP, but there's actually no connect to the heart or blood. You'd lose HP if you broke a bone, even if there's no bleeding.
4-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;Joey1&notsaidmarker;Joey2:,count-role;other&character;joey:,marker:Joey2=interested.png,So wait, Joey, you get paid to s-strip?

5-hand,count-role;other&character;meia&stage;1&timeinstage;0:=interested.png,Oh, I see... What's an "Oma?"
5-hand,oneShotId:7,count-role;self&saidmarker;AellaHP:,id:269,marker:AellaHP2=interested.png,Oh, uh, you guys know about HP, right? The life force of all living things? I just realized this world might operate on different rules than mine.
5-hand,count-role;other&character;ribbon_girl&stage;3&sayingmarker;AellaChargeArms:=calm.png,Okay. You'll have to introduce us later, then.
5-hand,count-role;other&character;futaba&sayingmarker;futaba_adventures:=enthused.png,Ooh, I've always wanted to go overseas! Uh, in my world, that is, but I'm sure overseas in this world is great too!
5-hand,count-role;other&character;joey&sayingmarker;CandyHat:=interested.png,Really?... What kind of candy?
5-hand,count-role;other&character;joey&sayingmarker;CandyHat:=interested.png,Really? Wouldn't that make your head sticky?
5-hand,count-role;other&character;joey&sayingmarker;CandyHat:=interested.png,Really? Well, I hope it doesn't melt on you.
5-hand,oneShotId:24,count-role;other&character;erufuda&saidmarker;aella_fries2:,id:313=flustered.png,Shoot, I just remembered I'm in a foreign region. Unless restaurants around here accept gold, I'm gonna need some new currency before I can get some fries...
5-hand,oneShotId:22,count-role;other&character;erufuda&saidmarker;aella_fries:,id:287=happy.png,So where can I get some of these "fries" for myself?
5-hand,oneShotId:9,count-role;self&saidmarker;AellaHP3:,marker:AellaHP4=interested.png,Some people theorize that HP is a kind of shield-like energy that protects your soul. Which I guess makes sense when you consider healing magic.
5-hand,count-role;other&character;saki_zls&stage;6&timeinstage;0:=interested.png,S-so what happened to your body? Th-the scars, I mean.
5-hand,oneShotId:4,count-role;other&character;lucina&stage;1:=flustered.png,S-sorry, I don't mean to undermine your status... Let me start over. Hi, Princess Lucina, I'm Aella. Nice to meet you.
5-hand,count-role;other&character;mavis&stage;3&timeinstage;0:=happy.png,Staying at home is no excuse for not working out. Just look at me! I spent my whole life inside, and I can suplex orcs!
5-hand,count-role;other&character;mavis&stage;3&timeinstage;0:=happy.png,Staying at home is no excuse for not working out. If anything, it's a reason to do it more! That's what <i>I</i> did, anyway!
5-hand,count-role;other&character;meia&stage;1&timeinstage;1:=calm.png,That's interesting, Meia! It's certainly not unheard of for women to love each other in my world, but I didn't think they could have children.
5-hand,oneShotId:25,count-role;other&character;erufuda&saidmarker;aella_book_club2:,id:314,marker:ErufudaBook2=interested.png,The book you're talking about must be in a foreign language, huh, Erufuda? I still only caught "elf" from the title.
5-hand,count-role;other&character;mavis&stage;5&timeinstage;0:=interested.png,To be honest, no, that isn't.
5-hand,oneShotId:20,count-role;other&character;shantae&stage;1:,id:311,marker:Shantae_Transformations=interested.png,Transformations, you say? Don't you know transformation magic is dangerous?... Or is it safer for you because you're a magical being?
5-hand,count-role;other&character;mary&sayingmarker;imnotlooking:,id:282,marker:MaryBlind=interested.png,Uh, okay. I guess you have a point, but telling us that makes about as much of a difference as actually doing it.
5-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;AellaHP2&notsaidmarker;AellaHP3:,id:268,marker:AellaHP3=calm.png,Uh, right, so HP is your life force in my world. You lose it when you experience bodily harm, and you gain it when you eat or sleep.
5-hand,count-role;other&character;rainbow_dash&sayingmarker;adventurer_what_do:,marker:RDAdventures1=happy.png,Well, I didn't go around finding relics, but I did go on a pretty crazy adventure to kill these demon weapons that were causing havoc.
5-hand,count-role;other&character;nami&stage;3:=competitive.png,Well, uh, don't worry about me trying to turn you in, Nami. At least, not unless you start to cause trouble.
5-hand,count-role;other&character;erufuda&stage;1:=interested.png,What is that you're eating, Erufuda? It sure does smell appetizing.
5-hand,count-role;other&character;meia&stage;5&saidmarker;aella_menkill:,id:256,marker:MeiaSeesPsycho=sad.png,You really just don't want to see me as anything other than an amoral psycho, huh?
5-hand,count-role;other&character;akko&stage;4&timeinstage;0:=interested.png,You'd be able to cast spells that you couldn't before, but you'd lose what makes you <i>you</i> too, so you can see why it's bad.
5-hand,count-role;other&character;meia&stage;5&saidmarker;aella_menkill2:,id:270,marker:MeiaNotListening=annoyed.png,You're not listening to me, Meia! My point is that it's fun to fight, but only when it's with something you can't reason with! <i>Killing</i> isn't fun!
5-hand,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;4&timeinstage;1:,marker:HadEnough=angry.png,Y-you want to fight? I-I fight you t-topless if I have to!
5-hand,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;4&timeinstage;1:,marker:HadEnough=angry.png,Y-you want to fight? I-I put myself on display for long enough to knock you out, i-if that's what it takes to shut you up!
5-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;RGWager&notsaidmarker;RGWagerNotSure:,count-role;other&character;ribbon_girl:,marker:RGWagerNotSure=flustered.png,Aha, well, I'm sure I could beat you, but... <i>anything?</i> I don't like the sound of that...
5-hand,oneShotId:16,count-role;self&saidmarker;AellaAdventures:,count-role;other&character;chara_dreemurr:,marker:CharaDemon=flustered.png,Are you a demon, Chara? I don't remember freeing you from a weapon prison...
5-hand,count-role;other&character;tharja&saidmarker;cheating1:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;TharjaCheating:,marker:TharjaCheating=annoyed.png,H-hey, wait a minute, did you just say you've been cheating? You'd better stop!
5-hand,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;DoneWithRevy:,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;5&timeinstage;2:=angry.png,I don't care how often you're rude to people! You shouldn't be rude because it makes people feel bad!
5-hand,count-role;other&character;jolyne:,count-role;self&saidmarker;AellaAdventures:,id:303,marker:JolyneAdventure=happy.png,I don't know about that, Jolyne, my adventure was pretty bizarre too! I'd like to hear about yours!
5-hand,oneShotId:13,count-role;self&saidmarker;MaryDucks:,count-role;other&character;mary&sayingmarker;AellaDucks:,id:295,marker:MaryDucks2=thinking.png,I don't know about that. I think my dress could only carry... maybe seven? Eight at best.
5-hand,count-role;other&character;erufuda&stage;3:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ErufudaPants1:,id:316,marker:ErufudaPants2=interested.png,I don't know where you've been getting your clothes from, but human craftsmanship is usually pretty good. Not the best, but good. My sister's dress is human-made and lasted for years.
5-hand,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;RevyCoolIt:,count-role;other&character;revy&sayingmarker;music:,marker:AellaMusic=happy.png,I like piano and violin music the best. Does anyone here know how to play either of those instruments?
5-hand,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;DoneWithRevy:,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;5&timeinstage;0:=angry.png,I said "Niccolo," not "Nicole!" Are you hard of hearing? Start being nicer and I'll tell you about a guy who can help!
5-hand,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;DoneWithRevy:,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;5&timeinstage;0:=angry.png,I said "Niccolo," not "Nicole!" You messed that up on purpose, didn't you?
5-hand,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;DoneWithRevy:,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;5&timeinstage;0:=angry.png,I said "Niccolo," not "Nicole!" Funny, you're as tall, uncharming, and <i>almost</i> as masculine as him.
5-hand,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;DoneWithRevy:,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;5&timeinstage;0:=angry.png,I said "Niccolo," not "Nicole!" And if you try to lay a single dirty hand on me, I... I'll break your arm!
5-hand,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;DoneWithRevy:,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;5&timeinstage;0:=angry.png,I said "Niccolo," not "Nicole!" If I didn't know he's an only child, I'd swear your his sister!
5-hand,oneShotId:17,count-role;other&character;chara_dreemurr:,count-role;self&saidmarker;CharaDemon:,marker:CharaDemon2=competitive.png,I'll give you a fair warning, Chara, I'm no stranger to demon-slaying, so don't try anything funny, okay?
5-hand,count-role;other&character;revy:,count-role;self&saidmarker;SorryMeia&notsaidmarker;NotAMurderer:,marker:NotAMurderer=annoyed.png,I'm not a <i>murderer</i>, no, but just because I don't <i>murder</i> doesn't mean I haven't <i>killed</i>, Revy.
5-hand,count-role;other&character;revy:,count-role;self&saidmarker;SorryMeia&notsaidmarker;NotAMurderer:,marker:NotAMurderer=annoyed.png,I'm not a <i>murderer</i>, Revy, but I've killed orcs, dragons, even <i>demons</i>, but I don't make a game of it.
5-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;Joey3&notsaidmarker;Joey4:,count-role;other&character;joey:,marker:Joey4=interested.png,Isn't it, uh... kind of dangerous to be naked in public?
5-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;JotaroStopTime:,count-role;other&character;jotaro&stage;2&timeinstage;0:=enthused.png,I've only ever met "time" mages who could cast speed-based spells. You must be a <i>true</i> time mage, Jotaro!
5-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;JotaroStopTime2&notsaidmarker;TimeStopAttempt:,count-role;other&character;jotaro:,marker:TimeStopAttempt=competitive.png,Let's see if I can stop time too. <i>Star platinum!</i>
5-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;AellaAdventures:,count-role;other&character;kizuna&sayingmarker;ai_ventures:=happy.png,Not really the kind of adventure I was asking about, but that's a good answer anyway, Kizuna!
5-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;AellaAdventures:,count-role;other&character;mulan&notsaidmarker;MulanAdventures&sayingmarker;MulanAdventures:=enthused.png,Oh, it definitely counts! I love tales of adventures involving rescuing royalty!
5-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;AellaHP2:,count-role;other&character;shantae&saidmarker;hearts:,id:304,marker:AellaHP3=happy.png,Right, Shantae, a lot of people associate hearts with HP, but there's actually no connect to the heart or blood. You'd lose HP if you broke a bone, even if there's no bleeding.
5-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;Joey1&notsaidmarker;Joey2:,count-role;other&character;joey:,marker:Joey2=interested.png,So wait, Joey, you get paid to s-strip?
5-hand,count-role;self&timeinstage;0:,count-role;other&character;twilight:=flustered.png,S-sorry, Twilight, but I'm not originally from this world either. Though, I guess that doesn't really change your point...
5-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;AellaBookClub:,count-role;other&character;mulan&notsaidmarker;MulanBooks&sayingmarker;MulanBooks:=happy.png,That's nice. I haven't read much poetry myself, but I've read quite a few books on philosophy.
5-hand,count-role;other&character;croix&saidmarker;AellaFrench:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;Languages1:,marker:Languages1=embarrassed.png,Uh, y-yeah, I speak French. Khadoric and Dragonic, too. Dreh hi mindok niin?
5-hand,oneShotId:3,count-role;self&saidmarker;AellaBookClub:,count-role;other&character;chazz:,marker:ChazzDontRead=interested.png,Um, Chazz, why did you bother even trying to read if you think literature is a waste of your time?
5-hand,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;RGWager:,count-role;other&character;ribbon_girl&saidmarker;WagerStart:,marker:RGWager=interested.png,Um, does that wager apply to everyone, or just ~player~, Ribbon Girl?
5-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;Joey5&notsaidmarker;Joey6:,count-role;other&character;joey:,marker:Joey6=interested.png,Um, why have a "no touching" rule? No offense, but you already go pretty far, why stop there?
5-hand,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;DoneWithRevy:,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;5&timeinstage;1:=angry.png,Well, I'm sorry about your bad hearing, Revy, but you can't just mishear a name and start assuming you know my life! It's very rude!
5-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;Joey4&notsaidmarker;Joey5:,count-role;other&character;joey:,marker:Joey5=interested.png,What are some of the stipulations you have, Joey?
5-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;AellaAdventures&notsaidmarker;Jessie1:,count-role;other&character;jessie&saidmarker;jessieAdventure:,marker:Jessie1=interested.png,What kind of adventure do you mean, Jessie?
5-hand,oneShotId:23,count-role;other&character;erufuda:,count-role;self&saidmarker;AellaBookClub:,id:288,marker:ErufudaBook1=flustered.png,What was that book you mentioned again, Erufuda? The only part of it I caught was "Elf."
5-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;Joey2&notsaidmarker;Joey3:,count-role;other&character;joey:,marker:Joey3=interested.png,What's it like? Getting paid to take your clothes off?
5-hand,count-role;other&character;beatrix:,count-role;self:=interested.png,W-wait, really? W-well then, what are the benefits?
5-hand,count-role;other&character;meia:,count-role;self&saidmarker;SorryMeia&notsaidmarker;SorryMeia2:,marker:SorryMeia2=flustered.png,W-well, I just meant that there isn't really a way to know if I'm really stronger than you without putting it to the test, you know...?
5-hand,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;DoneWithRevy:,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;4&timeinstage;2:=angry.png,W-what? No! Why would I ever... do <i>that</i> with <i>you</i>? I like nice men, not rude women!
5-hand,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;DoneWithRevy:,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;4&timeinstage;2:,marker:RevyNotPretty=angry.png,W-what? No! Why would I ever... do <i>that</i> with <i>you</i>? You're not even that pretty!
5-hand,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;DoneWithRevy:,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;4&timeinstage;2:,marker:RevyProbablyHasAnSTD=angry.png,W-what? Why would I ever let <i>you</i> touch <i>me</i>? I'd probably catch a disease!
5-hand,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;DoneWithRevy:,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;4&timeinstage;2:,marker:RevyIsntGoodEnough=angry.png,W-why would I ever... do <i>that</i> with <i>you</i>? I saved the world, I can do better than <i>you</i>!
5-hand,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;DoneWithRevy:,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;4&timeinstage;2:,marker:RevyGonnaGetHerArmBroke=angry.png,You try to touch me and I'll break your arm! If you wanted to do... <i>that</i>, you should've been nicer!
5-hand,oneShotId:15,count-role;other&character;jolyne&saidmarker;Stand:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;JolyneStand:,id:301,marker:JolyneStand=interested.png,You mentioned something about a "Stand," Jolyne? I can't see it. Is that bad?
5-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;KaminaMightyManlyMan&notsaidmarker;KaminaIsCool:,count-role;other&character;kamina&stage;6&timeinstage;0:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=facepalm.png,Oh, and get this, he wanted <i>to be paid after that performance</i>! <i>Ugh...</i>
5-hand,priority:156,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;DoneWithRevy:,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;5&timeinstage;3:=annoyed.png,You think I don't know what darkness is in the world? I fought fierce monsters, rebuilt ruined lives -- <i>I've been to the underworld</i>!

5-hand,totalRounds:4,priority:226,count-role;other&character;chun-li&hashand;High Card&sayingmarker;high_card:,count-role;other&character;juri:=annoyed.png,Y-yeah! Even if you can't do anything with that information, you shouldn't be looking at her cards!

5-hand,priority:6,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;1v1:,count-alive:2,marker:1v1=flustered.png,Oh gosh, we're down to two. I'm getting nervous...
5-hand,count-role;other&character;sei&stage;1&timeinstage;0&saidmarker;drinks_anyone:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:=calm.png,None for me, thanks. I need to be battle-ready at all times.
5-hand,oneShotId:6,count-role;other&character;kamina&stage;1:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:188=calm.png,You don't get to be a Sergeant by letting your teammates play make-believe to their deaths.
5-hand,priority:381,count-role;other&character;akko&stage;4&timeinstage;0:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:243=interested.png,You'd be able to cast spells that you couldn't before, but you'd lose what makes you <i>you</i> too, so you can see why it's dangerous .
5-hand,count-role;other&character;sei&stage;1&timeinstage;0&saidmarker;drinks_anyone:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=calm.png,None for me, thanks. Alcohol sounds gross.

5-hand,priority:102,count-role;other&character;chara_dreemurr&saidmarker;DetectAellaSewingMagic&sayingmarker;ResponseAellaSewingMagic:,id:308,marker:Chara_Dead=interested.png,Wait, so you're dead? You look pretty good for an animate corpse.
5-hand,priority:141,count-role;other&character;erufuda&stage;2&sayingmarker;ask_favorite_food:,id:293,marker:ErufudaFood1=thinking.png,I've never really thought about it... Is "steak" too boring of an answer?
5-hand,priority:155,count-role;other&character;nami&stage;5-6&timeinstage;0-&sayingmarker;chopper:,id:33,marker:NamiChopper=interested.png,Hold on, slow down. A reindeer? That can turn into a human? Because of <i>fruit</i>?
5-hand,priority:155,count-role;other&character;cammy_white&stage;1&timeinstage;0:,id:6=interested.png,I suppose that's up to you, Cammy. I think they <i>could</i> count, even individually, but do you feel the need to do so?
5-hand,priority:155,count-role;other&character;nami&stage;5-6&timeinstage;0-&sayingmarker;brook:,id:34,marker:NamiBrook=happy.png,Oh, I'm no stranger to the living dead! I've fought plenty of living skeletons before. I'd like to see one who can play music, though!

5-hand,totalRounds:0,count-role;other&character;shamir:,marker:ShamirPlaying=interested.png,So you're playing, then? You don't really have to.
5-hand,totalRounds:1,count-role;other&character;jura:=enthused.png,I can teach you about swords if you like, Jura. I've got a couple of manuals at home I can show you!
5-hand,totalRounds:1,count-role;other&character;saki_zls:=interested.png,You said you were the leader of a pike gang, Saki? Is that pike as in the fish or pike as in the weapon?
5-hand,totalRounds:5,count-role;other&character;vriska:=flustered.png,Er, sorry, Vriska, but there's something about the way you talk that's... Getting under my skin.
5-hand,totalRounds:5,count-role;other&character;vriska:=flustered.png,Er, sorry, Vriska, but there's something about the way you pronounce "B" sounds that's... Getting under my skin.
5-hand,totalRounds:5,count-role;other&character;ryuko&stage;0:=flustered.png,Uh, this might be a weird question, but... has that eye pattern on Ryuko's clothes been... <i>blinking</i>?

5-hand,totalRounds:7-,count-alive:4-5,count-role;other&character;mary&sayingmarker;mfk:,id:284,marker:MaryFMK=flustered.png,... I'm not going to answer that. I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings.

5-hand,count-meia:1,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;7&timeinstage;2:=interested.png,I mean <i>literal</i> monsters, Meia. You know, things you can't reason with, like goblins and trolls.
5-hand,count-meia:1,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;7&timeinstage;0:=calm.png,Phew! I'm glad that didn't turn into a fight.
5-hand,count-meia:1,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;7&timeinstage;1:=happy.png,Well just because you're pirates doesn't mean I want you hurt. Resolving conflict with bloodshed is only fun against monsters.

5-hand,totalRounds:28=flustered.png,Gosh, this game is taking longer than I thought it would...
5-hand,totalRounds:28=flustered.png,It's a good thing I'm used to standing for long periods of time. This game is taking quite a while...
5-hand,totalRounds:28=flustered.png,I'm used to long fights, but this is... not as fun, to be honest. I mean, not that it's <i>boring</i>, just... never mind...
5-hand,totalRounds:28=interested.png,Do these games normally go on for this long? Not that I'm complaining, I'm just curious.

-3-good_hand=calm.png,If only my hands could've been this good more consistently...
-3-good_hand=calm.png,If only my hands could've been this good earlier...
-3-good_hand=happy.png,Maybe I have some luck after all...?
-3-good_hand=competitive.png,Take that, stupid luck stat!
-3-good_hand,count-role;self&hashand;Royal Flush&saidmarker;1v1:=enthused.png,Aha! A royal flush! No way you're beating me this round!
-3-good_hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;1v1:=happy.png,Sorry, but I'm pretty sure you lost this round.
-3-good_hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;1v1:=happy.png,Looks like I'm safe this round, unless you happen to have something better.
-3-good_hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;1v1:=happy.png,Oh, thank goodness. I'm safe. Unless my luck decides otherwise...
-3-good_hand,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:104=competitive.png,It's gonna take more than some pieces of paper to get rid of me!
-3-okay_hand=sad.png,I don't like my odds with this hand. Even if it is an okay hand...
-3-okay_hand=sad.png,I'm not comfortable with this hand...
-3-okay_hand=sad.png,A pair leaves too much room to be beaten...
-3-okay_hand=sad.png,This hand does little to put me at ease...
-3-okay_hand=sad.png,Could be worse, I guess...
-3-okay_hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;1v1:=sad.png,I really don't like the look of this hand right now...
-3-okay_hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;1v1:=calm.png,This is <i>not</i> a good hand to have in this situation...
-3-okay_hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;1v1:=sad.png,I could very well have lost this round with a hand like this...
-3-okay_hand,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:87=calm.png,A pair will simply have to do.
-3-okay_hand,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:87=annoyed.png,I'm not afraid to lose this game. However, I refuse to lose by result of a pair.
-3-bad_hand=sad.png,I can't believe these cards...
-3-bad_hand=sad.png,It's over...
-3-bad_hand=sad.png,I'm done for...
-3-bad_hand=sad.png,Curse my horrible luck stat...
-3-bad_hand,marker:BestedByPaper=facepalm.png,I can't believe I'm about to be bested by tiny pieces of paper.
-3-bad_hand=facepalm.png,I really should've brought some luck charms or something...
-3-bad_hand,one-shot-id:4=flustered.png,I'm... starting to forget why I thought playing a game that involved getting naked with strangers was a fun idea...
-3-bad_hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;1v1:=sad.png,Well, I did good to last as long as I did...
-3-bad_hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;1v1:=sad.png,I'm usually <i>great</i> at one-on-one scenarios...
-3-bad_hand,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:93=annoyed.png,I'll tell you now, I will not be removing my arm to save myself from losing the game. I quite like having two arms.
-3-bad_hand,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:93=facepalm.png,My defeat is all but certain with this hand.
-3-hand,count-role;other&character;mulan&sayingmarker;honorable_others:=flustered.png,A match? Like a romantic partner...? I never really thought about it...
-3-hand,count-role;other&character;rinkah&stage;4&timeinstage;0:=interested.png,A-anyway, um... That u-underwear looks rather uncomfortable, a-and maybe a bit impractical. Am I right at all?
-3-hand,count-role;other&character;kyu&stage;1&timeinstage;0:=thinking.png,But then begs the question: what do you have to gain from lying to us like that...?
-3-hand,count-role;other&character;mary&stage;3&sayingmarker;dakku:,id:285,marker:MaryDucks=interested.png,Ducks...? Yeah, I guess you could carry ducks in it. You mean fully grown ones, right? Four sounds about right.
-3-hand,oneShotId:19,count-role;other&character;shantae&saidmarker;hearts2:,id:310,marker:Shantae_Hearts=thinking.png,Half a heart, huh, Shantae? Bumping your toe couldn't have been more than 3 HP, so you must have a lot of hearts! Unless you bumped it particularly hard...
-3-hand,count-role;other&character;palutena&saying;I have hearts:,marker:PaluHearts1=shocked.png,H-hearts? L-like the symbol, o-or m-maybe cow hearts? N-not <i>human</i> hearts, right?
-3-hand,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;4&timeinstage;0:,marker:RevyCoolIt=annoyed.png,I must say, Revy, I don't appreciate your overly aggressive attitude. You need to cool down!
-3-hand,count-role;other&character;mary&sayingmarker;weird_fetish:,id:286=flustered.png,I-I'm not sure. I don't even know if I have... any of those...
-3-hand,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;4&timeinstage;2:=angry.png,I'm not scared, I'm just bad at tough talk! I assure you that my arms and legs are better at being tough than my voice is!
-3-hand,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;4&timeinstage;2:=angry.png,I'm not scared, I just don't like being so mean! I'm not afraid of putting up a fight, though!
-3-hand,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;4&timeinstage;2:=angry.png,I'm not scared, I'm just bad at intimidation checks because of my low charisma stat! I've got more than enough strength to make up for it, though!
-3-hand,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;4&timeinstage;2:=angry.png,I'm not scared, I just stutter sometimes! It's never stopped me from taking down dragons, I'll have you know!
-3-hand,oneShotId:18,count-role;other&character;orendi&saidmarker;Aella_Quest:,marker:Orendi_Quest=flustered.png,I'm still processing that quest you told me about, Orendi. How do you destroy stuff with math...?
-3-hand,count-role;other&character;nayru&stage;5&timeinstage;0&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=flustered.png,I'm, uh... I'm sorry about your dress, Nayru. I can fix it up for you, if you like.
-3-hand,count-role;other&character;ini&stage;5&timeinstage;0:=facepalm.png,I've <i>been</i> using my brain, I just wanted to believe that you were who you were saying you were.
-3-hand,count-role;other&character;marinette&stage;1&timeinstage;0:=calm.png,I've never seen any Ladybug Mages before. Did you invent the school?
-3-hand,count-role;other&character;marinette&sayingmarker;aella_bookclub:=enthused.png,I've read quite a few of them, yeah! I should show you my collection of them. We could compare our worlds' fashion trends!
-3-hand,oneShotId:21,count-role;other&character;shantae&saidmarker;adventures:,id:307=happy.png,My adventure involved a lot of that too, Shantae! Except for the transformations part.
-3-hand,count-role;other&character;meia&stage;5&saidmarker;aella_slaughter:,id:107,marker:MeiaSafeKill=flustered.png,N-no, Meia, I don't mean things that are beneth me, I mean things that <i>endanger</i> me. Things that you <i>need</i> to kill to be safe.
-3-hand,count-role;other&character;meia&stage;5&saidmarker;aella_slaughter:,id:107,marker:MeiaSafeKill=flustered.png,You make it sound like I enjoy killing bunnies and squirrels, Meia... I meant <i>dangerous</i> things. Things that you need to kill to be safe.
-3-hand,count-role;other&character;marinette&sayingmarker;aella_adventures:=happy.png,No no, that's okay, the demon weapon problem has already been taken care of!
-3-hand,count-role;other&character;joey&stage;6:=calm.png,No. Should I have?
-3-hand,count-role;other&character;ini&stage;6&timeinstage;0:=facepalm.png,Of course it is... Well, you're right, there's nothing I can do with that information, but thank you for your honesty.
-3-hand,count-role;other&character;amalia&stage;5&timeinstage;0:=sad.png,Oh! You can summon flowers? I wish I could do the same...
-3-hand,count-role;other&character;amalia&stage;5&timeinstage;0:=sad.png,Oh! Flowers... I wish I had some too...
-3-hand,count-role;other&character;amalia&stage;5&timeinstage;0:=calm.png,Can you summon some flowers for me too, please...?
-3-hand,count-role;other&character;erufuda&stage;3&timeinstage;0:,id:290,marker:ErufudaPants1=happy.png,Oh, and don't worry about the tear. I can fix that for you so you don't have to wear them home like that!
-3-hand,count-role;other&character;futaba&sayingmarker;futaba_bookclub:=happy.png,Oh, I agree! The mind is very fascinating!
-3-hand,count-role;other&character;meia&stage;1&timeinstage;0:=interested.png,Oh, I see... What's an "Oma?"
-3-hand,oneShotId:7,count-role;self&saidmarker;AellaHP:,id:269,marker:AellaHP2=interested.png,Oh, uh, you guys know about HP, right? The life force of all living things? I just realized this world might operate on different rules than mine.
-3-hand,count-role;other&character;ribbon_girl&stage;3&sayingmarker;AellaChargeArms:=calm.png,Okay. You'll have to introduce us later, then.
-3-hand,count-role;other&character;futaba&sayingmarker;futaba_adventures:=enthused.png,Ooh, I've always wanted to go overseas! Uh, in my world, that is, but I'm sure overseas in this world is great too!
-3-hand,count-role;other&character;joey&sayingmarker;CandyHat:=interested.png,Really?... What kind of candy?
-3-hand,count-role;other&character;joey&sayingmarker;CandyHat:=interested.png,Really? Wouldn't that make your head sticky?
-3-hand,count-role;other&character;joey&sayingmarker;CandyHat:=interested.png,Really? Well, I hope it doesn't melt on you.
-3-hand,oneShotId:24,count-role;other&character;erufuda&saidmarker;aella_fries2:,id:313=flustered.png,Shoot, I just remembered I'm in a foreign region. Unless restaurants around here accept gold, I'm gonna need some new currency before I can get some fries...
-3-hand,oneShotId:22,count-role;other&character;erufuda&saidmarker;aella_fries:,id:287=happy.png,So where can I get some of these "fries" for myself?
-3-hand,oneShotId:9,count-role;self&saidmarker;AellaHP3:,marker:AellaHP4=interested.png,Some people theorize that HP is a kind of shield-like energy that protects your soul. Which I guess makes sense when you consider healing magic.
-3-hand,count-role;other&character;saki_zls&stage;6&timeinstage;0:=interested.png,S-so what happened to your body? Th-the scars, I mean.
-3-hand,oneShotId:4,count-role;other&character;lucina&stage;1:=flustered.png,S-sorry, I don't mean to undermine your status... Let me start over. Hi, Princess Lucina, I'm Aella. Nice to meet you.
-3-hand,count-role;other&character;mavis&stage;3&timeinstage;0:=happy.png,Staying at home is no excuse for not working out. Just look at me! I spent my whole life inside, and I can suplex orcs!
-3-hand,count-role;other&character;mavis&stage;3&timeinstage;0:=happy.png,Staying at home is no excuse for not working out. If anything, it's a reason to do it more! That's what <i>I</i> did, anyway!
-3-hand,count-role;other&character;meia&stage;1&timeinstage;1:=calm.png,That's interesting, Meia! It's certainly not unheard of for women to love each other in my world, but I didn't think they could have children.
-3-hand,oneShotId:25,count-role;other&character;erufuda&saidmarker;aella_book_club2:,id:314,marker:ErufudaBook2=interested.png,The book you're talking about must be in a foreign language, huh, Erufuda? I still only caught "elf" from the title.
-3-hand,count-role;other&character;mavis&stage;5&timeinstage;0:=interested.png,To be honest, no, that isn't.
-3-hand,oneShotId:20,count-role;other&character;shantae&stage;1:,id:311,marker:Shantae_Transformations=interested.png,Transformations, you say? Don't you know transformation magic is dangerous?... Or is it safer for you because you're a magical being?
-3-hand,count-role;other&character;mary&sayingmarker;imnotlooking:,id:282,marker:MaryBlind=interested.png,Uh, okay. I guess you have a point, but telling us that makes about as much of a difference as actually doing it.
-3-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;AellaHP2&notsaidmarker;AellaHP3:,id:268,marker:AellaHP3=calm.png,Uh, right, so HP is your life force in my world. You lose it when you experience bodily harm, and you gain it when you eat or sleep.
-3-hand,count-role;other&character;rainbow_dash&sayingmarker;adventurer_what_do:,marker:RDAdventures1=happy.png,Well, I didn't go around finding relics, but I did go on a pretty crazy adventure to kill these demon weapons that were causing havoc.
-3-hand,count-role;other&character;nami&stage;3:=competitive.png,Well, uh, don't worry about me trying to turn you in, Nami. At least, not unless you start to cause trouble.
-3-hand,count-role;other&character;erufuda&stage;1:=interested.png,What is that you're eating, Erufuda? It sure does smell appetizing.
-3-hand,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;4&timeinstage;2:,marker:DoneWithRevy=facepalm.png,You know what, Revy? I'm done trying to talk to you. I'm going to ignore you now.
-3-hand,count-role;other&character;meia&stage;5&saidmarker;aella_menkill:,id:256,marker:MeiaSeesPsycho=sad.png,You really just don't want to see me as anything other than an amoral psycho, huh?
-3-hand,count-role;other&character;akko&stage;4&timeinstage;0:=interested.png,You'd be able to cast spells that you couldn't before, but you'd lose what makes you <i>you</i> too, so you can see why it's bad.
-3-hand,count-role;other&character;meia&stage;5&saidmarker;aella_menkill2:,id:270,marker:MeiaNotListening=annoyed.png,You're not listening to me, Meia! My point is that it's fun to fight, but only when it's with something you can't reason with! <i>Killing</i> isn't fun!
-3-hand,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;4&timeinstage;1:,marker:HadEnough=angry.png,Y-you want to fight? I-I put myself on display for long enough to knock you out, i-if that's what it takes to shut you up!
-3-hand,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;4&timeinstage;1:,marker:HadEnough=angry.png,Y-you want to fight? I-I'll fight you n-naked if I have to!
-3-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;RGWager&notsaidmarker;RGWagerNotSure:,count-role;other&character;ribbon_girl:,marker:RGWagerNotSure=flustered.png,Aha, well, I'm sure I could beat you, but... <i>anything?</i> I don't like the sound of that...
-3-hand,oneShotId:16,count-role;self&saidmarker;AellaAdventures:,count-role;other&character;chara_dreemurr:,marker:CharaDemon=flustered.png,Are you a demon, Chara? I don't remember freeing you from a weapon prison...
-3-hand,count-role;other&character;tharja&saidmarker;cheating1:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;TharjaCheating:,marker:TharjaCheating=annoyed.png,H-hey, wait a minute, did you just say you've been cheating? You'd better stop!
-3-hand,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;DoneWithRevy:,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;5&timeinstage;2:=angry.png,I don't care how often you're rude to people! You shouldn't be rude because it makes people feel bad!
-3-hand,count-role;other&character;jolyne:,count-role;self&saidmarker;AellaAdventures:,id:303,marker:JolyneAdventure=happy.png,I don't know about that, Jolyne, my adventure was pretty bizarre too! I'd like to hear about yours!
-3-hand,oneShotId:13,count-role;self&saidmarker;MaryDucks:,count-role;other&character;mary&sayingmarker;AellaDucks:,id:295,marker:MaryDucks2=thinking.png,I don't know about that. I think my dress could only carry... maybe seven? Eight at best.
-3-hand,count-role;other&character;erufuda&stage;3:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ErufudaPants1:,id:316,marker:ErufudaPants2=interested.png,I don't know where you've been getting your clothes from, but human craftsmanship is usually pretty good. Not the best, but good. My sister's dress is human-made and lasted for years.
-3-hand,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;RevyCoolIt:,count-role;other&character;revy&sayingmarker;music:,marker:AellaMusic=happy.png,I like piano and violin music the best. Does anyone here know how to play either of those instruments?
-3-hand,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;DoneWithRevy:,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;5&timeinstage;0:=angry.png,I said "Niccolo," not "Nicole!" Are you hard of hearing? Start being nicer and I'll tell you about a guy who can help!
-3-hand,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;DoneWithRevy:,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;5&timeinstage;0:=angry.png,I said "Niccolo," not "Nicole!" You messed that up on purpose, didn't you?
-3-hand,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;DoneWithRevy:,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;5&timeinstage;0:=angry.png,I said "Niccolo," not "Nicole!" Funny, you're as tall, uncharming, and <i>almost</i> as masculine as him.
-3-hand,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;DoneWithRevy:,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;5&timeinstage;0:=angry.png,I said "Niccolo," not "Nicole!" And if you try to lay a single dirty hand on me, I... I'll break your arm!
-3-hand,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;DoneWithRevy:,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;5&timeinstage;0:=angry.png,I said "Niccolo," not "Nicole!" If I didn't know he's an only child, I'd swear your his sister!
-3-hand,oneShotId:17,count-role;other&character;chara_dreemurr:,count-role;self&saidmarker;CharaDemon:,marker:CharaDemon2=competitive.png,I'll give you a fair warning, Chara, I'm no stranger to demon-slaying, so don't try anything funny, okay?
-3-hand,count-role;other&character;revy:,count-role;self&saidmarker;SorryMeia&notsaidmarker;NotAMurderer:,marker:NotAMurderer=annoyed.png,I'm not a <i>murderer</i>, no, but just because I don't <i>murder</i> doesn't mean I haven't <i>killed</i>, Revy.
-3-hand,count-role;other&character;revy:,count-role;self&saidmarker;SorryMeia&notsaidmarker;NotAMurderer:,marker:NotAMurderer=annoyed.png,I'm not a <i>murderer</i>, Revy, but I've killed orcs, dragons, even <i>demons</i>, but I don't make a game of it.
-3-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;Joey3&notsaidmarker;Joey4:,count-role;other&character;joey:,marker:Joey4=interested.png,Isn't it, uh... kind of dangerous to be naked in public?
-3-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;JotaroStopTime:,count-role;other&character;jotaro&stage;2&timeinstage;0:=enthused.png,I've only ever met "time" mages who could cast speed-based spells. You must be a <i>true</i> time mage, Jotaro!
-3-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;JotaroStopTime2&notsaidmarker;TimeStopAttempt:,count-role;other&character;jotaro:,marker:TimeStopAttempt=competitive.png,Let's see if I can stop time too. <i>Star platinum!</i>
-3-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;AellaAdventures:,count-role;other&character;kizuna&sayingmarker;ai_ventures:=happy.png,Not really the kind of adventure I was asking about, but that's a good answer anyway, Kizuna!
-3-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;AellaAdventures:,count-role;other&character;mulan&notsaidmarker;MulanAdventures&sayingmarker;MulanAdventures:=enthused.png,Oh, it definitely counts! I love tales of adventures involving rescuing royalty!
-3-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;AellaHP2:,count-role;other&character;shantae&saidmarker;hearts:,id:304,marker:AellaHP3=happy.png,Right, Shantae, a lot of people associate hearts with HP, but there's actually no connect to the heart or blood. You'd lose HP if you broke a bone, even if there's no bleeding.
-3-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;Joey1&notsaidmarker;Joey2:,count-role;other&character;joey:,marker:Joey2=interested.png,So wait, Joey, you get paid to s-strip?
-3-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;AellaBookClub:,count-role;other&character;mulan&notsaidmarker;MulanBooks&sayingmarker;MulanBooks:=happy.png,That's nice. I haven't read much poetry myself, but I've read quite a few books on philosophy.
-3-hand,count-role;other&character;croix&saidmarker;AellaFrench:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;Languages1:,marker:Languages1=embarrassed.png,Uh, y-yeah, I speak French. Khadoric and Dragonic, too. Dreh hi mindok niin?
-3-hand,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;RGWager:,count-role;other&character;ribbon_girl&saidmarker;WagerStart:,marker:RGWager=interested.png,Um, does that wager apply to everyone, or just ~player~, Ribbon Girl?
-3-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;Joey5&notsaidmarker;Joey6:,count-role;other&character;joey:,marker:Joey6=interested.png,Um, why have a "no touching" rule? No offense, but you already go pretty far, why stop there?
-3-hand,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;DoneWithRevy:,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;5&timeinstage;1:=angry.png,Well, I'm sorry about your bad hearing, Revy, but you can't just mishear a name and start assuming you know my life! It's very rude!
-3-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;Joey4&notsaidmarker;Joey5:,count-role;other&character;joey:,marker:Joey5=interested.png,What are some of the stipulations you have, Joey?
-3-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;AellaAdventures&notsaidmarker;Jessie1:,count-role;other&character;jessie&saidmarker;jessieAdventure:,marker:Jessie1=interested.png,What kind of adventure do you mean, Jessie?

0-stripping,count-role;other&character;yuelia&saidmarker;aella_heavyArmor:=stripping.png,Oh, I absolutely could. Unless you weigh a ton more than you look like you do, it'd be no problem at all.
0-stripping,count-role;other&character;nami:=stripping.png,Oh, it's the symbol of my kingdom. It symbolizes warmth and a closeness with the gods.

0-stripping,count-role;other&character;mary:,id:300=stripping.png,Oh? Why's that? Is that because you can fit into smaller spaces? My sister's pretty good at that too.
0-stripping,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;aella_battle1&notsaidmarker;aella_battle2&sayingmarker;aella_battle2:=stripping.png,One time my friends and I fought a red dragon. Turns out, all we had to do was convince it that hoarding gold was bad for the kingdom's economy!
0-stripping,count-role;other&character;arash:=stripping.png,Thank you, and yeah, it <i>is</i> easy to move around in. Speed is one thing that sets Warriors apart from Knights.
0-stripping,count-role;other&character;elizabeth:=stripping.png,That's a common misconception, Elizabeth. Armor <i>can't</i> be heavy, or else it becomes more trouble than it's worth.
0-stripping,count-role;other&character;joey:=stripping.png,This reminds me of the first time I ever left the house; the first step into a brand new world.
0-stripping,count-role;other&character;shantae:,id:306=stripping.png,Well, armor like that certainly has it's, uh... <i>advantages</i>, but it's certainly not a strategy I enjoy using.
0-stripping,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;aella_fantasy1&notsaidmarker;aella_fantasy2&sayingmarker;aella_fantasy2:=stripping.png,Well, there are mercenaries, but not a whole lot of mutants, and it's not apocalyptic.

0-stripping,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;0-7:,id:108=stripping.png,What? No, adventuring, of course! It's real easy to make a lot of money when you sell the equipment you find and don't use!
0-stripping,count-role;other&character;mulan&stage;0-1:=stripping.png,While that's a correct assumption, I'm not actually part of any army. I'm just a wandering warrior.
0-stripping,count-role;other&character;sakura:=stripping.png,Yeah, I guess it was a long journey, considering I went from Lofous Village to Paralimnio Village to get to the portal to this world.
0-stripping,count-role;other&character;akko:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=stripping.png,I'm on more of a quest than an adventure. My friend Etsuko opened up a portal and wanted me to find out where it lead to.

0-stripping,count-role;other&character;sei:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=stripping.png,Uh, thanks, I guess? To be honest, I don't see how this is brave. I've faced greater trials than this.
0-stripping,priority:101,count-role;other&character;yuelia&saidmarker;aella_prepare:=stripping.png,That's quite admirable of them, but I never needed to do so myself. I was always well-off just buying everything I needed.

1-stripped=stripped.png,Don't let me slow things down. Let's keep this game going.
1-stripped=stripped.png,It's just enough armor to safely parry attacks without encumbering me too much.
1-stripped=stripped.png,It's kind of funny how no matter what shops I visit, they always have that exact armor set for sale but with different stats.
1-stripped=annoyed.png,First person to comment how little my armor covers gets smacked! It doesn't affect my defense stat, I tell you!
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;coco:=flustered.png,<i>Amateur...?</i>
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;jessie&stage;0-5:=stripped.png,Ah, but do you know that for sure, Jessie? And <i>that</i> is why I wore the armor here in the first place.

1-stripped,count-role;other&character;meia:=stripped.png,Aha, funny coincidence, I've played a lot of poker too.

1-stripped,count-role;other&character;elizabeth:=stripped.png,I'm sure you could walk in it, just probably not very far. It doesn't require a lot of <i>strength</i>, but it can be very trying on your <i>stamina</i>.
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;joey:=stripped.png,Is that what you see stripping as, Joey?
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;aella_fantasy2&notsaidmarker;aella_fantasy3&sayingmarker;aella_fantasy3:=calm.png,No promises about us not having to worry about goblins.

1-stripped,count-role;other&character;nugi-chan&saidmarker;nugi-chan_aella_a_thrust_to_the_chest:,id:318,marker:Nugi_Thrust=stripped.png,Not really, no. A thrust-countering techique for rapiers would also work on spears, for example. It's the same motion, so the prinicples are the same.
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;beatrix:,marker:AellaHP=stripped.png,Oh, it doesn't, but that's what HP is for!
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;clover:=stripped.png,Oh, see, it's a metaphor, Clover. I don't mean a literal world, I mean it's a a brand new experience.
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;ribbon_girl:=stripped.png,Other than being really strong, that's about it. I don't know a lot of people who have non-magic abilities like you.

1-stripped,count-role;other&character;mulan&stage;0-1&saying;men and women:=interested.png,Um, no, it wouldn't. Men and women can fight together in the same regiment just fine.
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;rinkah:=stripped.png,Yeah. You can never know when a goblin ambush might happen.

1-stripped,count-festival_aella:1,id:52=stripped.png,I don't want to slow things down too much, so I'll take off <i>all</i> of my accessories.
1-stripped,count-festival_aella:1,id:52=stripped.png,I hope no one minds if I put my flower with the rest of my things. I can't call you <i>all</i> my dates, so I wouldn't know who to give it to.
1-stripped,priority:1,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:64=stripped.png,Of course, it wasn't good enough to save my arm, but it's really my fault for letting my shield run out.
1-stripped,count-new_year_aella:1=stripped.png,We wear similar colors for New Years in my world, so this outfit isn't much different than what I would've worn there.
1-stripped,count-new_year_aella:1=stripped.png,Besides New Years, we also have the First Harvest Festival in Spring, where we celebrate food and all forms of livestock.
1-stripped,count-new_year_aella:1=stripped.png,Etsuko also insisted I carry that plush doll. She made it in her likeness, more or less. She's not a rabbit, though, obviously.
1-stripped,count-new_year_aella:1=stripped.png,Etsuko also insisted I carry that plush doll. If this were the First Harvest Festival, it would've been a stuffed horse instead of a rabbit.

1-must_strip,count-role;self&hashand;Straight Flush:=sad.png,Aw, darn it! I thought for sure I couldn't lose with that hand!

1-must_strip,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;viewers>=4&notsaidmarker;aella_level1&sayingmarker;aella_level1:=happy.png,Good question indeed! I'm a level 23 Warrior.
1-must_strip,count-role;other&character;navi:=happy.png,Haha, you know, I don't get it either. People come in all sorts of shapes and sizes, so why single people out?
1-must_strip,count-role;other&character;sakura:=calm.png,I made them myself. Nothing gets made in my size, so I kinda had to.
1-must_strip,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;viewers>=8&notsaidmarker;aella_battle1&sayingmarker;aella_battle1:=competitive.png,I sure do! Er, know my way around a fight, that is.
1-must_strip,count-role;other&character;mulan&stage;2-10:=interested.png,Is that so, Mulan? I wonder why?
1-must_strip,count-role;other&character;mulan&stage;0-1:=interested.png,Is that so, Ping? I wonder why?
1-must_strip,count-role;other&character;yuelia&sayingmarker;aella_goodFriends:,marker:SecondMother=happy.png,I've met all kinds of people, and yeah, some of them became good friends! One of my friends is like a second mother to me.
1-must_strip,count-role;other&character;yuelia&sayingmarker;aella_goodFriends:,marker:FriendToSister=happy.png,I've met all kinds of people, and yeah, some of them became good friends! One of my friends even became my sister!
1-must_strip,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;viewers>=4&notsaidmarker;aella_knight1&sayingmarker;aella_knight1:=calm.png,Oh, I'm not actually a knight. I'm a warrior. And I've never heard of the White Knights.
1-must_strip,count-role;other&character;yuelia&sayingmarker;aella_newAdventure:=thinking.png,Well, I did want to have a look around this world when we're done here, if you count that as an adventure.
1-must_strip,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;viewers>=4&notsaidmarker;aella_fantasy1&sayingmarker;aella_fantasy1:=interested.png,Well, yes. Is this world not like that?
1-must_strip,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;viewers>=8&notsaidmarker;aella_intimacy1&sayingmarker;aella_intimacy1:=interested.png,Well, yes. Why would I lie about that?
1-must_strip,count-role;self&hashand;Royal Flush:=shocked.png,W-what? But a Royal Flush is an unbeatable hand!
1-must_strip,count-role;self&hashand;Royal Flush:=shocked.png,W-what? Me? But I have a Royal Flush!
1-must_strip,count-role;self&hashand;Royal Flush:=shocked.png,W-what? <i>I</i> have to strip? But how? <i>Why?</i>
1-must_strip,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;viewers<4&notsaidmarker;aella_comfort1&sayingmarker;aella_comfort1:=flustered.png,Yeah, I don't doubt that.

1-must_strip,count-role;other&character;akko:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=happy.png,Of course! Etsuko is a good witch, and I'm sure there are plenty more.
1-must_strip,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,count-role;other&character;jura&stage;0-6:,id:259=interested.png,Again, it's a very normal size for a rifle. What does your "girl" collect, hand cannons?
1-must_strip,priority:1,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:96=happy.png,Whatever. I'm still relatively decent, so this is only a minor setback.
1-must_strip,priority:1,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:96=competitive.png,You think I'm shaking yet? Hah! I sleep in less than this, and I have a bunkmate!
1-must_strip,priority:1,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:96=happy.png,Compared to the battlefront, this is nothing!
1-must_strip,test:~self.place~:1=happy.png,I could certainly stand to lose this one, haha.
1-must_strip,test:~self.place~:1=happy.png,Ah, first place is overrated anyhow!
1-must_strip_winning=happy.png,Well, this is <i>strip</i> poker. I didn't expect to go the whole game fully clothed.
1-must_strip_normal=happy.png,Well, at least I'm keeping pace with the rest of you.
1-must_strip_losing=happy.png,My turn again? Oh well, at least we're still early on in the game.
1-stripping=stripping.png,Suppose it's time for my boots to go.
1-stripping=stripping.png,Alright, I'll take off my boots next. It only makes sense.
1-stripping=stripping.png,Time for the next <i>step</i>, heh heh... You get it?

1-stripping,count-role;other&character;navi&stage;1-5:=stripping.png,Being tall doesn't give me much of any advantage. I've fought plenty of formidable opponents who were shorter than me.
1-stripping,count-role;other&character;elizabeth:=stripping.png,Indeed it is. I've studied many books on strategy and war tactics. They're very fascinating!
1-stripping,count-role;other&character;kazuma:=stripping.png,It's okay, I can fix the boots too.
1-stripping,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;aella_level1&notsaidmarker;aella_level2&sayingmarker;aella_level2:=stripping.png,I've never had a bard in my party before. What can you do?

1-stripping,count-role;other&character;beatrix:=stripping.png,Uh, no, they're pretty normal boots. Nothing special.
1-stripping,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;aella_fantasy1&notsaidmarker;aella_fantasy2&sayingmarker;aella_fantasy2:=stripping.png,Well, there are mercenaries, but not a whole lot of mutants, and it's not apocalyptic.

2-stripped,count-role;other&character;elizabeth:=competitive.png,Haha! Poker has nothing to do with strategy. You should be more afraid of how I've studied books on poker tactics!
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;elizabeth:=competitive.png,Haha! Poker has nothing to do with strategy. You should be more afraid of how many times I've played poker against my parents!

2-stripped,count-role;other&character;kazuma:=happy.png,No thanks. I have a party of my own already, and I'm set on gold. Selling all of your underlevel gear is a great way to make money!
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;aella_reaction2&notsaidmarker;aella_reaction3&sayingmarker;aella_reaction3:=interested.png,No, no one calls me "mommy" or "daddy." I don't have any kids... A-and no, I won't crush your skull.

#naked
-3-stripped=stripped.png,Well, a-at least this is as naked as I can be...
-3-stripped=stripped.png,I know that nudity is natural, but clothes are... much more comfortable.
-3-stripped=stripped.png,I'm so glad Jolene didn't tag along. Sisters shouldn't see each other naked, even if she <i>is</i> adopted...
-3-stripped=stripped.png,Sorry if I'm doing a lot of whining about my exposure. It's just... you know...
-3-stripped=stripped.png,Okay, Asvaldr, I've learned my lesson... You can come save me now... <i>Please?...</i>
-3-stripped=stripped.png,Before anyone asks, no, they aren't magic panties. They're just regular ones...
-3-stripped,count-role;other&character;twilight:=stripped.png,A <i>what</i> mark? W-why would I have a mark hidden under my clothes...?
-3-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;aella_annoy2&notsaidmarker;aella_annoy3&sayingmarker;aella_annoy3:=flustered.png,Humor...? I was being genuine...

-3-stripped,count-role;other&character;palutena&stage;0-7:=annoyed.png,This isn't about <i>just</i> being naked, you know! It's about being naked around others...
-3-stripped,count-role;other&character;streaming-chan&saidmarker;aella_fantasy2&notsaidmarker;aella_fantasy3&sayingmarker;aella_fantasy3:=calm.png,No promises about us not having to worry about goblins.

-3-stripped,count-role;other&character;joey:=stripped.png,Th-thanks for the encouragement... Though, it is rather weird to have someone cheering about this...

-1-female_must_strip,priority:381,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;4:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:244=calm.png,There's no cure for Manatrocism, so if you turned into one, I'd have no choice but to kill you. Hence why I'd have no hesitation doing so.

#OPPONENT REMOVING ACCESSORY
#These lines are spoken when an opponent removes a small item that does not cover any skin.
#Typically, characters are fine with this when they are fully dressed but less satisfied as they become more naked.
#Note that all "removing" lines are NOT spoken to human players. Characters will skip straight from "6-male_human_must_strip" to "6-male_removed_accessory", for example.

#fully clothed
0-male_removing_accessory=flustered.png,Oh, I didn't realize you still had ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~...

0-male_removing_accessory=calm.png,Your ~clothing~? That's fair.
0-male_removing_accessory=calm.png,Well, your ~clothing~ needed to come off eventually anyway.
0-male_removing_accessory=calm.png,The rules do allow your ~clothing~ to count as an item.
0-male_removing_accessory=happy.png,That's fine. It's not like we're racing here.
0-male_removing_accessory=happy.png,Off ~clothing.ifPlural(come|comes)~ your ~clothing~, eh?
0-male_removing_accessory=happy.png,Farewell, ~clothing~.
0-male_removing_accessory=calm.png,Rules are rules, and they allow your ~clothing~ to count.
0-male_removing_accessory=interested.png,Well, the rules say your ~clothing~ ~clothing.ifPlural(count|counts)~, so I guess I do too?
0-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;chazz&stage;0:,id:279=thinking.png,A Duel Disk? But it's not even disk-shaped. And wouldn't it be terribly awkward for another player to play on that with you?
0-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kazuma:=competitive.png,Fair warning, I'm really good at crushing thieves before they make off with my stuff!
0-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;jotaro&stage;1:=flustered.png,I mean, you <i>did</i> agree to do this, Jotaro.
0-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;ae86&stage;0:=interested.png,I mean, you can love whoever you want as long as they can and <i>do</i> consent, but this is like being attracted to your dining table.

0-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&layers;3-4:=flustered.png,That's, um... Yeah, I can't complain.

0-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kamina&stage;0:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:186=angry.png,It takes more than courage to win a fight. It takes planning, critical thinking, and knowing when to back down. Without those skills, you're nothing!
0-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kamina&stage;0:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:186=angry.png,It takes more than being an oxygen theif win a fight. It takes planning, critical thinking, and knowing when to back down. Otherwise, you're nothing!
0-male_removing_accessory,priority:56,count-role;target&startinglayers;3-4:=flustered.png,Alright, sure. You didn't come here with much, after all...
0-male_removing_accessory,priority:56,count-role;target&startinglayers;3-4:=flustered.png,I... supppose it's only fair we let you count ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~

0-male_removing_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:116=annoyed.png,Is that the best you can do?
0-male_removing_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:116=interested.png,That's it?
0-male_removing_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:116=interested.png,Not exactly bold, are you?
0-male_removing_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,count-role;target&character;ae86&stage;0:,id:198=interested.png,Oh, it's playing now, is it? Lovely.
0-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetSaying:platinum,marker:JotaroStarPlatinum=interested.png,Uh, what's "star platinum?"
0-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1,targetSaying:platinum,marker:JotaroStarPlatinum=interested.png,Uh, what's "star platinum?"
0-male_removed_accessory=happy.png,I certainly understand the desire to stall with every single one of your accessories.
0-male_removed_accessory=calm.png,Definitely a sensible choice.
0-male_removed_accessory=happy.png,No big deal.
0-male_removed_accessory=calm.png,A reasonable choice.
0-male_removed_accessory=calm.png,A perfectly legal move.
0-male_removed_accessory=calm.png,No reason to rush.
0-male_removed_accessory=calm.png,A trifle, really.
0-male_removed_accessory=interested.png,Um... Why did you wait this long to remove your ~clothing~ anyway?
0-male_removed_accessory=interested.png,I can't say I understand your, um... undress order. Can you explain?
0-male_removed_accessory=flustered.png,Either avoiding losing or avoiding exposing more of yourself, I can see why you'd resort to this.
0-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;jotaro&stage;2&saying;time:,marker:JotaroStopTime=shocked.png,<i>Y-you can stop time?</i> So <i>that's</i> what's been going on!
0-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;ae86&stage;1:=flustered.png,It doesn't even have anything to take of, does it? That just raises further questions as to why it's here...
0-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&layers;2-3:=interested.png,Um... Why did you wait this long to remove your ~clothing~ anyway?
0-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&layers;2-3:=interested.png,I can't say I understand your, um... undress order. Can you explain?

0-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;jotaro&stage;1:=shocked.png,W-what just happened? Where'd your belts go?
0-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;jotaro&stage;2:=shocked.png,Y-your shoes! I didn't even see you take them off!
0-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;jotaro&stage;2&saying;time:,count-role;self&saidmarker;JotaroStarPlatinum2:,marker:JotaroStopTime2=shocked.png,<i>Y-you can stop time?</i> So <i>that's</i> what's been going on!
0-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;kamina&stage;3:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;KaminaIsCool:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=facepalm.png,... Sure... I'm sure you will be serious...
0-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;kamina&stage;1:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;KaminaIsCool:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=interested.png,I-it's just poker. Can you please tone it down some?
0-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;kamina&stage;1:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:187=annoyed.png,Do my words sting? Let them. Do you feel discouraged? I hope so. I've seen too many soldiers throw their lives away playing hero.
0-male_removed_accessory,priority:56,count-role;target&startinglayers;3-4:=happy.png,I guess as long as you don't start pulling threads off to survive, I'll let this slide.
0-male_removed_accessory,priority:56,count-role;target&startinglayers;3-4:=happy.png,Maybe next time you should come a little more prepared?
0-male_removed_accessory,count-exposed&role;target:=interested.png,Um... Why did you wait this long to remove your ~clothing~ anyway?

0-male_removed_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:117=annoyed.png,I'll accept that for now, but I expect better out of you.
0-male_removed_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:117=calm.png,You can only hold out for so long. I know that all too well.
0-male_removed_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:117=annoyed.png,You can't do that forever. Don't prove me wrong.
0-male_removed_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:117=calm.png,Grapes are inevitable in this game, I suppose.
0-male_removed_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,count-role;target&character;ae86&stage;1:,id:199=annoyed.png,You could've at least picked a <i>sexy</i> car model, like a 1958 Cadillac Eldorado.
0-male_removed_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,count-role;target&character;ae86&stage;1:,id:199=enthused.png,This car sucks. You wanna see a sexy vehicle, check out the G5 Odyssey Scylla. They got six beefy Arc Engines on that thing!

0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;korra&stage;0:=interested.png,"Earth bending?" You can't bend the ground... Can you?...
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;3:,id:40=interested.png,A Manatrocity is what happens when you're not careful with using magic on a living creature.
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;rarity_eg&stage;0:=flustered.png,Admittedly it's more from necessity, but fashion is a fun subject, too!
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;syrenne&stage;1:=interested.png,Although I guess "mercenary" implies I ask for pay up front? I don't ask for any payment. I just like helping people.
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;megumin&stage;0:=thinking.png,Come to think of it, I believe he has a hat really similar to the one you're wearing. Funny coincidence!
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nami&stage;0:,id:27=interested.png,Control the weather? That must take a lot of mana to use, huh?
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;meia&stage;0:=interested.png,Does your monocle really mean that much to you, Meia? You can still see fine in your other eye, right?
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;5:=competitive.png,Don't worry, Blake, if anyone judges you, I'll punch them in the face!
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;catria&stage;0:=competitive.png,Don't worry, Catria, if anyone attacks us, <i>I'll</i> deal with them. I certainly don't need weapons to deal with threats!

0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;rinkah&stage;1&saying;cold:=calm.png,I could use some boots like that, myself. I have trouble with the cold.
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;ribbon_girl&stage;0:=calm.png,I see. What about those weird gloves you're wearing? Are they related to your powers too?
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1-3:=interested.png,I wonder what the outcome will be this time?
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1-3:=interested.png,I hope the outcome will be good.
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1-3:=interested.png,How likely is a bad roll?
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1-3:=interested.png,What could possibly go wrong?
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1-3:=interested.png,I'm sure the odds are in your favor, huh?
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;0:=interested.png,If by "get lucky" you mean "get critical hits," then no, I don't get them very often.
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1-3:=embarrassed.png,I'm afraid of what will happen if you roll a 20...
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1-3:=embarrassed.png,Th-the die can't effect anyone but you, right, Vriska? I fear that it might...
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1-3:=embarrassed.png,Th-the die can't effect <i>my</i> clothes, can it?...
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;chiaki&stage;1&saying;debuffs:=happy.png,I'm certain you won't. <i>I</i> can't cast any, at least!
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;chiaki&stage;1&saying;debuffs:=happy.png,You won't have to worry about any debuffs from <i>me</i> at least! All of my debuffs are dealt on-hit, and I won't be hitting you any time soon!
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;mary&stage;0:=happy.png,I'm not really a sandal person, myself. You probably already knew that because I came here in boots, though.
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;lotte&stage;0:=flustered.png,I'm not very good with magic, myself. I can conjure flames and whatnot well enough, but making them into a projectile just doesn't happen.
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;0:=happy.png,In my world, people tend to become a particular type of mage. My friend Timbo is a red mage, for example.
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;3:=happy.png,Is your bag magic at all, Moon? I recently started using magic bag myself, and they're really fantastic.
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;mahiru&stage;0:=happy.png,It looks like one of those focused lanterns, that project light into a beam.
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shamir&stage;0:,id:299=happy.png,I've dabbled in archery a bit myself, but I prefer melee weapons. My sister's pretty good with bows, though.
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;5&saidmarker;pinka_start&notsaidmarker;pinka_end2:=happy.png,No knife accident? No death threat? I think she's turning back to normal!

0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;0&saidmarker;fled:=interested.png,Oh! Uh, is she going to come back?
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;0&saidmarker;fled:=interested.png,Oh! Uh, should we just continue without her?...

0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&layers;3-4:=flustered.png,That's, um... Yeah, I can't complain.
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&layers;3-4:=happy.png,Just remembered you had ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~, huh? Haha.
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;2:=happy.png,Oh, I don't mind at all. Get more comfortable.
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;larachel&stage;1:,id:23=sad.png,Oh, looks like your staff ran out of mana.
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;yuelia&stage;1&sayingmarker;fast_learning:,id:43=enthused.png,Oh, that's pretty cool! Enchanted items are always really neat!
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;ini&stage;0&saidmarker;bracelets:=flustered.png,Oh, well, that's cool too, I guess... So much for recovering lost knowledge...
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;alice_mgq:=embarrassed.png,Oh, well, uh, g-good. Good that you're not out yet.
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;0:=calm.png,Oh, you're a <i>love</i> fairy... But then why's your name "Queue?"
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;1:=flustered.png,Say, you haven't... started any wars, have you? With your assassinations?
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;0:=shocked.png,Shimakaze! Your gloves are on fire!
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;0:=shocked.png,Your gloves! They're on fire!
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;1:=interested.png,So what kind of fairy are you <i>really</i>? Maybe a white magic fairy, hence the hearts on your outfit?
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;ribbon_girl&stage;1:=happy.png,Sounds like you have a fair amount of options. Do you have any more?
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;lyn&stage;0:=interested.png,That must be the name of your sword, huh?
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;croix&stage;1:=interested.png,That's really cool. What are "magitronics," though?
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;0:=happy.png,That's the right way to play this game in my book: keep your modesty for as long as possible!
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;morrigan&stage;1:=interested.png,To be clear, I'm not afraid of bats, but I reserve the right to punch them if they get too close.
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;1:,id:39=interested.png,Um, you're not going to keep transforming when you lose, are you, Akko?
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;marinette&stage;0:=interested.png,Where I come from, ~name~, people don't dress in weird outfits unless it relates to their magic specialization.
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;yuelia&stage;0&sayingmarker;transformation:,id:42=shocked.png,Woah! Y-you're human!
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;1:=interested.png,Wouldn't that require your shoes to be small and cramped?
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;mae&stage;0&sayingmarker;heels:=flustered.png,Yeah, I don't understand heels either. They just seem like more trouble than they're worth.
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;5:=calm.png,Yeah, I guess you could say that.
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;supernova&stage;0:=interested.png,You certainly don't look like you came from the same kind of world as me. What's yours like?
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;2:=annoyed.png,You forgot already? Where's your head at?
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;1:=interested.png,You, uh... had to be <i>told</i> to do that?...
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;1:=interested.png,You had to be <i>told</i> to do that? I thought that was just common sense.
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;1:=shocked.png,Your boots! Where did those holes come from?
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;0:=happy.png,You're an assassin, huh? My sister is a thief. Those classes are adjacent, right?
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;0:,count-role;self&saidmarker;SewingMagic:=happy.png,Oh, you know Sewing Magic too, Vriska? What're the odds that the three of us all would?
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;0:,count-role;self&saidmarker;SewingMagic:=happy.png,Oh, you know Sewing Magic too, Vriska? Gosh, Etsuko's books must be more popular than I thought!
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;hanako&stage;0:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:231=interested.png,An... accident?... How? How does one burn only half of their face in a house fire?
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;hanako&stage;0:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:231=facepalm.png,House fire accidents don't burn people perfectly down the middle of their faces. What is this, a comic book?
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;0:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:201=calm.png,Not that I'm <i>expecting</i> a fight, but you never know, right?
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;misato&stage;0:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:228=happy.png,You must've done some pretty awesome things in the process of achieving that rank. You should share some stories sometime.
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;meia&stage;0:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:196=flustered.png,You're a pirate, huh? I should be arresting you, but <i>technically</i> I'm off the clock, so... I can pretend you're not a pirate.
0-female_removing_accessory,priority:381,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;0:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:235=angry.png,<i>What in blazes are you doing? Transformation magic is illegal!</i>
0-female_removing_accessory,priority:381,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;3:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:241=calm.png,A Manatrocity is what happens when you're not careful with using magic on a living creature. You don't choose to become one, it's just happens.
0-female_removing_accessory,priority:381,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;1:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:238=annoyed.png,So you're just gonna ignore me, huh? Alright, once this game is over, you're coming with me. <i>In cuffs.</i>
0-female_removing_accessory,priority:56,count-role;target&startinglayers;3-4:=flustered.png,Alright, sure. You didn't come here with much, after all...
0-female_removing_accessory,priority:56,count-role;target&startinglayers;3-4:=flustered.png,I... supppose it's only fair we let you count ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~
0-female_removing_accessory,count-exposed&role;target:=flustered.png,Oh, I didn't realize you still had ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~...
0-female_removing_accessory,count-exposed&role;target:=flustered.png,That's, um... Yeah, I can't complain.
0-female_removing_accessory,count-exposed&role;target:=happy.png,Just remembered you had ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~, huh? Haha.
0-female_removing_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:121=annoyed.png,Is that the best you can do?
0-female_removing_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:121=interested.png,That's it?
0-female_removing_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:121=interested.png,Not exactly bold, are you?
0-female_removed_accessory=happy.png,I certainly understand the desire to stall with every single one of your accessories.
0-female_removed_accessory=calm.png,Definitely a sensible choice.
0-female_removed_accessory=happy.png,No big deal.
0-female_removed_accessory=calm.png,A reasonable choice.
0-female_removed_accessory=calm.png,A perfectly legal move.
0-female_removed_accessory=calm.png,No reason to rush.
0-female_removed_accessory=calm.png,A trifle, really.
0-female_removed_accessory=interested.png,That's a nice outfit, I suppose, but why is it missing a sleeve?
0-female_removed_accessory=interested.png,Um... Why did you wait this long to remove your ~clothing~ anyway?
0-female_removed_accessory=interested.png,I can't say I understand your, um... undress order. Can you explain?
0-female_removed_accessory=flustered.png,Either avoiding losing or avoiding exposing more of yourself, I can see why you'd resort to this.
0-female_removed_accessory=interested.png,Well, uh... I think you're actually wearing <i>more</i> clothes now, but I guess if it's up to luck, maybe you'll lose more next time?
0-female_removed_accessory=interested.png,Well, uh... I think you're wearing <i>more</i> clothing now, but since it's luck-based, I guess it's okay?
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;mahiru&stage;1:=flustered.png,Admittedly, I never liked those lanterns. I find it more comforting having a wider radius of light.
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;4&saidmarker;dizzy:=shocked.png,Are you okay, Shimakaze?
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;lyn&stage;2:=flustered.png,D-did anyone else hear a small tune just now...?
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;1:=shocked.png,D-did you do that intentionally? You're oddly calm.
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;1:=interested.png,Do you know any invisibility spells like she does? They must be pretty vital to your skill set.
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;lotte&stage;1:=interested.png,Er, wait, you're counting your wand? But that's not even clothing.
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;chiaki&stage;1&saying;HP:=happy.png,Good! I wouldn't want you dying on us in the middle of a match!
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4b:=interested.png,Gosh, that is quite the small shirt.
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;larachel&stage;2:=annoyed.png,Hey, wait a minute, you weren't trying to attack us with a spell, were you?
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;2:=interested.png,Huh. Yeah. I guess that would do the trick too.
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;lyn&stage;1:=happy.png,I don't name my weapons, personally, but I did once wield an axe that was living, and <i>that</i> had a name!
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;rinkah&stage;2:=flustered.png,I wish I could say the same. I get cold even in Summer...
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;3:=interested.png,If you hate the accessories rule so much, why'd you wear any?... I mean, except for your shoes.
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;mary&stage;1:,id:294=thinking.png,If you made them steel-toed, would they even be sandals anymore? At that point they're just shoes, and wouldn't that defeat the purpose?
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;4:=annoyed.png,Magic is chaotic by nature, and it can overwhelm living things and turn them into mindless, spellcasting monsters. 
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;yuelia&stage;1&sayingmarker;real_name:=happy.png,Nice to meet the real you, Yuelia. Were you a butterfly on purpose? My friend Timbo turned me into a chicken on accident once.
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;mae&stage;1&sayingmarker;nightmarefeet:=interested.png,Nightmare... feet?
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;revy&stage;4:=facepalm.png,No one was trying to touch your things!
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;ini&stage;2:=sad.png,Oh no. That's unfortunate.
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1c:,marker:VriskaDress=happy.png,Oh wow! What a lovely dress!
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1c:,marker:VriskaDress=happy.png,Oh wow! You look very lovely now, Vriska!
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1c:=happy.png,Oh wow! What a grand dress! I honestly wasn't expecting that!
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2b:=happy.png,Oh! What a lovely outfit!
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;lucina&stage;1:,id:25=horny.png,Oh! Y-you're... a princ<i>ess</i>? Th-that's cool too, I guess...
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4a:=interested.png,Oh, did you re-class into a Ladybug Mage?
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4a:=interested.png,Oh. I guess you re-classed into a Ladybug Mage?
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4c:=interested.png,Oh, did you re-class into a Monk?
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4c:=interested.png,Oh. I guess you re-classed into a Monk now?
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3a:=interested.png,Oh, did you re-class into a Ranger?
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3a:=interested.png,Oh. I guess you re-classed into a Ranger now?
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3a:=happy.png,Oh, are you a Ranger now? My sister is a Ranger! Well, technically a Thief, but same thing, basically.
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;ribbon_girl&stage;1:=happy.png,Oh, like magic gauntlets! That's really neat!
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;6&saidmarker;pinka_start&notsaidmarker;pinka_end2:=sad.png,Oh, never mind. I think that was a death threat...
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;2:=enthused.png,Oh, or maybe you're one of four <i>card</i> fairies, and that's why your at this poker game! Can you give me some fortune for this match? Or is that why you didn't want us knowing?
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;meia&stage;1:=happy.png,Oh, so it's just a decoration? It sure looks like it has a purpose.
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3c:=happy.png,Oh, what a nice sweater!
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3c:=happy.png,Ooh, I like that sweater!
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;6:=interested.png,Oh, you were just hiding cat ears? I've had stranger-looking allies than a person with cat ears.
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;6:=interested.png,Um, not to put you down or anything, Blake, but I've fought alongside a walking flower and the Demon Lord of Wounds; cat ears are not shocking to me.
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;6:=interested.png,Uh, sorry but, is that it? Just cat ears? My friend Pernilla is a walking flower. You look normal compared to her.
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;6:=interested.png,Sorry, but after dealing with a formless, mind-bending monster, everyone else looks normal to me.
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;6:=interested.png,Sorry, but I'm not surprised. I guess I got desensitized by the evil, formless monster I defeated not too long ago. He was quite a weird one...
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;6:=interested.png,Sorry, Blake, but I'm not surprised at all. With all the weird creatures I've seen, I've learned to stop questioning peoples' appearance.
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2a:=interested.png,Oh. I guess you re-classed into a Swashbuckler now?
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2a:=interested.png,Oh, did you re-class into a Swashbuckler?
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;supernova&stage;1-4:,id:309=happy.png,Our worlds must be quite different. I've never even heard of "skyscrapers!"
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;syrenne&stage;2:=happy.png,People do tend to reward me, though, which is always nice.
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;ribbon_girl&stage;2:=enthused.png,Really? You'll have to teach me more about them!
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;megumin&stage;1:=flustered.png,Say, y-you don't know any transmogrification spells, do you? My friend turned me into a chicken once, and I'd like to avoid doing that again...
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;rarity_eg&stage;1:=interested.png,So do you make your outfits by hand, or do you know sewing magic too?
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;marinette&stage;1:=interested.png,So, by that logic, you must be a Ladybug Mage, right?
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;1:=calm.png,That's fine. You don't have to stay here if you don't want to.
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;2:=interested.png,This is... really bizarre.
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;1:=interested.png,Uh, I guess so...
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;4:=interested.png,Um... Moon?... Did you hear my question?...
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&layers;2-3:=interested.png,Um... Why did you wait this long to remove your ~clothing~ anyway?
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&layers;2-3:=interested.png,I can't say I understand your, um... undress order. Can you explain?
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&layers;2-3:=flustered.png,Either avoiding losing or avoiding exposing more of yourself, I can see why you'd resort to this.
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;1&saidmarker;fled:=happy.png,Well, at least you came back!
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;1&saidmarker;fled:=happy.png,Don't sweat it, Florina! You came back, at least!
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;alice_mgq:=shocked.png,Whoa! Y-your a Lamia? So it <i>is</i> true that you can disguise yourselves!
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;1:=interested.png,W-wait a minute, love fairies don't exist. Fairies don't control emotions, emotions are as natural as breathing.
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;6:=flustered.png,W-why does that make me nervous...?
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;spooky&stage;1:=angry.png,Yeah, you'd <i>better</i> put the knife down!
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;2:=annoyed.png,You really shouldn't toy with magic like that, especially not transformation spells. We wouldn't want you to turn into a Manatrocity.
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;morrigan&stage;2:=happy.png,You'd have to be pretty low-level for <i>bats</i> to give you trouble, anyhow!
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;2:=flustered.png,You're really, uh... enthusiastic about this game, huh?
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;2:=flustered.png,You, uh... sure are eager to get n-naked, huh?
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1a:,count-role;other&character;link:,marker:VriskaLink=interested.png,Oh, you, uh... copied Link's outfit?
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1a:,count-role;other&character;link:,marker:VriskaLink=interested.png,Oh. You must really like Link's outfit, huh?
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3a:,count-role;other&character;ruby:=interested.png,Oh, you, uh... copied Ruby's outfit?
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3a:,count-role;other&character;ruby:=interested.png,Oh. You must really like Ruby's outfit, huh?
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3b:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=interested.png,Oh, you, uh... copied Zone-tan's outfit?
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3b:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=interested.png,Oh. You must really like Zone-tan's outfit, huh?
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;chun-li:=calm.png,She's right, Chun-Li. The die technically counts... for better or worse.
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2b:,count-role;self&saidmarker;VriskaDress:=happy.png,You still look lovely, Vriska.
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3b:,count-role;self&saidmarker;VriskaLink:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=interested.png,You copied Ruby's outfit now? Why do you keep doing that?
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3b:,count-role;self&saidmarker;VriskaLink:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=interested.png,Why do you keep copying people's outfits?
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3a:,count-role;self&saidmarker;VriskaLink:,count-role;other&character;ruby:=interested.png,You copied Zone-tan's outfit now? Why do you keep doing that?
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3a:,count-role;self&saidmarker;VriskaLink:,count-role;other&character;ruby:=interested.png,Why do you keep copying people's outfits?
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;misato&stage;1:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:229=interested.png,Say, who're you enlisted with? I don't recognize your uniform.
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;hanako&stage;1:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:232=calm.png,Until you give me a more logical answer, I'm going to believe you were attacked.
0-female_removed_accessory,priority:381,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;4:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:242=annoyed.png,Magic is chaotic by nature, and it can overwhelm living things and turn them into mindless, spellcasting monsters. Frankly, you're endangering us.
0-female_removed_accessory,priority:381,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;2:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:239=calm.png,Oh, and if you end up getting yourself turned into a Manatrocity, I won't hesitate to pump you full of lead.
0-female_removed_accessory,priority:381,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;1:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:237=annoyed.png,You look rather young, so I'll give you the benefit of the doubt. Transformation magic is illegal because it's dangerous, so don't do it, you hear me?
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;1:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=interested.png,Anyway, that's nice armor. What's the make?
0-female_removed_accessory,priority:381,count-role;target&character;mae&stage;1&saidmarker;heels:=happy.png,I know, right? The last time I tried wearing heels, I nearly broke my arm when I fell!
0-female_removed_accessory,priority:382,count-role;target&character;nami&stage;3:=flustered.png,You're a pirate, huh...? Sorry, I guess books lead me to expect more scars and stuff.
0-female_removed_accessory,priority:56,count-role;target&startinglayers;2-3:=happy.png,I guess as long as you don't start pulling threads off to survive, I'll let this slide.
0-female_removed_accessory,priority:56,count-role;target&startinglayers;2-3:=happy.png,Maybe next time you should come a little more prepared?
0-female_removed_accessory,count-exposed&role;target:=interested.png,Um... Why did you wait this long to remove your ~clothing~ anyway?
0-female_removed_accessory,count-exposed&role;target:=interested.png,I can't say I understand your, um... undress order. Can you explain?
0-female_removed_accessory,count-exposed&role;target:=flustered.png,Either avoiding losing or avoiding exposing more of yourself, I can see why you'd resort to this.
0-female_removed_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:122=annoyed.png,I'll accept that for now, but I expect better out of you.
0-female_removed_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:122=calm.png,You can only hold out for so long. I know that all too well.
0-female_removed_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:122=annoyed.png,You can't do that forever. Don't prove me wrong.
0-female_removed_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:122=calm.png,Grapes are inevitable in this game, I suppose.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1a=interested.png,Well, uh... I think you're actually wearing <i>more</i> clothes now, but I guess if it's up to luck, maybe you'll lose more next time?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1a=interested.png,Well, uh... I think you're wearing <i>more</i> clothing now, but since it's luck-based, I guess it's okay?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1b=interested.png,Well, uh... I think you're actually wearing <i>more</i> clothes now, but I guess if it's up to luck, maybe you'll lose more next time?

1-male_removing_accessory=flustered.png,Oh, I didn't realize you still had ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~...
1-male_removing_accessory=flustered.png,That's, um... Yeah, I can't complain.
1-male_removing_accessory=happy.png,Just remembered you had ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~, huh? Haha.
1-male_removing_accessory,marker:JotaroStarPlatinum=interested.png,Uh, what's "star platinum?"
1-male_removing_accessory=calm.png,Your ~clothing~? That's fair.
1-male_removing_accessory=calm.png,Well, your ~clothing~ needed to come off eventually anyway.
1-male_removing_accessory=calm.png,The rules do allow your ~clothing~ to count as an item.
1-male_removing_accessory=happy.png,That's fine. It's not like we're racing here.
1-male_removing_accessory=happy.png,Off ~clothing.ifPlural(come|comes)~ your ~clothing~, eh?
1-male_removing_accessory=happy.png,Farewell, ~clothing~.
1-male_removing_accessory=calm.png,Rules are rules, and they allow your ~clothing~ to count.
1-male_removing_accessory=interested.png,Well, the rules say your ~clothing~ ~clothing.ifPlural(count|counts)~, so I guess I do too?
1-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;chazz&stage;0:,id:279=thinking.png,A Duel Disk? But it's not even disk-shaped. And wouldn't it be terribly awkward for another player to play on that with you?
1-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kazuma:=competitive.png,Fair warning, I'm really good at crushing thieves before they make off with my stuff!
1-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;jotaro&stage;1:=flustered.png,I mean, you <i>did</i> agree to do this, Jotaro.
1-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;ae86&stage;0:=interested.png,I mean, you can love whoever you want as long as they can and <i>do</i> consent, but this is like being attracted to your dining table.
1-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&layers;3-4:=flustered.png,Oh, I didn't realize you still had ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~...
1-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&layers;3-4:=flustered.png,That's, um... Yeah, I can't complain.

1-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kamina&stage;0:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:186=angry.png,It takes more than courage to win a fight. It takes planning, critical thinking, and knowing when to back down. Without those skills, you're nothing!
1-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kamina&stage;0:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:186=angry.png,It takes more than being an oxygen theif win a fight. It takes planning, critical thinking, and knowing when to back down. Otherwise, you're nothing!
1-male_removing_accessory,priority:56,count-role;target&startinglayers;3-4:=flustered.png,Alright, sure. You didn't come here with much, after all...
1-male_removing_accessory,priority:56,count-role;target&startinglayers;3-4:=flustered.png,I... supppose it's only fair we let you count ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~

1-male_removing_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:116=interested.png,That's it?
1-male_removing_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:116=interested.png,Not exactly bold, are you?
1-male_removing_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,count-role;target&character;ae86&stage;0:,id:198=interested.png,Oh, it's playing now, is it? Lovely.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetSaying:platinum,marker:JotaroStarPlatinum=interested.png,Uh, what's "star platinum?"
1-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1,targetSaying:platinum,marker:JotaroStarPlatinum=interested.png,Uh, what's "star platinum?"
1-male_removed_accessory=happy.png,I certainly understand the desire to stall with every single one of your accessories.
1-male_removed_accessory=calm.png,Definitely a sensible choice.
1-male_removed_accessory=happy.png,No big deal.
1-male_removed_accessory=calm.png,A reasonable choice.
1-male_removed_accessory=calm.png,A perfectly legal move.
1-male_removed_accessory=calm.png,No reason to rush.
1-male_removed_accessory=calm.png,A trifle, really.
1-male_removed_accessory=interested.png,Um... Why did you wait this long to remove your ~clothing~ anyway?
1-male_removed_accessory=interested.png,I can't say I understand your, um... undress order. Can you explain?
1-male_removed_accessory=flustered.png,Either avoiding losing or avoiding exposing more of yourself, I can see why you'd resort to this.
1-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;jotaro&stage;2&saying;time:,marker:JotaroStopTime=shocked.png,<i>Y-you can stop time?</i> So <i>that's</i> what's been going on!
1-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;ae86&stage;1:=flustered.png,It doesn't even have anything to take of, does it? That just raises further questions as to why it's here...
1-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&layers;2-3:=interested.png,Um... Why did you wait this long to remove your ~clothing~ anyway?
1-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&layers;2-3:=interested.png,I can't say I understand your, um... undress order. Can you explain?

1-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;chazz&stage;1:=flustered.png,Whatever game you play with those sounds needlessly complicated...
1-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;jotaro&stage;1:=shocked.png,W-what just happened? Where'd your belts go?
1-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;jotaro&stage;2:=shocked.png,Y-your shoes! I didn't even see you take them off!

1-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;kamina&stage;1:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;KaminaIsCool:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=interested.png,I-it's just poker. Can you please tone it down some?
1-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;kamina&stage;1:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:187=annoyed.png,Do my words sting? Let them. Do you feel discouraged? I hope so. I've seen too many soldiers throw their lives away playing hero.
1-male_removed_accessory,priority:56,count-role;target&startinglayers;3-4:=happy.png,I guess as long as you don't start pulling threads off to survive, I'll let this slide.
1-male_removed_accessory,priority:56,count-role;target&startinglayers;3-4:=happy.png,Maybe next time you should come a little more prepared?
1-male_removed_accessory,count-exposed&role;target:=interested.png,Um... Why did you wait this long to remove your ~clothing~ anyway?

1-male_removed_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:117=annoyed.png,I'll accept that for now, but I expect better out of you.
1-male_removed_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:117=calm.png,You can only hold out for so long. I know that all too well.
1-male_removed_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:117=annoyed.png,You can't do that forever. Don't prove me wrong.
1-male_removed_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:117=calm.png,Grapes are inevitable in this game, I suppose.
1-male_removed_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,count-role;target&character;ae86&stage;1:,id:199=annoyed.png,You could've at least picked a <i>sexy</i> car model, like a 1958 Cadillac Eldorado.
1-male_removed_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,count-role;target&character;ae86&stage;1:,id:199=enthused.png,This car sucks. You wanna see a sexy vehicle, check out the G5 Odyssey Scylla. They got six beefy Arc Engines on that thing!
1-female_removing_accessory=flustered.png,Oh, I didn't realize you still had ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~...

1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;korra&stage;0:=interested.png,"Earth bending?" How do you bend earth?
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;korra&stage;0:=interested.png,"Earth bending?" You can't bend the ground... Can you?...
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;3:,id:40=interested.png,A Manatrocity is what happens when you're not careful with using magic on a living creature.
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;rarity_eg&stage;0:=flustered.png,Admittedly it's more from necessity, but fashion is a fun subject, too!
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;syrenne&stage;1:=interested.png,Although I guess "mercenary" implies I ask for pay up front? I don't ask for any payment. I just like helping people.
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;megumin&stage;0:=thinking.png,Come to think of it, I believe he has a hat really similar to the one you're wearing. Funny coincidence!
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nami&stage;0:,id:27=interested.png,Control the weather? That must take a lot of mana to use, huh?
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;meia&stage;0:=interested.png,Does your monocle really mean that much to you, Meia? You can still see fine in your other eye, right?
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;5:=competitive.png,Don't worry, Blake, if anyone judges you, I'll punch them in the face!
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;catria&stage;0:=competitive.png,Don't worry, Catria, if anyone attacks us, <i>I'll</i> deal with them. I certainly don't need weapons to deal with threats!
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;spooky&stage;0:=annoyed.png,Hey, wait, you had a knife? You weren't going to hurt anyone, were you?
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;rinkah&stage;1&saying;cold:=calm.png,I could use some boots like that, myself. I have trouble with the cold.
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;ribbon_girl&stage;0:=calm.png,I see. What about those weird gloves you're wearing? Are they related to your powers too?
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1-3:=interested.png,I wonder what the outcome will be this time?
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1-3:=interested.png,I hope the outcome will be good.
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1-3:=interested.png,How likely is a bad roll?
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1-3:=interested.png,What could possibly go wrong?
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1-3:=interested.png,I'm sure the odds are in your favor, huh?
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;0:=interested.png,If by "get lucky" you mean "get critical hits," then no, I don't get them very often.
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1-3:=embarrassed.png,I'm afraid of what will happen if you roll a 20...
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1-3:=embarrassed.png,Th-the die can't effect anyone but you, right, Vriska? I fear that it might...
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1-3:=embarrassed.png,Th-the die can't effect <i>my</i> clothes, can it?...
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;chiaki&stage;1&saying;debuffs:=happy.png,I'm certain you won't. <i>I</i> can't cast any, at least!
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;chiaki&stage;1&saying;debuffs:=happy.png,You won't have to worry about any debuffs from <i>me</i> at least! All of my debuffs are dealt on-hit, and I won't be hitting you any time soon!
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;mary&stage;0:=happy.png,I'm not really a sandal person, myself. You probably already knew that because I came here in boots, though.
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;lotte&stage;0:=flustered.png,I'm not very good with magic, myself. I can conjure flames and whatnot well enough, but making them into a projectile just doesn't happen.
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;0:=happy.png,In my world, people tend to become a particular type of mage. My friend Timbo is a red mage, for example.
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;3:=happy.png,Is your bag magic at all, Moon? I recently started using magic bag myself, and they're really fantastic.
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;mahiru&stage;0:=happy.png,It looks like one of those focused lanterns, that project light into a beam.
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shamir&stage;0:,id:299=happy.png,I've dabbled in archery a bit myself, but I prefer melee weapons. My sister's pretty good with bows, though.
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;5&saidmarker;pinka_start&notsaidmarker;pinka_end2:=happy.png,No knife accident? No death threat? I think she's turning back to normal!
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sayla&stage;0&sayingmarker;sayla_boots_back_later:=interested.png,Of course... I think...
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;0:,id:38=shocked.png,Oh! I didn't realize you knew transformation magic!
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nami&stage;2:,id:28=calm.png,Oh! Looks like you dropped something, Nami.
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;0:,marker:SewingMagic=happy.png,Oh! Sewing magic, huh? Did you study Etsuko's books too?
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;0:,marker:SewingMagic=happy.png,Oh! Sewing magic, huh? I'm a practitioner of it myself.
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;0&saidmarker;fled:=interested.png,Oh! Uh, is she going to come back?
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;0&saidmarker;fled:=interested.png,Oh! Uh, should we just continue without her?...
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&layers;3-4:=flustered.png,Oh, I didn't realize you still had ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~...
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&layers;3-4:=flustered.png,That's, um... Yeah, I can't complain.
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&layers;3-4:=happy.png,Just remembered you had ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~, huh? Haha.
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;2:=happy.png,Oh, I don't mind at all. Get more comfortable.
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;larachel&stage;1:,id:23=sad.png,Oh, looks like your staff ran out of mana.
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;yuelia&stage;1&sayingmarker;fast_learning:,id:43=enthused.png,Oh, that's pretty cool! Enchanted items are always really neat!
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;ini&stage;0&saidmarker;bracelets:=flustered.png,Oh, well, that's cool too, I guess... So much for recovering lost knowledge...
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;alice_mgq:=embarrassed.png,Oh, well, uh, g-good. Good that you're not out yet.
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;0:=calm.png,Oh, you're a <i>love</i> fairy... But then why's your name "Queue?"
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;1:=flustered.png,Say, you haven't... started any wars, have you? With your assassinations?
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;0:=shocked.png,Shimakaze! Your gloves are on fire!
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;0:=shocked.png,Your gloves! They're on fire!
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;1:=interested.png,So what kind of fairy are you <i>really</i>? Maybe a white magic fairy, hence the hearts on your outfit?
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;ribbon_girl&stage;1:=happy.png,Sounds like you have a fair amount of options. Do you have any more?
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;lyn&stage;0:=interested.png,That must be the name of your sword, huh?
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;croix&stage;1:=interested.png,That's really cool. What are "magitronics," though?
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;0:=happy.png,That's the right way to play this game in my book: keep your modesty for as long as possible!
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;morrigan&stage;1:=interested.png,To be clear, I'm not afraid of bats, but I reserve the right to punch them if they get too close.
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;1:,id:39=interested.png,Um, you're not going to keep transforming when you lose, are you, Akko?
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;marinette&stage;0:=interested.png,Where I come from, ~name~, people don't dress in weird outfits unless it relates to their magic specialization.
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;yuelia&stage;0&sayingmarker;transformation:,id:42=shocked.png,Woah! Y-you're human!
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;1:=interested.png,Wouldn't that require your shoes to be small and cramped?
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;mae&stage;0&sayingmarker;heels:=flustered.png,Yeah, I don't understand heels either. They just seem like more trouble than they're worth.
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;5:=calm.png,Yeah, I guess you could say that.
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;supernova&stage;0:=interested.png,You certainly don't look like you came from the same kind of world as me. What's yours like?
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;2:=annoyed.png,You forgot already? Where's your head at?
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;1:=interested.png,You, uh... had to be <i>told</i> to do that?...
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;1:=interested.png,You had to be <i>told</i> to do that? I thought that was just common sense.
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;1:=shocked.png,Your boots! Where did those holes come from?
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;0:=happy.png,You're an assassin, huh? My sister is a thief. Those classes are adjacent, right?
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;0:,count-role;self&saidmarker;SewingMagic:=happy.png,Oh, you know Sewing Magic too, Vriska? What're the odds that the three of us all would?
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;0:,count-role;self&saidmarker;SewingMagic:=happy.png,Oh, you know Sewing Magic too, Vriska? Gosh, Etsuko's books must be more popular than I thought!
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;hanako&stage;0:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:231=interested.png,An... accident?... How? How does one burn only half of their face in a house fire?
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;hanako&stage;0:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:231=facepalm.png,House fire accidents don't burn people perfectly down the middle of their faces. What is this, a comic book?
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;0:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:201=calm.png,Not that I'm <i>expecting</i> a fight, but you never know, right?
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;misato&stage;0:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:228=happy.png,You must've done some pretty awesome things in the process of achieving that rank. You should share some stories sometime.
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;meia&stage;0:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:196=flustered.png,You're a pirate, huh? I should be arresting you, but <i>technically</i> I'm off the clock, so... I can pretend you're not a pirate.

1-female_removing_accessory,priority:381,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;1:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:238=annoyed.png,So you're just gonna ignore me, huh? Alright, once this game is over, you're coming with me. <i>In cuffs.</i>
1-female_removing_accessory,priority:56,count-role;target&startinglayers;3-4:=flustered.png,Alright, sure. You didn't come here with much, after all...
1-female_removing_accessory,priority:56,count-role;target&startinglayers;3-4:=flustered.png,I... supppose it's only fair we let you count ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~

1-female_removing_accessory,count-exposed&role;target:=happy.png,Just remembered you had ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~, huh? Haha.
1-female_removing_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:121=annoyed.png,Is that the best you can do?
1-female_removing_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:121=interested.png,That's it?
1-female_removing_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:121=interested.png,Not exactly bold, are you?
1-female_removed_accessory=happy.png,I certainly understand the desire to stall with every single one of your accessories.
1-female_removed_accessory=calm.png,Definitely a sensible choice.
1-female_removed_accessory=happy.png,No big deal.
1-female_removed_accessory=calm.png,A reasonable choice.
1-female_removed_accessory=calm.png,A perfectly legal move.
1-female_removed_accessory=calm.png,No reason to rush.
1-female_removed_accessory=calm.png,A trifle, really.
1-female_removed_accessory=interested.png,That's a nice outfit, I suppose, but why is it missing a sleeve?
1-female_removed_accessory=interested.png,Um... Why did you wait this long to remove your ~clothing~ anyway?
1-female_removed_accessory=interested.png,I can't say I understand your, um... undress order. Can you explain?
1-female_removed_accessory=flustered.png,Either avoiding losing or avoiding exposing more of yourself, I can see why you'd resort to this.
1-female_removed_accessory=interested.png,Well, uh... I think you're actually wearing <i>more</i> clothes now, but I guess if it's up to luck, maybe you'll lose more next time?
1-female_removed_accessory=interested.png,Well, uh... I think you're wearing <i>more</i> clothing now, but since it's luck-based, I guess it's okay?
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;mahiru&stage;1:=flustered.png,Admittedly, I never liked those lanterns. I find it more comforting having a wider radius of light.
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;4&saidmarker;dizzy:=shocked.png,Are you okay, Shimakaze?
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;lyn&stage;2:=flustered.png,D-did anyone else hear a small tune just now...?
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;1:=shocked.png,D-did you do that intentionally? You're oddly calm.
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;1:=interested.png,Do you know any invisibility spells like she does? They must be pretty vital to your skill set.
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;lotte&stage;1:=interested.png,Er, wait, you're counting your wand? But that's not even clothing.
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;chiaki&stage;1&saying;HP:=happy.png,Good! I wouldn't want you dying on us in the middle of a match!
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4b:=interested.png,Gosh, that is quite the small shirt.
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;larachel&stage;2:=annoyed.png,Hey, wait a minute, you weren't trying to attack us with a spell, were you?
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;2:=interested.png,Huh. Yeah. I guess that would do the trick too.
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;lyn&stage;1:=happy.png,I don't name my weapons, personally, but I did once wield an axe that was living, and <i>that</i> had a name!
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;rinkah&stage;2:=flustered.png,I wish I could say the same. I get cold even in Summer...
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;3:=interested.png,If you hate the accessories rule so much, why'd you wear any?... I mean, except for your shoes.
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;mary&stage;1:,id:294=thinking.png,If you made them steel-toed, would they even be sandals anymore? At that point they're just shoes, and wouldn't that defeat the purpose?
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;4:=annoyed.png,Magic is chaotic by nature, and it can overwhelm living things and turn them into mindless, spellcasting monsters. 
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;yuelia&stage;1&sayingmarker;real_name:=happy.png,Nice to meet the real you, Yuelia. Were you a butterfly on purpose? My friend Timbo turned me into a chicken on accident once.
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;mae&stage;1&sayingmarker;nightmarefeet:=interested.png,Nightmare... feet?
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;revy&stage;4:=facepalm.png,No one was trying to touch your things!
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;ini&stage;2:=sad.png,Oh no. That's unfortunate.
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1c:,marker:VriskaDress=happy.png,Oh wow! What a lovely dress!
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1c:,marker:VriskaDress=happy.png,Oh wow! You look very lovely now, Vriska!
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1c:=happy.png,Oh wow! What a grand dress! I honestly wasn't expecting that!
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2b:=happy.png,Oh! What a lovely outfit!
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;lucina&stage;1:,id:25=horny.png,Oh! Y-you're... a princ<i>ess</i>? Th-that's cool too, I guess...
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4a:=interested.png,Oh, did you re-class into a Ladybug Mage?
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4a:=interested.png,Oh. I guess you re-classed into a Ladybug Mage?
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4c:=interested.png,Oh, did you re-class into a Monk?
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4c:=interested.png,Oh. I guess you re-classed into a Monk now?
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3a:=interested.png,Oh, did you re-class into a Ranger?
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3a:=interested.png,Oh. I guess you re-classed into a Ranger now?
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3a:=happy.png,Oh, are you a Ranger now? My sister is a Ranger! Well, technically a Thief, but same thing, basically.
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;ribbon_girl&stage;1:=happy.png,Oh, like magic gauntlets! That's really neat!
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;6&saidmarker;pinka_start&notsaidmarker;pinka_end2:=sad.png,Oh, never mind. I think that was a death threat...
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;2:=enthused.png,Oh, or maybe you're one of four <i>card</i> fairies, and that's why your at this poker game! Can you give me some fortune for this match? Or is that why you didn't want us knowing?
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;meia&stage;1:=happy.png,Oh, so it's just a decoration? It sure looks like it has a purpose.
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3c:=happy.png,Oh, what a nice sweater!
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3c:=happy.png,Ooh, I like that sweater!
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;6:=interested.png,Oh, you were just hiding cat ears? I've had stranger-looking allies than a person with cat ears.
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;6:=interested.png,Um, not to put you down or anything, Blake, but I've fought alongside a walking flower and the Demon Lord of Wounds; cat ears are not shocking to me.
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;6:=interested.png,Uh, sorry but, is that it? Just cat ears? My friend Pernilla is a walking flower. You look normal compared to her.
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;6:=interested.png,Sorry, but after dealing with a formless, mind-bending monster, everyone else looks normal to me.
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;6:=interested.png,Sorry, but I'm not surprised. I guess I got desensitized by the evil, formless monster I defeated not too long ago. He was quite a weird one...
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;6:=interested.png,Sorry, Blake, but I'm not surprised at all. With all the weird creatures I've seen, I've learned to stop questioning peoples' appearance.
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2a:=interested.png,Oh. I guess you re-classed into a Swashbuckler now?
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2a:=interested.png,Oh, did you re-class into a Swashbuckler?
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;supernova&stage;1-4:,id:309=happy.png,Our worlds must be quite different. I've never even heard of "skyscrapers!"
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;syrenne&stage;2:=happy.png,People do tend to reward me, though, which is always nice.
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;ribbon_girl&stage;2:=enthused.png,Really? You'll have to teach me more about them!
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;megumin&stage;1:=flustered.png,Say, y-you don't know any transmogrification spells, do you? My friend turned me into a chicken once, and I'd like to avoid doing that again...
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;rarity_eg&stage;1:=interested.png,So do you make your outfits by hand, or do you know sewing magic too?
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;marinette&stage;1:=interested.png,So, by that logic, you must be a Ladybug Mage, right?
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;1:=calm.png,That's fine. You don't have to stay here if you don't want to.
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;2:=interested.png,This is... really bizarre.
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;1:=interested.png,Uh, I guess so...
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;4:=interested.png,Um... Moon?... Did you hear my question?...
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&layers;2-3:=interested.png,Um... Why did you wait this long to remove your ~clothing~ anyway?
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&layers;2-3:=interested.png,I can't say I understand your, um... undress order. Can you explain?
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&layers;2-3:=flustered.png,Either avoiding losing or avoiding exposing more of yourself, I can see why you'd resort to this.
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;1&saidmarker;fled:=happy.png,Well, at least you came back!
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;1&saidmarker;fled:=happy.png,Don't sweat it, Florina! You came back, at least!
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;alice_mgq:=shocked.png,Whoa! Y-your a Lamia? So it <i>is</i> true that you can disguise yourselves!
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;1:=interested.png,W-wait a minute, love fairies don't exist. Fairies don't control emotions, emotions are as natural as breathing.
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;6:=flustered.png,W-why does that make me nervous...?
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;spooky&stage;1:=angry.png,Yeah, you'd <i>better</i> put the knife down!
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;2:=annoyed.png,You really shouldn't toy with magic like that, especially not transformation spells. We wouldn't want you to turn into a Manatrocity.
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;morrigan&stage;2:=happy.png,You'd have to be pretty low-level for <i>bats</i> to give you trouble, anyhow!
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;2:=flustered.png,You're really, uh... enthusiastic about this game, huh?
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;2:=flustered.png,You, uh... sure are eager to get n-naked, huh?
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1a:,count-role;other&character;link:,marker:VriskaLink=interested.png,Oh, you, uh... copied Link's outfit?
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1a:,count-role;other&character;link:,marker:VriskaLink=interested.png,Oh. You must really like Link's outfit, huh?
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3a:,count-role;other&character;ruby:=interested.png,Oh, you, uh... copied Ruby's outfit?
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3a:,count-role;other&character;ruby:=interested.png,Oh. You must really like Ruby's outfit, huh?
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3b:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=interested.png,Oh, you, uh... copied Zone-tan's outfit?
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3b:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=interested.png,Oh. You must really like Zone-tan's outfit, huh?
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;chun-li:=calm.png,She's right, Chun-Li. The die technically counts... for better or worse.
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2b:,count-role;self&saidmarker;VriskaDress:=happy.png,You still look lovely, Vriska.
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3b:,count-role;self&saidmarker;VriskaLink:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=interested.png,You copied Ruby's outfit now? Why do you keep doing that?
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3b:,count-role;self&saidmarker;VriskaLink:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=interested.png,Why do you keep copying people's outfits?
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3a:,count-role;self&saidmarker;VriskaLink:,count-role;other&character;ruby:=interested.png,You copied Zone-tan's outfit now? Why do you keep doing that?
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3a:,count-role;self&saidmarker;VriskaLink:,count-role;other&character;ruby:=interested.png,Why do you keep copying people's outfits?
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;misato&stage;1:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:229=interested.png,Say, who're you enlisted with? I don't recognize your uniform.
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;hanako&stage;1:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:232=calm.png,Until you give me a more logical answer, I'm going to believe you were attacked.
1-female_removed_accessory,priority:381,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;4:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:242=annoyed.png,Magic is chaotic by nature, and it can overwhelm living things and turn them into mindless, spellcasting monsters. Frankly, you're endangering us.
1-female_removed_accessory,priority:381,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;2:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:239=calm.png,Oh, and if you end up getting yourself turned into a Manatrocity, I won't hesitate to pump you full of lead.
1-female_removed_accessory,priority:381,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;1:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:237=annoyed.png,You look rather young, so I'll give you the benefit of the doubt. Transformation magic is illegal because it's dangerous, so don't do it, you hear me?
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;1:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=interested.png,Anyway, that's nice armor. What's the make?
1-female_removed_accessory,priority:381,count-role;target&character;mae&stage;1&saidmarker;heels:=happy.png,I know, right? The last time I tried wearing heels, I nearly broke my arm when I fell!
1-female_removed_accessory,priority:382,count-role;target&character;nami&stage;3:=flustered.png,You're a pirate, huh...? Sorry, I guess books lead me to expect more scars and stuff.
1-female_removed_accessory,priority:56,count-role;target&startinglayers;2-3:=happy.png,I guess as long as you don't start pulling threads off to survive, I'll let this slide.
1-female_removed_accessory,priority:56,count-role;target&startinglayers;2-3:=happy.png,Maybe next time you should come a little more prepared?
1-female_removed_accessory,count-exposed&role;target:=interested.png,Um... Why did you wait this long to remove your ~clothing~ anyway?
1-female_removed_accessory,count-exposed&role;target:=interested.png,I can't say I understand your, um... undress order. Can you explain?
1-female_removed_accessory,count-exposed&role;target:=flustered.png,Either avoiding losing or avoiding exposing more of yourself, I can see why you'd resort to this.
1-female_removed_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:122=annoyed.png,I'll accept that for now, but I expect better out of you.
1-female_removed_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:122=calm.png,You can only hold out for so long. I know that all too well.
1-female_removed_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:122=annoyed.png,You can't do that forever. Don't prove me wrong.
1-female_removed_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:122=calm.png,Grapes are inevitable in this game, I suppose.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1a=interested.png,Well, uh... I think you're actually wearing <i>more</i> clothes now, but I guess if it's up to luck, maybe you'll lose more next time?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1a=interested.png,Well, uh... I think you're wearing <i>more</i> clothing now, but since it's luck-based, I guess it's okay?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1b=interested.png,Well, uh... I think you're actually wearing <i>more</i> clothes now, but I guess if it's up to luck, maybe you'll lose more next time?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1b=interested.png,Well, uh... I think you're wearing <i>more</i> clothing now, but since it's luck-based, I guess it's okay?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2c,targetNotSaidMarker:1c=interested.png,That's a nice outfit, I suppose, but why is it missing a sleeve?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3b=interested.png,That's a nice outfit, I suppose, but why is it missing a sleeve?

2-male_removing_accessory=flustered.png,That's, um... Yeah, I can't complain.

2-male_removing_accessory,marker:JotaroStarPlatinum=interested.png,Uh, what's "star platinum?"
2-male_removing_accessory=calm.png,Your ~clothing~? That's fair.
2-male_removing_accessory=calm.png,Well, your ~clothing~ needed to come off eventually anyway.
2-male_removing_accessory=calm.png,The rules do allow your ~clothing~ to count as an item.
2-male_removing_accessory=happy.png,That's fine. It's not like we're racing here.
2-male_removing_accessory=happy.png,Off ~clothing.ifPlural(come|comes)~ your ~clothing~, eh?
2-male_removing_accessory=happy.png,Farewell, ~clothing~.
2-male_removing_accessory=calm.png,Rules are rules, and they allow your ~clothing~ to count.
2-male_removing_accessory=interested.png,Well, the rules say your ~clothing~ ~clothing.ifPlural(count|counts)~, so I guess I do too?
2-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;chazz&stage;0:,id:279=thinking.png,A Duel Disk? But it's not even disk-shaped. And wouldn't it be terribly awkward for another player to play on that with you?
2-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kazuma:=competitive.png,Fair warning, I'm really good at crushing thieves before they make off with my stuff!
2-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;jotaro&stage;1:=flustered.png,I mean, you <i>did</i> agree to do this, Jotaro.
2-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;ae86&stage;0:=interested.png,I mean, you can love whoever you want as long as they can and <i>do</i> consent, but this is like being attracted to your dining table.

2-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kamina&stage;0:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:186=angry.png,It takes more than courage to win a fight. It takes planning, critical thinking, and knowing when to back down. Without those skills, you're nothing!
2-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kamina&stage;0:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:186=angry.png,It takes more than being an oxygen theif win a fight. It takes planning, critical thinking, and knowing when to back down. Otherwise, you're nothing!
2-male_removing_accessory,priority:56,count-role;target&startinglayers;3-4:=flustered.png,Alright, sure. You didn't come here with much, after all...

2-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&layers;2-3:=interested.png,Um... Why did you wait this long to remove your ~clothing~ anyway?
2-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&layers;2-3:=interested.png,I can't say I understand your, um... undress order. Can you explain?
2-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&layers;2-3:=flustered.png,Either avoiding losing or avoiding exposing more of yourself, I can see why you'd resort to this.
2-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;chazz&stage;1:=flustered.png,Whatever game you play with those sounds needlessly complicated...
2-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;jotaro&stage;1:=shocked.png,W-what just happened? Where'd your belts go?
2-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;jotaro&stage;2:=shocked.png,Y-your shoes! I didn't even see you take them off!
2-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;jotaro&stage;2&saying;time:,count-role;self&saidmarker;JotaroStarPlatinum2:,marker:JotaroStopTime2=shocked.png,<i>Y-you can stop time?</i> So <i>that's</i> what's been going on!
2-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;kamina&stage;3:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;KaminaIsCool:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=facepalm.png,... Sure... I'm sure you will be serious...
2-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;kamina&stage;1:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;KaminaIsCool:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=interested.png,I-it's just poker. Can you please tone it down some?
2-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;kamina&stage;1:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:187=annoyed.png,Do my words sting? Let them. Do you feel discouraged? I hope so. I've seen too many soldiers throw their lives away playing hero.
2-male_removed_accessory,priority:56,count-role;target&startinglayers;3-4:=happy.png,I guess as long as you don't start pulling threads off to survive, I'll let this slide.
2-male_removed_accessory,priority:56,count-role;target&startinglayers;3-4:=happy.png,Maybe next time you should come a little more prepared?
2-male_removed_accessory,count-exposed&role;target:=interested.png,Um... Why did you wait this long to remove your ~clothing~ anyway?
2-male_removed_accessory,count-exposed&role;target:=interested.png,I can't say I understand your, um... undress order. Can you explain?
2-male_removed_accessory,count-exposed&role;target:=flustered.png,Either avoiding losing or avoiding exposing more of yourself, I can see why you'd resort to this.
2-male_removed_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:117=annoyed.png,I'll accept that for now, but I expect better out of you.
2-male_removed_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:117=calm.png,You can only hold out for so long. I know that all too well.
2-male_removed_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:117=annoyed.png,You can't do that forever. Don't prove me wrong.
2-male_removed_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:117=calm.png,Grapes are inevitable in this game, I suppose.
2-male_removed_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,count-role;target&character;ae86&stage;1:,id:199=annoyed.png,You could've at least picked a <i>sexy</i> car model, like a 1958 Cadillac Eldorado.
2-male_removed_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,count-role;target&character;ae86&stage;1:,id:199=enthused.png,This car sucks. You wanna see a sexy vehicle, check out the G5 Odyssey Scylla. They got six beefy Arc Engines on that thing!
2-female_removing_accessory=flustered.png,Oh, I didn't realize you still had ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~...
2-female_removing_accessory=flustered.png,That's, um... Yeah, I can't complain.
2-female_removing_accessory=happy.png,Just remembered you had ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~, huh? Haha.
2-female_removing_accessory=calm.png,Your ~clothing~? That's fair.
2-female_removing_accessory=calm.png,Well, your ~clothing~ needed to come off eventually anyway.
2-female_removing_accessory=calm.png,The rules do allow your ~clothing~ to count as an item.
2-female_removing_accessory=happy.png,That's fine. It's not like we're racing here.
2-female_removing_accessory=happy.png,Off ~clothing.ifPlural(come|comes)~ your ~clothing~, eh?
2-female_removing_accessory=happy.png,Farewell, ~clothing~.
2-female_removing_accessory=calm.png,Rules are rules, and they allow your ~clothing~ to count.
2-female_removing_accessory=interested.png,Well, the rules say your ~clothing~ ~clothing.ifPlural(count|counts)~, so I guess I do too?
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;korra&stage;0:=interested.png,"Earth bending?" How do you bend earth?
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;korra&stage;0:=interested.png,"Earth bending?" You can't bend the ground... Can you?...
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;3:,id:40=interested.png,A Manatrocity is what happens when you're not careful with using magic on a living creature.
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;rarity_eg&stage;0:=flustered.png,Admittedly it's more from necessity, but fashion is a fun subject, too!
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;syrenne&stage;1:=interested.png,Although I guess "mercenary" implies I ask for pay up front? I don't ask for any payment. I just like helping people.
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;megumin&stage;0:=thinking.png,Come to think of it, I believe he has a hat really similar to the one you're wearing. Funny coincidence!
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nami&stage;0:,id:27=interested.png,Control the weather? That must take a lot of mana to use, huh?
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;meia&stage;0:=interested.png,Does your monocle really mean that much to you, Meia? You can still see fine in your other eye, right?
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;5:=competitive.png,Don't worry, Blake, if anyone judges you, I'll punch them in the face!
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;catria&stage;0:=competitive.png,Don't worry, Catria, if anyone attacks us, <i>I'll</i> deal with them. I certainly don't need weapons to deal with threats!
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;spooky&stage;0:=annoyed.png,Hey, wait, you had a knife? You weren't going to hurt anyone, were you?
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;rinkah&stage;1&saying;cold:=calm.png,I could use some boots like that, myself. I have trouble with the cold.
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;ribbon_girl&stage;0:=calm.png,I see. What about those weird gloves you're wearing? Are they related to your powers too?
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1-3:=interested.png,I wonder what the outcome will be this time?
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1-3:=interested.png,I hope the outcome will be good.
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1-3:=interested.png,How likely is a bad roll?
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1-3:=interested.png,What could possibly go wrong?
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1-3:=interested.png,I'm sure the odds are in your favor, huh?
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;0:=interested.png,If by "get lucky" you mean "get critical hits," then no, I don't get them very often.
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1-3:=embarrassed.png,I'm afraid of what will happen if you roll a 20...
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1-3:=embarrassed.png,Th-the die can't effect anyone but you, right, Vriska? I fear that it might...
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1-3:=embarrassed.png,Th-the die can't effect <i>my</i> clothes, can it?...
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;chiaki&stage;1&saying;debuffs:=happy.png,I'm certain you won't. <i>I</i> can't cast any, at least!
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;chiaki&stage;1&saying;debuffs:=happy.png,You won't have to worry about any debuffs from <i>me</i> at least! All of my debuffs are dealt on-hit, and I won't be hitting you any time soon!
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;mary&stage;0:=happy.png,I'm not really a sandal person, myself. You probably already knew that because I came here in boots, though.
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;lotte&stage;0:=flustered.png,I'm not very good with magic, myself. I can conjure flames and whatnot well enough, but making them into a projectile just doesn't happen.
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;0:=happy.png,In my world, people tend to become a particular type of mage. My friend Timbo is a red mage, for example.
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;3:=happy.png,Is your bag magic at all, Moon? I recently started using magic bag myself, and they're really fantastic.
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;mahiru&stage;0:=happy.png,It looks like one of those focused lanterns, that project light into a beam.
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shamir&stage;0:,id:299=happy.png,I've dabbled in archery a bit myself, but I prefer melee weapons. My sister's pretty good with bows, though.
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;5&saidmarker;pinka_start&notsaidmarker;pinka_end2:=happy.png,No knife accident? No death threat? I think she's turning back to normal!
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sayla&stage;0&sayingmarker;sayla_boots_back_later:=interested.png,Of course... I think...
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;0:,id:38=shocked.png,Oh! I didn't realize you knew transformation magic!
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nami&stage;2:,id:28=calm.png,Oh! Looks like you dropped something, Nami.
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;0:,marker:SewingMagic=happy.png,Oh! Sewing magic, huh? Did you study Etsuko's books too?
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;0:,marker:SewingMagic=happy.png,Oh! Sewing magic, huh? I'm a practitioner of it myself.
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;0&saidmarker;fled:=interested.png,Oh! Uh, is she going to come back?
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;0&saidmarker;fled:=interested.png,Oh! Uh, should we just continue without her?...
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&layers;3-4:=flustered.png,Oh, I didn't realize you still had ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~...
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&layers;3-4:=flustered.png,That's, um... Yeah, I can't complain.
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&layers;3-4:=happy.png,Just remembered you had ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~, huh? Haha.
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;2:=happy.png,Oh, I don't mind at all. Get more comfortable.
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;larachel&stage;1:,id:23=sad.png,Oh, looks like your staff ran out of mana.
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;yuelia&stage;1&sayingmarker;fast_learning:,id:43=enthused.png,Oh, that's pretty cool! Enchanted items are always really neat!
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;ini&stage;0&saidmarker;bracelets:=flustered.png,Oh, well, that's cool too, I guess... So much for recovering lost knowledge...
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;alice_mgq:=embarrassed.png,Oh, well, uh, g-good. Good that you're not out yet.
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;0:=calm.png,Oh, you're a <i>love</i> fairy... But then why's your name "Queue?"
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;1:=flustered.png,Say, you haven't... started any wars, have you? With your assassinations?
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;0:=shocked.png,Shimakaze! Your gloves are on fire!
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;0:=shocked.png,Your gloves! They're on fire!
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;1:=interested.png,So what kind of fairy are you <i>really</i>? Maybe a white magic fairy, hence the hearts on your outfit?
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;ribbon_girl&stage;1:=happy.png,Sounds like you have a fair amount of options. Do you have any more?
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;lyn&stage;0:=interested.png,That must be the name of your sword, huh?
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;croix&stage;1:=interested.png,That's really cool. What are "magitronics," though?
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;0:=happy.png,That's the right way to play this game in my book: keep your modesty for as long as possible!
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;morrigan&stage;1:=interested.png,To be clear, I'm not afraid of bats, but I reserve the right to punch them if they get too close.
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;1:,id:39=interested.png,Um, you're not going to keep transforming when you lose, are you, Akko?
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;marinette&stage;0:=interested.png,Where I come from, ~name~, people don't dress in weird outfits unless it relates to their magic specialization.
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;yuelia&stage;0&sayingmarker;transformation:,id:42=shocked.png,Woah! Y-you're human!
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;1:=interested.png,Wouldn't that require your shoes to be small and cramped?
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;mae&stage;0&sayingmarker;heels:=flustered.png,Yeah, I don't understand heels either. They just seem like more trouble than they're worth.
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;5:=calm.png,Yeah, I guess you could say that.
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;supernova&stage;0:=interested.png,You certainly don't look like you came from the same kind of world as me. What's yours like?
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;2:=annoyed.png,You forgot already? Where's your head at?
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;1:=interested.png,You, uh... had to be <i>told</i> to do that?...
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;1:=interested.png,You had to be <i>told</i> to do that? I thought that was just common sense.
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;1:=shocked.png,Your boots! Where did those holes come from?
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;0:=happy.png,You're an assassin, huh? My sister is a thief. Those classes are adjacent, right?
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;0:,count-role;self&saidmarker;SewingMagic:=happy.png,Oh, you know Sewing Magic too, Vriska? What're the odds that the three of us all would?
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;0:,count-role;self&saidmarker;SewingMagic:=happy.png,Oh, you know Sewing Magic too, Vriska? Gosh, Etsuko's books must be more popular than I thought!
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;hanako&stage;0:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:231=interested.png,An... accident?... How? How does one burn only half of their face in a house fire?
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;hanako&stage;0:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:231=facepalm.png,House fire accidents don't burn people perfectly down the middle of their faces. What is this, a comic book?
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;0:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:201=calm.png,Not that I'm <i>expecting</i> a fight, but you never know, right?
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;misato&stage;0:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:228=happy.png,You must've done some pretty awesome things in the process of achieving that rank. You should share some stories sometime.
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;meia&stage;0:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:196=flustered.png,You're a pirate, huh? I should be arresting you, but <i>technically</i> I'm off the clock, so... I can pretend you're not a pirate.
2-female_removing_accessory,priority:381,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;0:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:235=angry.png,<i>What in blazes are you doing? Transformation magic is illegal!</i>
2-female_removing_accessory,priority:381,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;3:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:241=calm.png,A Manatrocity is what happens when you're not careful with using magic on a living creature. You don't choose to become one, it's just happens.
2-female_removing_accessory,priority:381,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;1:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:238=annoyed.png,So you're just gonna ignore me, huh? Alright, once this game is over, you're coming with me. <i>In cuffs.</i>
2-female_removing_accessory,priority:56,count-role;target&startinglayers;3-4:=flustered.png,Alright, sure. You didn't come here with much, after all...
2-female_removing_accessory,priority:56,count-role;target&startinglayers;3-4:=flustered.png,I... supppose it's only fair we let you count ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~
2-female_removing_accessory,count-exposed&role;target:=flustered.png,Oh, I didn't realize you still had ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~...
2-female_removing_accessory,count-exposed&role;target:=flustered.png,That's, um... Yeah, I can't complain.
2-female_removing_accessory,count-exposed&role;target:=happy.png,Just remembered you had ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~, huh? Haha.
2-female_removing_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:121=annoyed.png,Is that the best you can do?
2-female_removing_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:121=interested.png,That's it?
2-female_removing_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:121=interested.png,Not exactly bold, are you?
2-female_removed_accessory=happy.png,I certainly understand the desire to stall with every single one of your accessories.
2-female_removed_accessory=calm.png,Definitely a sensible choice.
2-female_removed_accessory=happy.png,No big deal.
2-female_removed_accessory=calm.png,A reasonable choice.
2-female_removed_accessory=calm.png,A perfectly legal move.
2-female_removed_accessory=calm.png,No reason to rush.
2-female_removed_accessory=calm.png,A trifle, really.
2-female_removed_accessory=interested.png,That's a nice outfit, I suppose, but why is it missing a sleeve?
2-female_removed_accessory=interested.png,Um... Why did you wait this long to remove your ~clothing~ anyway?
2-female_removed_accessory=interested.png,I can't say I understand your, um... undress order. Can you explain?
2-female_removed_accessory=flustered.png,Either avoiding losing or avoiding exposing more of yourself, I can see why you'd resort to this.
2-female_removed_accessory=interested.png,Well, uh... I think you're actually wearing <i>more</i> clothes now, but I guess if it's up to luck, maybe you'll lose more next time?
2-female_removed_accessory=interested.png,Well, uh... I think you're wearing <i>more</i> clothing now, but since it's luck-based, I guess it's okay?
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;mahiru&stage;1:=flustered.png,Admittedly, I never liked those lanterns. I find it more comforting having a wider radius of light.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;4&saidmarker;dizzy:=shocked.png,Are you okay, Shimakaze?
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;lyn&stage;2:=flustered.png,D-did anyone else hear a small tune just now...?
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;1:=shocked.png,D-did you do that intentionally? You're oddly calm.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;1:=interested.png,Do you know any invisibility spells like she does? They must be pretty vital to your skill set.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;lotte&stage;1:=interested.png,Er, wait, you're counting your wand? But that's not even clothing.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;chiaki&stage;1&saying;HP:=happy.png,Good! I wouldn't want you dying on us in the middle of a match!
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4b:=interested.png,Gosh, that is quite the small shirt.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;larachel&stage;2:=annoyed.png,Hey, wait a minute, you weren't trying to attack us with a spell, were you?
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;2:=interested.png,Huh. Yeah. I guess that would do the trick too.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;lyn&stage;1:=happy.png,I don't name my weapons, personally, but I did once wield an axe that was living, and <i>that</i> had a name!
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;rinkah&stage;2:=flustered.png,I wish I could say the same. I get cold even in Summer...
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;3:=interested.png,If you hate the accessories rule so much, why'd you wear any?... I mean, except for your shoes.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;mary&stage;1:,id:294=thinking.png,If you made them steel-toed, would they even be sandals anymore? At that point they're just shoes, and wouldn't that defeat the purpose?
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;4:=annoyed.png,Magic is chaotic by nature, and it can overwhelm living things and turn them into mindless, spellcasting monsters. 
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;yuelia&stage;1&sayingmarker;real_name:=happy.png,Nice to meet the real you, Yuelia. Were you a butterfly on purpose? My friend Timbo turned me into a chicken on accident once.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;mae&stage;1&sayingmarker;nightmarefeet:=interested.png,Nightmare... feet?
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;revy&stage;4:=facepalm.png,No one was trying to touch your things!
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;ini&stage;2:=sad.png,Oh no. That's unfortunate.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1c:,marker:VriskaDress=happy.png,Oh wow! What a lovely dress!
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1c:,marker:VriskaDress=happy.png,Oh wow! You look very lovely now, Vriska!
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1c:=happy.png,Oh wow! What a grand dress! I honestly wasn't expecting that!
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2b:=happy.png,Oh! What a lovely outfit!
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;lucina&stage;1:,id:25=horny.png,Oh! Y-you're... a princ<i>ess</i>? Th-that's cool too, I guess...
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4a:=interested.png,Oh, did you re-class into a Ladybug Mage?
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4a:=interested.png,Oh. I guess you re-classed into a Ladybug Mage?
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4c:=interested.png,Oh, did you re-class into a Monk?
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4c:=interested.png,Oh. I guess you re-classed into a Monk now?
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3a:=interested.png,Oh, did you re-class into a Ranger?
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3a:=interested.png,Oh. I guess you re-classed into a Ranger now?
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3a:=happy.png,Oh, are you a Ranger now? My sister is a Ranger! Well, technically a Thief, but same thing, basically.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;ribbon_girl&stage;1:=happy.png,Oh, like magic gauntlets! That's really neat!
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;6&saidmarker;pinka_start&notsaidmarker;pinka_end2:=sad.png,Oh, never mind. I think that was a death threat...
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;2:=enthused.png,Oh, or maybe you're one of four <i>card</i> fairies, and that's why your at this poker game! Can you give me some fortune for this match? Or is that why you didn't want us knowing?
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;meia&stage;1:=happy.png,Oh, so it's just a decoration? It sure looks like it has a purpose.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3c:=happy.png,Oh, what a nice sweater!
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3c:=happy.png,Ooh, I like that sweater!
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;6:=interested.png,Oh, you were just hiding cat ears? I've had stranger-looking allies than a person with cat ears.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;6:=interested.png,Um, not to put you down or anything, Blake, but I've fought alongside a walking flower and the Demon Lord of Wounds; cat ears are not shocking to me.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;6:=interested.png,Uh, sorry but, is that it? Just cat ears? My friend Pernilla is a walking flower. You look normal compared to her.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;6:=interested.png,Sorry, but after dealing with a formless, mind-bending monster, everyone else looks normal to me.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;6:=interested.png,Sorry, but I'm not surprised. I guess I got desensitized by the evil, formless monster I defeated not too long ago. He was quite a weird one...
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;6:=interested.png,Sorry, Blake, but I'm not surprised at all. With all the weird creatures I've seen, I've learned to stop questioning peoples' appearance.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2a:=interested.png,Oh. I guess you re-classed into a Swashbuckler now?
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2a:=interested.png,Oh, did you re-class into a Swashbuckler?
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;supernova&stage;1-4:,id:309=happy.png,Our worlds must be quite different. I've never even heard of "skyscrapers!"
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;syrenne&stage;2:=happy.png,People do tend to reward me, though, which is always nice.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;ribbon_girl&stage;2:=enthused.png,Really? You'll have to teach me more about them!
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;megumin&stage;1:=flustered.png,Say, y-you don't know any transmogrification spells, do you? My friend turned me into a chicken once, and I'd like to avoid doing that again...
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;rarity_eg&stage;1:=interested.png,So do you make your outfits by hand, or do you know sewing magic too?
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;marinette&stage;1:=interested.png,So, by that logic, you must be a Ladybug Mage, right?
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;1:=calm.png,That's fine. You don't have to stay here if you don't want to.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;2:=interested.png,This is... really bizarre.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;1:=interested.png,Uh, I guess so...
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;4:=interested.png,Um... Moon?... Did you hear my question?...
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&layers;2-3:=interested.png,Um... Why did you wait this long to remove your ~clothing~ anyway?
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&layers;2-3:=interested.png,I can't say I understand your, um... undress order. Can you explain?
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&layers;2-3:=flustered.png,Either avoiding losing or avoiding exposing more of yourself, I can see why you'd resort to this.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;1&saidmarker;fled:=happy.png,Well, at least you came back!
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;1&saidmarker;fled:=happy.png,Don't sweat it, Florina! You came back, at least!
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;alice_mgq:=shocked.png,Whoa! Y-your a Lamia? So it <i>is</i> true that you can disguise yourselves!
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;1:=interested.png,W-wait a minute, love fairies don't exist. Fairies don't control emotions, emotions are as natural as breathing.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;6:=flustered.png,W-why does that make me nervous...?
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;spooky&stage;1:=angry.png,Yeah, you'd <i>better</i> put the knife down!
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;2:=annoyed.png,You really shouldn't toy with magic like that, especially not transformation spells. We wouldn't want you to turn into a Manatrocity.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;morrigan&stage;2:=happy.png,You'd have to be pretty low-level for <i>bats</i> to give you trouble, anyhow!
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;2:=flustered.png,You're really, uh... enthusiastic about this game, huh?
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;2:=flustered.png,You, uh... sure are eager to get n-naked, huh?
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1a:,count-role;other&character;link:,marker:VriskaLink=interested.png,Oh, you, uh... copied Link's outfit?
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1a:,count-role;other&character;link:,marker:VriskaLink=interested.png,Oh. You must really like Link's outfit, huh?
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3a:,count-role;other&character;ruby:=interested.png,Oh, you, uh... copied Ruby's outfit?
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3a:,count-role;other&character;ruby:=interested.png,Oh. You must really like Ruby's outfit, huh?
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3b:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=interested.png,Oh, you, uh... copied Zone-tan's outfit?
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3b:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=interested.png,Oh. You must really like Zone-tan's outfit, huh?
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;chun-li:=calm.png,She's right, Chun-Li. The die technically counts... for better or worse.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2b:,count-role;self&saidmarker;VriskaDress:=happy.png,You still look lovely, Vriska.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3b:,count-role;self&saidmarker;VriskaLink:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=interested.png,You copied Ruby's outfit now? Why do you keep doing that?
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3b:,count-role;self&saidmarker;VriskaLink:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=interested.png,Why do you keep copying people's outfits?

2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;misato&stage;1:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:229=interested.png,Say, who're you enlisted with? I don't recognize your uniform.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;hanako&stage;1:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:232=calm.png,Until you give me a more logical answer, I'm going to believe you were attacked.
2-female_removed_accessory,priority:381,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;4:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:242=annoyed.png,Magic is chaotic by nature, and it can overwhelm living things and turn them into mindless, spellcasting monsters. Frankly, you're endangering us.
2-female_removed_accessory,priority:381,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;2:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:239=calm.png,Oh, and if you end up getting yourself turned into a Manatrocity, I won't hesitate to pump you full of lead.
2-female_removed_accessory,priority:381,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;1:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:237=annoyed.png,You look rather young, so I'll give you the benefit of the doubt. Transformation magic is illegal because it's dangerous, so don't do it, you hear me?
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;1:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=interested.png,Anyway, that's nice armor. What's the make?
2-female_removed_accessory,priority:381,count-role;target&character;mae&stage;1&saidmarker;heels:=happy.png,I know, right? The last time I tried wearing heels, I nearly broke my arm when I fell!
2-female_removed_accessory,priority:382,count-role;target&character;nami&stage;3:=flustered.png,You're a pirate, huh...? Sorry, I guess books lead me to expect more scars and stuff.
2-female_removed_accessory,priority:56,count-role;target&startinglayers;2-3:=happy.png,I guess as long as you don't start pulling threads off to survive, I'll let this slide.
2-female_removed_accessory,priority:56,count-role;target&startinglayers;2-3:=happy.png,Maybe next time you should come a little more prepared?
2-female_removed_accessory,count-exposed&role;target:=interested.png,Um... Why did you wait this long to remove your ~clothing~ anyway?
2-female_removed_accessory,count-exposed&role;target:=interested.png,I can't say I understand your, um... undress order. Can you explain?
2-female_removed_accessory,count-exposed&role;target:=flustered.png,Either avoiding losing or avoiding exposing more of yourself, I can see why you'd resort to this.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:122=annoyed.png,I'll accept that for now, but I expect better out of you.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:122=calm.png,You can only hold out for so long. I know that all too well.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:122=annoyed.png,You can't do that forever. Don't prove me wrong.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:122=calm.png,Grapes are inevitable in this game, I suppose.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1a=interested.png,Well, uh... I think you're actually wearing <i>more</i> clothes now, but I guess if it's up to luck, maybe you'll lose more next time?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1a=interested.png,Well, uh... I think you're wearing <i>more</i> clothing now, but since it's luck-based, I guess it's okay?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1b=interested.png,Well, uh... I think you're actually wearing <i>more</i> clothes now, but I guess if it's up to luck, maybe you'll lose more next time?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1b=interested.png,Well, uh... I think you're wearing <i>more</i> clothing now, but since it's luck-based, I guess it's okay?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2c,targetNotSaidMarker:1c=interested.png,That's a nice outfit, I suppose, but why is it missing a sleeve?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3b=interested.png,That's a nice outfit, I suppose, but why is it missing a sleeve?

3-male_removing_accessory=flustered.png,That's, um... Yeah, I can't complain.
3-male_removing_accessory=happy.png,Just remembered you had ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~, huh? Haha.
3-male_removing_accessory,marker:JotaroStarPlatinum=interested.png,Uh, what's "star platinum?"
3-male_removing_accessory=calm.png,Your ~clothing~? That's fair.
3-male_removing_accessory=calm.png,Well, your ~clothing~ needed to come off eventually anyway.
3-male_removing_accessory=calm.png,The rules do allow your ~clothing~ to count as an item.
3-male_removing_accessory=happy.png,That's fine. It's not like we're racing here.
3-male_removing_accessory=happy.png,Off ~clothing.ifPlural(come|comes)~ your ~clothing~, eh?
3-male_removing_accessory=happy.png,Farewell, ~clothing~.
3-male_removing_accessory=calm.png,Rules are rules, and they allow your ~clothing~ to count.
3-male_removing_accessory=interested.png,Well, the rules say your ~clothing~ ~clothing.ifPlural(count|counts)~, so I guess I do too?
3-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;chazz&stage;0:,id:279=thinking.png,A Duel Disk? But it's not even disk-shaped. And wouldn't it be terribly awkward for another player to play on that with you?
3-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kazuma:=competitive.png,Fair warning, I'm really good at crushing thieves before they make off with my stuff!
3-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;jotaro&stage;1:=flustered.png,I mean, you <i>did</i> agree to do this, Jotaro.
3-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;ae86&stage;0:=interested.png,I mean, you can love whoever you want as long as they can and <i>do</i> consent, but this is like being attracted to your dining table.

3-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kamina&stage;0:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:186=angry.png,It takes more than courage to win a fight. It takes planning, critical thinking, and knowing when to back down. Without those skills, you're nothing!
3-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kamina&stage;0:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:186=angry.png,It takes more than being an oxygen theif win a fight. It takes planning, critical thinking, and knowing when to back down. Otherwise, you're nothing!
3-male_removing_accessory,priority:56,count-role;target&startinglayers;3-4:=flustered.png,Alright, sure. You didn't come here with much, after all...
3-male_removing_accessory,priority:56,count-role;target&startinglayers;3-4:=flustered.png,I... supppose it's only fair we let you count ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~

3-male_removing_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:116=annoyed.png,Is that the best you can do?
3-male_removing_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:116=interested.png,That's it?
3-male_removing_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:116=interested.png,Not exactly bold, are you?
3-male_removing_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,count-role;target&character;ae86&stage;0:,id:198=interested.png,Oh, it's playing now, is it? Lovely.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetSaying:platinum,marker:JotaroStarPlatinum=interested.png,Uh, what's "star platinum?"
3-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1,targetSaying:platinum,marker:JotaroStarPlatinum=interested.png,Uh, what's "star platinum?"
3-male_removed_accessory=happy.png,I certainly understand the desire to stall with every single one of your accessories.
3-male_removed_accessory=calm.png,Definitely a sensible choice.
3-male_removed_accessory=happy.png,No big deal.
3-male_removed_accessory=calm.png,A reasonable choice.
3-male_removed_accessory=calm.png,A perfectly legal move.
3-male_removed_accessory=calm.png,No reason to rush.
3-male_removed_accessory=calm.png,A trifle, really.
3-male_removed_accessory=interested.png,Um... Why did you wait this long to remove your ~clothing~ anyway?

3-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;kamina&stage;1:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:187=annoyed.png,Do my words sting? Let them. Do you feel discouraged? I hope so. I've seen too many soldiers throw their lives away playing hero.

3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;syrenne&stage;1:=interested.png,Although I guess "mercenary" implies I ask for pay up front? I don't ask for any payment. I just like helping people.

3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;spooky&stage;0:=annoyed.png,Hey, wait, you had a knife? You weren't going to hurt anyone, were you?
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;rinkah&stage;1&saying;cold:=calm.png,I could use some boots like that, myself. I have trouble with the cold.
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;ribbon_girl&stage;0:=calm.png,I see. What about those weird gloves you're wearing? Are they related to your powers too?
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1-3:=interested.png,I wonder what the outcome will be this time?
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1-3:=interested.png,I hope the outcome will be good.
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1-3:=interested.png,How likely is a bad roll?
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1-3:=interested.png,What could possibly go wrong?
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1-3:=interested.png,I'm sure the odds are in your favor, huh?
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;0:=interested.png,If by "get lucky" you mean "get critical hits," then no, I don't get them very often.
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1-3:=embarrassed.png,I'm afraid of what will happen if you roll a 20...
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1-3:=embarrassed.png,Th-the die can't effect anyone but you, right, Vriska? I fear that it might...
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1-3:=embarrassed.png,Th-the die can't effect <i>my</i> clothes, can it?...
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;chiaki&stage;1&saying;debuffs:=happy.png,I'm certain you won't. <i>I</i> can't cast any, at least!
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;chiaki&stage;1&saying;debuffs:=happy.png,You won't have to worry about any debuffs from <i>me</i> at least! All of my debuffs are dealt on-hit, and I won't be hitting you any time soon!
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;mary&stage;0:=happy.png,I'm not really a sandal person, myself. You probably already knew that because I came here in boots, though.
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;lotte&stage;0:=flustered.png,I'm not very good with magic, myself. I can conjure flames and whatnot well enough, but making them into a projectile just doesn't happen.
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;0:=happy.png,In my world, people tend to become a particular type of mage. My friend Timbo is a red mage, for example.
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;3:=happy.png,Is your bag magic at all, Moon? I recently started using magic bag myself, and they're really fantastic.
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;mahiru&stage;0:=happy.png,It looks like one of those focused lanterns, that project light into a beam.
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shamir&stage;0:,id:299=happy.png,I've dabbled in archery a bit myself, but I prefer melee weapons. My sister's pretty good with bows, though.
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;5&saidmarker;pinka_start&notsaidmarker;pinka_end2:=happy.png,No knife accident? No death threat? I think she's turning back to normal!
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sayla&stage;0&sayingmarker;sayla_boots_back_later:=interested.png,Of course... I think...
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;0:,id:38=shocked.png,Oh! I didn't realize you knew transformation magic!
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nami&stage;2:,id:28=calm.png,Oh! Looks like you dropped something, Nami.
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;0:,marker:SewingMagic=happy.png,Oh! Sewing magic, huh? Did you study Etsuko's books too?
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;0:,marker:SewingMagic=happy.png,Oh! Sewing magic, huh? I'm a practitioner of it myself.
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;0&saidmarker;fled:=interested.png,Oh! Uh, is she going to come back?
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;0&saidmarker;fled:=interested.png,Oh! Uh, should we just continue without her?...
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&layers;3-4:=flustered.png,Oh, I didn't realize you still had ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~...
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&layers;3-4:=flustered.png,That's, um... Yeah, I can't complain.
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&layers;3-4:=happy.png,Just remembered you had ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~, huh? Haha.
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;2:=happy.png,Oh, I don't mind at all. Get more comfortable.
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;larachel&stage;1:,id:23=sad.png,Oh, looks like your staff ran out of mana.
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;yuelia&stage;1&sayingmarker;fast_learning:,id:43=enthused.png,Oh, that's pretty cool! Enchanted items are always really neat!
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;ini&stage;0&saidmarker;bracelets:=flustered.png,Oh, well, that's cool too, I guess... So much for recovering lost knowledge...
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;alice_mgq:=embarrassed.png,Oh, well, uh, g-good. Good that you're not out yet.
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;0:=calm.png,Oh, you're a <i>love</i> fairy... But then why's your name "Queue?"
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;1:=flustered.png,Say, you haven't... started any wars, have you? With your assassinations?
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;0:=shocked.png,Shimakaze! Your gloves are on fire!
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;0:=shocked.png,Your gloves! They're on fire!
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;1:=interested.png,So what kind of fairy are you <i>really</i>? Maybe a white magic fairy, hence the hearts on your outfit?
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;ribbon_girl&stage;1:=happy.png,Sounds like you have a fair amount of options. Do you have any more?
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;lyn&stage;0:=interested.png,That must be the name of your sword, huh?
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;croix&stage;1:=interested.png,That's really cool. What are "magitronics," though?
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;0:=happy.png,That's the right way to play this game in my book: keep your modesty for as long as possible!
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;morrigan&stage;1:=interested.png,To be clear, I'm not afraid of bats, but I reserve the right to punch them if they get too close.
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;1:,id:39=interested.png,Um, you're not going to keep transforming when you lose, are you, Akko?
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;marinette&stage;0:=interested.png,Where I come from, ~name~, people don't dress in weird outfits unless it relates to their magic specialization.
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;yuelia&stage;0&sayingmarker;transformation:,id:42=shocked.png,Woah! Y-you're human!
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;1:=interested.png,Wouldn't that require your shoes to be small and cramped?
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;mae&stage;0&sayingmarker;heels:=flustered.png,Yeah, I don't understand heels either. They just seem like more trouble than they're worth.
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;5:=calm.png,Yeah, I guess you could say that.
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;supernova&stage;0:=interested.png,You certainly don't look like you came from the same kind of world as me. What's yours like?
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;2:=annoyed.png,You forgot already? Where's your head at?
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;1:=interested.png,You, uh... had to be <i>told</i> to do that?...
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;1:=interested.png,You had to be <i>told</i> to do that? I thought that was just common sense.
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;1:=shocked.png,Your boots! Where did those holes come from?
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;0:=happy.png,You're an assassin, huh? My sister is a thief. Those classes are adjacent, right?
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;0:,count-role;self&saidmarker;SewingMagic:=happy.png,Oh, you know Sewing Magic too, Vriska? What're the odds that the three of us all would?
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;0:,count-role;self&saidmarker;SewingMagic:=happy.png,Oh, you know Sewing Magic too, Vriska? Gosh, Etsuko's books must be more popular than I thought!
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;hanako&stage;0:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:231=interested.png,An... accident?... How? How does one burn only half of their face in a house fire?
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;hanako&stage;0:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:231=facepalm.png,House fire accidents don't burn people perfectly down the middle of their faces. What is this, a comic book?
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;0:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:201=calm.png,Not that I'm <i>expecting</i> a fight, but you never know, right?
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;misato&stage;0:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:228=happy.png,You must've done some pretty awesome things in the process of achieving that rank. You should share some stories sometime.
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;meia&stage;0:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:196=flustered.png,You're a pirate, huh? I should be arresting you, but <i>technically</i> I'm off the clock, so... I can pretend you're not a pirate.
3-female_removing_accessory,priority:381,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;0:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:235=angry.png,<i>What in blazes are you doing? Transformation magic is illegal!</i>
3-female_removing_accessory,priority:381,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;3:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:241=calm.png,A Manatrocity is what happens when you're not careful with using magic on a living creature. You don't choose to become one, it's just happens.
3-female_removing_accessory,priority:381,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;1:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:238=annoyed.png,So you're just gonna ignore me, huh? Alright, once this game is over, you're coming with me. <i>In cuffs.</i>
3-female_removing_accessory,priority:56,count-role;target&startinglayers;3-4:=flustered.png,Alright, sure. You didn't come here with much, after all...
3-female_removing_accessory,priority:56,count-role;target&startinglayers;3-4:=flustered.png,I... supppose it's only fair we let you count ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~
3-female_removing_accessory,count-exposed&role;target:=flustered.png,Oh, I didn't realize you still had ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~...
3-female_removing_accessory,count-exposed&role;target:=flustered.png,That's, um... Yeah, I can't complain.
3-female_removing_accessory,count-exposed&role;target:=happy.png,Just remembered you had ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~, huh? Haha.
3-female_removing_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:121=annoyed.png,Is that the best you can do?
3-female_removing_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:121=interested.png,That's it?
3-female_removing_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:121=interested.png,Not exactly bold, are you?
3-female_removed_accessory=happy.png,I certainly understand the desire to stall with every single one of your accessories.
3-female_removed_accessory=calm.png,Definitely a sensible choice.
3-female_removed_accessory=happy.png,No big deal.
3-female_removed_accessory=calm.png,A reasonable choice.
3-female_removed_accessory=calm.png,A perfectly legal move.
3-female_removed_accessory=calm.png,No reason to rush.
3-female_removed_accessory=calm.png,A trifle, really.
3-female_removed_accessory=interested.png,That's a nice outfit, I suppose, but why is it missing a sleeve?
3-female_removed_accessory=interested.png,Um... Why did you wait this long to remove your ~clothing~ anyway?
3-female_removed_accessory=interested.png,I can't say I understand your, um... undress order. Can you explain?
3-female_removed_accessory=flustered.png,Either avoiding losing or avoiding exposing more of yourself, I can see why you'd resort to this.
3-female_removed_accessory=interested.png,Well, uh... I think you're actually wearing <i>more</i> clothes now, but I guess if it's up to luck, maybe you'll lose more next time?
3-female_removed_accessory=interested.png,Well, uh... I think you're wearing <i>more</i> clothing now, but since it's luck-based, I guess it's okay?
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;mahiru&stage;1:=flustered.png,Admittedly, I never liked those lanterns. I find it more comforting having a wider radius of light.
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;4&saidmarker;dizzy:=shocked.png,Are you okay, Shimakaze?
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;lyn&stage;2:=flustered.png,D-did anyone else hear a small tune just now...?
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;1:=shocked.png,D-did you do that intentionally? You're oddly calm.
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;1:=interested.png,Do you know any invisibility spells like she does? They must be pretty vital to your skill set.
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;lotte&stage;1:=interested.png,Er, wait, you're counting your wand? But that's not even clothing.
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;chiaki&stage;1&saying;HP:=happy.png,Good! I wouldn't want you dying on us in the middle of a match!
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4b:=interested.png,Gosh, that is quite the small shirt.
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;larachel&stage;2:=annoyed.png,Hey, wait a minute, you weren't trying to attack us with a spell, were you?
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;2:=interested.png,Huh. Yeah. I guess that would do the trick too.
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;lyn&stage;1:=happy.png,I don't name my weapons, personally, but I did once wield an axe that was living, and <i>that</i> had a name!
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;rinkah&stage;2:=flustered.png,I wish I could say the same. I get cold even in Summer...
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;3:=interested.png,If you hate the accessories rule so much, why'd you wear any?... I mean, except for your shoes.
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;mary&stage;1:,id:294=thinking.png,If you made them steel-toed, would they even be sandals anymore? At that point they're just shoes, and wouldn't that defeat the purpose?
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;4:=annoyed.png,Magic is chaotic by nature, and it can overwhelm living things and turn them into mindless, spellcasting monsters. 
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;yuelia&stage;1&sayingmarker;real_name:=happy.png,Nice to meet the real you, Yuelia. Were you a butterfly on purpose? My friend Timbo turned me into a chicken on accident once.
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;mae&stage;1&sayingmarker;nightmarefeet:=interested.png,Nightmare... feet?
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;revy&stage;4:=facepalm.png,No one was trying to touch your things!
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;ini&stage;2:=sad.png,Oh no. That's unfortunate.
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1c:,marker:VriskaDress=happy.png,Oh wow! What a lovely dress!
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1c:,marker:VriskaDress=happy.png,Oh wow! You look very lovely now, Vriska!
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1c:=happy.png,Oh wow! What a grand dress! I honestly wasn't expecting that!
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2b:=happy.png,Oh! What a lovely outfit!
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;lucina&stage;1:,id:25=horny.png,Oh! Y-you're... a princ<i>ess</i>? Th-that's cool too, I guess...
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4a:=interested.png,Oh, did you re-class into a Ladybug Mage?
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4a:=interested.png,Oh. I guess you re-classed into a Ladybug Mage?
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4c:=interested.png,Oh, did you re-class into a Monk?
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4c:=interested.png,Oh. I guess you re-classed into a Monk now?
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3a:=interested.png,Oh, did you re-class into a Ranger?
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3a:=interested.png,Oh. I guess you re-classed into a Ranger now?
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3a:=happy.png,Oh, are you a Ranger now? My sister is a Ranger! Well, technically a Thief, but same thing, basically.
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;ribbon_girl&stage;1:=happy.png,Oh, like magic gauntlets! That's really neat!
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;6&saidmarker;pinka_start&notsaidmarker;pinka_end2:=sad.png,Oh, never mind. I think that was a death threat...
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;2:=enthused.png,Oh, or maybe you're one of four <i>card</i> fairies, and that's why your at this poker game! Can you give me some fortune for this match? Or is that why you didn't want us knowing?
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;meia&stage;1:=happy.png,Oh, so it's just a decoration? It sure looks like it has a purpose.
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3c:=happy.png,Oh, what a nice sweater!
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3c:=happy.png,Ooh, I like that sweater!
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;6:=interested.png,Oh, you were just hiding cat ears? I've had stranger-looking allies than a person with cat ears.
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;6:=interested.png,Um, not to put you down or anything, Blake, but I've fought alongside a walking flower and the Demon Lord of Wounds; cat ears are not shocking to me.
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;6:=interested.png,Uh, sorry but, is that it? Just cat ears? My friend Pernilla is a walking flower. You look normal compared to her.
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;6:=interested.png,Sorry, but after dealing with a formless, mind-bending monster, everyone else looks normal to me.
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;6:=interested.png,Sorry, but I'm not surprised. I guess I got desensitized by the evil, formless monster I defeated not too long ago. He was quite a weird one...
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;6:=interested.png,Sorry, Blake, but I'm not surprised at all. With all the weird creatures I've seen, I've learned to stop questioning peoples' appearance.
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2a:=interested.png,Oh. I guess you re-classed into a Swashbuckler now?
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2a:=interested.png,Oh, did you re-class into a Swashbuckler?
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;supernova&stage;1-4:,id:309=happy.png,Our worlds must be quite different. I've never even heard of "skyscrapers!"
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;syrenne&stage;2:=happy.png,People do tend to reward me, though, which is always nice.
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;ribbon_girl&stage;2:=enthused.png,Really? You'll have to teach me more about them!
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;megumin&stage;1:=flustered.png,Say, y-you don't know any transmogrification spells, do you? My friend turned me into a chicken once, and I'd like to avoid doing that again...
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;rarity_eg&stage;1:=interested.png,So do you make your outfits by hand, or do you know sewing magic too?
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;marinette&stage;1:=interested.png,So, by that logic, you must be a Ladybug Mage, right?
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;1:=calm.png,That's fine. You don't have to stay here if you don't want to.
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;2:=interested.png,This is... really bizarre.
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;1:=interested.png,Uh, I guess so...
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;4:=interested.png,Um... Moon?... Did you hear my question?...
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&layers;2-3:=interested.png,Um... Why did you wait this long to remove your ~clothing~ anyway?
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&layers;2-3:=interested.png,I can't say I understand your, um... undress order. Can you explain?
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&layers;2-3:=flustered.png,Either avoiding losing or avoiding exposing more of yourself, I can see why you'd resort to this.
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;1&saidmarker;fled:=happy.png,Well, at least you came back!
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;1&saidmarker;fled:=happy.png,Don't sweat it, Florina! You came back, at least!
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;alice_mgq:=shocked.png,Whoa! Y-your a Lamia? So it <i>is</i> true that you can disguise yourselves!
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;1:=interested.png,W-wait a minute, love fairies don't exist. Fairies don't control emotions, emotions are as natural as breathing.
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;6:=flustered.png,W-why does that make me nervous...?
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;spooky&stage;1:=angry.png,Yeah, you'd <i>better</i> put the knife down!
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;2:=annoyed.png,You really shouldn't toy with magic like that, especially not transformation spells. We wouldn't want you to turn into a Manatrocity.
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;morrigan&stage;2:=happy.png,You'd have to be pretty low-level for <i>bats</i> to give you trouble, anyhow!
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;2:=flustered.png,You're really, uh... enthusiastic about this game, huh?
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;2:=flustered.png,You, uh... sure are eager to get n-naked, huh?
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1a:,count-role;other&character;link:,marker:VriskaLink=interested.png,Oh, you, uh... copied Link's outfit?

3-female_removed_accessory,priority:381,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;4:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:242=annoyed.png,Magic is chaotic by nature, and it can overwhelm living things and turn them into mindless, spellcasting monsters. Frankly, you're endangering us.

3-female_removed_accessory,count-exposed&role;target:=flustered.png,Either avoiding losing or avoiding exposing more of yourself, I can see why you'd resort to this.
3-female_removed_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:122=annoyed.png,I'll accept that for now, but I expect better out of you.
3-female_removed_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:122=calm.png,You can only hold out for so long. I know that all too well.

4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;syrenne&stage;1:=interested.png,Although I guess "mercenary" implies I ask for pay up front? I don't ask for any payment. I just like helping people.

4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;1:=interested.png,So what kind of fairy are you <i>really</i>? Maybe a white magic fairy, hence the hearts on your outfit?
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;ribbon_girl&stage;1:=happy.png,Sounds like you have a fair amount of options. Do you have any more?
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;lyn&stage;0:=interested.png,That must be the name of your sword, huh?
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;croix&stage;1:=interested.png,That's really cool. What are "magitronics," though?
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;0:=happy.png,That's the right way to play this game in my book: keep your modesty for as long as possible!
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;morrigan&stage;1:=interested.png,To be clear, I'm not afraid of bats, but I reserve the right to punch them if they get too close.
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;5:=flustered.png,Uh... Y-yeah, I guess I can say it's been fun...
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;1:,id:39=interested.png,Um, you're not going to keep transforming when you lose, are you, Akko?
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;alice_mgq:=annoyed.png,Well, whatever it is, it'd better be worth stalling for.
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;marinette&stage;0:=interested.png,Where I come from, ~name~, people don't dress in weird outfits unless it relates to their magic specialization.
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;yuelia&stage;0&sayingmarker;transformation:,id:42=shocked.png,Woah! Y-you're human!
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;1:=interested.png,Wouldn't that require your shoes to be small and cramped?
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;mae&stage;0&sayingmarker;heels:=flustered.png,Yeah, I don't understand heels either. They just seem like more trouble than they're worth.
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;supernova&stage;0:=interested.png,You certainly don't look like you came from the same kind of world as me. What's yours like?
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;2:=annoyed.png,You forgot already? Where's your head at?
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;1:=interested.png,You, uh... had to be <i>told</i> to do that?...
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;1:=interested.png,You had to be <i>told</i> to do that? I thought that was just common sense.
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;1:=shocked.png,Your boots! Where did those holes come from?
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;0:=happy.png,You're an assassin, huh? My sister is a thief. Those classes are adjacent, right?
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&layers;3-4:=interested.png,Y-you still have ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~? Er, why?
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&layers;3-4:=calm.png,I can't say I understand why you kept ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~ for as long as you did...
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&layers;3-4:=flustered.png,I would've thought you'd have taken ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~ off before you... became exposed...
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;0:,count-role;self&saidmarker;SewingMagic:=happy.png,Oh, you know Sewing Magic too, Vriska? What're the odds that the three of us all would?
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;0:,count-role;self&saidmarker;SewingMagic:=happy.png,Oh, you know Sewing Magic too, Vriska? Gosh, Etsuko's books must be more popular than I thought!
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;hanako&stage;0:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:231=interested.png,An... accident?... How? How does one burn only half of their face in a house fire?
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;hanako&stage;0:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:231=facepalm.png,House fire accidents don't burn people perfectly down the middle of their faces. What is this, a comic book?
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;0:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:201=calm.png,Not that I'm <i>expecting</i> a fight, but you never know, right?
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;misato&stage;0:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:228=happy.png,You must've done some pretty awesome things in the process of achieving that rank. You should share some stories sometime.
4-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;meia&stage;0:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:196=flustered.png,You're a pirate, huh? I should be arresting you, but <i>technically</i> I'm off the clock, so... I can pretend you're not a pirate.
4-female_removing_accessory,priority:381,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;0:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:235=angry.png,<i>What in blazes are you doing? Transformation magic is illegal!</i>
4-female_removing_accessory,priority:381,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;3:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:241=calm.png,A Manatrocity is what happens when you're not careful with using magic on a living creature. You don't choose to become one, it's just happens.
4-female_removing_accessory,priority:381,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;1:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:238=annoyed.png,So you're just gonna ignore me, huh? Alright, once this game is over, you're coming with me. <i>In cuffs.</i>
4-female_removing_accessory,priority:56,count-role;target&startinglayers;3-4:=flustered.png,Alright, sure. You didn't come here with much, after all...
4-female_removing_accessory,priority:56,count-role;target&startinglayers;3-4:=flustered.png,I... supppose it's only fair we let you count ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~
4-female_removing_accessory,count-exposed&role;target:=interested.png,Y-you still have ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~? Er, why?
4-female_removing_accessory,count-exposed&role;target:=calm.png,I can't say I understand why you kept ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~ for as long as you did...
4-female_removing_accessory,count-exposed&role;target:=flustered.png,I would've thought you'd have taken ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~ off before you... became exposed...
4-female_removing_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:120=facepalm.png,You're kidding, right?
4-female_removing_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:120=facepalm.png,Such insubordination...
4-female_removing_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:120=interested.png,Not feeling very bold now, eh?
4-female_removing_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:120=annoyed.png,I think you need to check your azimuth there, ~name~.
4-female_removed_accessory=annoyed.png,In case you haven't noticed, I only have two items left right now!
4-female_removed_accessory=facepalm.png,I'm not going to argue the rules, but I'm not happy about them, either!
4-female_removed_accessory=annoyed.png,You'd better hope I don't end up losing the next hand!
4-female_removed_accessory=angry.png,I swear, if I lose because of your accessories, you're going to pay!
4-female_removed_accessory=angry.png,I'm <i>genuinely</i> upset about that!
4-female_removed_accessory=interested.png,That's a nice outfit, I suppose, but why is it missing a sleeve?
4-female_removed_accessory=flustered.png,Well, I can't say I wouldn't have done the same thing...
4-female_removed_accessory=flustered.png,I-I'm going to let that slide, since you're... you know...
4-female_removed_accessory=flustered.png,I guess I can't really complain, because you're... you know...
4-female_removed_accessory,one-shot-id:2=flustered.png,Well, I can't say I wouldn't have done the same thing... Or maybe I can, because I would've taken ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~ off before anything else.
4-female_removed_accessory=interested.png,Well, uh... I think you're actually wearing <i>more</i> clothes now, but I guess if it's up to luck, maybe you'll lose more next time?
4-female_removed_accessory=interested.png,Well, uh... I think you're wearing <i>more</i> clothing now, but since it's luck-based, I guess it's okay?
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;spooky&stage;1:=angry.png,A-are you going to count that? That's barely fair!
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;mahiru&stage;1:=flustered.png,Admittedly, I never liked those lanterns. I find it more comforting having a wider radius of light.
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;4&saidmarker;dizzy:=shocked.png,Are you okay, Shimakaze?
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;lyn&stage;2:=flustered.png,D-did anyone else hear a small tune just now...?
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;1:=shocked.png,D-did you do that intentionally? You're oddly calm.
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;1:=interested.png,Do you know any invisibility spells like she does? They must be pretty vital to your skill set.
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;lotte&stage;1:=interested.png,Er, wait, you're counting your wand? But that's not even clothing.
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;chiaki&stage;1&saying;HP:=happy.png,Good! I wouldn't want you dying on us in the middle of a match!
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4b:=interested.png,Gosh, that is quite the small shirt.
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;larachel&stage;2:=annoyed.png,Hey, wait a minute, you weren't trying to attack us with a spell, were you?
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;2:=interested.png,Huh. Yeah. I guess that would do the trick too.
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;lyn&stage;1:=happy.png,I don't name my weapons, personally, but I did once wield an axe that was living, and <i>that</i> had a name!
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;rinkah&stage;2:=flustered.png,I wish I could say the same. I get cold even in Summer...
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;3:=interested.png,If you hate the accessories rule so much, why'd you wear any?... I mean, except for your shoes.
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;mary&stage;1:,id:294=thinking.png,If you made them steel-toed, would they even be sandals anymore? At that point they're just shoes, and wouldn't that defeat the purpose?
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;4:=annoyed.png,Magic is chaotic by nature, and it can overwhelm living things and turn them into mindless, spellcasting monsters. 
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;yuelia&stage;1&sayingmarker;real_name:=happy.png,Nice to meet the real you, Yuelia. Were you a butterfly on purpose? My friend Timbo turned me into a chicken on accident once.
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;mae&stage;1&sayingmarker;nightmarefeet:=interested.png,Nightmare... feet?
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;revy&stage;4:=facepalm.png,No one was trying to touch your things!
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;ini&stage;2:=sad.png,Oh no. That's unfortunate.
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1c:,marker:VriskaDress=happy.png,Oh wow! What a lovely dress!
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1c:,marker:VriskaDress=happy.png,Oh wow! You look very lovely now, Vriska!
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1c:=happy.png,Oh wow! What a grand dress! I honestly wasn't expecting that!
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2b:=happy.png,Oh! What a lovely outfit!
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;lucina&stage;1:,id:25=horny.png,Oh! Y-you're... a princ<i>ess</i>? Th-that's cool too, I guess...
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4a:=interested.png,Oh, did you re-class into a Ladybug Mage?
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4a:=interested.png,Oh. I guess you re-classed into a Ladybug Mage?
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4c:=interested.png,Oh, did you re-class into a Monk?
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4c:=interested.png,Oh. I guess you re-classed into a Monk now?
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3a:=interested.png,Oh, did you re-class into a Ranger?
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3a:=interested.png,Oh. I guess you re-classed into a Ranger now?
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3a:=happy.png,Oh, are you a Ranger now? My sister is a Ranger! Well, technically a Thief, but same thing, basically.
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;ribbon_girl&stage;1:=happy.png,Oh, like magic gauntlets! That's really neat!
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;6&saidmarker;pinka_start&notsaidmarker;pinka_end2:=sad.png,Oh, never mind. I think that was a death threat...
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;2:=enthused.png,Oh, or maybe you're one of four <i>card</i> fairies, and that's why your at this poker game! Can you give me some fortune for this match? Or is that why you didn't want us knowing?
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;meia&stage;1:=happy.png,Oh, so it's just a decoration? It sure looks like it has a purpose.
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3c:=happy.png,Oh, what a nice sweater!
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3c:=happy.png,Ooh, I like that sweater!
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;6:=interested.png,Oh, you were just hiding cat ears? I've had stranger-looking allies than a person with cat ears.
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;6:=interested.png,Um, not to put you down or anything, Blake, but I've fought alongside a walking flower and the Demon Lord of Wounds; cat ears are not shocking to me.
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;6:=interested.png,Uh, sorry but, is that it? Just cat ears? My friend Pernilla is a walking flower. You look normal compared to her.
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;6:=interested.png,Sorry, but after dealing with a formless, mind-bending monster, everyone else looks normal to me.
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;6:=interested.png,Sorry, but I'm not surprised. I guess I got desensitized by the evil, formless monster I defeated not too long ago. He was quite a weird one...
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;6:=interested.png,Sorry, Blake, but I'm not surprised at all. With all the weird creatures I've seen, I've learned to stop questioning peoples' appearance.
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2a:=interested.png,Oh. I guess you re-classed into a Swashbuckler now?
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2a:=interested.png,Oh, did you re-class into a Swashbuckler?
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;supernova&stage;1-4:,id:309=happy.png,Our worlds must be quite different. I've never even heard of "skyscrapers!"
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;syrenne&stage;2:=happy.png,People do tend to reward me, though, which is always nice.
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;ribbon_girl&stage;2:=enthused.png,Really? You'll have to teach me more about them!
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;megumin&stage;1:=flustered.png,Say, y-you don't know any transmogrification spells, do you? My friend turned me into a chicken once, and I'd like to avoid doing that again...
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;rarity_eg&stage;1:=interested.png,So do you make your outfits by hand, or do you know sewing magic too?
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;marinette&stage;1:=interested.png,So, by that logic, you must be a Ladybug Mage, right?
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;1:=calm.png,That's fine. You don't have to stay here if you don't want to.
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;2:=interested.png,This is... really bizarre.
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;1:=interested.png,Uh, I guess so...
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;4:=interested.png,Um... Moon?... Did you hear my question?...
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;1&saidmarker;fled:=happy.png,Well, at least you came back!
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;1&saidmarker;fled:=happy.png,Don't sweat it, Florina! You came back, at least!
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&layers;2-3:=flustered.png,Well, I can't say I wouldn't have done the same thing...
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&layers;2-3:=flustered.png,I-I'm going to let that slide, since you're... you know...
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&layers;2-3:=flustered.png,I guess I can't really complain, because you're... you know...
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&layers;2-3:,one-shot-id:2=flustered.png,Well, I can't say I wouldn't have done the same thing... Or maybe I can, because I would've taken ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~ off before anything else.
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;alice_mgq:=shocked.png,Whoa! Y-your a Lamia? So it <i>is</i> true that you can disguise yourselves!
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;1:=interested.png,W-wait a minute, love fairies don't exist. Fairies don't control emotions, emotions are as natural as breathing.
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;6:=flustered.png,W-why does that make me nervous...?
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;2:=annoyed.png,You really shouldn't toy with magic like that, especially not transformation spells. We wouldn't want you to turn into a Manatrocity.
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;morrigan&stage;2:=happy.png,You'd have to be pretty low-level for <i>bats</i> to give you trouble, anyhow!
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;2:=flustered.png,You're really, uh... enthusiastic about this game, huh?
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;2:=flustered.png,You, uh... sure are eager to get n-naked, huh?
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1a:,count-role;other&character;link:,marker:VriskaLink=interested.png,Oh, you, uh... copied Link's outfit?
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1a:,count-role;other&character;link:,marker:VriskaLink=interested.png,Oh. You must really like Link's outfit, huh?
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3a:,count-role;other&character;ruby:=interested.png,Oh, you, uh... copied Ruby's outfit?
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3a:,count-role;other&character;ruby:=interested.png,Oh. You must really like Ruby's outfit, huh?
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3b:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=interested.png,Oh, you, uh... copied Zone-tan's outfit?
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3b:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=interested.png,Oh. You must really like Zone-tan's outfit, huh?
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;chun-li:=calm.png,She's right, Chun-Li. The die technically counts... for better or worse.
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2b:,count-role;self&saidmarker;VriskaDress:=happy.png,You still look lovely, Vriska.
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3b:,count-role;self&saidmarker;VriskaLink:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=interested.png,You copied Ruby's outfit now? Why do you keep doing that?
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3b:,count-role;self&saidmarker;VriskaLink:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=interested.png,Why do you keep copying people's outfits?
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3a:,count-role;self&saidmarker;VriskaLink:,count-role;other&character;ruby:=interested.png,You copied Zone-tan's outfit now? Why do you keep doing that?
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3a:,count-role;self&saidmarker;VriskaLink:,count-role;other&character;ruby:=interested.png,Why do you keep copying people's outfits?
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;misato&stage;1:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:229=interested.png,Say, who're you enlisted with? I don't recognize your uniform.
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;hanako&stage;1:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:232=calm.png,Until you give me a more logical answer, I'm going to believe you were attacked.
4-female_removed_accessory,priority:381,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;4:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:242=annoyed.png,Magic is chaotic by nature, and it can overwhelm living things and turn them into mindless, spellcasting monsters. Frankly, you're endangering us.
4-female_removed_accessory,priority:381,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;2:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:239=calm.png,Oh, and if you end up getting yourself turned into a Manatrocity, I won't hesitate to pump you full of lead.
4-female_removed_accessory,priority:381,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;1:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:237=annoyed.png,You look rather young, so I'll give you the benefit of the doubt. Transformation magic is illegal because it's dangerous, so don't do it, you hear me?
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;1:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=interested.png,Anyway, that's nice armor. What's the make?
4-female_removed_accessory,priority:381,count-role;target&character;mae&stage;1&saidmarker;heels:=happy.png,I know, right? The last time I tried wearing heels, I nearly broke my arm when I fell!
4-female_removed_accessory,priority:382,count-role;target&character;nami&stage;3:=flustered.png,You're a pirate, huh...? Sorry, I guess books lead me to expect more scars and stuff.
4-female_removed_accessory,priority:56,count-role;target&startinglayers;2-3:=happy.png,I guess as long as you don't start pulling threads off to survive, I'll let this slide.
4-female_removed_accessory,priority:56,count-role;target&startinglayers;2-3:=happy.png,Maybe next time you should come a little more prepared?
4-female_removed_accessory,count-exposed&role;target:=flustered.png,Well, I can't say I wouldn't have done the same thing...
4-female_removed_accessory,count-exposed&role;target:=flustered.png,I-I'm going to let that slide, since you're... you know...
4-female_removed_accessory,count-exposed&role;target:=flustered.png,I guess I can't really complain, because you're... you know...
4-female_removed_accessory,count-exposed&role;target:,one-shot-id:2=flustered.png,Well, I can't say I wouldn't have done the same thing... Or maybe I can, because I would've taken ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~ off before anything else.
4-female_removed_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:123=calm.png,I'd like to remind you that I have the authority to arrest you.
4-female_removed_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:123=annoyed.png,There's strategic retreats, and then there's cowardice. You get what I'm saying?

5-male_removing_accessory=angry.png,I know it's just a game, but I don't appreciate you casually removing your ~clothing~ while my body is on display!

5-male_removing_accessory,marker:JotaroStarPlatinum=interested.png,Uh, what's "star platinum?"
5-male_removing_accessory=interested.png,Y-you still have ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~? Er, why?

5-male_removing_accessory=flustered.png,I would've thought you'd have taken ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~ off before you... became exposed...
5-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;chazz&stage;0:,id:279=thinking.png,A Duel Disk? But it's not even disk-shaped. And wouldn't it be terribly awkward for another player to play on that with you?
5-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kazuma:=competitive.png,Fair warning, I'm really good at crushing thieves before they make off with my stuff!
5-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;jotaro&stage;1:=flustered.png,I mean, you <i>did</i> agree to do this, Jotaro.
5-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;ae86&stage;0:=interested.png,I mean, you can love whoever you want as long as they can and <i>do</i> consent, but this is like being attracted to your dining table.

5-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kamina&stage;0:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:186=angry.png,It takes more than courage to win a fight. It takes planning, critical thinking, and knowing when to back down. Without those skills, you're nothing!
5-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kamina&stage;0:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:186=angry.png,It takes more than being an oxygen theif win a fight. It takes planning, critical thinking, and knowing when to back down. Otherwise, you're nothing!

5-male_removing_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:119=annoyed.png,I think you need to check your azimuth there, ~name~.

5-male_removed_accessory=annoyed.png,How rude!
5-male_removed_accessory=angry.png,My THAC0 is still low when I'm without my axe, I'll have you know, so you'd better be good at dodging punches!
5-male_removed_accessory=annoyed.png,I'm sorry if I was rude, but so were you.
5-male_removed_accessory=annoyed.png,I've seen goblins who were more generious than you.
5-male_removed_accessory=flustered.png,Well, I can't say I wouldn't have done the same thing...
5-male_removed_accessory=flustered.png,I-I'm going to let that slide, since you're... you know...
5-male_removed_accessory=flustered.png,I guess I can't really complain, because you're... you know...
5-male_removed_accessory,one-shot-id:3=flustered.png,Well, I can't say I wouldn't have done the same thing... Or maybe I can, because I would've taken ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~ off before anything else.

5-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;kamina&stage;1:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:187=annoyed.png,Do my words sting? Let them. Do you feel discouraged? I hope so. I've seen too many soldiers throw their lives away playing hero.
5-male_removed_accessory,priority:56,count-role;target&startinglayers;3-4:=happy.png,I guess as long as you don't start pulling threads off to survive, I'll let this slide.
5-male_removed_accessory,priority:56,count-role;target&startinglayers;3-4:=happy.png,Maybe next time you should come a little more prepared?

5-male_removed_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:118=calm.png,I'd like to remind you that I have the authority to arrest you.
5-male_removed_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:118=annoyed.png,There's strategic retreats, and then there's cowardice. You get what I'm saying?

5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;3:,id:40=interested.png,A Manatrocity is what happens when you're not careful with using magic on a living creature.
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;rarity_eg&stage;0:=flustered.png,Admittedly it's more from necessity, but fashion is a fun subject, too!
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;syrenne&stage;1:=interested.png,Although I guess "mercenary" implies I ask for pay up front? I don't ask for any payment. I just like helping people.
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;megumin&stage;0:=thinking.png,Come to think of it, I believe he has a hat really similar to the one you're wearing. Funny coincidence!
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nami&stage;0:,id:27=interested.png,Control the weather? That must take a lot of mana to use, huh?
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;meia&stage;0:=interested.png,Does your monocle really mean that much to you, Meia? You can still see fine in your other eye, right?
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;5:=competitive.png,Don't worry, Blake, if anyone judges you, I'll punch them in the face!
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;catria&stage;0:=competitive.png,Don't worry, Catria, if anyone attacks us, <i>I'll</i> deal with them. I certainly don't need weapons to deal with threats!

5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;rinkah&stage;1&saying;cold:=calm.png,I could use some boots like that, myself. I have trouble with the cold.
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;2:=calm.png,I mind a little bit...
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;ribbon_girl&stage;0:=calm.png,I see. What about those weird gloves you're wearing? Are they related to your powers too?
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1-3:=interested.png,I wonder what the outcome will be this time?
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1-3:=interested.png,I hope the outcome will be good.
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1-3:=interested.png,How likely is a bad roll?
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1-3:=interested.png,What could possibly go wrong?
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1-3:=interested.png,I'm sure the odds are in your favor, huh?
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;0:=interested.png,If by "get lucky" you mean "get critical hits," then no, I don't get them very often.
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;chiaki&stage;1&saying;debuffs:=happy.png,I'm certain you won't. <i>I</i> can't cast any, at least!
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;chiaki&stage;1&saying;debuffs:=happy.png,You won't have to worry about any debuffs from <i>me</i> at least! All of my debuffs are dealt on-hit, and I won't be hitting you any time soon!
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;mary&stage;0:=happy.png,I'm not really a sandal person, myself. You probably already knew that because I came here in boots, though.
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;lotte&stage;0:=flustered.png,I'm not very good with magic, myself. I can conjure flames and whatnot well enough, but making them into a projectile just doesn't happen.
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;0:=happy.png,In my world, people tend to become a particular type of mage. My friend Timbo is a red mage, for example.
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;3:=happy.png,Is your bag magic at all, Moon? I recently started using magic bag myself, and they're really fantastic.

5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shamir&stage;0:,id:299=happy.png,I've dabbled in archery a bit myself, but I prefer melee weapons. My sister's pretty good with bows, though.

5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sayla&stage;0&sayingmarker;sayla_boots_back_later:=interested.png,Of course... I think...
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;0:,id:38=shocked.png,Oh! I didn't realize you knew transformation magic!
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nami&stage;2:,id:28=calm.png,Oh! Looks like you dropped something, Nami.
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;0:,marker:SewingMagic=happy.png,Oh! Sewing magic, huh? Did you study Etsuko's books too?
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;0:,marker:SewingMagic=happy.png,Oh! Sewing magic, huh? I'm a practitioner of it myself.
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;0&saidmarker;fled:=interested.png,Oh! Uh, is she going to come back?
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;0&saidmarker;fled:=interested.png,Oh! Uh, should we just continue without her?...
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;larachel&stage;1:,id:23=sad.png,Oh, looks like your staff ran out of mana.
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;yuelia&stage;1&sayingmarker;fast_learning:,id:43=enthused.png,Oh, that's pretty cool! Enchanted items are always really neat!
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;ini&stage;0&saidmarker;bracelets:=flustered.png,Oh, well, that's cool too, I guess... So much for recovering lost knowledge...
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;0:=calm.png,Oh, you're a <i>love</i> fairy... But then why's your name "Queue?"
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;1:=flustered.png,Say, you haven't... started any wars, have you? With your assassinations?
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;0:=shocked.png,Shimakaze! Your gloves are on fire!
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;0:=shocked.png,Your gloves! They're on fire!
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;1:=interested.png,So what kind of fairy are you <i>really</i>? Maybe a white magic fairy, hence the hearts on your outfit?
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;ribbon_girl&stage;1:=happy.png,Sounds like you have a fair amount of options. Do you have any more?
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;lyn&stage;0:=interested.png,That must be the name of your sword, huh?
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;croix&stage;1:=interested.png,That's really cool. What are "magitronics," though?
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;0:=happy.png,That's the right way to play this game in my book: keep your modesty for as long as possible!
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;morrigan&stage;1:=interested.png,To be clear, I'm not afraid of bats, but I reserve the right to punch them if they get too close.
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;5:=flustered.png,Uh... Y-yeah, I guess I can say it's been fun...
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;1:,id:39=interested.png,Um, you're not going to keep transforming when you lose, are you, Akko?
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;alice_mgq:=annoyed.png,Well, whatever it is, it'd better be worth stalling for.
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;marinette&stage;0:=interested.png,Where I come from, ~name~, people don't dress in weird outfits unless it relates to their magic specialization.
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;yuelia&stage;0&sayingmarker;transformation:,id:42=shocked.png,Woah! Y-you're human!
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;1:=interested.png,Wouldn't that require your shoes to be small and cramped?
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;mae&stage;0&sayingmarker;heels:=flustered.png,Yeah, I don't understand heels either. They just seem like more trouble than they're worth.
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;supernova&stage;0:=interested.png,You certainly don't look like you came from the same kind of world as me. What's yours like?
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;2:=annoyed.png,You forgot already? Where's your head at?
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;1:=interested.png,You, uh... had to be <i>told</i> to do that?...
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;1:=interested.png,You had to be <i>told</i> to do that? I thought that was just common sense.
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;1:=shocked.png,Your boots! Where did those holes come from?
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;0:=happy.png,You're an assassin, huh? My sister is a thief. Those classes are adjacent, right?
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&layers;3-4:=interested.png,Y-you still have ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~? Er, why?
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&layers;3-4:=calm.png,I can't say I understand why you kept ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~ for as long as you did...
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&layers;3-4:=flustered.png,I would've thought you'd have taken ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~ off before you... became exposed...
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;0:,count-role;self&saidmarker;SewingMagic:=happy.png,Oh, you know Sewing Magic too, Vriska? What're the odds that the three of us all would?
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;0:,count-role;self&saidmarker;SewingMagic:=happy.png,Oh, you know Sewing Magic too, Vriska? Gosh, Etsuko's books must be more popular than I thought!
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;hanako&stage;0:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:231=interested.png,An... accident?... How? How does one burn only half of their face in a house fire?
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;hanako&stage;0:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:231=facepalm.png,House fire accidents don't burn people perfectly down the middle of their faces. What is this, a comic book?
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;0:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:201=calm.png,Not that I'm <i>expecting</i> a fight, but you never know, right?

5-female_removing_accessory,priority:381,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;3:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:241=calm.png,A Manatrocity is what happens when you're not careful with using magic on a living creature. You don't choose to become one, it's just happens.
5-female_removing_accessory,priority:381,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;1:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:238=annoyed.png,So you're just gonna ignore me, huh? Alright, once this game is over, you're coming with me. <i>In cuffs.</i>
5-female_removing_accessory,priority:56,count-role;target&startinglayers;3-4:=flustered.png,Alright, sure. You didn't come here with much, after all...
5-female_removing_accessory,priority:56,count-role;target&startinglayers;3-4:=flustered.png,I... supppose it's only fair we let you count ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~
5-female_removing_accessory,count-exposed&role;target:=interested.png,Y-you still have ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~? Er, why?
5-female_removing_accessory,count-exposed&role;target:=calm.png,I can't say I understand why you kept ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~ for as long as you did...
5-female_removing_accessory,count-exposed&role;target:=flustered.png,I would've thought you'd have taken ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~ off before you... became exposed...
5-female_removing_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:120=facepalm.png,You're kidding, right?
5-female_removing_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:120=facepalm.png,Such insubordination...
5-female_removing_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:120=interested.png,Not feeling very bold now, eh?
5-female_removing_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:120=annoyed.png,I think you need to check your azimuth there, ~name~.
5-female_removed_accessory=angry.png,I'm not afraid to hurt you if you keep doing that!
5-female_removed_accessory=annoyed.png,At this point, you're basically mocking me!
5-female_removed_accessory=facepalm.png,Who even wrote these rules?
5-female_removed_accessory=annoyed.png,How rude!
5-female_removed_accessory=angry.png,My THAC0 is still low when I'm without my axe, I'll have you know, so you'd better be good at dodging punches!
5-female_removed_accessory=annoyed.png,I'm sorry if I was rude, but so were you.
5-female_removed_accessory=annoyed.png,I've seen goblins who were more generious than you.
5-female_removed_accessory=interested.png,That's a nice outfit, I suppose, but why is it missing a sleeve?
5-female_removed_accessory=flustered.png,Well, I can't say I wouldn't have done the same thing...
5-female_removed_accessory=flustered.png,I-I'm going to let that slide, since you're... you know...
5-female_removed_accessory=flustered.png,I guess I can't really complain, because you're... you know...
5-female_removed_accessory,one-shot-id:2=flustered.png,Well, I can't say I wouldn't have done the same thing... Or maybe I can, because I would've taken ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~ off before anything else.
5-female_removed_accessory=interested.png,Well, uh... I think you're actually wearing <i>more</i> clothes now, but I guess if it's up to luck, maybe you'll lose more next time?
5-female_removed_accessory=interested.png,Well, uh... I think you're wearing <i>more</i> clothing now, but since it's luck-based, I guess it's okay?
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;spooky&stage;1:=angry.png,A-are you going to count that? That's barely fair!
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;mahiru&stage;1:=flustered.png,Admittedly, I never liked those lanterns. I find it more comforting having a wider radius of light.
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;4&saidmarker;dizzy:=shocked.png,Are you okay, Shimakaze?
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;lyn&stage;2:=flustered.png,D-did anyone else hear a small tune just now...?
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;1:=shocked.png,D-did you do that intentionally? You're oddly calm.
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;1:=interested.png,Do you know any invisibility spells like she does? They must be pretty vital to your skill set.
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;lotte&stage;1:=interested.png,Er, wait, you're counting your wand? But that's not even clothing.
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;chiaki&stage;1&saying;HP:=happy.png,Good! I wouldn't want you dying on us in the middle of a match!
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4b:=interested.png,Gosh, that is quite the small shirt.
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;larachel&stage;2:=annoyed.png,Hey, wait a minute, you weren't trying to attack us with a spell, were you?
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;2:=interested.png,Huh. Yeah. I guess that would do the trick too.
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;lyn&stage;1:=happy.png,I don't name my weapons, personally, but I did once wield an axe that was living, and <i>that</i> had a name!
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;rinkah&stage;2:=flustered.png,I wish I could say the same. I get cold even in Summer...
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;3:=interested.png,If you hate the accessories rule so much, why'd you wear any?... I mean, except for your shoes.
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;mary&stage;1:,id:294=thinking.png,If you made them steel-toed, would they even be sandals anymore? At that point they're just shoes, and wouldn't that defeat the purpose?
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;4:=annoyed.png,Magic is chaotic by nature, and it can overwhelm living things and turn them into mindless, spellcasting monsters. 
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;yuelia&stage;1&sayingmarker;real_name:=happy.png,Nice to meet the real you, Yuelia. Were you a butterfly on purpose? My friend Timbo turned me into a chicken on accident once.
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;mae&stage;1&sayingmarker;nightmarefeet:=interested.png,Nightmare... feet?
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;revy&stage;4:=facepalm.png,No one was trying to touch your things!
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;ini&stage;2:=sad.png,Oh no. That's unfortunate.
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1c:,marker:VriskaDress=happy.png,Oh wow! What a lovely dress!
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1c:,marker:VriskaDress=happy.png,Oh wow! You look very lovely now, Vriska!
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1c:=happy.png,Oh wow! What a grand dress! I honestly wasn't expecting that!
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2b:=happy.png,Oh! What a lovely outfit!
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;lucina&stage;1:,id:25=horny.png,Oh! Y-you're... a princ<i>ess</i>? Th-that's cool too, I guess...
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4a:=interested.png,Oh, did you re-class into a Ladybug Mage?
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4a:=interested.png,Oh. I guess you re-classed into a Ladybug Mage?
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4c:=interested.png,Oh, did you re-class into a Monk?
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4c:=interested.png,Oh. I guess you re-classed into a Monk now?
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3a:=interested.png,Oh, did you re-class into a Ranger?
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3a:=interested.png,Oh. I guess you re-classed into a Ranger now?
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3a:=happy.png,Oh, are you a Ranger now? My sister is a Ranger! Well, technically a Thief, but same thing, basically.
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;ribbon_girl&stage;1:=happy.png,Oh, like magic gauntlets! That's really neat!
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;6&saidmarker;pinka_start&notsaidmarker;pinka_end2:=sad.png,Oh, never mind. I think that was a death threat...
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;2:=enthused.png,Oh, or maybe you're one of four <i>card</i> fairies, and that's why your at this poker game! Can you give me some fortune for this match? Or is that why you didn't want us knowing?
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;meia&stage;1:=happy.png,Oh, so it's just a decoration? It sure looks like it has a purpose.
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3c:=happy.png,Oh, what a nice sweater!
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3c:=happy.png,Ooh, I like that sweater!
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;6:=interested.png,Oh, you were just hiding cat ears? I've had stranger-looking allies than a person with cat ears.
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;6:=interested.png,Um, not to put you down or anything, Blake, but I've fought alongside a walking flower and the Demon Lord of Wounds; cat ears are not shocking to me.
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;6:=interested.png,Uh, sorry but, is that it? Just cat ears? My friend Pernilla is a walking flower. You look normal compared to her.
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;6:=interested.png,Sorry, but after dealing with a formless, mind-bending monster, everyone else looks normal to me.
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;6:=interested.png,Sorry, but I'm not surprised. I guess I got desensitized by the evil, formless monster I defeated not too long ago. He was quite a weird one...
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;6:=interested.png,Sorry, Blake, but I'm not surprised at all. With all the weird creatures I've seen, I've learned to stop questioning peoples' appearance.
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2a:=interested.png,Oh. I guess you re-classed into a Swashbuckler now?
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2a:=interested.png,Oh, did you re-class into a Swashbuckler?
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;supernova&stage;1-4:,id:309=happy.png,Our worlds must be quite different. I've never even heard of "skyscrapers!"
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;syrenne&stage;2:=happy.png,People do tend to reward me, though, which is always nice.
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;ribbon_girl&stage;2:=enthused.png,Really? You'll have to teach me more about them!
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;megumin&stage;1:=flustered.png,Say, y-you don't know any transmogrification spells, do you? My friend turned me into a chicken once, and I'd like to avoid doing that again...
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;rarity_eg&stage;1:=interested.png,So do you make your outfits by hand, or do you know sewing magic too?
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;marinette&stage;1:=interested.png,So, by that logic, you must be a Ladybug Mage, right?
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;1:=calm.png,That's fine. You don't have to stay here if you don't want to.
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;2:=interested.png,This is... really bizarre.
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;1:=interested.png,Uh, I guess so...
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;4:=interested.png,Um... Moon?... Did you hear my question?...
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;1&saidmarker;fled:=happy.png,Well, at least you came back!
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;1&saidmarker;fled:=happy.png,Don't sweat it, Florina! You came back, at least!
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&layers;2-3:=flustered.png,Well, I can't say I wouldn't have done the same thing...
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&layers;2-3:=flustered.png,I-I'm going to let that slide, since you're... you know...
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&layers;2-3:=flustered.png,I guess I can't really complain, because you're... you know...
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&layers;2-3:,one-shot-id:2=flustered.png,Well, I can't say I wouldn't have done the same thing... Or maybe I can, because I would've taken ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~ off before anything else.
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;alice_mgq:=shocked.png,Whoa! Y-your a Lamia? So it <i>is</i> true that you can disguise yourselves!
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;1:=interested.png,W-wait a minute, love fairies don't exist. Fairies don't control emotions, emotions are as natural as breathing.
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;6:=flustered.png,W-why does that make me nervous...?
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;2:=annoyed.png,You really shouldn't toy with magic like that, especially not transformation spells. We wouldn't want you to turn into a Manatrocity.
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;morrigan&stage;2:=happy.png,You'd have to be pretty low-level for <i>bats</i> to give you trouble, anyhow!
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;2:=flustered.png,You're really, uh... enthusiastic about this game, huh?
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;2:=flustered.png,You, uh... sure are eager to get n-naked, huh?
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1a:,count-role;other&character;link:,marker:VriskaLink=interested.png,Oh, you, uh... copied Link's outfit?
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1a:,count-role;other&character;link:,marker:VriskaLink=interested.png,Oh. You must really like Link's outfit, huh?
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3a:,count-role;other&character;ruby:=interested.png,Oh, you, uh... copied Ruby's outfit?
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3a:,count-role;other&character;ruby:=interested.png,Oh. You must really like Ruby's outfit, huh?
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3b:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=interested.png,Oh, you, uh... copied Zone-tan's outfit?
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3b:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=interested.png,Oh. You must really like Zone-tan's outfit, huh?
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;chun-li:=calm.png,She's right, Chun-Li. The die technically counts... for better or worse.
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2b:,count-role;self&saidmarker;VriskaDress:=happy.png,You still look lovely, Vriska.
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3b:,count-role;self&saidmarker;VriskaLink:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=interested.png,You copied Ruby's outfit now? Why do you keep doing that?
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3b:,count-role;self&saidmarker;VriskaLink:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=interested.png,Why do you keep copying people's outfits?
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3a:,count-role;self&saidmarker;VriskaLink:,count-role;other&character;ruby:=interested.png,You copied Zone-tan's outfit now? Why do you keep doing that?
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3a:,count-role;self&saidmarker;VriskaLink:,count-role;other&character;ruby:=interested.png,Why do you keep copying people's outfits?
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;misato&stage;1:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:229=interested.png,Say, who're you enlisted with? I don't recognize your uniform.
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;hanako&stage;1:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:232=calm.png,Until you give me a more logical answer, I'm going to believe you were attacked.
5-female_removed_accessory,priority:381,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;4:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:242=annoyed.png,Magic is chaotic by nature, and it can overwhelm living things and turn them into mindless, spellcasting monsters. Frankly, you're endangering us.
5-female_removed_accessory,priority:381,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;2:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:239=calm.png,Oh, and if you end up getting yourself turned into a Manatrocity, I won't hesitate to pump you full of lead.
5-female_removed_accessory,priority:381,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;1:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:237=annoyed.png,You look rather young, so I'll give you the benefit of the doubt. Transformation magic is illegal because it's dangerous, so don't do it, you hear me?
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;1:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=interested.png,Anyway, that's nice armor. What's the make?
5-female_removed_accessory,priority:381,count-role;target&character;mae&stage;1&saidmarker;heels:=happy.png,I know, right? The last time I tried wearing heels, I nearly broke my arm when I fell!
5-female_removed_accessory,priority:382,count-role;target&character;nami&stage;3:=flustered.png,You're a pirate, huh...? Sorry, I guess books lead me to expect more scars and stuff.
5-female_removed_accessory,priority:56,count-role;target&startinglayers;2-3:=happy.png,I guess as long as you don't start pulling threads off to survive, I'll let this slide.
5-female_removed_accessory,priority:56,count-role;target&startinglayers;2-3:=happy.png,Maybe next time you should come a little more prepared?
5-female_removed_accessory,count-exposed&role;target:=flustered.png,Well, I can't say I wouldn't have done the same thing...
5-female_removed_accessory,count-exposed&role;target:=flustered.png,I-I'm going to let that slide, since you're... you know...
5-female_removed_accessory,count-exposed&role;target:=flustered.png,I guess I can't really complain, because you're... you know...
5-female_removed_accessory,count-exposed&role;target:,one-shot-id:2=flustered.png,Well, I can't say I wouldn't have done the same thing... Or maybe I can, because I would've taken ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~ off before anything else.
5-female_removed_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:123=calm.png,I'd like to remind you that I have the authority to arrest you.
5-female_removed_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:123=annoyed.png,There's strategic retreats, and then there's cowardice. You get what I'm saying?
5-female_removed_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:123=facepalm.png,You're lucky I'm not corrupt, or else I would've arrested you for that.
5-female_removed_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:123=interested.png,You do know I didn't get these scars by taking my clothes off, right?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1a=interested.png,Well, uh... I think you're actually wearing <i>more</i> clothes now, but I guess if it's up to luck, maybe you'll lose more next time?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1a=interested.png,Well, uh... I think you're wearing <i>more</i> clothing now, but since it's luck-based, I guess it's okay?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1b=interested.png,Well, uh... I think you're actually wearing <i>more</i> clothes now, but I guess if it's up to luck, maybe you'll lose more next time?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1b=interested.png,Well, uh... I think you're wearing <i>more</i> clothing now, but since it's luck-based, I guess it's okay?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2c,targetNotSaidMarker:1c=interested.png,That's a nice outfit, I suppose, but why is it missing a sleeve?

-3-male_removing_accessory,priority:56,count-role;target&startinglayers;3-4:=flustered.png,Alright, sure. You didn't come here with much, after all...
-3-male_removing_accessory,priority:56,count-role;target&startinglayers;3-4:=flustered.png,I... supppose it's only fair we let you count ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~

-3-male_removing_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:119=facepalm.png,Such insubordination...
-3-male_removing_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:119=interested.png,Not feeling very bold now, eh?
-3-male_removing_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:119=annoyed.png,I think you need to check your azimuth there, ~name~.

-3-male_removed_accessory=flustered.png,Well, I can't say I wouldn't have done the same thing...
-3-male_removed_accessory=flustered.png,I-I'm going to let that slide, since you're... you know...

-3-male_removed_accessory,one-shot-id:3=flustered.png,Well, I can't say I wouldn't have done the same thing... Or maybe I can, because I would've taken ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~ off before anything else.

-3-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;jotaro&stage;2:=shocked.png,Y-your shoes! I didn't even see you take them off!

-3-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;kamina&stage;1:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:187=annoyed.png,Do my words sting? Let them. Do you feel discouraged? I hope so. I've seen too many soldiers throw their lives away playing hero.
-3-male_removed_accessory,priority:56,count-role;target&startinglayers;3-4:=happy.png,I guess as long as you don't start pulling threads off to survive, I'll let this slide.

-3-male_removed_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:118=calm.png,I'd like to remind you that I have the authority to arrest you.
-3-male_removed_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:118=annoyed.png,There's strategic retreats, and then there's cowardice. You get what I'm saying?
-3-male_removed_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:118=facepalm.png,You're lucky I'm not corrupt, or else I would've arrested you for that.
-3-male_removed_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:118=interested.png,You do know I didn't get these scars by taking my clothes off, right?
-3-male_removed_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,count-role;target&character;ae86&stage;1:,id:199=annoyed.png,You could've at least picked a <i>sexy</i> car model, like a 1958 Cadillac Eldorado.

-3-female_removing_accessory=angry.png,I can't believe you still have stuff like your ~clothing~ to remove while I'm down to nothing!
-3-female_removing_accessory=annoyed.png,I know it's fair, but I don't appreciate you removing your ~clothing~ when I'm standing here naked!
-3-female_removing_accessory=annoyed.png,Having fun over there, taking off your ~clothing~? Because I'm not!
-3-female_removing_accessory=facepalm.png,You're joking, right? You've got to be joking!

-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;3:,id:40=interested.png,A Manatrocity is what happens when you're not careful with using magic on a living creature.
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;rarity_eg&stage;0:=flustered.png,Admittedly it's more from necessity, but fashion is a fun subject, too!
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;syrenne&stage;1:=interested.png,Although I guess "mercenary" implies I ask for pay up front? I don't ask for any payment. I just like helping people.
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;megumin&stage;0:=thinking.png,Come to think of it, I believe he has a hat really similar to the one you're wearing. Funny coincidence!
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nami&stage;0:,id:27=interested.png,Control the weather? That must take a lot of mana to use, huh?
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;meia&stage;0:=interested.png,Does your monocle really mean that much to you, Meia? You can still see fine in your other eye, right?
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;5:=competitive.png,Don't worry, Blake, if anyone judges you, I'll punch them in the face!
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;catria&stage;0:=competitive.png,Don't worry, Catria, if anyone attacks us, <i>I'll</i> deal with them. I certainly don't need weapons to deal with threats!
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;spooky&stage;0:=annoyed.png,Hey, wait, you had a knife? You weren't going to hurt anyone, were you?
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;rinkah&stage;1&saying;cold:=calm.png,I could use some boots like that, myself. I have trouble with the cold.
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;2:=calm.png,I mind a little bit...
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;ribbon_girl&stage;0:=calm.png,I see. What about those weird gloves you're wearing? Are they related to your powers too?
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1-3:=interested.png,I wonder what the outcome will be this time?
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1-3:=interested.png,I hope the outcome will be good.
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1-3:=interested.png,How likely is a bad roll?
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1-3:=interested.png,What could possibly go wrong?
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1-3:=interested.png,I'm sure the odds are in your favor, huh?
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;0:=interested.png,If by "get lucky" you mean "get critical hits," then no, I don't get them very often.
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;chiaki&stage;1&saying;debuffs:=happy.png,I'm certain you won't. <i>I</i> can't cast any, at least!
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;chiaki&stage;1&saying;debuffs:=happy.png,You won't have to worry about any debuffs from <i>me</i> at least! All of my debuffs are dealt on-hit, and I won't be hitting you any time soon!
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;mary&stage;0:=happy.png,I'm not really a sandal person, myself. You probably already knew that because I came here in boots, though.
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;lotte&stage;0:=flustered.png,I'm not very good with magic, myself. I can conjure flames and whatnot well enough, but making them into a projectile just doesn't happen.
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;0:=happy.png,In my world, people tend to become a particular type of mage. My friend Timbo is a red mage, for example.
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;3:=happy.png,Is your bag magic at all, Moon? I recently started using magic bag myself, and they're really fantastic.
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;mahiru&stage;0:=happy.png,It looks like one of those focused lanterns, that project light into a beam.
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shamir&stage;0:,id:299=happy.png,I've dabbled in archery a bit myself, but I prefer melee weapons. My sister's pretty good with bows, though.
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;5&saidmarker;pinka_start&notsaidmarker;pinka_end2:=happy.png,No knife accident? No death threat? I think she's turning back to normal!
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sayla&stage;0&sayingmarker;sayla_boots_back_later:=interested.png,Of course... I think...
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nami&stage;2:,id:28=calm.png,Oh! Looks like you dropped something, Nami.
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;0:,marker:SewingMagic=happy.png,Oh! Sewing magic, huh? Did you study Etsuko's books too?
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;0:,marker:SewingMagic=happy.png,Oh! Sewing magic, huh? I'm a practitioner of it myself.
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;0&saidmarker;fled:=interested.png,Oh! Uh, is she going to come back?
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;0&saidmarker;fled:=interested.png,Oh! Uh, should we just continue without her?...
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;larachel&stage;1:,id:23=sad.png,Oh, looks like your staff ran out of mana.
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;yuelia&stage;1&sayingmarker;fast_learning:,id:43=enthused.png,Oh, that's pretty cool! Enchanted items are always really neat!
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;ini&stage;0&saidmarker;bracelets:=flustered.png,Oh, well, that's cool too, I guess... So much for recovering lost knowledge...
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;0:=calm.png,Oh, you're a <i>love</i> fairy... But then why's your name "Queue?"
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;1:=flustered.png,Say, you haven't... started any wars, have you? With your assassinations?
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;0:=shocked.png,Shimakaze! Your gloves are on fire!
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;0:=shocked.png,Your gloves! They're on fire!
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;1:=interested.png,So what kind of fairy are you <i>really</i>? Maybe a white magic fairy, hence the hearts on your outfit?
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;ribbon_girl&stage;1:=happy.png,Sounds like you have a fair amount of options. Do you have any more?
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;lyn&stage;0:=interested.png,That must be the name of your sword, huh?
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;croix&stage;1:=interested.png,That's really cool. What are "magitronics," though?
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;0:=happy.png,That's the right way to play this game in my book: keep your modesty for as long as possible!
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;morrigan&stage;1:=interested.png,To be clear, I'm not afraid of bats, but I reserve the right to punch them if they get too close.
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;5:=flustered.png,Uh... Y-yeah, I guess I can say it's been fun...
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;1:,id:39=interested.png,Um, you're not going to keep transforming when you lose, are you, Akko?
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;alice_mgq:=annoyed.png,Well, whatever it is, it'd better be worth stalling for.
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;marinette&stage;0:=interested.png,Where I come from, ~name~, people don't dress in weird outfits unless it relates to their magic specialization.
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;yuelia&stage;0&sayingmarker;transformation:,id:42=shocked.png,Woah! Y-you're human!
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;1:=interested.png,Wouldn't that require your shoes to be small and cramped?
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;mae&stage;0&sayingmarker;heels:=flustered.png,Yeah, I don't understand heels either. They just seem like more trouble than they're worth.
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;supernova&stage;0:=interested.png,You certainly don't look like you came from the same kind of world as me. What's yours like?
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;2:=annoyed.png,You forgot already? Where's your head at?
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;1:=interested.png,You, uh... had to be <i>told</i> to do that?...
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;1:=interested.png,You had to be <i>told</i> to do that? I thought that was just common sense.
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;1:=shocked.png,Your boots! Where did those holes come from?
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;0:=happy.png,You're an assassin, huh? My sister is a thief. Those classes are adjacent, right?
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&layers;3-4:=interested.png,Y-you still have ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~? Er, why?
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&layers;3-4:=calm.png,I can't say I understand why you kept ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~ for as long as you did...
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&layers;3-4:=flustered.png,I would've thought you'd have taken ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~ off before you... became exposed...
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;0:,count-role;self&saidmarker;SewingMagic:=happy.png,Oh, you know Sewing Magic too, Vriska? What're the odds that the three of us all would?
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;0:,count-role;self&saidmarker;SewingMagic:=happy.png,Oh, you know Sewing Magic too, Vriska? Gosh, Etsuko's books must be more popular than I thought!
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;hanako&stage;0:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:231=interested.png,An... accident?... How? How does one burn only half of their face in a house fire?
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;hanako&stage;0:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:231=facepalm.png,House fire accidents don't burn people perfectly down the middle of their faces. What is this, a comic book?
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;0:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:201=calm.png,Not that I'm <i>expecting</i> a fight, but you never know, right?
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;misato&stage;0:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:228=happy.png,You must've done some pretty awesome things in the process of achieving that rank. You should share some stories sometime.
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;meia&stage;0:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:196=flustered.png,You're a pirate, huh? I should be arresting you, but <i>technically</i> I'm off the clock, so... I can pretend you're not a pirate.
-3-female_removing_accessory,priority:381,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;3:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:241=calm.png,A Manatrocity is what happens when you're not careful with using magic on a living creature. You don't choose to become one, it's just happens.
-3-female_removing_accessory,priority:381,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;1:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:238=annoyed.png,So you're just gonna ignore me, huh? Alright, once this game is over, you're coming with me. <i>In cuffs.</i>
-3-female_removing_accessory,priority:56,count-role;target&startinglayers;3-4:=flustered.png,Alright, sure. You didn't come here with much, after all...
-3-female_removing_accessory,priority:56,count-role;target&startinglayers;3-4:=flustered.png,I... supppose it's only fair we let you count ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~

-3-female_removing_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:120=facepalm.png,Such insubordination...
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:120=interested.png,Not feeling very bold now, eh?
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:120=annoyed.png,I think you need to check your azimuth there, ~name~.
-3-female_removed_accessory=facepalm.png,If this kind of behavior is common for this game, then I couldn't play it again. I could never get used to this!
-3-female_removed_accessory=angry.png,Could you maybe show some empathy for the woman standing here completely naked?!
-3-female_removed_accessory=facepalm.png,Is this normal for this game, or is ~name~ just rude?

-3-female_removed_accessory=annoyed.png,Count yourself lucky that I'm not a red mage, or I'd hit you with a magic missile!
-3-female_removed_accessory=annoyed.png,I've found more than that in a goblin's pouch.
-3-female_removed_accessory=annoyed.png,I've found more than that hidden inside of a pot.
-3-female_removed_accessory=interested.png,That's a nice outfit, I suppose, but why is it missing a sleeve?
-3-female_removed_accessory=flustered.png,Well, I can't say I wouldn't have done the same thing...
-3-female_removed_accessory=flustered.png,I-I'm going to let that slide, since you're... you know...
-3-female_removed_accessory=flustered.png,I guess I can't really complain, because you're... you know...
-3-female_removed_accessory,one-shot-id:2=flustered.png,Well, I can't say I wouldn't have done the same thing... Or maybe I can, because I would've taken ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~ off before anything else.
-3-female_removed_accessory=interested.png,Well, uh... I think you're actually wearing <i>more</i> clothes now, but I guess if it's up to luck, maybe you'll lose more next time?
-3-female_removed_accessory=interested.png,Well, uh... I think you're wearing <i>more</i> clothing now, but since it's luck-based, I guess it's okay?
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;spooky&stage;1:=angry.png,A-are you going to count that? That's barely fair!
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;mahiru&stage;1:=flustered.png,Admittedly, I never liked those lanterns. I find it more comforting having a wider radius of light.
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;4&saidmarker;dizzy:=shocked.png,Are you okay, Shimakaze?
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;lyn&stage;2:=flustered.png,D-did anyone else hear a small tune just now...?
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;1:=shocked.png,D-did you do that intentionally? You're oddly calm.
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;1:=interested.png,Do you know any invisibility spells like she does? They must be pretty vital to your skill set.
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;lotte&stage;1:=interested.png,Er, wait, you're counting your wand? But that's not even clothing.
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;chiaki&stage;1&saying;HP:=happy.png,Good! I wouldn't want you dying on us in the middle of a match!
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4b:=interested.png,Gosh, that is quite the small shirt.
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;larachel&stage;2:=annoyed.png,Hey, wait a minute, you weren't trying to attack us with a spell, were you?
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;2:=interested.png,Huh. Yeah. I guess that would do the trick too.
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;lyn&stage;1:=happy.png,I don't name my weapons, personally, but I did once wield an axe that was living, and <i>that</i> had a name!
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;rinkah&stage;2:=flustered.png,I wish I could say the same. I get cold even in Summer...
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;3:=interested.png,If you hate the accessories rule so much, why'd you wear any?... I mean, except for your shoes.
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;mary&stage;1:,id:294=thinking.png,If you made them steel-toed, would they even be sandals anymore? At that point they're just shoes, and wouldn't that defeat the purpose?
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;4:=annoyed.png,Magic is chaotic by nature, and it can overwhelm living things and turn them into mindless, spellcasting monsters. 
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;yuelia&stage;1&sayingmarker;real_name:=happy.png,Nice to meet the real you, Yuelia. Were you a butterfly on purpose? My friend Timbo turned me into a chicken on accident once.
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;mae&stage;1&sayingmarker;nightmarefeet:=interested.png,Nightmare... feet?
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;revy&stage;4:=facepalm.png,No one was trying to touch your things!
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;ini&stage;2:=sad.png,Oh no. That's unfortunate.
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1c:,marker:VriskaDress=happy.png,Oh wow! What a lovely dress!
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1c:,marker:VriskaDress=happy.png,Oh wow! You look very lovely now, Vriska!
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1c:=happy.png,Oh wow! What a grand dress! I honestly wasn't expecting that!
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2b:=happy.png,Oh! What a lovely outfit!
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;lucina&stage;1:,id:25=horny.png,Oh! Y-you're... a princ<i>ess</i>? Th-that's cool too, I guess...
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4a:=interested.png,Oh, did you re-class into a Ladybug Mage?
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4a:=interested.png,Oh. I guess you re-classed into a Ladybug Mage?
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4c:=interested.png,Oh, did you re-class into a Monk?
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4c:=interested.png,Oh. I guess you re-classed into a Monk now?
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3a:=interested.png,Oh, did you re-class into a Ranger?
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3a:=interested.png,Oh. I guess you re-classed into a Ranger now?
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3a:=happy.png,Oh, are you a Ranger now? My sister is a Ranger! Well, technically a Thief, but same thing, basically.
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;ribbon_girl&stage;1:=happy.png,Oh, like magic gauntlets! That's really neat!
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;6&saidmarker;pinka_start&notsaidmarker;pinka_end2:=sad.png,Oh, never mind. I think that was a death threat...
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;2:=enthused.png,Oh, or maybe you're one of four <i>card</i> fairies, and that's why your at this poker game! Can you give me some fortune for this match? Or is that why you didn't want us knowing?
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;meia&stage;1:=happy.png,Oh, so it's just a decoration? It sure looks like it has a purpose.
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3c:=happy.png,Oh, what a nice sweater!
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3c:=happy.png,Ooh, I like that sweater!
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;6:=interested.png,Oh, you were just hiding cat ears? I've had stranger-looking allies than a person with cat ears.
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;6:=interested.png,Um, not to put you down or anything, Blake, but I've fought alongside a walking flower and the Demon Lord of Wounds; cat ears are not shocking to me.
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;6:=interested.png,Uh, sorry but, is that it? Just cat ears? My friend Pernilla is a walking flower. You look normal compared to her.
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;6:=interested.png,Sorry, but after dealing with a formless, mind-bending monster, everyone else looks normal to me.
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;6:=interested.png,Sorry, but I'm not surprised. I guess I got desensitized by the evil, formless monster I defeated not too long ago. He was quite a weird one...
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;6:=interested.png,Sorry, Blake, but I'm not surprised at all. With all the weird creatures I've seen, I've learned to stop questioning peoples' appearance.
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2a:=interested.png,Oh. I guess you re-classed into a Swashbuckler now?
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2a:=interested.png,Oh, did you re-class into a Swashbuckler?
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;supernova&stage;1-4:,id:309=happy.png,Our worlds must be quite different. I've never even heard of "skyscrapers!"
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;syrenne&stage;2:=happy.png,People do tend to reward me, though, which is always nice.
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;ribbon_girl&stage;2:=enthused.png,Really? You'll have to teach me more about them!
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;megumin&stage;1:=flustered.png,Say, y-you don't know any transmogrification spells, do you? My friend turned me into a chicken once, and I'd like to avoid doing that again...
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;rarity_eg&stage;1:=interested.png,So do you make your outfits by hand, or do you know sewing magic too?
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;marinette&stage;1:=interested.png,So, by that logic, you must be a Ladybug Mage, right?
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;1:=calm.png,That's fine. You don't have to stay here if you don't want to.
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;2:=interested.png,This is... really bizarre.
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;1:=interested.png,Uh, I guess so...
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;4:=interested.png,Um... Moon?... Did you hear my question?...
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;1&saidmarker;fled:=happy.png,Well, at least you came back!
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;1&saidmarker;fled:=happy.png,Don't sweat it, Florina! You came back, at least!
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&layers;2-3:=flustered.png,Well, I can't say I wouldn't have done the same thing...
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&layers;2-3:=flustered.png,I-I'm going to let that slide, since you're... you know...
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&layers;2-3:=flustered.png,I guess I can't really complain, because you're... you know...
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&layers;2-3:,one-shot-id:2=flustered.png,Well, I can't say I wouldn't have done the same thing... Or maybe I can, because I would've taken ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~ off before anything else.
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;alice_mgq:=shocked.png,Whoa! Y-your a Lamia? So it <i>is</i> true that you can disguise yourselves!
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;1:=interested.png,W-wait a minute, love fairies don't exist. Fairies don't control emotions, emotions are as natural as breathing.
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;6:=flustered.png,W-why does that make me nervous...?
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;2:=annoyed.png,You really shouldn't toy with magic like that, especially not transformation spells. We wouldn't want you to turn into a Manatrocity.
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;morrigan&stage;2:=happy.png,You'd have to be pretty low-level for <i>bats</i> to give you trouble, anyhow!
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;2:=flustered.png,You're really, uh... enthusiastic about this game, huh?
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;2:=flustered.png,You, uh... sure are eager to get n-naked, huh?
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1a:,count-role;other&character;link:,marker:VriskaLink=interested.png,Oh, you, uh... copied Link's outfit?
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1a:,count-role;other&character;link:,marker:VriskaLink=interested.png,Oh. You must really like Link's outfit, huh?
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3a:,count-role;other&character;ruby:=interested.png,Oh, you, uh... copied Ruby's outfit?
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3a:,count-role;other&character;ruby:=interested.png,Oh. You must really like Ruby's outfit, huh?
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3b:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=interested.png,Oh, you, uh... copied Zone-tan's outfit?
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3b:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=interested.png,Oh. You must really like Zone-tan's outfit, huh?
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;chun-li:=calm.png,She's right, Chun-Li. The die technically counts... for better or worse.
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2b:,count-role;self&saidmarker;VriskaDress:=happy.png,You still look lovely, Vriska.
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3b:,count-role;self&saidmarker;VriskaLink:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=interested.png,You copied Ruby's outfit now? Why do you keep doing that?
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3b:,count-role;self&saidmarker;VriskaLink:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=interested.png,Why do you keep copying people's outfits?
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3a:,count-role;self&saidmarker;VriskaLink:,count-role;other&character;ruby:=interested.png,You copied Zone-tan's outfit now? Why do you keep doing that?
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3a:,count-role;self&saidmarker;VriskaLink:,count-role;other&character;ruby:=interested.png,Why do you keep copying people's outfits?
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;misato&stage;1:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:229=interested.png,Say, who're you enlisted with? I don't recognize your uniform.
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;hanako&stage;1:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:232=calm.png,Until you give me a more logical answer, I'm going to believe you were attacked.
-3-female_removed_accessory,priority:381,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;4:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:242=annoyed.png,Magic is chaotic by nature, and it can overwhelm living things and turn them into mindless, spellcasting monsters. Frankly, you're endangering us.
-3-female_removed_accessory,priority:381,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;2:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:239=calm.png,Oh, and if you end up getting yourself turned into a Manatrocity, I won't hesitate to pump you full of lead.
-3-female_removed_accessory,priority:381,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;1:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:237=annoyed.png,You look rather young, so I'll give you the benefit of the doubt. Transformation magic is illegal because it's dangerous, so don't do it, you hear me?
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;1:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=interested.png,Anyway, that's nice armor. What's the make?
-3-female_removed_accessory,priority:381,count-role;target&character;mae&stage;1&saidmarker;heels:=happy.png,I know, right? The last time I tried wearing heels, I nearly broke my arm when I fell!
-3-female_removed_accessory,priority:382,count-role;target&character;nami&stage;3:=flustered.png,You're a pirate, huh...? Sorry, I guess books lead me to expect more scars and stuff.
-3-female_removed_accessory,priority:56,count-role;target&startinglayers;2-3:=happy.png,I guess as long as you don't start pulling threads off to survive, I'll let this slide.
-3-female_removed_accessory,priority:56,count-role;target&startinglayers;2-3:=happy.png,Maybe next time you should come a little more prepared?
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-exposed&role;target:=flustered.png,Well, I can't say I wouldn't have done the same thing...
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-exposed&role;target:=flustered.png,I-I'm going to let that slide, since you're... you know...
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-exposed&role;target:=flustered.png,I guess I can't really complain, because you're... you know...
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-exposed&role;target:,one-shot-id:2=flustered.png,Well, I can't say I wouldn't have done the same thing... Or maybe I can, because I would've taken ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~ off before anything else.
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:123=calm.png,I'd like to remind you that I have the authority to arrest you.
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:123=annoyed.png,There's strategic retreats, and then there's cowardice. You get what I'm saying?
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:123=facepalm.png,You're lucky I'm not corrupt, or else I would've arrested you for that.
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:123=interested.png,You do know I didn't get these scars by taking my clothes off, right?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1a=interested.png,Well, uh... I think you're actually wearing <i>more</i> clothes now, but I guess if it's up to luck, maybe you'll lose more next time?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1a=interested.png,Well, uh... I think you're wearing <i>more</i> clothing now, but since it's luck-based, I guess it's okay?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1b=interested.png,Well, uh... I think you're actually wearing <i>more</i> clothes now, but I guess if it's up to luck, maybe you'll lose more next time?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1b=interested.png,Well, uh... I think you're wearing <i>more</i> clothing now, but since it's luck-based, I guess it's okay?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2c,targetNotSaidMarker:1c=interested.png,That's a nice outfit, I suppose, but why is it missing a sleeve?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3b=interested.png,That's a nice outfit, I suppose, but why is it missing a sleeve?

-2-male_removed_accessory,count-exposed&role;target:=flustered.png,I-I'm going to let that slide, since you're... you know...
-2-male_removed_accessory,count-exposed&role;target:=flustered.png,I guess I can't really complain, because you're... you know...
-2-male_removed_accessory,count-exposed&role;target:,one-shot-id:3=flustered.png,Well, I can't say I wouldn't have done the same thing... Or maybe I can, because I would've taken ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~ off before anything else.
-2-male_removed_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:118=calm.png,I'd like to remind you that I have the authority to arrest you.
-2-male_removed_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:118=annoyed.png,There's strategic retreats, and then there's cowardice. You get what I'm saying?
-2-male_removed_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:118=facepalm.png,You're lucky I'm not corrupt, or else I would've arrested you for that.
-2-male_removed_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:118=interested.png,You do know I didn't get these scars by taking my clothes off, right?
-2-male_removed_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,count-role;target&character;ae86&stage;1:,id:199=annoyed.png,You could've at least picked a <i>sexy</i> car model, like a 1958 Cadillac Eldorado.
-2-male_removed_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,count-role;target&character;ae86&stage;1:,id:199=enthused.png,This car sucks. You wanna see a sexy vehicle, check out the G5 Odyssey Scylla. They got six beefy Arc Engines on that thing!
-2-female_removing_accessory=sad.png,At this point, I don't have a reason to be mad. I've already lost.
-2-female_removing_accessory=sad.png,I lost already. I can't really get mad.
-2-female_removing_accessory=sad.png,Take off whatever you want... I don't care anymore...
-2-female_removing_accessory=interested.png,Y-you still have ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~? Er, why?
-2-female_removing_accessory=calm.png,I can't say I understand why you kept ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~ for as long as you did...
-2-female_removing_accessory=flustered.png,I would've thought you'd have taken ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~ off before you... became exposed...
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;korra&stage;0:=interested.png,"Earth bending?" How do you bend earth?
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;korra&stage;0:=interested.png,"Earth bending?" You can't bend the ground... Can you?...
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;3:,id:40=interested.png,A Manatrocity is what happens when you're not careful with using magic on a living creature.
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;rarity_eg&stage;0:=flustered.png,Admittedly it's more from necessity, but fashion is a fun subject, too!
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;syrenne&stage;1:=interested.png,Although I guess "mercenary" implies I ask for pay up front? I don't ask for any payment. I just like helping people.
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;megumin&stage;0:=thinking.png,Come to think of it, I believe he has a hat really similar to the one you're wearing. Funny coincidence!
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nami&stage;0:,id:27=interested.png,Control the weather? That must take a lot of mana to use, huh?
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;meia&stage;0:=interested.png,Does your monocle really mean that much to you, Meia? You can still see fine in your other eye, right?
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;5:=competitive.png,Don't worry, Blake, if anyone judges you, I'll punch them in the face!
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;catria&stage;0:=competitive.png,Don't worry, Catria, if anyone attacks us, <i>I'll</i> deal with them. I certainly don't need weapons to deal with threats!
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;spooky&stage;0:=annoyed.png,Hey, wait, you had a knife? You weren't going to hurt anyone, were you?
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;rinkah&stage;1&saying;cold:=calm.png,I could use some boots like that, myself. I have trouble with the cold.
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;2:=calm.png,I mind a little bit...
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;ribbon_girl&stage;0:=calm.png,I see. What about those weird gloves you're wearing? Are they related to your powers too?
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1-3:=interested.png,I wonder what the outcome will be this time?
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1-3:=interested.png,I hope the outcome will be good.
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1-3:=interested.png,How likely is a bad roll?
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1-3:=interested.png,What could possibly go wrong?
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1-3:=interested.png,I'm sure the odds are in your favor, huh?
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;0:=interested.png,If by "get lucky" you mean "get critical hits," then no, I don't get them very often.
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;chiaki&stage;1&saying;debuffs:=happy.png,I'm certain you won't. <i>I</i> can't cast any, at least!
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;chiaki&stage;1&saying;debuffs:=happy.png,You won't have to worry about any debuffs from <i>me</i> at least! All of my debuffs are dealt on-hit, and I won't be hitting you any time soon!
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;mary&stage;0:=happy.png,I'm not really a sandal person, myself. You probably already knew that because I came here in boots, though.
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;lotte&stage;0:=flustered.png,I'm not very good with magic, myself. I can conjure flames and whatnot well enough, but making them into a projectile just doesn't happen.
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sayaka&stage;0:=happy.png,In my world, people tend to become a particular type of mage. My friend Timbo is a red mage, for example.
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;3:=happy.png,Is your bag magic at all, Moon? I recently started using magic bag myself, and they're really fantastic.
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;mahiru&stage;0:=happy.png,It looks like one of those focused lanterns, that project light into a beam.
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shamir&stage;0:,id:299=happy.png,I've dabbled in archery a bit myself, but I prefer melee weapons. My sister's pretty good with bows, though.
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;5&saidmarker;pinka_start&notsaidmarker;pinka_end2:=happy.png,No knife accident? No death threat? I think she's turning back to normal!
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sayla&stage;0&sayingmarker;sayla_boots_back_later:=interested.png,Of course... I think...
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nami&stage;2:,id:28=calm.png,Oh! Looks like you dropped something, Nami.
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;0:,marker:SewingMagic=happy.png,Oh! Sewing magic, huh? Did you study Etsuko's books too?
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;0:,marker:SewingMagic=happy.png,Oh! Sewing magic, huh? I'm a practitioner of it myself.
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;0&saidmarker;fled:=interested.png,Oh! Uh, is she going to come back?
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;0&saidmarker;fled:=interested.png,Oh! Uh, should we just continue without her?...
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;larachel&stage;1:,id:23=sad.png,Oh, looks like your staff ran out of mana.
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;yuelia&stage;1&sayingmarker;fast_learning:,id:43=enthused.png,Oh, that's pretty cool! Enchanted items are always really neat!
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;ini&stage;0&saidmarker;bracelets:=flustered.png,Oh, well, that's cool too, I guess... So much for recovering lost knowledge...
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;0:=calm.png,Oh, you're a <i>love</i> fairy... But then why's your name "Queue?"
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;1:=flustered.png,Say, you haven't... started any wars, have you? With your assassinations?
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;0:=shocked.png,Shimakaze! Your gloves are on fire!
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;0:=shocked.png,Your gloves! They're on fire!
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;1:=interested.png,So what kind of fairy are you <i>really</i>? Maybe a white magic fairy, hence the hearts on your outfit?
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;ribbon_girl&stage;1:=happy.png,Sounds like you have a fair amount of options. Do you have any more?
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;lyn&stage;0:=interested.png,That must be the name of your sword, huh?
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;croix&stage;1:=interested.png,That's really cool. What are "magitronics," though?
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;0:=happy.png,That's the right way to play this game in my book: keep your modesty for as long as possible!
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;morrigan&stage;1:=interested.png,To be clear, I'm not afraid of bats, but I reserve the right to punch them if they get too close.
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;5:=flustered.png,Uh... Y-yeah, I guess I can say it's been fun...
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;1:,id:39=interested.png,Um, you're not going to keep transforming when you lose, are you, Akko?
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;alice_mgq:=annoyed.png,Well, whatever it is, it'd better be worth stalling for.
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;marinette&stage;0:=interested.png,Where I come from, ~name~, people don't dress in weird outfits unless it relates to their magic specialization.
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;yuelia&stage;0&sayingmarker;transformation:,id:42=shocked.png,Woah! Y-you're human!
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;1:=interested.png,Wouldn't that require your shoes to be small and cramped?
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;mae&stage;0&sayingmarker;heels:=flustered.png,Yeah, I don't understand heels either. They just seem like more trouble than they're worth.
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;supernova&stage;0:=interested.png,You certainly don't look like you came from the same kind of world as me. What's yours like?
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;2:=annoyed.png,You forgot already? Where's your head at?
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;1:=interested.png,You, uh... had to be <i>told</i> to do that?...
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;1:=interested.png,You had to be <i>told</i> to do that? I thought that was just common sense.
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;1:=shocked.png,Your boots! Where did those holes come from?
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;0:=happy.png,You're an assassin, huh? My sister is a thief. Those classes are adjacent, right?
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&layers;3-4:=interested.png,Y-you still have ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~? Er, why?
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&layers;3-4:=calm.png,I can't say I understand why you kept ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~ for as long as you did...
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&layers;3-4:=flustered.png,I would've thought you'd have taken ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~ off before you... became exposed...
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;0:,count-role;self&saidmarker;SewingMagic:=happy.png,Oh, you know Sewing Magic too, Vriska? What're the odds that the three of us all would?
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;0:,count-role;self&saidmarker;SewingMagic:=happy.png,Oh, you know Sewing Magic too, Vriska? Gosh, Etsuko's books must be more popular than I thought!
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;hanako&stage;0:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:231=interested.png,An... accident?... How? How does one burn only half of their face in a house fire?
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;hanako&stage;0:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:231=facepalm.png,House fire accidents don't burn people perfectly down the middle of their faces. What is this, a comic book?
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;0:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:201=calm.png,Not that I'm <i>expecting</i> a fight, but you never know, right?
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;misato&stage;0:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:228=happy.png,You must've done some pretty awesome things in the process of achieving that rank. You should share some stories sometime.
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;meia&stage;0:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:196=flustered.png,You're a pirate, huh? I should be arresting you, but <i>technically</i> I'm off the clock, so... I can pretend you're not a pirate.
-2-female_removing_accessory,priority:381,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;3:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:241=calm.png,A Manatrocity is what happens when you're not careful with using magic on a living creature. You don't choose to become one, it's just happens.
-2-female_removing_accessory,priority:381,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;1:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:238=annoyed.png,So you're just gonna ignore me, huh? Alright, once this game is over, you're coming with me. <i>In cuffs.</i>
-2-female_removing_accessory,priority:56,count-role;target&startinglayers;3-4:=flustered.png,Alright, sure. You didn't come here with much, after all...
-2-female_removing_accessory,priority:56,count-role;target&startinglayers;3-4:=flustered.png,I... supppose it's only fair we let you count ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-exposed&role;target:=interested.png,Y-you still have ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~? Er, why?
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-exposed&role;target:=calm.png,I can't say I understand why you kept ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~ for as long as you did...
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-exposed&role;target:=flustered.png,I would've thought you'd have taken ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~ off before you... became exposed...
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:120=facepalm.png,You're kidding, right?
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:120=facepalm.png,Such insubordination...
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:120=interested.png,Not feeling very bold now, eh?
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:120=annoyed.png,I think you need to check your azimuth there, ~name~.
-2-female_removed_accessory=interested.png,That's a nice outfit, I suppose, but why is it missing a sleeve?
-2-female_removed_accessory=flustered.png,Well, I can't say I wouldn't have done the same thing...
-2-female_removed_accessory=flustered.png,I-I'm going to let that slide, since you're... you know...
-2-female_removed_accessory=flustered.png,I guess I can't really complain, because you're... you know...
-2-female_removed_accessory,one-shot-id:2=flustered.png,Well, I can't say I wouldn't have done the same thing... Or maybe I can, because I would've taken ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~ off before anything else.
-2-female_removed_accessory=interested.png,Well, uh... I think you're actually wearing <i>more</i> clothes now, but I guess if it's up to luck, maybe you'll lose more next time?
-2-female_removed_accessory=interested.png,Well, uh... I think you're wearing <i>more</i> clothing now, but since it's luck-based, I guess it's okay?
-2-female_removed_accessory=sad.png,You could take off everything or nothing, it doesn't make a difference to me...
-2-female_removed_accessory=interested.png,I think you could at least be nicer to your opponents, though...
-2-female_removed_accessory=interested.png,I can't say the same for anyone else, though...
-2-female_removed_accessory=calm.png,You should be careful about being a sore winner, though.
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;spooky&stage;1:=angry.png,A-are you going to count that? That's barely fair!
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;mahiru&stage;1:=flustered.png,Admittedly, I never liked those lanterns. I find it more comforting having a wider radius of light.
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;4&saidmarker;dizzy:=shocked.png,Are you okay, Shimakaze?
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;lyn&stage;2:=flustered.png,D-did anyone else hear a small tune just now...?
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;1:=shocked.png,D-did you do that intentionally? You're oddly calm.
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;1:=interested.png,Do you know any invisibility spells like she does? They must be pretty vital to your skill set.
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;lotte&stage;1:=interested.png,Er, wait, you're counting your wand? But that's not even clothing.
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;chiaki&stage;1&saying;HP:=happy.png,Good! I wouldn't want you dying on us in the middle of a match!
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4b:=interested.png,Gosh, that is quite the small shirt.
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;larachel&stage;2:=annoyed.png,Hey, wait a minute, you weren't trying to attack us with a spell, were you?
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;2:=interested.png,Huh. Yeah. I guess that would do the trick too.
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;lyn&stage;1:=happy.png,I don't name my weapons, personally, but I did once wield an axe that was living, and <i>that</i> had a name!
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;rinkah&stage;2:=flustered.png,I wish I could say the same. I get cold even in Summer...
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;3:=interested.png,If you hate the accessories rule so much, why'd you wear any?... I mean, except for your shoes.
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;mary&stage;1:,id:294=thinking.png,If you made them steel-toed, would they even be sandals anymore? At that point they're just shoes, and wouldn't that defeat the purpose?
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;4:=annoyed.png,Magic is chaotic by nature, and it can overwhelm living things and turn them into mindless, spellcasting monsters. 
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;yuelia&stage;1&sayingmarker;real_name:=happy.png,Nice to meet the real you, Yuelia. Were you a butterfly on purpose? My friend Timbo turned me into a chicken on accident once.
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;mae&stage;1&sayingmarker;nightmarefeet:=interested.png,Nightmare... feet?
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;revy&stage;4:=facepalm.png,No one was trying to touch your things!
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;ini&stage;2:=sad.png,Oh no. That's unfortunate.
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1c:,marker:VriskaDress=happy.png,Oh wow! What a lovely dress!
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1c:,marker:VriskaDress=happy.png,Oh wow! You look very lovely now, Vriska!
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1c:=happy.png,Oh wow! What a grand dress! I honestly wasn't expecting that!
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2b:=happy.png,Oh! What a lovely outfit!
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;lucina&stage;1:,id:25=horny.png,Oh! Y-you're... a princ<i>ess</i>? Th-that's cool too, I guess...
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4a:=interested.png,Oh, did you re-class into a Ladybug Mage?
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4a:=interested.png,Oh. I guess you re-classed into a Ladybug Mage?
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4c:=interested.png,Oh, did you re-class into a Monk?
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4c:=interested.png,Oh. I guess you re-classed into a Monk now?
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3a:=interested.png,Oh, did you re-class into a Ranger?
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3a:=interested.png,Oh. I guess you re-classed into a Ranger now?
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3a:=happy.png,Oh, are you a Ranger now? My sister is a Ranger! Well, technically a Thief, but same thing, basically.
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;ribbon_girl&stage;1:=happy.png,Oh, like magic gauntlets! That's really neat!
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;6&saidmarker;pinka_start&notsaidmarker;pinka_end2:=sad.png,Oh, never mind. I think that was a death threat...
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;2:=enthused.png,Oh, or maybe you're one of four <i>card</i> fairies, and that's why your at this poker game! Can you give me some fortune for this match? Or is that why you didn't want us knowing?
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;meia&stage;1:=happy.png,Oh, so it's just a decoration? It sure looks like it has a purpose.
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3c:=happy.png,Oh, what a nice sweater!
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3c:=happy.png,Ooh, I like that sweater!
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;6:=interested.png,Oh, you were just hiding cat ears? I've had stranger-looking allies than a person with cat ears.
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;6:=interested.png,Um, not to put you down or anything, Blake, but I've fought alongside a walking flower and the Demon Lord of Wounds; cat ears are not shocking to me.
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;6:=interested.png,Uh, sorry but, is that it? Just cat ears? My friend Pernilla is a walking flower. You look normal compared to her.
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;6:=interested.png,Sorry, but after dealing with a formless, mind-bending monster, everyone else looks normal to me.
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;6:=interested.png,Sorry, but I'm not surprised. I guess I got desensitized by the evil, formless monster I defeated not too long ago. He was quite a weird one...
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;6:=interested.png,Sorry, Blake, but I'm not surprised at all. With all the weird creatures I've seen, I've learned to stop questioning peoples' appearance.
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2a:=interested.png,Oh. I guess you re-classed into a Swashbuckler now?
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2a:=interested.png,Oh, did you re-class into a Swashbuckler?
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;supernova&stage;1-4:,id:309=happy.png,Our worlds must be quite different. I've never even heard of "skyscrapers!"
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;syrenne&stage;2:=happy.png,People do tend to reward me, though, which is always nice.
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;ribbon_girl&stage;2:=enthused.png,Really? You'll have to teach me more about them!
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;megumin&stage;1:=flustered.png,Say, y-you don't know any transmogrification spells, do you? My friend turned me into a chicken once, and I'd like to avoid doing that again...
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;rarity_eg&stage;1:=interested.png,So do you make your outfits by hand, or do you know sewing magic too?
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;marinette&stage;1:=interested.png,So, by that logic, you must be a Ladybug Mage, right?
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;1:=calm.png,That's fine. You don't have to stay here if you don't want to.
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;2:=interested.png,This is... really bizarre.
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;1:=interested.png,Uh, I guess so...
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;4:=interested.png,Um... Moon?... Did you hear my question?...

-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&layers;2-3:,one-shot-id:2=flustered.png,Well, I can't say I wouldn't have done the same thing... Or maybe I can, because I would've taken ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~ off before anything else.
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;alice_mgq:=shocked.png,Whoa! Y-your a Lamia? So it <i>is</i> true that you can disguise yourselves!
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;1:=interested.png,W-wait a minute, love fairies don't exist. Fairies don't control emotions, emotions are as natural as breathing.
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;6:=flustered.png,W-why does that make me nervous...?
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;2:=annoyed.png,You really shouldn't toy with magic like that, especially not transformation spells. We wouldn't want you to turn into a Manatrocity.
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;morrigan&stage;2:=happy.png,You'd have to be pretty low-level for <i>bats</i> to give you trouble, anyhow!

-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;2:=flustered.png,You, uh... sure are eager to get n-naked, huh?

-2-female_removed_accessory,priority:381,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;4:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:242=annoyed.png,Magic is chaotic by nature, and it can overwhelm living things and turn them into mindless, spellcasting monsters. Frankly, you're endangering us.
-2-female_removed_accessory,priority:381,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;2:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:239=calm.png,Oh, and if you end up getting yourself turned into a Manatrocity, I won't hesitate to pump you full of lead.
-2-female_removed_accessory,priority:381,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;1:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:237=annoyed.png,You look rather young, so I'll give you the benefit of the doubt. Transformation magic is illegal because it's dangerous, so don't do it, you hear me?
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;1:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=interested.png,Anyway, that's nice armor. What's the make?
-2-female_removed_accessory,priority:381,count-role;target&character;mae&stage;1&saidmarker;heels:=happy.png,I know, right? The last time I tried wearing heels, I nearly broke my arm when I fell!
-2-female_removed_accessory,priority:382,count-role;target&character;nami&stage;3:=flustered.png,You're a pirate, huh...? Sorry, I guess books lead me to expect more scars and stuff.
-2-female_removed_accessory,priority:56,count-role;target&startinglayers;2-3:=happy.png,I guess as long as you don't start pulling threads off to survive, I'll let this slide.

-2-female_removed_accessory,count-exposed&role;target:=flustered.png,Well, I can't say I wouldn't have done the same thing...
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-exposed&role;target:=flustered.png,I-I'm going to let that slide, since you're... you know...
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-exposed&role;target:=flustered.png,I guess I can't really complain, because you're... you know...

-2-female_removed_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:123=annoyed.png,There's strategic retreats, and then there's cowardice. You get what I'm saying?
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:123=facepalm.png,You're lucky I'm not corrupt, or else I would've arrested you for that.
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:123=interested.png,You do know I didn't get these scars by taking my clothes off, right?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1a=interested.png,Well, uh... I think you're actually wearing <i>more</i> clothes now, but I guess if it's up to luck, maybe you'll lose more next time?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1a=interested.png,Well, uh... I think you're wearing <i>more</i> clothing now, but since it's luck-based, I guess it's okay?

-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;syrenne&stage;1:=interested.png,Although I guess "mercenary" implies I ask for pay up front? I don't ask for any payment. I just like helping people.

-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sayla&stage;0&sayingmarker;sayla_boots_back_later:=interested.png,Of course... I think...
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;nami&stage;2:,id:28=calm.png,Oh! Looks like you dropped something, Nami.
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;0:,marker:SewingMagic=happy.png,Oh! Sewing magic, huh? Did you study Etsuko's books too?
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;0:,marker:SewingMagic=happy.png,Oh! Sewing magic, huh? I'm a practitioner of it myself.
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;0&saidmarker;fled:=interested.png,Oh! Uh, is she going to come back?
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;0&saidmarker;fled:=interested.png,Oh! Uh, should we just continue without her?...
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;larachel&stage;1:,id:23=sad.png,Oh, looks like your staff ran out of mana.
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;yuelia&stage;1&sayingmarker;fast_learning:,id:43=enthused.png,Oh, that's pretty cool! Enchanted items are always really neat!
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;ini&stage;0&saidmarker;bracelets:=flustered.png,Oh, well, that's cool too, I guess... So much for recovering lost knowledge...
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;0:=calm.png,Oh, you're a <i>love</i> fairy... But then why's your name "Queue?"
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;1:=flustered.png,Say, you haven't... started any wars, have you? With your assassinations?
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;0:=shocked.png,Shimakaze! Your gloves are on fire!
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;0:=shocked.png,Your gloves! They're on fire!
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;1:=interested.png,So what kind of fairy are you <i>really</i>? Maybe a white magic fairy, hence the hearts on your outfit?
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;ribbon_girl&stage;1:=happy.png,Sounds like you have a fair amount of options. Do you have any more?
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;lyn&stage;0:=interested.png,That must be the name of your sword, huh?
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;croix&stage;1:=interested.png,That's really cool. What are "magitronics," though?
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;0:=happy.png,That's the right way to play this game in my book: keep your modesty for as long as possible!
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;morrigan&stage;1:=interested.png,To be clear, I'm not afraid of bats, but I reserve the right to punch them if they get too close.
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;5:=flustered.png,Uh... Y-yeah, I guess I can say it's been fun...
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;1:,id:39=interested.png,Um, you're not going to keep transforming when you lose, are you, Akko?
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;alice_mgq:=annoyed.png,Well, whatever it is, it'd better be worth stalling for.
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;marinette&stage;0:=interested.png,Where I come from, ~name~, people don't dress in weird outfits unless it relates to their magic specialization.
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;yuelia&stage;0&sayingmarker;transformation:,id:42=shocked.png,Woah! Y-you're human!
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;1:=interested.png,Wouldn't that require your shoes to be small and cramped?
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;mae&stage;0&sayingmarker;heels:=flustered.png,Yeah, I don't understand heels either. They just seem like more trouble than they're worth.
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;supernova&stage;0:=interested.png,You certainly don't look like you came from the same kind of world as me. What's yours like?
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;2:=annoyed.png,You forgot already? Where's your head at?
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;1:=interested.png,You, uh... had to be <i>told</i> to do that?...
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;1:=interested.png,You had to be <i>told</i> to do that? I thought that was just common sense.
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;1:=shocked.png,Your boots! Where did those holes come from?
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;0:=happy.png,You're an assassin, huh? My sister is a thief. Those classes are adjacent, right?
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&layers;3-4:=interested.png,Y-you still have ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~? Er, why?
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&layers;3-4:=calm.png,I can't say I understand why you kept ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~ for as long as you did...
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&layers;3-4:=flustered.png,I would've thought you'd have taken ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~ off before you... became exposed...
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;0:,count-role;self&saidmarker;SewingMagic:=happy.png,Oh, you know Sewing Magic too, Vriska? What're the odds that the three of us all would?
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;0:,count-role;self&saidmarker;SewingMagic:=happy.png,Oh, you know Sewing Magic too, Vriska? Gosh, Etsuko's books must be more popular than I thought!
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;hanako&stage;0:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:231=interested.png,An... accident?... How? How does one burn only half of their face in a house fire?
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;hanako&stage;0:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:231=facepalm.png,House fire accidents don't burn people perfectly down the middle of their faces. What is this, a comic book?
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;0:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:201=calm.png,Not that I'm <i>expecting</i> a fight, but you never know, right?
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;misato&stage;0:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:228=happy.png,You must've done some pretty awesome things in the process of achieving that rank. You should share some stories sometime.
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;meia&stage;0:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:196=flustered.png,You're a pirate, huh? I should be arresting you, but <i>technically</i> I'm off the clock, so... I can pretend you're not a pirate.
-1-female_removing_accessory,priority:381,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;3:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:241=calm.png,A Manatrocity is what happens when you're not careful with using magic on a living creature. You don't choose to become one, it's just happens.
-1-female_removing_accessory,priority:381,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;1:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:238=annoyed.png,So you're just gonna ignore me, huh? Alright, once this game is over, you're coming with me. <i>In cuffs.</i>
-1-female_removing_accessory,priority:56,count-role;target&startinglayers;3-4:=flustered.png,Alright, sure. You didn't come here with much, after all...
-1-female_removing_accessory,priority:56,count-role;target&startinglayers;3-4:=flustered.png,I... supppose it's only fair we let you count ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-exposed&role;target:=interested.png,Y-you still have ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~? Er, why?
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-exposed&role;target:=calm.png,I can't say I understand why you kept ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~ for as long as you did...
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-exposed&role;target:=flustered.png,I would've thought you'd have taken ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~ off before you... became exposed...
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:120=facepalm.png,You're kidding, right?
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:120=facepalm.png,Such insubordination...
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:120=interested.png,Not feeling very bold now, eh?
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:120=annoyed.png,I think you need to check your azimuth there, ~name~.
-1-female_removed_accessory=interested.png,That's a nice outfit, I suppose, but why is it missing a sleeve?
-1-female_removed_accessory=flustered.png,Well, I can't say I wouldn't have done the same thing...
-1-female_removed_accessory=flustered.png,I-I'm going to let that slide, since you're... you know...
-1-female_removed_accessory=flustered.png,I guess I can't really complain, because you're... you know...
-1-female_removed_accessory,one-shot-id:2=flustered.png,Well, I can't say I wouldn't have done the same thing... Or maybe I can, because I would've taken ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~ off before anything else.
-1-female_removed_accessory=interested.png,Well, uh... I think you're actually wearing <i>more</i> clothes now, but I guess if it's up to luck, maybe you'll lose more next time?
-1-female_removed_accessory=interested.png,Well, uh... I think you're wearing <i>more</i> clothing now, but since it's luck-based, I guess it's okay?
-1-female_removed_accessory=sad.png,You could take off everything or nothing, it doesn't make a difference to me...
-1-female_removed_accessory=interested.png,I think you could at least be nicer to your opponents, though...
-1-female_removed_accessory=interested.png,I can't say the same for anyone else, though...
-1-female_removed_accessory=calm.png,You should be careful about being a sore winner, though.
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;spooky&stage;1:=angry.png,A-are you going to count that? That's barely fair!
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;mahiru&stage;1:=flustered.png,Admittedly, I never liked those lanterns. I find it more comforting having a wider radius of light.
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;4&saidmarker;dizzy:=shocked.png,Are you okay, Shimakaze?
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;lyn&stage;2:=flustered.png,D-did anyone else hear a small tune just now...?
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;1:=shocked.png,D-did you do that intentionally? You're oddly calm.
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;1:=interested.png,Do you know any invisibility spells like she does? They must be pretty vital to your skill set.
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;lotte&stage;1:=interested.png,Er, wait, you're counting your wand? But that's not even clothing.
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;chiaki&stage;1&saying;HP:=happy.png,Good! I wouldn't want you dying on us in the middle of a match!
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4b:=interested.png,Gosh, that is quite the small shirt.
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;larachel&stage;2:=annoyed.png,Hey, wait a minute, you weren't trying to attack us with a spell, were you?
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;2:=interested.png,Huh. Yeah. I guess that would do the trick too.
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;lyn&stage;1:=happy.png,I don't name my weapons, personally, but I did once wield an axe that was living, and <i>that</i> had a name!
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;rinkah&stage;2:=flustered.png,I wish I could say the same. I get cold even in Summer...
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;3:=interested.png,If you hate the accessories rule so much, why'd you wear any?... I mean, except for your shoes.
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;mary&stage;1:,id:294=thinking.png,If you made them steel-toed, would they even be sandals anymore? At that point they're just shoes, and wouldn't that defeat the purpose?
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;4:=annoyed.png,Magic is chaotic by nature, and it can overwhelm living things and turn them into mindless, spellcasting monsters. 
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;yuelia&stage;1&sayingmarker;real_name:=happy.png,Nice to meet the real you, Yuelia. Were you a butterfly on purpose? My friend Timbo turned me into a chicken on accident once.
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;mae&stage;1&sayingmarker;nightmarefeet:=interested.png,Nightmare... feet?
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;revy&stage;4:=facepalm.png,No one was trying to touch your things!
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;ini&stage;2:=sad.png,Oh no. That's unfortunate.
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1c:,marker:VriskaDress=happy.png,Oh wow! What a lovely dress!
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1c:,marker:VriskaDress=happy.png,Oh wow! You look very lovely now, Vriska!
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1c:=happy.png,Oh wow! What a grand dress! I honestly wasn't expecting that!
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2b:=happy.png,Oh! What a lovely outfit!
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;lucina&stage;1:,id:25=horny.png,Oh! Y-you're... a princ<i>ess</i>? Th-that's cool too, I guess...
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4a:=interested.png,Oh, did you re-class into a Ladybug Mage?
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4a:=interested.png,Oh. I guess you re-classed into a Ladybug Mage?
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4c:=interested.png,Oh, did you re-class into a Monk?
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4c:=interested.png,Oh. I guess you re-classed into a Monk now?
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3a:=interested.png,Oh, did you re-class into a Ranger?
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3a:=interested.png,Oh. I guess you re-classed into a Ranger now?
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3a:=happy.png,Oh, are you a Ranger now? My sister is a Ranger! Well, technically a Thief, but same thing, basically.
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;ribbon_girl&stage;1:=happy.png,Oh, like magic gauntlets! That's really neat!
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;6&saidmarker;pinka_start&notsaidmarker;pinka_end2:=sad.png,Oh, never mind. I think that was a death threat...
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;2:=enthused.png,Oh, or maybe you're one of four <i>card</i> fairies, and that's why your at this poker game! Can you give me some fortune for this match? Or is that why you didn't want us knowing?
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;meia&stage;1:=happy.png,Oh, so it's just a decoration? It sure looks like it has a purpose.
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3c:=happy.png,Oh, what a nice sweater!
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3c:=happy.png,Ooh, I like that sweater!
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;6:=interested.png,Oh, you were just hiding cat ears? I've had stranger-looking allies than a person with cat ears.
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;6:=interested.png,Um, not to put you down or anything, Blake, but I've fought alongside a walking flower and the Demon Lord of Wounds; cat ears are not shocking to me.
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;6:=interested.png,Uh, sorry but, is that it? Just cat ears? My friend Pernilla is a walking flower. You look normal compared to her.
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;6:=interested.png,Sorry, but after dealing with a formless, mind-bending monster, everyone else looks normal to me.
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;6:=interested.png,Sorry, but I'm not surprised. I guess I got desensitized by the evil, formless monster I defeated not too long ago. He was quite a weird one...
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;6:=interested.png,Sorry, Blake, but I'm not surprised at all. With all the weird creatures I've seen, I've learned to stop questioning peoples' appearance.
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2a:=interested.png,Oh. I guess you re-classed into a Swashbuckler now?
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2a:=interested.png,Oh, did you re-class into a Swashbuckler?
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;supernova&stage;1-4:,id:309=happy.png,Our worlds must be quite different. I've never even heard of "skyscrapers!"
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;syrenne&stage;2:=happy.png,People do tend to reward me, though, which is always nice.
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;ribbon_girl&stage;2:=enthused.png,Really? You'll have to teach me more about them!
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;megumin&stage;1:=flustered.png,Say, y-you don't know any transmogrification spells, do you? My friend turned me into a chicken once, and I'd like to avoid doing that again...
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;rarity_eg&stage;1:=interested.png,So do you make your outfits by hand, or do you know sewing magic too?
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;marinette&stage;1:=interested.png,So, by that logic, you must be a Ladybug Mage, right?
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;natsuki&stage;1:=calm.png,That's fine. You don't have to stay here if you don't want to.
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;shimakaze&stage;2:=interested.png,This is... really bizarre.
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;1:=interested.png,Uh, I guess so...
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;4:=interested.png,Um... Moon?... Did you hear my question?...
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;1&saidmarker;fled:=happy.png,Well, at least you came back!
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;1&saidmarker;fled:=happy.png,Don't sweat it, Florina! You came back, at least!
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&layers;2-3:=flustered.png,Well, I can't say I wouldn't have done the same thing...
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&layers;2-3:=flustered.png,I-I'm going to let that slide, since you're... you know...
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&layers;2-3:=flustered.png,I guess I can't really complain, because you're... you know...
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&layers;2-3:,one-shot-id:2=flustered.png,Well, I can't say I wouldn't have done the same thing... Or maybe I can, because I would've taken ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~ off before anything else.
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;alice_mgq:=shocked.png,Whoa! Y-your a Lamia? So it <i>is</i> true that you can disguise yourselves!
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;kyu&stage;1:=interested.png,W-wait a minute, love fairies don't exist. Fairies don't control emotions, emotions are as natural as breathing.
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;6:=flustered.png,W-why does that make me nervous...?
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;2:=annoyed.png,You really shouldn't toy with magic like that, especially not transformation spells. We wouldn't want you to turn into a Manatrocity.
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;morrigan&stage;2:=happy.png,You'd have to be pretty low-level for <i>bats</i> to give you trouble, anyhow!
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;2:=flustered.png,You're really, uh... enthusiastic about this game, huh?
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;2:=flustered.png,You, uh... sure are eager to get n-naked, huh?
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1a:,count-role;other&character;link:,marker:VriskaLink=interested.png,Oh, you, uh... copied Link's outfit?
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1&saidmarker;1a:,count-role;other&character;link:,marker:VriskaLink=interested.png,Oh. You must really like Link's outfit, huh?
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3a:,count-role;other&character;ruby:=interested.png,Oh, you, uh... copied Ruby's outfit?
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3a:,count-role;other&character;ruby:=interested.png,Oh. You must really like Ruby's outfit, huh?
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3b:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=interested.png,Oh, you, uh... copied Zone-tan's outfit?
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3b:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=interested.png,Oh. You must really like Zone-tan's outfit, huh?
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1:,count-role;other&character;chun-li:=calm.png,She's right, Chun-Li. The die technically counts... for better or worse.
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2b:,count-role;self&saidmarker;VriskaDress:=happy.png,You still look lovely, Vriska.
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3b:,count-role;self&saidmarker;VriskaLink:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=interested.png,You copied Ruby's outfit now? Why do you keep doing that?
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3b:,count-role;self&saidmarker;VriskaLink:,count-role;other&character;zone-tan:=interested.png,Why do you keep copying people's outfits?
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3a:,count-role;self&saidmarker;VriskaLink:,count-role;other&character;ruby:=interested.png,You copied Zone-tan's outfit now? Why do you keep doing that?
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3a:,count-role;self&saidmarker;VriskaLink:,count-role;other&character;ruby:=interested.png,Why do you keep copying people's outfits?
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;misato&stage;1:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:229=interested.png,Say, who're you enlisted with? I don't recognize your uniform.
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;hanako&stage;1:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:232=calm.png,Until you give me a more logical answer, I'm going to believe you were attacked.
-1-female_removed_accessory,priority:381,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;4:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:242=annoyed.png,Magic is chaotic by nature, and it can overwhelm living things and turn them into mindless, spellcasting monsters. Frankly, you're endangering us.
-1-female_removed_accessory,priority:381,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;2:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:239=calm.png,Oh, and if you end up getting yourself turned into a Manatrocity, I won't hesitate to pump you full of lead.

-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;sei&stage;1:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=interested.png,Anyway, that's nice armor. What's the make?

-1-female_removed_accessory,count-exposed&role;target:,one-shot-id:2=flustered.png,Well, I can't say I wouldn't have done the same thing... Or maybe I can, because I would've taken ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~ off before anything else.

-1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1a=interested.png,Well, uh... I think you're actually wearing <i>more</i> clothes now, but I guess if it's up to luck, maybe you'll lose more next time?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1a=interested.png,Well, uh... I think you're wearing <i>more</i> clothing now, but since it's luck-based, I guess it's okay?

0-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;meia&stage;1:=happy.png,It's always fun to compare different cultures' armor sets. So what can you tell me about your armor, Meia?
0-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;1:=calm.png,It's just your jacket. That shouldn't be so bad.
0-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kyoko&stage;5:=shocked.png,Oh gosh! No wonder you didn't want to take off your gloves!

0-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;0:=interested.png,Sure, it's a nice set - I just noticed; you're not wearing shoes. Why wear armor on all of your body but your feet?
0-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;0:=interested.png,Sure, it's a nice set - I just noticed; you're not wearing shoes. Why wear gloves, yet not shoes?
0-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;0:=interested.png,Sure, it's a nice set - I just noticed; you're not wearing shoes. Your feet are arguably one of the most important parts of your body to cover.
0-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:=interested.png,Well, I guess this method does make your item choice more of a surprise.
0-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;sakura&stage;2:=shocked.png,Wh-what the--?
0-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;rarity_eg&stage;1:=thinking.png,You and Etsuko have the same accent... Now that I think about it, you also both make clothes and have pale skin, too...

0-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;2:=thinking.png,<i>Phew</i>, you undid it... I wonder how dangerous transformation magic is for magical beings like genies...
0-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;tharja&stage;1:=interested.png,A-anyway, what kind of spells do you know? My black mage friend Etsuko can summon monsters and curse people.
0-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:=calm.png,Case in point; I had no idea you were removing your footwear.
0-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;sonya:=interested.png,Face paint? Here? Now? Why?
0-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;1:=calm.png,Have you ever tried sandals? I'm sure they'd be a good middle ground between not wearing shoes and protecting your feet.
0-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;sakura&stage;4:=flustered.png,I don't know any healing magic, so I can't help you if you can't reattach your head on your own.
0-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;kyoko&stage;6:=interested.png,I know an alchemist who might be able to help, curatives are his specialty. He's sure to have something for burn scars.
0-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;futaba&stage;1:=interested.png,I mean, it's not really my fault that you look so much like her.
0-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;futaba&stage;1:=interested.png,Like I said, you look a lot like her. I think my train of thought is perfectly reasonable.
0-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;moon:=sad.png,I never thought it'd ever be so uncomfortable with someone taking off their hat...
0-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&layers;2-3:=interested.png,If I can be honest, I didn't like how you looked with ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~ on like that anyway.
0-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&layers;2-3:=happy.png,I think you look better now, anyway.
0-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;3:=interested.png,I'll admit, that's what I was thinking too, Sheena.
0-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika&stage;1:=thinking.png,I'm sure Etsuko would come if I just ask... <i>Maybe</i>...
0-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;mae&stage;2:=happy.png,I've never seen anyone take off their socks without their hands before. Your dexterity stat must be pretty good!
0-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;amy&stage;1:=happy.png,My mentor Etsuko invented a school of magic, so I'm sure she could teach you how to do it!
0-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;rin&stage;1:=calm.png,No, I don't know any myself, but I bet my friend Etsuko has a spellbook somewhere in her tower!
0-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;emi&stage;7:,id:37=enthused.png,Oh wow, those are pretty cool! It's like you're part puppet!... But wait, where's the strings?
0-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;emi&stage;7:,id:37=enthused.png,Wow, your legs are pretty cool! I never thought about replacing lost limbs with puppet parts before! So where are the strings?
0-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;ribbon_girl&stage;3:=thinking.png,Oh, right, I guess without the same powers as you, I wouldn't be able to use it right, huh?
0-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;erufuda&stage;1:,id:315=thinking.png,Oh, they're not secret! At least, I don't think they are...
0-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;1:=interested.png,Remind me, what sort of spells do dancers learn?
0-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;2:=happy.png,See, you look fine! It's just your shoulders!
0-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;5&saidmarker;bee2&notsaidmarker;bee_stop:=flustered.png,That was... Odd. Uh, sorry about your tunic, Florina.
0-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;5&saidmarker;bee2&notsaidmarker;bee_stop:=interested.png,That was... Bizarre. You wouldn't happen to have any Bee mage enemies, would you?
0-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;5&saidmarker;bee2&notsaidmarker;bee_stop:=interested.png,That was... Strange. You wouldn't happen to have any enemies who know Bee magic, would you?
0-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;croix&stage;5:=flustered.png,To be honest, I wouldn't have been surprised...
0-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;3:=interested.png,You... don't actually have this under control, do you?

1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;larachel&stage;0:=flustered.png,I never could get the hang of white magic, myself. It's like, you have to focus your mana into bodily energy, or something?

1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;rin&stage;0:=happy.png,I think it'd help you out a lot to learn butlery magic. There's all sorts of things that you can move with it!
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;chiaki&stage;2&saying;uniform:=interested.png,I... don't think that's how a uniform works.
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;amy&stage;0:=thinking.png,I'm actually not sure how this works, but in my world, you can turn any passion into a school of magic.
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;croix&stage;4:=interested.png,I'm... okay with that.
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;meia&stage;1:=happy.png,It's always fun to compare different cultures' armor sets. So what can you tell me about your armor, Meia?
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;1:=calm.png,It's just your jacket. That shouldn't be so bad.
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kyoko&stage;5:=shocked.png,Oh gosh! No wonder you didn't want to take off your gloves!
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;1&sayingmarker;monkey:,id:278=shocked.png,Oh no! You're a monkey! C-can you turn back?
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;sakura&stage;3:,id:4=shocked.png,Oh no! Y-you can reattach that, right?
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;0:,id:277=thinking.png,Oh, right, I see by your outfit that you're a dancer. I guess dancers can't exactly be evil... probably.
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;tharja&stage;0:=flustered.png,Oh, uh, I meant I'm in this world because of her, n-not playing this game. Playing this game was my idea.
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika&stage;0:,id:17=flustered.png,Oh? Were we supposed to bring friends...?
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;sonya:=interested.png,Oh? What are you doing?
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;4:=flustered.png,Personally, I'm glad you have to remove your hat first...

1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;futaba&stage;0:=flustered.png,S-sorry! I didn't mean to insult your height...
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;0:=interested.png,Sure, it's a nice set - I just noticed; you're not wearing shoes. Why wear armor on all of your body but your feet?
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;0:=interested.png,Sure, it's a nice set - I just noticed; you're not wearing shoes. Why wear gloves, yet not shoes?
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;0:=interested.png,Sure, it's a nice set - I just noticed; you're not wearing shoes. Your feet are arguably one of the most important parts of your body to cover.
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:=interested.png,Well, I guess this method does make your item choice more of a surprise.
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;sakura&stage;2:=shocked.png,Wh-what the--?
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;rarity_eg&stage;1:=thinking.png,You and Etsuko have the same accent... Now that I think about it, you also both make clothes and have pale skin, too...
1-female_removing_minor,priority:381,count-role;target&character;rin&stage;0:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:208=calm.png,I've always been pretty against the idea of Augments myself, but I like having two arms more, so I got one when I lost my arm in battle.
1-female_removing_minor,priority:381,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:217=angry.png,Seriously, would you cut that out? Someone's gonna get hurt, and if you keep it up, I'll ensure that it's <i>you</i>!
1-female_removing_minor,priority:381,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:215=facepalm.png,What a waste of ammo...
1-female_removing_minor,priority:382,count-role;target&character;mae&stage;1&saidmarker;nightmarefeet&sayingmarker;nightmarefeet2:=interested.png,I'll admit, I am curious.
1-female_removing_minor,count-exposed&role;target:=happy.png,I suppose taking ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~ off won't make much of a difference, huh?
1-female_removing_minor,count-exposed&role;target:=interested.png,Well, ~clothing.ifPlural(those aren't|that isn't)~ really doing you any favors right now.

1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;2:=thinking.png,<i>Phew</i>, you undid it... I wonder how dangerous transformation magic is for magical beings like genies...
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;tharja&stage;1:=interested.png,A-anyway, what kind of spells do you know? My black mage friend Etsuko can summon monsters and curse people.
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:=calm.png,Case in point; I had no idea you were removing your footwear.
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;sonya:=interested.png,Face paint? Here? Now? Why?
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;1:=calm.png,Have you ever tried sandals? I'm sure they'd be a good middle ground between not wearing shoes and protecting your feet.
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;sakura&stage;4:=flustered.png,I don't know any healing magic, so I can't help you if you can't reattach your head on your own.
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;kyoko&stage;6:=interested.png,I know an alchemist who might be able to help, curatives are his specialty. He's sure to have something for burn scars.
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;futaba&stage;1:=interested.png,I mean, it's not really my fault that you look so much like her.
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;futaba&stage;1:=interested.png,Like I said, you look a lot like her. I think my train of thought is perfectly reasonable.
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;moon:=sad.png,I never thought it'd ever be so uncomfortable with someone taking off their hat...
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&layers;2-3:=interested.png,If I can be honest, I didn't like how you looked with ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~ on like that anyway.
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&layers;2-3:=happy.png,I think you look better now, anyway.
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;3:=interested.png,I'll admit, that's what I was thinking too, Sheena.
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika&stage;1:=thinking.png,I'm sure Etsuko would come if I just ask... <i>Maybe</i>...
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;mae&stage;2:=happy.png,I've never seen anyone take off their socks without their hands before. Your dexterity stat must be pretty good!
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;amy&stage;1:=happy.png,My mentor Etsuko invented a school of magic, so I'm sure she could teach you how to do it!
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;rin&stage;1:=calm.png,No, I don't know any myself, but I bet my friend Etsuko has a spellbook somewhere in her tower!
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;emi&stage;7:,id:37=enthused.png,Oh wow, those are pretty cool! It's like you're part puppet!... But wait, where's the strings?
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;emi&stage;7:,id:37=enthused.png,Wow, your legs are pretty cool! I never thought about replacing lost limbs with puppet parts before! So where are the strings?
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;ribbon_girl&stage;3:=thinking.png,Oh, right, I guess without the same powers as you, I wouldn't be able to use it right, huh?
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;erufuda&stage;1:,id:315=thinking.png,Oh, they're not secret! At least, I don't think they are...
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;1:=interested.png,Remind me, what sort of spells do dancers learn?
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;2:=happy.png,See, you look fine! It's just your shoulders!
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;5&saidmarker;bee2&notsaidmarker;bee_stop:=flustered.png,That was... Odd. Uh, sorry about your tunic, Florina.
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;5&saidmarker;bee2&notsaidmarker;bee_stop:=interested.png,That was... Bizarre. You wouldn't happen to have any Bee mage enemies, would you?
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;5&saidmarker;bee2&notsaidmarker;bee_stop:=interested.png,That was... Strange. You wouldn't happen to have any enemies who know Bee magic, would you?
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;croix&stage;5:=flustered.png,To be honest, I wouldn't have been surprised...
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;kyoko&stage;6:=sad.png,Wait, I think I have something that'll help in my... Oh right, I don't have my pouch anymore...
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;kyoko&stage;6:=sad.png,Wait, I think I have a potion in my... Oh right, I don't have my pouch anymore...
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;3:=interested.png,You... don't actually have this under control, do you?

1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;sakura&stage;3:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;ZLS1:,marker:ZLS1=calm.png,Oh! You're undead! I thought I smelled something... dead.
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;self&saidmarker;MeiaPressurizedArmor:,count-role;target&character;meia&stage;2:=flustered.png,Tight clothes, huh? Glad I'm not a Mejarian, then. I'm not fond of tight clothes, except for my leggings...

1-female_removed_minor,priority:381,count-role;target&character;emi&stage;7:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:203=enthused.png,Wow, those are really archaic! You oughta upgrade.
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;sei&saidmarker;pauldrons:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=happy.png,Haha. Of course they're articulated, Sei. If you couldn't move your arms well, how would you swing your weapon?
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;sei&saidmarker;damage_reduction:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=interested.png,Oh, that's cool. One question, though: what's a "shotgun?" Whatever it is must be powerful, right?
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;sei&saidmarker;dna_lock:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=enthused.png,Wow, that's pretty cool! Maybe I should put the same kind of enchantment on my armor too?
1-female_removed_minor,priority:381,count-role;target&character;mae&stage;2&saidmarker;nightmarefeet2:=flustered.png,Oh. Well, I'd rather have been fooled into <i>thinking</i> that they're nightmarish than have them actually <i>be</i> nightmarish.

2-male_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kamina&stage;6:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=sad.png,...
2-male_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kamina&stage;4:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=calm.png,No. No it wasn't.

2-male_removing_minor,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:124=interested.png,You wear stuff like ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~ often?
2-male_removed_minor=interested.png,If I can be honest, I didn't like how you looked with ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~ on like that anyway.
2-male_removed_minor=happy.png,I think you look better now, anyway.
2-male_removed_minor=happy.png,No big deal, right?
2-male_removed_minor=happy.png,Nothing to be embarrassed about.
2-male_removed_minor=happy.png,You may not have your ~clothing~, but you still have your modesty!
2-male_removed_minor=happy.png,The game's picking up speed!
2-male_removed_minor=happy.png,Say, that reminds me of this goblin I saw. He had on something like ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~... Anyway, he's dead now.
2-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;jotaro&stage;3&saying;hat:=calm.png,I wouldn't have expected you to go easy on us.

2-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;jotaro&stage;3:=flustered.png,O-oh, s-sorry...
2-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;jotaro&stage;4:=flustered.png,P-please calm down, Jotaro. You'll get your clothes back. I think...
2-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;kamina&stage;7:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=interested.png,A-are you still talking about your... you know...?
2-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;kamina&stage;7:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=interested.png,A-are you... still using a euphemism...?
2-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;kamina&stage;5:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=interested.png,That is... also factual.
2-male_removed_minor,count-exposed&role;target:=interested.png,If I can be honest, I didn't like how you looked with ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~ on like that anyway.
2-male_removed_minor,count-exposed&role;target:=happy.png,I think you look better now, anyway.
2-male_removed_minor,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:125=calm.png,I see so many people in uniforms that I forget what real fashion is.
2-male_removed_minor,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:125=calm.png,Believe it or not, I don't get to see clothing like your ~clothing~ very often.
2-female_removing_minor=happy.png,At least that's a step up from bracelets and necklaces.
2-female_removing_minor=happy.png,Out of accessories, ~name~?
2-female_removing_minor=happy.png,A safe choice; ~clothing~.
2-female_removing_minor=happy.png,Your ~clothing~? ~clothing.ifPlural(Those are|That's)~ more or less just a decoration.
2-female_removing_minor=calm.png,Your ~clothing~? Good choice.
2-female_removing_minor=flustered.png,I saw something like ~clothing.ifPlural(those in a catalogue once. Looked really nice, but I figured they wouldn't fit me.|that in a catalogue once. Looked really nice, but I figured it wouldn't fit me.)~
2-female_removing_minor=thinking.png,That reminds me. I was considering expanding my wardrobe selection. Do you think something like ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~ would look good on me?
2-female_removing_minor=happy.png,I suppose taking ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~ off won't make much of a difference, huh?
2-female_removing_minor=interested.png,Well, ~clothing.ifPlural(those aren't|that isn't)~ really doing you any favors right now.
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;ribbon_girl&stage;2:=enthused.png,<i>Dragons?</i> I've got to get a pair of those!
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;4&saidmarker;bee&notsaidmarker;bee_stop:=shocked.png,Goodness! That bee is certainly giving you trouble!
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;4&saidmarker;bee&notsaidmarker;bee_stop:=shocked.png,My! That bee certainly has it out for you!
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;erufuda&stage;0:,id:292=happy.png,I did a lot of exercise growing up. I can teach you some stuff my father taught me!
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:=sad.png,I don't think I'll ever get used to that sound...
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;catria&stage;1&saying;strip both:=interested.png,I don't think you <i>have</i> to, but it would feel more fair.
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;catria&stage;1&saying;strip both:=interested.png,I don't think you <i>have</i> to, but it is nice to remove a pair at once.
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;larachel&stage;0:=flustered.png,I never could get the hang of white magic, myself. It's like, you have to focus your mana into bodily energy, or something?
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&layers;3-4:=happy.png,I suppose taking ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~ off won't make much of a difference, huh?
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&layers;3-4:=interested.png,Well, ~clothing.ifPlural(those aren't|that isn't)~ really doing you any favors right now.
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;rin&stage;0:=happy.png,I think it'd help you out a lot to learn butlery magic. There's all sorts of things that you can move with it!
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;chiaki&stage;2&saying;uniform:=interested.png,I... don't think that's how a uniform works.
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;amy&stage;0:=thinking.png,I'm actually not sure how this works, but in my world, you can turn any passion into a school of magic.
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;croix&stage;4:=interested.png,I'm... okay with that.
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;meia&stage;1:=happy.png,It's always fun to compare different cultures' armor sets. So what can you tell me about your armor, Meia?
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;1:=calm.png,It's just your jacket. That shouldn't be so bad.
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kyoko&stage;5:=shocked.png,Oh gosh! No wonder you didn't want to take off your gloves!
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;1&sayingmarker;monkey:,id:278=shocked.png,Oh no! You're a monkey! C-can you turn back?
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;sakura&stage;3:,id:4=shocked.png,Oh no! Y-you can reattach that, right?
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;0:,id:277=thinking.png,Oh, right, I see by your outfit that you're a dancer. I guess dancers can't exactly be evil... probably.
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;tharja&stage;0:=flustered.png,Oh, uh, I meant I'm in this world because of her, n-not playing this game. Playing this game was my idea.
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika&stage;0:,id:17=flustered.png,Oh? Were we supposed to bring friends...?
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;sonya:=interested.png,Oh? What are you doing?
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;4:=flustered.png,Personally, I'm glad you have to remove your hat first...
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;meia&stage;1&saying;pressurized:,marker:MeiaPressurizedArmor=interested.png,Pressurized? What's that for?
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;futaba&stage;0:=flustered.png,S-sorry! I didn't mean to insult your height...
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;0:=interested.png,Sure, it's a nice set - I just noticed; you're not wearing shoes. Why wear armor on all of your body but your feet?
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;0:=interested.png,Sure, it's a nice set - I just noticed; you're not wearing shoes. Why wear gloves, yet not shoes?
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;0:=interested.png,Sure, it's a nice set - I just noticed; you're not wearing shoes. Your feet are arguably one of the most important parts of your body to cover.
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:=interested.png,Well, I guess this method does make your item choice more of a surprise.
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;sakura&stage;2:=shocked.png,Wh-what the--?
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;rarity_eg&stage;1:=thinking.png,You and Etsuko have the same accent... Now that I think about it, you also both make clothes and have pale skin, too...
2-female_removing_minor,priority:381,count-role;target&character;rin&stage;0:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:208=calm.png,I've always been pretty against the idea of Augments myself, but I like having two arms more, so I got one when I lost my arm in battle.
2-female_removing_minor,priority:381,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:217=angry.png,Seriously, would you cut that out? Someone's gonna get hurt, and if you keep it up, I'll ensure that it's <i>you</i>!
2-female_removing_minor,priority:381,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:215=facepalm.png,What a waste of ammo...
2-female_removing_minor,priority:382,count-role;target&character;mae&stage;1&saidmarker;nightmarefeet&sayingmarker;nightmarefeet2:=interested.png,I'll admit, I am curious.
2-female_removing_minor,count-exposed&role;target:=happy.png,I suppose taking ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~ off won't make much of a difference, huh?
2-female_removing_minor,count-exposed&role;target:=interested.png,Well, ~clothing.ifPlural(those aren't|that isn't)~ really doing you any favors right now.

2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;2:=thinking.png,<i>Phew</i>, you undid it... I wonder how dangerous transformation magic is for magical beings like genies...
2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;tharja&stage;1:=interested.png,A-anyway, what kind of spells do you know? My black mage friend Etsuko can summon monsters and curse people.
2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:=calm.png,Case in point; I had no idea you were removing your footwear.
2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;sonya:=interested.png,Face paint? Here? Now? Why?
2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;1:=calm.png,Have you ever tried sandals? I'm sure they'd be a good middle ground between not wearing shoes and protecting your feet.
2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;sakura&stage;4:=flustered.png,I don't know any healing magic, so I can't help you if you can't reattach your head on your own.
2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;kyoko&stage;6:=interested.png,I know an alchemist who might be able to help, curatives are his specialty. He's sure to have something for burn scars.
2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;futaba&stage;1:=interested.png,I mean, it's not really my fault that you look so much like her.
2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;futaba&stage;1:=interested.png,Like I said, you look a lot like her. I think my train of thought is perfectly reasonable.
2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;moon:=sad.png,I never thought it'd ever be so uncomfortable with someone taking off their hat...
2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&layers;2-3:=interested.png,If I can be honest, I didn't like how you looked with ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~ on like that anyway.
2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&layers;2-3:=happy.png,I think you look better now, anyway.
2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;3:=interested.png,I'll admit, that's what I was thinking too, Sheena.
2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika&stage;1:=thinking.png,I'm sure Etsuko would come if I just ask... <i>Maybe</i>...
2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;mae&stage;2:=happy.png,I've never seen anyone take off their socks without their hands before. Your dexterity stat must be pretty good!
2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;amy&stage;1:=happy.png,My mentor Etsuko invented a school of magic, so I'm sure she could teach you how to do it!
2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;rin&stage;1:=calm.png,No, I don't know any myself, but I bet my friend Etsuko has a spellbook somewhere in her tower!
2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;emi&stage;7:,id:37=enthused.png,Oh wow, those are pretty cool! It's like you're part puppet!... But wait, where's the strings?
2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;emi&stage;7:,id:37=enthused.png,Wow, your legs are pretty cool! I never thought about replacing lost limbs with puppet parts before! So where are the strings?
2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;ribbon_girl&stage;3:=thinking.png,Oh, right, I guess without the same powers as you, I wouldn't be able to use it right, huh?
2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;erufuda&stage;1:,id:315=thinking.png,Oh, they're not secret! At least, I don't think they are...
2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;1:=interested.png,Remind me, what sort of spells do dancers learn?
2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;2:=happy.png,See, you look fine! It's just your shoulders!
2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;5&saidmarker;bee2&notsaidmarker;bee_stop:=flustered.png,That was... Odd. Uh, sorry about your tunic, Florina.
2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;5&saidmarker;bee2&notsaidmarker;bee_stop:=interested.png,That was... Bizarre. You wouldn't happen to have any Bee mage enemies, would you?
2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;5&saidmarker;bee2&notsaidmarker;bee_stop:=interested.png,That was... Strange. You wouldn't happen to have any enemies who know Bee magic, would you?
2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;croix&stage;5:=flustered.png,To be honest, I wouldn't have been surprised...
2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;kyoko&stage;6:=sad.png,Wait, I think I have something that'll help in my... Oh right, I don't have my pouch anymore...
2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;kyoko&stage;6:=sad.png,Wait, I think I have a potion in my... Oh right, I don't have my pouch anymore...
2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;3:=interested.png,You... don't actually have this under control, do you?
2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;2:,count-role;self&saidmarker;Shantae_Transformations:,id:312=flustered.png,<i>Phew</i>, you undid it... Well I guess you do have experience with this kind of stuff...
2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;sakura&stage;3:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;ZLS1:,marker:ZLS1=calm.png,Oh! You're undead! I thought I smelled something... dead.
2-female_removed_minor,count-role;self&saidmarker;MeiaPressurizedArmor:,count-role;target&character;meia&stage;2:=flustered.png,Tight clothes, huh? Glad I'm not a Mejarian, then. I'm not fond of tight clothes, except for my leggings...
2-female_removed_minor,priority:381,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:216=annoyed.png,All you were taking off was your footwear? That's an even <i>bigger</i> waste of ammo.
2-female_removed_minor,priority:381,count-role;target&character;rin&stage;1:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:209=interested.png,Do you at least know any butlery magic? It's an old art, but I bet it'd help you out a ton.
2-female_removed_minor,priority:381,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;3:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:218=facepalm.png,Perhaps I won't even have to...
2-female_removed_minor,priority:381,count-role;target&character;emi&stage;7:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:203=enthused.png,Wow, those are really archaic! You oughta upgrade.
2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;sei&saidmarker;pauldrons:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=happy.png,Haha. Of course they're articulated, Sei. If you couldn't move your arms well, how would you swing your weapon?
2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;sei&saidmarker;damage_reduction:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=interested.png,Oh, that's cool. One question, though: what's a "shotgun?" Whatever it is must be powerful, right?
2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;sei&saidmarker;dna_lock:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=enthused.png,Wow, that's pretty cool! Maybe I should put the same kind of enchantment on my armor too?
2-female_removed_minor,priority:381,count-role;target&character;mae&stage;2&saidmarker;nightmarefeet2:=flustered.png,Oh. Well, I'd rather have been fooled into <i>thinking</i> that they're nightmarish than have them actually <i>be</i> nightmarish.
2-female_removed_minor,count-exposed&role;target:=interested.png,If I can be honest, I didn't like how you looked with ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~ on like that anyway.

3-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;jotaro&stage;4:=flustered.png,P-please calm down, Jotaro. You'll get your clothes back. I think...
3-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;kamina&stage;7:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=interested.png,A-are you still talking about your... you know...?
3-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;kamina&stage;7:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=interested.png,A-are you... still using a euphemism...?
3-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;kamina&stage;5:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=interested.png,That is... also factual.
3-male_removed_minor,count-exposed&role;target:=interested.png,If I can be honest, I didn't like how you looked with ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~ on like that anyway.
3-male_removed_minor,count-exposed&role;target:=happy.png,I think you look better now, anyway.
3-male_removed_minor,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:125=calm.png,I see so many people in uniforms that I forget what real fashion is.
3-male_removed_minor,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:125=calm.png,Believe it or not, I don't get to see clothing like your ~clothing~ very often.
3-female_removing_minor=happy.png,At least that's a step up from bracelets and necklaces.
3-female_removing_minor=happy.png,Out of accessories, ~name~?
3-female_removing_minor=happy.png,A safe choice; ~clothing~.
3-female_removing_minor=happy.png,Your ~clothing~? ~clothing.ifPlural(Those are|That's)~ more or less just a decoration.
3-female_removing_minor=calm.png,Your ~clothing~? Good choice.
3-female_removing_minor=flustered.png,I saw something like ~clothing.ifPlural(those in a catalogue once. Looked really nice, but I figured they wouldn't fit me.|that in a catalogue once. Looked really nice, but I figured it wouldn't fit me.)~
3-female_removing_minor=thinking.png,That reminds me. I was considering expanding my wardrobe selection. Do you think something like ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~ would look good on me?
3-female_removing_minor=happy.png,I suppose taking ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~ off won't make much of a difference, huh?
3-female_removing_minor=interested.png,Well, ~clothing.ifPlural(those aren't|that isn't)~ really doing you any favors right now.
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;ribbon_girl&stage;2:=enthused.png,<i>Dragons?</i> I've got to get a pair of those!
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;4&saidmarker;bee&notsaidmarker;bee_stop:=shocked.png,Goodness! That bee is certainly giving you trouble!
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;4&saidmarker;bee&notsaidmarker;bee_stop:=shocked.png,My! That bee certainly has it out for you!
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;erufuda&stage;0:,id:292=happy.png,I did a lot of exercise growing up. I can teach you some stuff my father taught me!
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:=sad.png,I don't think I'll ever get used to that sound...
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;catria&stage;1&saying;strip both:=interested.png,I don't think you <i>have</i> to, but it would feel more fair.
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;catria&stage;1&saying;strip both:=interested.png,I don't think you <i>have</i> to, but it is nice to remove a pair at once.
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;larachel&stage;0:=flustered.png,I never could get the hang of white magic, myself. It's like, you have to focus your mana into bodily energy, or something?
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&layers;3-4:=happy.png,I suppose taking ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~ off won't make much of a difference, huh?
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&layers;3-4:=interested.png,Well, ~clothing.ifPlural(those aren't|that isn't)~ really doing you any favors right now.
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;rin&stage;0:=happy.png,I think it'd help you out a lot to learn butlery magic. There's all sorts of things that you can move with it!
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;chiaki&stage;2&saying;uniform:=interested.png,I... don't think that's how a uniform works.
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;amy&stage;0:=thinking.png,I'm actually not sure how this works, but in my world, you can turn any passion into a school of magic.
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;croix&stage;4:=interested.png,I'm... okay with that.
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;meia&stage;1:=happy.png,It's always fun to compare different cultures' armor sets. So what can you tell me about your armor, Meia?
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;1:=calm.png,It's just your jacket. That shouldn't be so bad.
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kyoko&stage;5:=shocked.png,Oh gosh! No wonder you didn't want to take off your gloves!
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;1&sayingmarker;monkey:,id:278=shocked.png,Oh no! You're a monkey! C-can you turn back?
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;sakura&stage;3:,id:4=shocked.png,Oh no! Y-you can reattach that, right?
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;0:,id:277=thinking.png,Oh, right, I see by your outfit that you're a dancer. I guess dancers can't exactly be evil... probably.
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;tharja&stage;0:=flustered.png,Oh, uh, I meant I'm in this world because of her, n-not playing this game. Playing this game was my idea.
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika&stage;0:,id:17=flustered.png,Oh? Were we supposed to bring friends...?
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;sonya:=interested.png,Oh? What are you doing?
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;4:=flustered.png,Personally, I'm glad you have to remove your hat first...
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;meia&stage;1&saying;pressurized:,marker:MeiaPressurizedArmor=interested.png,Pressurized? What's that for?
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;futaba&stage;0:=flustered.png,S-sorry! I didn't mean to insult your height...
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;0:=interested.png,Sure, it's a nice set - I just noticed; you're not wearing shoes. Why wear armor on all of your body but your feet?
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;0:=interested.png,Sure, it's a nice set - I just noticed; you're not wearing shoes. Why wear gloves, yet not shoes?
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;0:=interested.png,Sure, it's a nice set - I just noticed; you're not wearing shoes. Your feet are arguably one of the most important parts of your body to cover.
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:=interested.png,Well, I guess this method does make your item choice more of a surprise.
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;sakura&stage;2:=shocked.png,Wh-what the--?
3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;rarity_eg&stage;1:=thinking.png,You and Etsuko have the same accent... Now that I think about it, you also both make clothes and have pale skin, too...
3-female_removing_minor,priority:381,count-role;target&character;rin&stage;0:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:208=calm.png,I've always been pretty against the idea of Augments myself, but I like having two arms more, so I got one when I lost my arm in battle.
3-female_removing_minor,priority:381,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:217=angry.png,Seriously, would you cut that out? Someone's gonna get hurt, and if you keep it up, I'll ensure that it's <i>you</i>!
3-female_removing_minor,priority:381,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:215=facepalm.png,What a waste of ammo...
3-female_removing_minor,priority:382,count-role;target&character;mae&stage;1&saidmarker;nightmarefeet&sayingmarker;nightmarefeet2:=interested.png,I'll admit, I am curious.
3-female_removing_minor,count-exposed&role;target:=happy.png,I suppose taking ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~ off won't make much of a difference, huh?
3-female_removing_minor,count-exposed&role;target:=interested.png,Well, ~clothing.ifPlural(those aren't|that isn't)~ really doing you any favors right now.
3-female_removing_minor,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:134=interested.png,You call that fashion?... No, seriously, you call that fashion? Is that part of your usual style?
3-female_removing_minor,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:134=interested.png,You wear stuff like ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~ often?
3-female_removed_minor=interested.png,If I can be honest, I didn't like how you looked with ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~ on like that anyway.
3-female_removed_minor=happy.png,I think you look better now, anyway.
3-female_removed_minor=happy.png,Well, at least we're even!
3-female_removed_minor=happy.png,See? That wasn't so bad, now, was it?
3-female_removed_minor=happy.png,It's good that you're keeping up!
3-female_removed_minor=happy.png,Glad you're keeping up!
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;2:=thinking.png,<i>Phew</i>, you undid it... I wonder how dangerous transformation magic is for magical beings like genies...
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;tharja&stage;1:=interested.png,A-anyway, what kind of spells do you know? My black mage friend Etsuko can summon monsters and curse people.
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:=calm.png,Case in point; I had no idea you were removing your footwear.
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;sonya:=interested.png,Face paint? Here? Now? Why?
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;1:=calm.png,Have you ever tried sandals? I'm sure they'd be a good middle ground between not wearing shoes and protecting your feet.
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;sakura&stage;4:=flustered.png,I don't know any healing magic, so I can't help you if you can't reattach your head on your own.
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;kyoko&stage;6:=interested.png,I know an alchemist who might be able to help, curatives are his specialty. He's sure to have something for burn scars.
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;futaba&stage;1:=interested.png,I mean, it's not really my fault that you look so much like her.
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;futaba&stage;1:=interested.png,Like I said, you look a lot like her. I think my train of thought is perfectly reasonable.
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;moon:=sad.png,I never thought it'd ever be so uncomfortable with someone taking off their hat...
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&layers;2-3:=interested.png,If I can be honest, I didn't like how you looked with ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~ on like that anyway.
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&layers;2-3:=happy.png,I think you look better now, anyway.
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;3:=interested.png,I'll admit, that's what I was thinking too, Sheena.
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika&stage;1:=thinking.png,I'm sure Etsuko would come if I just ask... <i>Maybe</i>...
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;mae&stage;2:=happy.png,I've never seen anyone take off their socks without their hands before. Your dexterity stat must be pretty good!
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;amy&stage;1:=happy.png,My mentor Etsuko invented a school of magic, so I'm sure she could teach you how to do it!
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;rin&stage;1:=calm.png,No, I don't know any myself, but I bet my friend Etsuko has a spellbook somewhere in her tower!
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;emi&stage;7:,id:37=enthused.png,Oh wow, those are pretty cool! It's like you're part puppet!... But wait, where's the strings?
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;emi&stage;7:,id:37=enthused.png,Wow, your legs are pretty cool! I never thought about replacing lost limbs with puppet parts before! So where are the strings?
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;ribbon_girl&stage;3:=thinking.png,Oh, right, I guess without the same powers as you, I wouldn't be able to use it right, huh?
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;erufuda&stage;1:,id:315=thinking.png,Oh, they're not secret! At least, I don't think they are...
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;1:=interested.png,Remind me, what sort of spells do dancers learn?
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;2:=happy.png,See, you look fine! It's just your shoulders!
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;5&saidmarker;bee2&notsaidmarker;bee_stop:=flustered.png,That was... Odd. Uh, sorry about your tunic, Florina.
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;5&saidmarker;bee2&notsaidmarker;bee_stop:=interested.png,That was... Bizarre. You wouldn't happen to have any Bee mage enemies, would you?
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;5&saidmarker;bee2&notsaidmarker;bee_stop:=interested.png,That was... Strange. You wouldn't happen to have any enemies who know Bee magic, would you?
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;croix&stage;5:=flustered.png,To be honest, I wouldn't have been surprised...
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;kyoko&stage;6:=sad.png,Wait, I think I have something that'll help in my... Oh right, I don't have my pouch anymore...
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;kyoko&stage;6:=sad.png,Wait, I think I have a potion in my... Oh right, I don't have my pouch anymore...
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;3:=interested.png,You... don't actually have this under control, do you?
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;2:,count-role;self&saidmarker;Shantae_Transformations:,id:312=flustered.png,<i>Phew</i>, you undid it... Well I guess you do have experience with this kind of stuff...
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;sakura&stage;3:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;ZLS1:,marker:ZLS1=calm.png,Oh! You're undead! I thought I smelled something... dead.
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;self&saidmarker;MeiaPressurizedArmor:,count-role;target&character;meia&stage;2:=flustered.png,Tight clothes, huh? Glad I'm not a Mejarian, then. I'm not fond of tight clothes, except for my leggings...
3-female_removed_minor,priority:381,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:216=annoyed.png,All you were taking off was your footwear? That's an even <i>bigger</i> waste of ammo.
3-female_removed_minor,priority:381,count-role;target&character;rin&stage;1:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:209=interested.png,Do you at least know any butlery magic? It's an old art, but I bet it'd help you out a ton.
3-female_removed_minor,priority:381,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;3:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:218=facepalm.png,Perhaps I won't even have to...
3-female_removed_minor,priority:381,count-role;target&character;emi&stage;7:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:203=enthused.png,Wow, those are really archaic! You oughta upgrade.
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;sei&saidmarker;pauldrons:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=happy.png,Haha. Of course they're articulated, Sei. If you couldn't move your arms well, how would you swing your weapon?
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;sei&saidmarker;damage_reduction:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=interested.png,Oh, that's cool. One question, though: what's a "shotgun?" Whatever it is must be powerful, right?
3-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;sei&saidmarker;dna_lock:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=enthused.png,Wow, that's pretty cool! Maybe I should put the same kind of enchantment on my armor too?
3-female_removed_minor,priority:381,count-role;target&character;mae&stage;2&saidmarker;nightmarefeet2:=flustered.png,Oh. Well, I'd rather have been fooled into <i>thinking</i> that they're nightmarish than have them actually <i>be</i> nightmarish.
3-female_removed_minor,count-exposed&role;target:=interested.png,If I can be honest, I didn't like how you looked with ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~ on like that anyway.

4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;chiaki&stage;2&saying;uniform:=interested.png,I... don't think that's how a uniform works.
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;amy&stage;0:=thinking.png,I'm actually not sure how this works, but in my world, you can turn any passion into a school of magic.
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;croix&stage;4:=interested.png,I'm... okay with that.
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;meia&stage;1:=happy.png,It's always fun to compare different cultures' armor sets. So what can you tell me about your armor, Meia?
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;1:=calm.png,It's just your jacket. That shouldn't be so bad.
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kyoko&stage;5:=shocked.png,Oh gosh! No wonder you didn't want to take off your gloves!
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;1&sayingmarker;monkey:,id:278=shocked.png,Oh no! You're a monkey! C-can you turn back?
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;sakura&stage;3:,id:4=shocked.png,Oh no! Y-you can reattach that, right?
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;0:,id:277=thinking.png,Oh, right, I see by your outfit that you're a dancer. I guess dancers can't exactly be evil... probably.
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;tharja&stage;0:=flustered.png,Oh, uh, I meant I'm in this world because of her, n-not playing this game. Playing this game was my idea.
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika&stage;0:,id:17=flustered.png,Oh? Were we supposed to bring friends...?
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;sonya:=interested.png,Oh? What are you doing?
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;4:=flustered.png,Personally, I'm glad you have to remove your hat first...
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;meia&stage;1&saying;pressurized:,marker:MeiaPressurizedArmor=interested.png,Pressurized? What's that for?
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;futaba&stage;0:=flustered.png,S-sorry! I didn't mean to insult your height...
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;0:=interested.png,Sure, it's a nice set - I just noticed; you're not wearing shoes. Why wear armor on all of your body but your feet?
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;0:=interested.png,Sure, it's a nice set - I just noticed; you're not wearing shoes. Why wear gloves, yet not shoes?
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;0:=interested.png,Sure, it's a nice set - I just noticed; you're not wearing shoes. Your feet are arguably one of the most important parts of your body to cover.
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:=interested.png,Well, I guess this method does make your item choice more of a surprise.
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;sakura&stage;2:=shocked.png,Wh-what the--?
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;rarity_eg&stage;1:=thinking.png,You and Etsuko have the same accent... Now that I think about it, you also both make clothes and have pale skin, too...
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&layers;3-4:=flustered.png,Your ~clothing~? I guess that's fine, all things considered...
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&layers;3-4:=flustered.png,Well... Alright. You don't have much covering you right now anyway...
4-female_removing_minor,priority:381,count-role;target&character;rin&stage;0:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:208=calm.png,I've always been pretty against the idea of Augments myself, but I like having two arms more, so I got one when I lost my arm in battle.
4-female_removing_minor,priority:381,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:217=angry.png,Seriously, would you cut that out? Someone's gonna get hurt, and if you keep it up, I'll ensure that it's <i>you</i>!
4-female_removing_minor,priority:381,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:215=facepalm.png,What a waste of ammo...
4-female_removing_minor,priority:382,count-role;target&character;mae&stage;1&saidmarker;nightmarefeet&sayingmarker;nightmarefeet2:=interested.png,I'll admit, I am curious.
4-female_removing_minor,count-exposed&role;target:=flustered.png,Your ~clothing~? I guess that's fine, all things considered...
4-female_removing_minor,count-exposed&role;target:=flustered.png,Well... Alright. You don't have much covering you right now anyway...
4-female_removing_minor,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:135=annoyed.png,Alright, I've had enough of the fashion show. I want to see some <i>real</i> stripping.
4-female_removing_minor,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:135=annoyed.png,You <i>really</i> think that's good enough right now?
4-female_removed_minor=calm.png,It's only fair that you keep pace.
4-female_removed_minor=flustered.png,Not that I didn't like your ~clothing~, just, you know...
4-female_removed_minor=calm.png,I don't have anything against your ~clothing~ in particular. It's just... nice to have you keep up.
4-female_removed_minor=calm.png,I mean, I liked your ~clothing~, but ~clothing.ifPlural(they|it)~ needed to go.
4-female_removed_minor=calm.png,It's not like ~clothing.ifPlural(those were|that was)~ hiding much anyway.
4-female_removed_minor=happy.png,You kind of look better without ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~ anyway.
4-female_removed_minor=calm.png,~clothing.ifPlural(Those weren't|That wasn't)~ doing much for you anyway. Except make you look a little silly, I guess.
4-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;2:=thinking.png,<i>Phew</i>, you undid it... I wonder how dangerous transformation magic is for magical beings like genies...
4-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;tharja&stage;1:=interested.png,A-anyway, what kind of spells do you know? My black mage friend Etsuko can summon monsters and curse people.
4-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:=calm.png,Case in point; I had no idea you were removing your footwear.
4-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;sonya:=interested.png,Face paint? Here? Now? Why?
4-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;1:=calm.png,Have you ever tried sandals? I'm sure they'd be a good middle ground between not wearing shoes and protecting your feet.
4-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;sakura&stage;4:=flustered.png,I don't know any healing magic, so I can't help you if you can't reattach your head on your own.
4-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;kyoko&stage;6:=interested.png,I know an alchemist who might be able to help, curatives are his specialty. He's sure to have something for burn scars.
4-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;futaba&stage;1:=interested.png,I mean, it's not really my fault that you look so much like her.
4-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;futaba&stage;1:=interested.png,Like I said, you look a lot like her. I think my train of thought is perfectly reasonable.
4-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;moon:=sad.png,I never thought it'd ever be so uncomfortable with someone taking off their hat...
4-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;3:=interested.png,I'll admit, that's what I was thinking too, Sheena.
4-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika&stage;1:=thinking.png,I'm sure Etsuko would come if I just ask... <i>Maybe</i>...
4-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;mae&stage;2:=happy.png,I've never seen anyone take off their socks without their hands before. Your dexterity stat must be pretty good!
4-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;amy&stage;1:=happy.png,My mentor Etsuko invented a school of magic, so I'm sure she could teach you how to do it!
4-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;rin&stage;1:=calm.png,No, I don't know any myself, but I bet my friend Etsuko has a spellbook somewhere in her tower!
4-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;emi&stage;7:,id:37=enthused.png,Oh wow, those are pretty cool! It's like you're part puppet!... But wait, where's the strings?
4-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;emi&stage;7:,id:37=enthused.png,Wow, your legs are pretty cool! I never thought about replacing lost limbs with puppet parts before! So where are the strings?
4-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;ribbon_girl&stage;3:=thinking.png,Oh, right, I guess without the same powers as you, I wouldn't be able to use it right, huh?
4-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;erufuda&stage;1:,id:315=thinking.png,Oh, they're not secret! At least, I don't think they are...
4-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;1:=interested.png,Remind me, what sort of spells do dancers learn?
4-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;2:=happy.png,See, you look fine! It's just your shoulders!
4-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;5&saidmarker;bee2&notsaidmarker;bee_stop:=flustered.png,That was... Odd. Uh, sorry about your tunic, Florina.
4-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;5&saidmarker;bee2&notsaidmarker;bee_stop:=interested.png,That was... Bizarre. You wouldn't happen to have any Bee mage enemies, would you?
4-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;5&saidmarker;bee2&notsaidmarker;bee_stop:=interested.png,That was... Strange. You wouldn't happen to have any enemies who know Bee magic, would you?
4-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;croix&stage;5:=flustered.png,To be honest, I wouldn't have been surprised...
4-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;kyoko&stage;6:=sad.png,Wait, I think I have something that'll help in my... Oh right, I don't have my pouch anymore...
4-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;kyoko&stage;6:=sad.png,Wait, I think I have a potion in my... Oh right, I don't have my pouch anymore...
4-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&layers;2-3:=happy.png,You kind of look better without ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~ anyway.
4-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&layers;2-3:=calm.png,~clothing.ifPlural(Those weren't|That wasn't)~ doing much for you anyway. Except make you look a little silly, I guess.
4-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;3:=interested.png,You... don't actually have this under control, do you?
4-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;2:,count-role;self&saidmarker;Shantae_Transformations:,id:312=flustered.png,<i>Phew</i>, you undid it... Well I guess you do have experience with this kind of stuff...
4-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;sakura&stage;3:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;ZLS1:,marker:ZLS1=calm.png,Oh! You're undead! I thought I smelled something... dead.
4-female_removed_minor,count-role;self&saidmarker;MeiaPressurizedArmor:,count-role;target&character;meia&stage;2:=flustered.png,Tight clothes, huh? Glad I'm not a Mejarian, then. I'm not fond of tight clothes, except for my leggings...
4-female_removed_minor,priority:381,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:216=annoyed.png,All you were taking off was your footwear? That's an even <i>bigger</i> waste of ammo.
4-female_removed_minor,priority:381,count-role;target&character;rin&stage;1:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:209=interested.png,Do you at least know any butlery magic? It's an old art, but I bet it'd help you out a ton.
4-female_removed_minor,priority:381,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;3:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:218=facepalm.png,Perhaps I won't even have to...
4-female_removed_minor,priority:381,count-role;target&character;emi&stage;7:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:203=enthused.png,Wow, those are really archaic! You oughta upgrade.
4-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;sei&saidmarker;pauldrons:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=happy.png,Haha. Of course they're articulated, Sei. If you couldn't move your arms well, how would you swing your weapon?
4-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;sei&saidmarker;damage_reduction:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=interested.png,Oh, that's cool. One question, though: what's a "shotgun?" Whatever it is must be powerful, right?
4-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;sei&saidmarker;dna_lock:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=enthused.png,Wow, that's pretty cool! Maybe I should put the same kind of enchantment on my armor too?
4-female_removed_minor,priority:381,count-role;target&character;mae&stage;2&saidmarker;nightmarefeet2:=flustered.png,Oh. Well, I'd rather have been fooled into <i>thinking</i> that they're nightmarish than have them actually <i>be</i> nightmarish.
4-female_removed_minor,count-exposed&role;target:=happy.png,You kind of look better without ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~ anyway.

5-female_removing_minor,priority:381,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:217=angry.png,Seriously, would you cut that out? Someone's gonna get hurt, and if you keep it up, I'll ensure that it's <i>you</i>!
5-female_removing_minor,priority:381,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:215=facepalm.png,What a waste of ammo...
5-female_removing_minor,priority:382,count-role;target&character;mae&stage;1&saidmarker;nightmarefeet&sayingmarker;nightmarefeet2:=interested.png,I'll admit, I am curious.
5-female_removing_minor,count-exposed&role;target:=flustered.png,Your ~clothing~? I guess that's fine, all things considered...
5-female_removing_minor,count-exposed&role;target:=flustered.png,Well... Alright. You don't have much covering you right now anyway...
5-female_removing_minor,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:135=annoyed.png,Alright, I've had enough of the fashion show. I want to see some <i>real</i> stripping.
5-female_removing_minor,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:135=annoyed.png,You <i>really</i> think that's good enough right now?
5-female_removed_minor=interested.png,S-so, ~clothing.ifPlural(are|is a)~ ~clothing~ a common thing to wear where you come from?...
5-female_removed_minor=sad.png,I want to get mad, but your choice only makes sense...
5-female_removed_minor=sad.png,I want to get mad, but I can only blame this on luck...
5-female_removed_minor=interested.png,S-so, um... D-do you wear your ~clothing~ often...?
5-female_removed_minor=happy.png,You kind of look better without ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~ anyway.
5-female_removed_minor=calm.png,~clothing.ifPlural(Those weren't|That wasn't)~ doing much for you anyway. Except make you look a little silly, I guess.
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;2:=thinking.png,<i>Phew</i>, you undid it... I wonder how dangerous transformation magic is for magical beings like genies...
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;tharja&stage;1:=interested.png,A-anyway, what kind of spells do you know? My black mage friend Etsuko can summon monsters and curse people.
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:=calm.png,Case in point; I had no idea you were removing your footwear.
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;sonya:=interested.png,Face paint? Here? Now? Why?
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;1:=calm.png,Have you ever tried sandals? I'm sure they'd be a good middle ground between not wearing shoes and protecting your feet.
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;sakura&stage;4:=flustered.png,I don't know any healing magic, so I can't help you if you can't reattach your head on your own.
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;kyoko&stage;6:=interested.png,I know an alchemist who might be able to help, curatives are his specialty. He's sure to have something for burn scars.
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;futaba&stage;1:=interested.png,I mean, it's not really my fault that you look so much like her.
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;futaba&stage;1:=interested.png,Like I said, you look a lot like her. I think my train of thought is perfectly reasonable.
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;moon:=sad.png,I never thought it'd ever be so uncomfortable with someone taking off their hat...
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;3:=interested.png,I'll admit, that's what I was thinking too, Sheena.
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika&stage;1:=thinking.png,I'm sure Etsuko would come if I just ask... <i>Maybe</i>...
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;mae&stage;2:=happy.png,I've never seen anyone take off their socks without their hands before. Your dexterity stat must be pretty good!
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;amy&stage;1:=happy.png,My mentor Etsuko invented a school of magic, so I'm sure she could teach you how to do it!
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;rin&stage;1:=calm.png,No, I don't know any myself, but I bet my friend Etsuko has a spellbook somewhere in her tower!
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;emi&stage;7:,id:37=enthused.png,Oh wow, those are pretty cool! It's like you're part puppet!... But wait, where's the strings?
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;emi&stage;7:,id:37=enthused.png,Wow, your legs are pretty cool! I never thought about replacing lost limbs with puppet parts before! So where are the strings?
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;ribbon_girl&stage;3:=thinking.png,Oh, right, I guess without the same powers as you, I wouldn't be able to use it right, huh?
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;erufuda&stage;1:,id:315=thinking.png,Oh, they're not secret! At least, I don't think they are...
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;1:=interested.png,Remind me, what sort of spells do dancers learn?
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;2:=happy.png,See, you look fine! It's just your shoulders!
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;5&saidmarker;bee2&notsaidmarker;bee_stop:=flustered.png,That was... Odd. Uh, sorry about your tunic, Florina.
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;5&saidmarker;bee2&notsaidmarker;bee_stop:=interested.png,That was... Bizarre. You wouldn't happen to have any Bee mage enemies, would you?
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;5&saidmarker;bee2&notsaidmarker;bee_stop:=interested.png,That was... Strange. You wouldn't happen to have any enemies who know Bee magic, would you?
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;croix&stage;5:=flustered.png,To be honest, I wouldn't have been surprised...
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;kyoko&stage;6:=sad.png,Wait, I think I have something that'll help in my... Oh right, I don't have my pouch anymore...
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;kyoko&stage;6:=sad.png,Wait, I think I have a potion in my... Oh right, I don't have my pouch anymore...

5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;3:=interested.png,You... don't actually have this under control, do you?
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;2:,count-role;self&saidmarker;Shantae_Transformations:,id:312=flustered.png,<i>Phew</i>, you undid it... Well I guess you do have experience with this kind of stuff...
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;sakura&stage;3:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;ZLS1:,marker:ZLS1=calm.png,Oh! You're undead! I thought I smelled something... dead.
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;self&saidmarker;MeiaPressurizedArmor:,count-role;target&character;meia&stage;2:=flustered.png,Tight clothes, huh? Glad I'm not a Mejarian, then. I'm not fond of tight clothes, except for my leggings...
5-female_removed_minor,priority:381,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:216=annoyed.png,All you were taking off was your footwear? That's an even <i>bigger</i> waste of ammo.
5-female_removed_minor,priority:381,count-role;target&character;rin&stage;1:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:209=interested.png,Do you at least know any butlery magic? It's an old art, but I bet it'd help you out a ton.
5-female_removed_minor,priority:381,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;3:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:218=facepalm.png,Perhaps I won't even have to...
5-female_removed_minor,priority:381,count-role;target&character;emi&stage;7:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:203=enthused.png,Wow, those are really archaic! You oughta upgrade.
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;sei&saidmarker;pauldrons:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=happy.png,Haha. Of course they're articulated, Sei. If you couldn't move your arms well, how would you swing your weapon?
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;sei&saidmarker;damage_reduction:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=interested.png,Oh, that's cool. One question, though: what's a "shotgun?" Whatever it is must be powerful, right?
5-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;sei&saidmarker;dna_lock:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=enthused.png,Wow, that's pretty cool! Maybe I should put the same kind of enchantment on my armor too?
5-female_removed_minor,priority:381,count-role;target&character;mae&stage;2&saidmarker;nightmarefeet2:=flustered.png,Oh. Well, I'd rather have been fooled into <i>thinking</i> that they're nightmarish than have them actually <i>be</i> nightmarish.

-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;larachel&stage;0:=flustered.png,I never could get the hang of white magic, myself. It's like, you have to focus your mana into bodily energy, or something?
-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;rin&stage;0:=happy.png,I think it'd help you out a lot to learn butlery magic. There's all sorts of things that you can move with it!
-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;chiaki&stage;2&saying;uniform:=interested.png,I... don't think that's how a uniform works.
-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;amy&stage;0:=thinking.png,I'm actually not sure how this works, but in my world, you can turn any passion into a school of magic.
-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;croix&stage;4:=interested.png,I'm... okay with that.
-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;meia&stage;1:=happy.png,It's always fun to compare different cultures' armor sets. So what can you tell me about your armor, Meia?
-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;1:=calm.png,It's just your jacket. That shouldn't be so bad.
-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kyoko&stage;5:=shocked.png,Oh gosh! No wonder you didn't want to take off your gloves!
-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;1&sayingmarker;monkey:,id:278=shocked.png,Oh no! You're a monkey! C-can you turn back?
-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;sakura&stage;3:,id:4=shocked.png,Oh no! Y-you can reattach that, right?
-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;0:,id:277=thinking.png,Oh, right, I see by your outfit that you're a dancer. I guess dancers can't exactly be evil... probably.
-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;tharja&stage;0:=flustered.png,Oh, uh, I meant I'm in this world because of her, n-not playing this game. Playing this game was my idea.

-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;0:=interested.png,Sure, it's a nice set - I just noticed; you're not wearing shoes. Why wear armor on all of your body but your feet?
-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;0:=interested.png,Sure, it's a nice set - I just noticed; you're not wearing shoes. Why wear gloves, yet not shoes?
-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;0:=interested.png,Sure, it's a nice set - I just noticed; you're not wearing shoes. Your feet are arguably one of the most important parts of your body to cover.
-3-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:=interested.png,Well, I guess this method does make your item choice more of a surprise.

-2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;larachel&stage;0:=flustered.png,I never could get the hang of white magic, myself. It's like, you have to focus your mana into bodily energy, or something?
-2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;rin&stage;0:=happy.png,I think it'd help you out a lot to learn butlery magic. There's all sorts of things that you can move with it!
-2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;chiaki&stage;2&saying;uniform:=interested.png,I... don't think that's how a uniform works.
-2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;amy&stage;0:=thinking.png,I'm actually not sure how this works, but in my world, you can turn any passion into a school of magic.

-2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;meia&stage;1:=happy.png,It's always fun to compare different cultures' armor sets. So what can you tell me about your armor, Meia?

-2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;0:=interested.png,Sure, it's a nice set - I just noticed; you're not wearing shoes. Why wear armor on all of your body but your feet?
-2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;0:=interested.png,Sure, it's a nice set - I just noticed; you're not wearing shoes. Why wear gloves, yet not shoes?
-2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;0:=interested.png,Sure, it's a nice set - I just noticed; you're not wearing shoes. Your feet are arguably one of the most important parts of your body to cover.
-2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:=interested.png,Well, I guess this method does make your item choice more of a surprise.
-2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;sakura&stage;2:=shocked.png,Wh-what the--?

-2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;tharja&stage;1:=interested.png,A-anyway, what kind of spells do you know? My black mage friend Etsuko can summon monsters and curse people.
-2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:=calm.png,Case in point; I had no idea you were removing your footwear.
-2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;sonya:=interested.png,Face paint? Here? Now? Why?
-2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;1:=calm.png,Have you ever tried sandals? I'm sure they'd be a good middle ground between not wearing shoes and protecting your feet.
-2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;sakura&stage;4:=flustered.png,I don't know any healing magic, so I can't help you if you can't reattach your head on your own.
-2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;kyoko&stage;6:=interested.png,I know an alchemist who might be able to help, curatives are his specialty. He's sure to have something for burn scars.
-2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;futaba&stage;1:=interested.png,I mean, it's not really my fault that you look so much like her.
-2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;futaba&stage;1:=interested.png,Like I said, you look a lot like her. I think my train of thought is perfectly reasonable.
-2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;moon:=sad.png,I never thought it'd ever be so uncomfortable with someone taking off their hat...
-2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;3:=interested.png,I'll admit, that's what I was thinking too, Sheena.
-2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika&stage;1:=thinking.png,I'm sure Etsuko would come if I just ask... <i>Maybe</i>...

-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;4&saidmarker;bee&notsaidmarker;bee_stop:=shocked.png,Goodness! That bee is certainly giving you trouble!
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;4&saidmarker;bee&notsaidmarker;bee_stop:=shocked.png,My! That bee certainly has it out for you!
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;erufuda&stage;0:,id:292=happy.png,I did a lot of exercise growing up. I can teach you some stuff my father taught me!
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:=sad.png,I don't think I'll ever get used to that sound...
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;catria&stage;1&saying;strip both:=interested.png,I don't think you <i>have</i> to, but it would feel more fair.
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;catria&stage;1&saying;strip both:=interested.png,I don't think you <i>have</i> to, but it is nice to remove a pair at once.
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;larachel&stage;0:=flustered.png,I never could get the hang of white magic, myself. It's like, you have to focus your mana into bodily energy, or something?
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;rin&stage;0:=happy.png,I think it'd help you out a lot to learn butlery magic. There's all sorts of things that you can move with it!
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;chiaki&stage;2&saying;uniform:=interested.png,I... don't think that's how a uniform works.
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;amy&stage;0:=thinking.png,I'm actually not sure how this works, but in my world, you can turn any passion into a school of magic.
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;croix&stage;4:=interested.png,I'm... okay with that.
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;meia&stage;1:=happy.png,It's always fun to compare different cultures' armor sets. So what can you tell me about your armor, Meia?
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;1:=calm.png,It's just your jacket. That shouldn't be so bad.
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kyoko&stage;5:=shocked.png,Oh gosh! No wonder you didn't want to take off your gloves!
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;1&sayingmarker;monkey:,id:278=shocked.png,Oh no! You're a monkey! C-can you turn back?
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;sakura&stage;3:,id:4=shocked.png,Oh no! Y-you can reattach that, right?
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;0:,id:277=thinking.png,Oh, right, I see by your outfit that you're a dancer. I guess dancers can't exactly be evil... probably.
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;tharja&stage;0:=flustered.png,Oh, uh, I meant I'm in this world because of her, n-not playing this game. Playing this game was my idea.
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika&stage;0:,id:17=flustered.png,Oh? Were we supposed to bring friends...?
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;sonya:=interested.png,Oh? What are you doing?
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;4:=flustered.png,Personally, I'm glad you have to remove your hat first...
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;meia&stage;1&saying;pressurized:,marker:MeiaPressurizedArmor=interested.png,Pressurized? What's that for?
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;futaba&stage;0:=flustered.png,S-sorry! I didn't mean to insult your height...
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;0:=interested.png,Sure, it's a nice set - I just noticed; you're not wearing shoes. Why wear armor on all of your body but your feet?
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;0:=interested.png,Sure, it's a nice set - I just noticed; you're not wearing shoes. Why wear gloves, yet not shoes?
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;0:=interested.png,Sure, it's a nice set - I just noticed; you're not wearing shoes. Your feet are arguably one of the most important parts of your body to cover.
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:=interested.png,Well, I guess this method does make your item choice more of a surprise.
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;sakura&stage;2:=shocked.png,Wh-what the--?
-1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;rarity_eg&stage;1:=thinking.png,You and Etsuko have the same accent... Now that I think about it, you also both make clothes and have pale skin, too...
-1-female_removing_minor,priority:381,count-role;target&character;rin&stage;0:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:208=calm.png,I've always been pretty against the idea of Augments myself, but I like having two arms more, so I got one when I lost my arm in battle.
-1-female_removing_minor,priority:381,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:217=angry.png,Seriously, would you cut that out? Someone's gonna get hurt, and if you keep it up, I'll ensure that it's <i>you</i>!
-1-female_removing_minor,priority:381,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:215=facepalm.png,What a waste of ammo...
-1-female_removing_minor,priority:382,count-role;target&character;mae&stage;1&saidmarker;nightmarefeet&sayingmarker;nightmarefeet2:=interested.png,I'll admit, I am curious.
-1-female_removing_minor,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:135=annoyed.png,Alright, I've had enough of the fashion show. I want to see some <i>real</i> stripping.
-1-female_removing_minor,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:135=annoyed.png,You <i>really</i> think that's good enough right now?
-1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;2:=thinking.png,<i>Phew</i>, you undid it... I wonder how dangerous transformation magic is for magical beings like genies...
-1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;tharja&stage;1:=interested.png,A-anyway, what kind of spells do you know? My black mage friend Etsuko can summon monsters and curse people.
-1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:=calm.png,Case in point; I had no idea you were removing your footwear.
-1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;sonya:=interested.png,Face paint? Here? Now? Why?
-1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;corrin_f&stage;1:=calm.png,Have you ever tried sandals? I'm sure they'd be a good middle ground between not wearing shoes and protecting your feet.
-1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;sakura&stage;4:=flustered.png,I don't know any healing magic, so I can't help you if you can't reattach your head on your own.
-1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;kyoko&stage;6:=interested.png,I know an alchemist who might be able to help, curatives are his specialty. He's sure to have something for burn scars.
-1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;futaba&stage;1:=interested.png,I mean, it's not really my fault that you look so much like her.
-1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;futaba&stage;1:=interested.png,Like I said, you look a lot like her. I think my train of thought is perfectly reasonable.
-1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;moon:=sad.png,I never thought it'd ever be so uncomfortable with someone taking off their hat...
-1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;3:=interested.png,I'll admit, that's what I was thinking too, Sheena.
-1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika&stage;1:=thinking.png,I'm sure Etsuko would come if I just ask... <i>Maybe</i>...
-1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;mae&stage;2:=happy.png,I've never seen anyone take off their socks without their hands before. Your dexterity stat must be pretty good!
-1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;amy&stage;1:=happy.png,My mentor Etsuko invented a school of magic, so I'm sure she could teach you how to do it!
-1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;rin&stage;1:=calm.png,No, I don't know any myself, but I bet my friend Etsuko has a spellbook somewhere in her tower!
-1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;emi&stage;7:,id:37=enthused.png,Oh wow, those are pretty cool! It's like you're part puppet!... But wait, where's the strings?
-1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;emi&stage;7:,id:37=enthused.png,Wow, your legs are pretty cool! I never thought about replacing lost limbs with puppet parts before! So where are the strings?
-1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;ribbon_girl&stage;3:=thinking.png,Oh, right, I guess without the same powers as you, I wouldn't be able to use it right, huh?
-1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;erufuda&stage;1:,id:315=thinking.png,Oh, they're not secret! At least, I don't think they are...
-1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;1:=interested.png,Remind me, what sort of spells do dancers learn?
-1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;2:=happy.png,See, you look fine! It's just your shoulders!
-1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;5&saidmarker;bee2&notsaidmarker;bee_stop:=flustered.png,That was... Odd. Uh, sorry about your tunic, Florina.
-1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;5&saidmarker;bee2&notsaidmarker;bee_stop:=interested.png,That was... Bizarre. You wouldn't happen to have any Bee mage enemies, would you?
-1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;florina&stage;5&saidmarker;bee2&notsaidmarker;bee_stop:=interested.png,That was... Strange. You wouldn't happen to have any enemies who know Bee magic, would you?
-1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;croix&stage;5:=flustered.png,To be honest, I wouldn't have been surprised...
-1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;kyoko&stage;6:=sad.png,Wait, I think I have something that'll help in my... Oh right, I don't have my pouch anymore...
-1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;kyoko&stage;6:=sad.png,Wait, I think I have a potion in my... Oh right, I don't have my pouch anymore...
-1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;3:=interested.png,You... don't actually have this under control, do you?
-1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;2:,count-role;self&saidmarker;Shantae_Transformations:,id:312=flustered.png,<i>Phew</i>, you undid it... Well I guess you do have experience with this kind of stuff...
-1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;sakura&stage;3:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;ZLS1:,marker:ZLS1=calm.png,Oh! You're undead! I thought I smelled something... dead.
-1-female_removed_minor,count-role;self&saidmarker;MeiaPressurizedArmor:,count-role;target&character;meia&stage;2:=flustered.png,Tight clothes, huh? Glad I'm not a Mejarian, then. I'm not fond of tight clothes, except for my leggings...
-1-female_removed_minor,priority:381,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;2:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:216=annoyed.png,All you were taking off was your footwear? That's an even <i>bigger</i> waste of ammo.
-1-female_removed_minor,priority:381,count-role;target&character;rin&stage;1:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:209=interested.png,Do you at least know any butlery magic? It's an old art, but I bet it'd help you out a ton.
-1-female_removed_minor,priority:381,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;3:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:218=facepalm.png,Perhaps I won't even have to...
-1-female_removed_minor,priority:381,count-role;target&character;emi&stage;7:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:203=enthused.png,Wow, those are really archaic! You oughta upgrade.
-1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;sei&saidmarker;pauldrons:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=happy.png,Haha. Of course they're articulated, Sei. If you couldn't move your arms well, how would you swing your weapon?
-1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;sei&saidmarker;damage_reduction:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=interested.png,Oh, that's cool. One question, though: what's a "shotgun?" Whatever it is must be powerful, right?
-1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;sei&saidmarker;dna_lock:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=enthused.png,Wow, that's pretty cool! Maybe I should put the same kind of enchantment on my armor too?
-1-female_removed_minor,priority:381,count-role;target&character;mae&stage;2&saidmarker;nightmarefeet2:=flustered.png,Oh. Well, I'd rather have been fooled into <i>thinking</i> that they're nightmarish than have them actually <i>be</i> nightmarish.
-1-female_removed_minor,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:137=calm.png,If I wanted a fashion show, I'd read a magazine.

#OPPONENT REMOVING MAJOR CLOTHING
#Major clothing reveals a significant amount of skin and likely underwear.
#However, as we don't know if the opponent is taking off the top or the bottom, we can't presume that nice abs are showing; maybe she took of her skirt before her shirt.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

0-male_removed_major,count-role;target&layers;3-4:=interested.png,Sorry I haven't lost as much as you have, I guess.
0-male_removed_major,count-role;target&layers;3-4:=happy.png,Perhaps you should've tried harder?

0-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;sayla&stage;3:=interested.png,Oh dear. That's. uh... unfortunate?
0-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;mary&stage;3:,id:283=happy.png,Oh! How'd that happen? Don't worry, I can easily fix that for you. Buttons are super easy, even <i>without</i> magic!

0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;chiaki&stage;6:=embarrassed.png,J-jugs?... I... think I get that...
0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;raven:=happy.png,My sister has a cloak just like that, and you would <i>swear</i> it's enchanted because of how stealthy she is, but it's just a normal cloak.
0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;6:=calm.png,My thought exactly. Bare feet aren't as bad as bare, er... something else.
0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,N-no, you are, I just didn't expect it...
0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;3&notsaidmarker;NonMagicStrip1:=shocked.png,Oh dear! Y-your shirt!

0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;buffy&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,O-oh dear. I wasn't aware that one could... do that.
0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,O-oh, I see you came prepared...
0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&layers;3-4:=interested.png,Sorry I haven't lost as much as you have, I guess.
0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&layers;3-4:=happy.png,Perhaps you should've tried harder?
0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;marinette&stage;2:=interested.png,That was a neat trick, but why didn't you start like this? Isn't changing outfits mid-game cheating?
0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;marinette&stage;2:=interested.png,That was a neat trick, but aren't you technically cheating?
0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;ini&stage;4:=flustered.png,That's nice. Uh, it's a nice set, too.
0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;wonder_woman&stage;1:=sad.png,The king and queen of my land are both pretty cowardly. Er, please don't tell them I said that...

0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;saki_zls:=shocked.png,Woah!
0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;4:=flustered.png,Wow. I... didn't know assassins had custom underwear...
0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;april&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,W-wait, your jumpsuit shouldn't count as two items. That's kind of against the rules.
0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;spooky:=embarrassed.png,W-why weren't you wearing underwear? What if... What if someone sees up your dress...?
0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;tharja&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Yep, that's what I thought... G-good thinking, taking off your bodysuit from under your other stuff, s-so you can stay modest longer.

0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;beatrix:,count-role;other&character;joey:=flustered.png,I guess I do too, but... I dunno. It doesn't seem smart to me...

1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,<i>Oh!</i> S-so that's what your spell does... Uh, neat, I guess. I hope you know some sewing magic, too...
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,<i>Oh!</i> S-so that was just a fancy sewing spell, huh? F-for cutting, clearly...
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;4:=shocked.png,<i>What? B-but how?</i> Th-that doesn't make any sense!
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;nayru&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=shocked.png,A-are you okay? Do you need healing?
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5c:=happy.png,Haha! You sure do look like a fairy right now!
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;croix&stage;3:=flustered.png,I am a little bit.
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;syrenne&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,I g-guess this isn't far off from how other warriors dress, but still...
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;emi&stage;8:,id:36=interested.png,I guess if you're willing to... not have legs for the rest of the game, we can allow it.
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;beatrix&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,I guess not... B-but why would you come here with only three items?
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sayla&stage;4:=interested.png,I suppose that's fair.
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sayla&stage;4:=interested.png,I can't argue with that.
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sayla&stage;3&sayingmarker;sayla_tights_hope_not_ripped:=happy.png,If they do, I can fix them for you!
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;catria&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,I-it was? I d-didn't notice...
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;1:=flustered.png,It's, uh... a very nice b-bra, Pinkie.
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;chiaki&stage;6:=embarrassed.png,J-jugs?... I... think I get that...
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;raven:=happy.png,My sister has a cloak just like that, and you would <i>swear</i> it's enchanted because of how stealthy she is, but it's just a normal cloak.
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;6:=calm.png,My thought exactly. Bare feet aren't as bad as bare, er... something else.
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,N-no, you are, I just didn't expect it...
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;3&notsaidmarker;NonMagicStrip1:=shocked.png,Oh dear! Y-your shirt!
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;3&notsaidmarker;NonMagicStrip1:=shocked.png,Y-your shirt! Y-you didn't plan that, did you...?
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5a:=embarrassed.png,Oh dear. That's... quite the outfit.
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6a:=interested.png,Oh dear. Would anyone happen to have towels prepared?
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6b:=embarrassed.png,Oh dear... That's a... strange outfit...
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6b:=embarrassed.png,Oh my... That outfit is... strange... Among other things...
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;morrigan&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,Oh my. Your bats are <i>really</i> loyal...
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;morrigan&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,Th-that's fine. I'm fine with waiting...
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;jasmine&stage;2:=interested.png,Oh, uh... Sorry. I've never heard of you before. Should I have?
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5b:=happy.png,Oh. I like the hair for this outfit.
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;buffy&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,O-oh dear. I wasn't aware that one could... do that.
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,O-oh, I see you came prepared...
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&layers;3-4:=interested.png,Sorry I haven't lost as much as you have, I guess.
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&layers;3-4:=happy.png,Perhaps you should've tried harder?
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;marinette&stage;2:=interested.png,That was a neat trick, but why didn't you start like this? Isn't changing outfits mid-game cheating?
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;marinette&stage;2:=interested.png,That was a neat trick, but aren't you technically cheating?
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;ini&stage;4:=flustered.png,That's nice. Uh, it's a nice set, too.
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;wonder_woman&stage;1:=sad.png,The king and queen of my land are both pretty cowardly. Er, please don't tell them I said that...
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;erufuda&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,Uh, i-if it makes you feel better, I've had plenty of troubles with clothes, myself.
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;kizuna&stage;1:=flustered.png,Uh, y-yeah, definitely c-cute...
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;rinkah&stage;4:=flustered.png,Uh... W-we can, uh... Y-your, um, <i>hair</i> is...
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale:=embarrassed.png,Um, no offense, but I think your bra needs washed...
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale:=embarrassed.png,I, um... We can see your, um... never mind...
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale:=embarrassed.png,Uh, y-your b-bra is, um... never mind...
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;mulan&stage;2:,id:11=interested.png,Wait a minute, that outfit... That's a woman's garb. Are you... not actually a man?
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;moon:=embarrassed.png,We can, uh... Y-your shirt is, uh...
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;saki_zls:=shocked.png,Woah!
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;4:=flustered.png,Wow. I... didn't know assassins had custom underwear...
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;april&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,W-wait, your jumpsuit shouldn't count as two items. That's kind of against the rules.
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;spooky:=embarrassed.png,W-why weren't you wearing underwear? What if... What if someone sees up your dress...?
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;tharja&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Yep, that's what I thought... G-good thinking, taking off your bodysuit from under your other stuff, s-so you can stay modest longer.
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;kizuna&stage;1&saying;off:,marker:KizunaDidntKnow=interested.png,You... didn't know your shirt comes off?...
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;morrigan&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,Your bats sure are loyal, I guess...
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;shego:=embarrassed.png,Y-You prepared for this, didn't you? No one wears l-lingerie casually...
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;beatrix:,count-role;other&character;joey:=flustered.png,I guess I do too, but... I dunno. It doesn't seem smart to me...
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;misato:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:227=enthused.png,Ah haha ha! You really think <i>I'd</i> be put off by scars? Have you <i>seen</i> my face?
1-female_removed_major,priority:381,count-role;target&character;emi&stage;8:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:206=happy.png,Alright, if you're willing to forgo legs, I won't raise any objections to this.
1-female_removed_major,priority:381,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;5:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:246=happy.png,Nothing personal, of course. You seem like a fine - albeit idiotic - young lass. Just don't make me kill you, okay?
1-female_removed_major,priority:381,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1-2:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:213=calm.png,You're lucky no one got hurt. Otherwise, you'd be under arrest.
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;misato:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=embarrassed.png,I'm not looking away because of the scar, I'm looking away because you're nearly n-naked...
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;misato:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=embarrassed.png,I'm not off-put by the scar. My dad had a ton. I'm more off-putt by your state of dress...
1-female_removed_major,priority:381,count-role;target&character;mae&stage;3&saidmarker;bea_bras:=flustered.png,They make... comfortable ones...?
1-female_removed_major,priority:41,count-role;target&startinglayers;3-4:=flustered.png,I guess you don't have that much to take off, anyway...
1-female_removed_major,priority:41,count-role;target&startinglayers;3-4:=flustered.png,I guess you didn't exactly have a choice...
1-female_removed_major,priority:41,count-role;target&startinglayers;3-4:=interested.png,You... probably should've worn more.
1-female_removed_major,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:145=happy.png,Not long now until you're defeated.

2-male_removing_major,count-role;target&layers;3-4:=flustered.png,Gosh, you really don't have much left...
2-male_removing_major,count-role;target&layers;3-4:=happy.png,Not long now until you're defeated!... Sorry, I guess I shouldn't be celebrating.
2-male_removing_major,count-role;target&character;kamina&stage;3:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=interested.png,Well, it's mostly luck, so...
2-male_removing_major,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:138=enthused.png,Now there's a step in the right direction.
2-male_removed_major,count-role;target&character;jotaro&stage;6:=flustered.png,I-I'm sorry you had to take off your... expensive pants? I'm sure they'll be safe...
2-male_removed_major,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;7:=horny.png,Oh! Th-that's a, uh... clever use of your shield.
2-male_removed_major,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;7:=horny.png,Oh! I've, uh... I've never seen anyone use a shield that way, but fair enough.
2-male_removed_major,count-role;target&layers;3-4:=interested.png,Sorry I haven't lost as much as you have, I guess.
2-male_removed_major,count-role;target&layers;3-4:=happy.png,Perhaps you should've tried harder?
2-male_removed_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_m&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,Y-you're wearing... panties?... O-okay, I guess...
2-male_removed_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_m&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,W-why are y-you, uh... N-never mind. I don't think I want to know.
2-male_removed_major,count-role;target&character;kamina&stage;4:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=sad.png,...
2-male_removed_major,priority:41,count-role;target&startinglayers;3-4:=flustered.png,I guess you don't have that much to take off, anyway...

2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;4:,id:41=sad.png, I've even asked Asvaldr about it - if anyone would know, it'd be him. There's no cure because the gods forsake such mages for their hubris.
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;alice_degracia&stage;3:=calm.png,Ah! Etsuko has a whole line of clothes like that! I never could get the magic to work myself, though...
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;2&notsaidmarker;NonMagicStrip1:=interested.png,Anyhow, I suppose this'll be interesting to watch.
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;chiaki&stage;4&saying;HP:=interested.png,Do you need a healing item? I think I have one on me.
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;sayla&stage;2&sayingmarker;sayla_tights_valuable:=happy.png,Don't worry, I won't steal them. They wouldn't even fit me, anyway!
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&layers;3-4:=flustered.png,Gosh, you really don't have much left...
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&layers;3-4:=happy.png,Not long now until you're defeated!... Sorry, I guess I shouldn't be celebrating.
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;tharja&stage;1:,id:24=flustered.png,I may not know any black magic, but I think I know where this spell is going...
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;april&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,I really shouldn't look... It's not like I can't just look at my own in the mirror...
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;april&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,Try to get it over with quickly, like guzzling down a gross potion...
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;april&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,Well, I did read that it's good to let your, uh... chest... breathe every now and then...
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;april&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,I once read that it's good to let your, uh... chest... breathe, so I guess this isn't completely bad for you?
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4-5:=interested.png,I wonder what the outcome will be this time?
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4-5:=interested.png,I hope the outcome will be good.
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4-5:=interested.png,How likely is a bad roll?
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4-5:=interested.png,What could possibly go wrong?
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4-5:=interested.png,I'm sure the odds are in your favor, huh?
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;buffy&stage;4:=interested.png,I, uh, don't see what you're getting at.
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;emi&stage;7:,id:35=flustered.png,I... I suppose it's not my place to say if this should be allowed or not...
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4-5:=embarrassed.png,I'm afraid of what will happen if you roll a 20...
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4-5:=embarrassed.png,Th-the die can't effect anyone but you, right, Vriska? I fear that it might...
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4-5:=embarrassed.png,Th-the die can't effect <i>my</i> clothes, can it?...
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;mae&stage;2&sayingmarker;bea_bras:=happy.png,I'm glad I'm not the only one who feels that way... A-about bras, that is...
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;0:=shocked.png,Is this a spell of some kind? I hope you have it under control!
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;0:=shocked.png,Th-this has to be a spell, right? I hope you've practiced it well!
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;sayla&stage;2&sayingmarker;sayla_tights_no_steal:=calm.png,Of course I won't steal them. Stealing isn't in my class description!
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;spooky:=horny.png,Oh dear! I... I wasn't expect you to... Uh...
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;erufuda&stage;2:,id:26=shocked.png,Oh dear! Your p-pants!
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;beatrix&stage;0:=shocked.png,Oh dear! You're taking it off already? A-are you sure you don't have anything else to take off?
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;sayla&stage;3:=interested.png,Oh dear. That's. uh... unfortunate?
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;mary&stage;3:,id:283=happy.png,Oh! How'd that happen? Don't worry, I can easily fix that for you. Buttons are super easy, even <i>without</i> magic!
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;marinette&stage;1:=enthused.png,Oh! Sewing magic, huh? Did you study Etsuko's books too?
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;marinette&stage;1:=happy.png,Oh! Sewing magic, huh? I'm a practitioner of it myself.
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;0:=shocked.png,Oh! W-well I guess undressing is the name of the game, but you don't have to start with big items!
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;wonder_woman&stage;0:=happy.png,Oh, I see, this is your battle attire! I always admire royals who aren't afraid to be on the front lines!
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;2:=flustered.png,Oh, uh, sure. I'll look away.
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;5:=interested.png,Oh, you're just removing your stockings? That's not so bad, I guess.
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;kizuna&stage;0&saying;torn:,marker:KizunaTorn=happy.png,Oh? I can probably fix it for you, if you'd like! I know Sewing Magic!
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;meia&stage;2:=flustered.png,S-so are, uh... tight long johns like that common where you come from, Meia?
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;1:=flustered.png,Uh, k-kind of...
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;croix&stage;2:=interested.png,Uh, yeah, what about them?
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;morrigan&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Uh... G-good to know?...
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;saki_zls&stage;5:=interested.png,Uh... Makeup?...
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;3:=interested.png,W-well, your kimono wasn't exactly hiding your underwear from the start.
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,W-what? W-why would there be a banana in your...? And what does that have to do with being excited...?
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;catria&stage;4&saying;underwear:=flustered.png,Yeah, that is kind of weird. I don't understand why people think that either...
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;raven:=calm.png,Your cloak, huh? Is it magical at all?
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;nayru&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=shocked.png,Y-your dress!
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;syrenne&stage;0:=shocked.png,Y-you're starting with your top?
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,Y-you're taking off your b-bra already? You have so many other options...
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;marinette&stage;1:,count-role;self&saidmarker;SewingMagic:=happy.png,Oh, you know Sewing Magic too, ~name~? What're the odds that the three of us all would?
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;marinette&stage;1:,count-role;self&saidmarker;SewingMagic:=happy.png,Oh, you know Sewing Magic too, ~name~? Gosh, Etsuko's books must be more popular than I thought!
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;meia&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;jura:=flustered.png,S-so are, uh... tight long johns like that the common thing where you come from, or is Jura's outfit more common?
2-female_removing_major,priority:381,count-role;target&character;emi&stage;7:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:205=competitive.png,Ha! I respect your tenacity!
2-female_removing_major,priority:381,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;4:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:245=annoyed.png,Not even science can cure it. The gods forsake such mages for their hubris, and so will I if it happens to you.
2-female_removing_major,priority:381,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;0:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:211=annoyed.png,You're using <i>bullets</i> to <i>undress</i>? Are you <i>insane</i>?
2-female_removing_major,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:143=enthused.png,Now there's a step in the right direction.
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;5:=flustered.png,... Sorry, I'm being a downer, aren't I?... Um, on the plus side, we've learned some things about magic because of Manatrocities.
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;revy:=facepalm.png,<i>Oh my gosh, this woman is more insufferable than Niccolo...</i>
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;revy:=facepalm.png,<i>Ugh, this woman makes Niccolo seem pleasant...</i>
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,<i>Oh!</i> S-so that's what your spell does... Uh, neat, I guess. I hope you know some sewing magic, too...
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,<i>Oh!</i> S-so that was just a fancy sewing spell, huh? F-for cutting, clearly...
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;4:=shocked.png,<i>What? B-but how?</i> Th-that doesn't make any sense!
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;nayru&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=shocked.png,A-are you okay? Do you need healing?
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5c:=happy.png,Haha! You sure do look like a fairy right now!
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;croix&stage;3:=flustered.png,I am a little bit.
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;syrenne&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,I g-guess this isn't far off from how other warriors dress, but still...
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;emi&stage;8:,id:36=interested.png,I guess if you're willing to... not have legs for the rest of the game, we can allow it.
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;beatrix&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,I guess not... B-but why would you come here with only three items?
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sayla&stage;4:=interested.png,I suppose that's fair.
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sayla&stage;4:=interested.png,I can't argue with that.
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sayla&stage;3&sayingmarker;sayla_tights_hope_not_ripped:=happy.png,If they do, I can fix them for you!
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;catria&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,I-it was? I d-didn't notice...
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;1:=flustered.png,It's, uh... a very nice b-bra, Pinkie.
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;chiaki&stage;6:=embarrassed.png,J-jugs?... I... think I get that...
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;raven:=happy.png,My sister has a cloak just like that, and you would <i>swear</i> it's enchanted because of how stealthy she is, but it's just a normal cloak.
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;6:=calm.png,My thought exactly. Bare feet aren't as bad as bare, er... something else.

2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5a:=embarrassed.png,Oh dear. That's... quite the outfit.
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6a:=interested.png,Oh dear. Would anyone happen to have towels prepared?
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6b:=embarrassed.png,Oh dear... That's a... strange outfit...
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6b:=embarrassed.png,Oh my... That outfit is... strange... Among other things...
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;morrigan&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,Oh my. Your bats are <i>really</i> loyal...
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;morrigan&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,Th-that's fine. I'm fine with waiting...
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;jasmine&stage;2:=interested.png,Oh, uh... Sorry. I've never heard of you before. Should I have?
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5b:=happy.png,Oh. I like the hair for this outfit.
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;buffy&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,O-oh dear. I wasn't aware that one could... do that.
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,O-oh, I see you came prepared...
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&layers;3-4:=interested.png,Sorry I haven't lost as much as you have, I guess.
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&layers;3-4:=happy.png,Perhaps you should've tried harder?
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;marinette&stage;2:=interested.png,That was a neat trick, but why didn't you start like this? Isn't changing outfits mid-game cheating?
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;marinette&stage;2:=interested.png,That was a neat trick, but aren't you technically cheating?
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;ini&stage;4:=flustered.png,That's nice. Uh, it's a nice set, too.
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;wonder_woman&stage;1:=sad.png,The king and queen of my land are both pretty cowardly. Er, please don't tell them I said that...
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;erufuda&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,Uh, i-if it makes you feel better, I've had plenty of troubles with clothes, myself.
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;kizuna&stage;1:=flustered.png,Uh, y-yeah, definitely c-cute...
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;rinkah&stage;4:=flustered.png,Uh... W-we can, uh... Y-your, um, <i>hair</i> is...
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale:=embarrassed.png,Um, no offense, but I think your bra needs washed...
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale:=embarrassed.png,I, um... We can see your, um... never mind...
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale:=embarrassed.png,Uh, y-your b-bra is, um... never mind...
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;mulan&stage;2:,id:11=interested.png,Wait a minute, that outfit... That's a woman's garb. Are you... not actually a man?
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;moon:=embarrassed.png,We can, uh... Y-your shirt is, uh...
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;saki_zls:=shocked.png,Woah!
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;4:=flustered.png,Wow. I... didn't know assassins had custom underwear...
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;april&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,W-wait, your jumpsuit shouldn't count as two items. That's kind of against the rules.
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;spooky:=embarrassed.png,W-why weren't you wearing underwear? What if... What if someone sees up your dress...?
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;tharja&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Yep, that's what I thought... G-good thinking, taking off your bodysuit from under your other stuff, s-so you can stay modest longer.
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;kizuna&stage;1&saying;off:,marker:KizunaDidntKnow=interested.png,You... didn't know your shirt comes off?...
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;morrigan&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,Your bats sure are loyal, I guess...
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;shego:=embarrassed.png,Y-You prepared for this, didn't you? No one wears l-lingerie casually...
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;beatrix:,count-role;other&character;joey:=flustered.png,I guess I do too, but... I dunno. It doesn't seem smart to me...
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;misato:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:227=enthused.png,Ah haha ha! You really think <i>I'd</i> be put off by scars? Have you <i>seen</i> my face?
2-female_removed_major,priority:381,count-role;target&character;emi&stage;8:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:206=happy.png,Alright, if you're willing to forgo legs, I won't raise any objections to this.
2-female_removed_major,priority:381,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;5:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:246=happy.png,Nothing personal, of course. You seem like a fine - albeit idiotic - young lass. Just don't make me kill you, okay?
2-female_removed_major,priority:381,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1-2:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:213=calm.png,You're lucky no one got hurt. Otherwise, you'd be under arrest.
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;misato:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=embarrassed.png,I'm not looking away because of the scar, I'm looking away because you're nearly n-naked...
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;misato:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=embarrassed.png,I'm not off-put by the scar. My dad had a ton. I'm more off-putt by your state of dress...
2-female_removed_major,priority:381,count-role;target&character;mae&stage;3&saidmarker;bea_bras:=flustered.png,They make... comfortable ones...?
2-female_removed_major,priority:41,count-role;target&startinglayers;3-4:=flustered.png,I guess you don't have that much to take off, anyway...
2-female_removed_major,priority:41,count-role;target&startinglayers;3-4:=flustered.png,I guess you didn't exactly have a choice...
2-female_removed_major,priority:41,count-role;target&startinglayers;3-4:=interested.png,You... probably should've worn more.
2-female_removed_major,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:145=happy.png,Not long now until you're defeated.

3-male_removing_major=happy.png,Join me in the ~clothing~-less club!
3-male_removing_major=happy.png,Now it's your turn to embarrass yourself!
3-male_removing_major=happy.png,If I can do it, you can do it, too!
3-male_removing_major,count-role;target&character;kamina&stage;3:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=interested.png,Well, it's mostly luck, so...
3-male_removing_major,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:138=enthused.png,Now there's a step in the right direction.
3-male_removed_major=happy.png,Only slightly embarrassing, right?
3-male_removed_major=calm.png,It's not so bad once you get used to it.
3-male_removed_major=calm.png,I'm still getting used to it, myself. The embarrassment, that is.
3-male_removed_major=calm.png,I'm still getting used to the embarrassment, myself.
3-male_removed_major,count-role;target&character;jotaro&stage;6:=flustered.png,I-I'm sorry you had to take off your... expensive pants? I'm sure they'll be safe...
3-male_removed_major,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;7:=horny.png,Oh! Th-that's a, uh... clever use of your shield.
3-male_removed_major,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;7:=horny.png,Oh! I've, uh... I've never seen anyone use a shield that way, but fair enough.
3-male_removed_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_m&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,Y-you're wearing... panties?... O-okay, I guess...
3-male_removed_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_m&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,W-why are y-you, uh... N-never mind. I don't think I want to know.
3-male_removed_major,count-role;target&character;kamina&stage;4:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=sad.png,...
3-male_removed_major,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:140=happy.png,Not long now until you're defeated.
3-female_removing_major=happy.png,Join me in the ~clothing~-less club!
3-female_removing_major=happy.png,Now it's your turn to embarrass yourself!
3-female_removing_major=happy.png,If I can do it, you can do it, too!
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;syrenne&stage;0:=shocked.png,~silent~
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;4:,id:41=sad.png, I've even asked Asvaldr about it - if anyone would know, it'd be him. There's no cure because the gods forsake such mages for their hubris.
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;alice_degracia&stage;3:=calm.png,Ah! Etsuko has a whole line of clothes like that! I never could get the magic to work myself, though...
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;2&notsaidmarker;NonMagicStrip1:=interested.png,Anyhow, I suppose this'll be interesting to watch.
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;chiaki&stage;4&saying;HP:=interested.png,Do you need a healing item? I think I have one on me.
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;sayla&stage;2&sayingmarker;sayla_tights_valuable:=happy.png,Don't worry, I won't steal them. They wouldn't even fit me, anyway!
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;tharja&stage;1:,id:24=flustered.png,I may not know any black magic, but I think I know where this spell is going...
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;april&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,I really shouldn't look... It's not like I can't just look at my own in the mirror...
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;april&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,Try to get it over with quickly, like guzzling down a gross potion...
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;april&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,Well, I did read that it's good to let your, uh... chest... breathe every now and then...
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;april&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,I once read that it's good to let your, uh... chest... breathe, so I guess this isn't completely bad for you?
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4-5:=interested.png,I wonder what the outcome will be this time?
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4-5:=interested.png,I hope the outcome will be good.
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4-5:=interested.png,How likely is a bad roll?
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4-5:=interested.png,What could possibly go wrong?
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4-5:=interested.png,I'm sure the odds are in your favor, huh?
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;buffy&stage;4:=interested.png,I, uh, don't see what you're getting at.
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;emi&stage;7:,id:35=flustered.png,I... I suppose it's not my place to say if this should be allowed or not...
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4-5:=embarrassed.png,I'm afraid of what will happen if you roll a 20...
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4-5:=embarrassed.png,Th-the die can't effect anyone but you, right, Vriska? I fear that it might...
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4-5:=embarrassed.png,Th-the die can't effect <i>my</i> clothes, can it?...
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;mae&stage;2&sayingmarker;bea_bras:=happy.png,I'm glad I'm not the only one who feels that way... A-about bras, that is...
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;0:=shocked.png,Is this a spell of some kind? I hope you have it under control!
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;0:=shocked.png,Th-this has to be a spell, right? I hope you've practiced it well!
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;sayla&stage;2&sayingmarker;sayla_tights_no_steal:=calm.png,Of course I won't steal them. Stealing isn't in my class description!
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;spooky:=horny.png,Oh dear! I... I wasn't expect you to... Uh...
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;erufuda&stage;2:,id:26=shocked.png,Oh dear! Your p-pants!
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;beatrix&stage;0:=shocked.png,Oh dear! You're taking it off already? A-are you sure you don't have anything else to take off?
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;sayla&stage;3:=interested.png,Oh dear. That's. uh... unfortunate?
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;mary&stage;3:,id:283=happy.png,Oh! How'd that happen? Don't worry, I can easily fix that for you. Buttons are super easy, even <i>without</i> magic!
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;marinette&stage;1:=enthused.png,Oh! Sewing magic, huh? Did you study Etsuko's books too?
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;marinette&stage;1:=happy.png,Oh! Sewing magic, huh? I'm a practitioner of it myself.
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;0:=shocked.png,Oh! W-well I guess undressing is the name of the game, but you don't have to start with big items!
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;wonder_woman&stage;0:=happy.png,Oh, I see, this is your battle attire! I always admire royals who aren't afraid to be on the front lines!
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;2:=flustered.png,Oh, uh, sure. I'll look away.
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;5:=interested.png,Oh, you're just removing your stockings? That's not so bad, I guess.
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;kizuna&stage;0&saying;torn:,marker:KizunaTorn=happy.png,Oh? I can probably fix it for you, if you'd like! I know Sewing Magic!
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;meia&stage;2:=flustered.png,S-so are, uh... tight long johns like that common where you come from, Meia?
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;1:=flustered.png,Uh, k-kind of...
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;croix&stage;2:=interested.png,Uh, yeah, what about them?
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;morrigan&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Uh... G-good to know?...
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;saki_zls&stage;5:=interested.png,Uh... Makeup?...
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;3:=interested.png,W-well, your kimono wasn't exactly hiding your underwear from the start.
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,W-what? W-why would there be a banana in your...? And what does that have to do with being excited...?
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;catria&stage;4&saying;underwear:=flustered.png,Yeah, that is kind of weird. I don't understand why people think that either...
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;raven:=calm.png,Your cloak, huh? Is it magical at all?
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;nayru&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=shocked.png,Y-your dress!
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;syrenne&stage;0:=shocked.png,Y-you're starting with your top?
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,Y-you're taking off your b-bra already? You have so many other options...
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;marinette&stage;1:,count-role;self&saidmarker;SewingMagic:=happy.png,Oh, you know Sewing Magic too, ~name~? What're the odds that the three of us all would?
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;marinette&stage;1:,count-role;self&saidmarker;SewingMagic:=happy.png,Oh, you know Sewing Magic too, ~name~? Gosh, Etsuko's books must be more popular than I thought!
3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;meia&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;jura:=flustered.png,S-so are, uh... tight long johns like that the common thing where you come from, or is Jura's outfit more common?
3-female_removing_major,priority:381,count-role;target&character;emi&stage;7:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:205=competitive.png,Ha! I respect your tenacity!
3-female_removing_major,priority:381,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;4:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:245=annoyed.png,Not even science can cure it. The gods forsake such mages for their hubris, and so will I if it happens to you.
3-female_removing_major,priority:381,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;0:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:211=annoyed.png,You're using <i>bullets</i> to <i>undress</i>? Are you <i>insane</i>?
3-female_removing_major,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:143=enthused.png,Now there's a step in the right direction.
3-female_removed_major=happy.png,Only slightly embarrassing, right?
3-female_removed_major=calm.png,It's not so bad once you get used to it.
3-female_removed_major=calm.png,I'm still getting used to it, myself. The embarrassment, that is.
3-female_removed_major=calm.png,I'm still getting used to the embarrassment, myself.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;5:=flustered.png,... Sorry, I'm being a downer, aren't I?... Um, on the plus side, we've learned some things about magic because of Manatrocities.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;revy:=facepalm.png,<i>Oh my gosh, this woman is more insufferable than Niccolo...</i>
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;revy:=facepalm.png,<i>Ugh, this woman makes Niccolo seem pleasant...</i>
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,<i>Oh!</i> S-so that's what your spell does... Uh, neat, I guess. I hope you know some sewing magic, too...
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,<i>Oh!</i> S-so that was just a fancy sewing spell, huh? F-for cutting, clearly...
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;4:=shocked.png,<i>What? B-but how?</i> Th-that doesn't make any sense!
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;nayru&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=shocked.png,A-are you okay? Do you need healing?
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5c:=happy.png,Haha! You sure do look like a fairy right now!
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;marinette&stage;2:=angry.png,Hey, wait a moment, that's cheating! You have more items now!
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;marinette&stage;2:=angry.png,Hey, no fair! I'm running out of clothes, and you go and conjure <i>more</i>?! That's cheating!
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;croix&stage;3:=flustered.png,I am a little bit.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;syrenne&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,I g-guess this isn't far off from how other warriors dress, but still...
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;emi&stage;8:,id:36=interested.png,I guess if you're willing to... not have legs for the rest of the game, we can allow it.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;beatrix&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,I guess not... B-but why would you come here with only three items?
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sayla&stage;4:=interested.png,I suppose that's fair.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sayla&stage;4:=interested.png,I can't argue with that.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sayla&stage;3&sayingmarker;sayla_tights_hope_not_ripped:=happy.png,If they do, I can fix them for you!
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;catria&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,I-it was? I d-didn't notice...
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;1:=flustered.png,It's, uh... a very nice b-bra, Pinkie.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;chiaki&stage;6:=embarrassed.png,J-jugs?... I... think I get that...
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;raven:=happy.png,My sister has a cloak just like that, and you would <i>swear</i> it's enchanted because of how stealthy she is, but it's just a normal cloak.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;6:=calm.png,My thought exactly. Bare feet aren't as bad as bare, er... something else.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,N-no, you are, I just didn't expect it...
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;3&notsaidmarker;NonMagicStrip1:=shocked.png,Oh dear! Y-your shirt!
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;3&notsaidmarker;NonMagicStrip1:=shocked.png,Y-your shirt! Y-you didn't plan that, did you...?
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5a:=embarrassed.png,Oh dear. That's... quite the outfit.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6a:=interested.png,Oh dear. Would anyone happen to have towels prepared?
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6b:=embarrassed.png,Oh dear... That's a... strange outfit...
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6b:=embarrassed.png,Oh my... That outfit is... strange... Among other things...
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;morrigan&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,Oh my. Your bats are <i>really</i> loyal...
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;morrigan&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,Th-that's fine. I'm fine with waiting...
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;jasmine&stage;2:=interested.png,Oh, uh... Sorry. I've never heard of you before. Should I have?
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5b:=happy.png,Oh. I like the hair for this outfit.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;buffy&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,O-oh dear. I wasn't aware that one could... do that.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,O-oh, I see you came prepared...
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;ini&stage;4:=flustered.png,That's nice. Uh, it's a nice set, too.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;wonder_woman&stage;1:=sad.png,The king and queen of my land are both pretty cowardly. Er, please don't tell them I said that...
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;erufuda&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,Uh, i-if it makes you feel better, I've had plenty of troubles with clothes, myself.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;kizuna&stage;1:=flustered.png,Uh, y-yeah, definitely c-cute...
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;rinkah&stage;4:=flustered.png,Uh... W-we can, uh... Y-your, um, <i>hair</i> is...
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale:=embarrassed.png,Um, no offense, but I think your bra needs washed...
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale:=embarrassed.png,I, um... We can see your, um... never mind...
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale:=embarrassed.png,Uh, y-your b-bra is, um... never mind...
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;mulan&stage;2:,id:11=interested.png,Wait a minute, that outfit... That's a woman's garb. Are you... not actually a man?
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;moon:=embarrassed.png,We can, uh... Y-your shirt is, uh...
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;saki_zls:=shocked.png,Woah!
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;4:=flustered.png,Wow. I... didn't know assassins had custom underwear...
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;april&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,W-wait, your jumpsuit shouldn't count as two items. That's kind of against the rules.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;spooky:=embarrassed.png,W-why weren't you wearing underwear? What if... What if someone sees up your dress...?
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;tharja&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Yep, that's what I thought... G-good thinking, taking off your bodysuit from under your other stuff, s-so you can stay modest longer.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;kizuna&stage;1&saying;off:,marker:KizunaDidntKnow=interested.png,You... didn't know your shirt comes off?...
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;morrigan&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,Your bats sure are loyal, I guess...
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;shego:=embarrassed.png,Y-You prepared for this, didn't you? No one wears l-lingerie casually...
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;beatrix:,count-role;other&character;joey:=flustered.png,I guess I do too, but... I dunno. It doesn't seem smart to me...
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;misato:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:227=enthused.png,Ah haha ha! You really think <i>I'd</i> be put off by scars? Have you <i>seen</i> my face?
3-female_removed_major,priority:381,count-role;target&character;emi&stage;8:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:206=happy.png,Alright, if you're willing to forgo legs, I won't raise any objections to this.
3-female_removed_major,priority:381,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;5:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:246=happy.png,Nothing personal, of course. You seem like a fine - albeit idiotic - young lass. Just don't make me kill you, okay?
3-female_removed_major,priority:381,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1-2:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:213=calm.png,You're lucky no one got hurt. Otherwise, you'd be under arrest.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;misato:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=embarrassed.png,I'm not looking away because of the scar, I'm looking away because you're nearly n-naked...
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;misato:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=embarrassed.png,I'm not off-put by the scar. My dad had a ton. I'm more off-putt by your state of dress...
3-female_removed_major,priority:381,count-role;target&character;mae&stage;3&saidmarker;bea_bras:=flustered.png,They make... comfortable ones...?
3-female_removed_major,priority:41,count-role;target&startinglayers;3-4:=flustered.png,I guess you don't have that much to take off, anyway...
3-female_removed_major,priority:41,count-role;target&startinglayers;3-4:=flustered.png,I guess you didn't exactly have a choice...
3-female_removed_major,priority:41,count-role;target&startinglayers;3-4:=interested.png,You... probably should've worn more.
3-female_removed_major,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:145=happy.png,Not long now until you're defeated.


#lost leggings
4-male_removing_major=happy.png,Hey, looks like we're about to be even.
4-male_removing_major=competitive.png,You didn't expect to go the whole game with your ~clothing~ on, did you?
4-male_removing_major=happy.png,Time for you to do some catching up.
4-male_removing_major=happy.png,Well, you'll have to do it eventually, so why not now?
4-male_removing_major,count-role;target&startinglayers;3-4:=happy.png,I'm kinda glad you didn't start off with a whole lot.
4-male_removing_major,count-role;target&startinglayers;3-4:=happy.png,It's a good thing you're not wearing a whole lot. Good for me, anyway...
4-male_removing_major,count-role;target&character;kamina&stage;3:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=interested.png,Well, it's mostly luck, so...
4-male_removing_major,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:139=enthused.png,Now <i>that's</i> what I want to see.
4-male_removed_major=happy.png,Welcome to my level. Er, not, like, experience points, I meant - never mind...
4-male_removed_major=happy.png,It's nice that you're keeping pace.
4-male_removed_major=happy.png,This game is more fun when you're not the only one in your underwear.
4-male_removed_major=happy.png,I think I'm starting to have fun again.
4-male_removed_major,count-role;target&character;jotaro&stage;6:=flustered.png,I-I'm sorry you had to take off your... expensive pants? I'm sure they'll be safe...
4-male_removed_major,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;7:=horny.png,Oh! Th-that's a, uh... clever use of your shield.
4-male_removed_major,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;7:=horny.png,Oh! I've, uh... I've never seen anyone use a shield that way, but fair enough.
4-male_removed_major,count-role;target&startinglayers;3-4:=competitive.png,You can't complain if you end up losing before me! You dug your own grave on this one.
4-male_removed_major,count-role;target&startinglayers;3-4:=competitive.png,If you really think you can beat me with what you have left, I'd like to see you try!
4-male_removed_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_m&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,Y-you're wearing... panties?... O-okay, I guess...
4-male_removed_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_m&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,W-why are y-you, uh... N-never mind. I don't think I want to know.
4-male_removed_major,count-role;target&character;kamina&stage;4:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=sad.png,...
4-male_removed_major,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:141=happy.png,Now just do that again a few more times.
4-female_removing_major=happy.png,Hey, looks like we're about to be even.
4-female_removing_major=competitive.png,You didn't expect to go the whole game with your ~clothing~ on, did you?
4-female_removing_major=happy.png,Time for you to do some catching up.
4-female_removing_major=happy.png,Well, you'll have to do it eventually, so why not now?
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;syrenne&stage;0:=shocked.png,~silent~
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;4:,id:41=sad.png, I've even asked Asvaldr about it - if anyone would know, it'd be him. There's no cure because the gods forsake such mages for their hubris.
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;alice_degracia&stage;3:=calm.png,Ah! Etsuko has a whole line of clothes like that! I never could get the magic to work myself, though...
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;2&notsaidmarker;NonMagicStrip1:=interested.png,Anyhow, I suppose this'll be interesting to watch.
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;chiaki&stage;4&saying;HP:=interested.png,Do you need a healing item? I think I have one on me.
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;sayla&stage;2&sayingmarker;sayla_tights_valuable:=happy.png,Don't worry, I won't steal them. They wouldn't even fit me, anyway!
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;tharja&stage;1:,id:24=flustered.png,I may not know any black magic, but I think I know where this spell is going...
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;april&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,I really shouldn't look... It's not like I can't just look at my own in the mirror...
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;april&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,Try to get it over with quickly, like guzzling down a gross potion...
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;april&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,Well, I did read that it's good to let your, uh... chest... breathe every now and then...
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;april&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,I once read that it's good to let your, uh... chest... breathe, so I guess this isn't completely bad for you?
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4-5:=interested.png,I wonder what the outcome will be this time?
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4-5:=interested.png,I hope the outcome will be good.
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4-5:=interested.png,How likely is a bad roll?
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4-5:=interested.png,What could possibly go wrong?
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4-5:=interested.png,I'm sure the odds are in your favor, huh?
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;buffy&stage;4:=interested.png,I, uh, don't see what you're getting at.
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;emi&stage;7:,id:35=flustered.png,I... I suppose it's not my place to say if this should be allowed or not...
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;mae&stage;2&sayingmarker;bea_bras:=happy.png,I'm glad I'm not the only one who feels that way... A-about bras, that is...
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&startinglayers;3-4:=happy.png,I'm kinda glad you didn't start off with a whole lot.
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&startinglayers;3-4:=happy.png,It's a good thing you're not wearing a whole lot. Good for me, anyway...
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;0:=shocked.png,Is this a spell of some kind? I hope you have it under control!
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;0:=shocked.png,Th-this has to be a spell, right? I hope you've practiced it well!
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;sayla&stage;2&sayingmarker;sayla_tights_no_steal:=calm.png,Of course I won't steal them. Stealing isn't in my class description!
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;spooky:=horny.png,Oh dear! I... I wasn't expect you to... Uh...
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;erufuda&stage;2:,id:26=shocked.png,Oh dear! Your p-pants!
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;beatrix&stage;0:=shocked.png,Oh dear! You're taking it off already? A-are you sure you don't have anything else to take off?
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;sayla&stage;3:=interested.png,Oh dear. That's. uh... unfortunate?
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;mary&stage;3:,id:283=happy.png,Oh! How'd that happen? Don't worry, I can easily fix that for you. Buttons are super easy, even <i>without</i> magic!
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;marinette&stage;1:=enthused.png,Oh! Sewing magic, huh? Did you study Etsuko's books too?
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;marinette&stage;1:=happy.png,Oh! Sewing magic, huh? I'm a practitioner of it myself.
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;0:=shocked.png,Oh! W-well I guess undressing is the name of the game, but you don't have to start with big items!
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;wonder_woman&stage;0:=happy.png,Oh, I see, this is your battle attire! I always admire royals who aren't afraid to be on the front lines!
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;2:=flustered.png,Oh, uh, sure. I'll look away.
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;5:=interested.png,Oh, you're just removing your stockings? That's not so bad, I guess.
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;kizuna&stage;0&saying;torn:,marker:KizunaTorn=happy.png,Oh? I can probably fix it for you, if you'd like! I know Sewing Magic!
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;meia&stage;2:=flustered.png,S-so are, uh... tight long johns like that common where you come from, Meia?
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;1:=flustered.png,Uh, k-kind of...
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;croix&stage;2:=interested.png,Uh, yeah, what about them?
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;morrigan&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Uh... G-good to know?...
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;saki_zls&stage;5:=interested.png,Uh... Makeup?...
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;3:=interested.png,W-well, your kimono wasn't exactly hiding your underwear from the start.
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,W-what? W-why would there be a banana in your...? And what does that have to do with being excited...?
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;catria&stage;4&saying;underwear:=flustered.png,Yeah, that is kind of weird. I don't understand why people think that either...
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;raven:=calm.png,Your cloak, huh? Is it magical at all?
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;nayru&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=shocked.png,Y-your dress!
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;syrenne&stage;0:=shocked.png,Y-you're starting with your top?
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,Y-you're taking off your b-bra already? You have so many other options...
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;marinette&stage;1:,count-role;self&saidmarker;SewingMagic:=happy.png,Oh, you know Sewing Magic too, ~name~? What're the odds that the three of us all would?
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;marinette&stage;1:,count-role;self&saidmarker;SewingMagic:=happy.png,Oh, you know Sewing Magic too, ~name~? Gosh, Etsuko's books must be more popular than I thought!
4-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;meia&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;jura:=flustered.png,S-so are, uh... tight long johns like that the common thing where you come from, or is Jura's outfit more common?
4-female_removing_major,priority:381,count-role;target&character;emi&stage;7:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:205=competitive.png,Ha! I respect your tenacity!
4-female_removing_major,priority:381,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;4:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:245=annoyed.png,Not even science can cure it. The gods forsake such mages for their hubris, and so will I if it happens to you.
4-female_removing_major,priority:381,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;0:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:211=annoyed.png,You're using <i>bullets</i> to <i>undress</i>? Are you <i>insane</i>?
4-female_removing_major,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:144=enthused.png,Now <i>that's</i> what I want to see.
4-female_removed_major=happy.png,Welcome to my level. Er, not, like, experience points, I meant - never mind...
4-female_removed_major=happy.png,It's nice that you're keeping pace.
4-female_removed_major=happy.png,This game is more fun when you're not the only one in your underwear.
4-female_removed_major=happy.png,I think I'm starting to have fun again.
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;5:=flustered.png,... Sorry, I'm being a downer, aren't I?... Um, on the plus side, we've learned some things about magic because of Manatrocities.
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;revy:=facepalm.png,<i>Oh my gosh, this woman is more insufferable than Niccolo...</i>
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;revy:=facepalm.png,<i>Ugh, this woman makes Niccolo seem pleasant...</i>
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:=flustered.png,<i>Oh!</i> Well, I, uh... wanted you to lose clothes quickly, but you didn't have to... explode them.
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:=flustered.png,<i>Oh!</i> Well, I, uh... wanted you to lose clothes quickly, but not like <i>that</i>.
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;4:=shocked.png,<i>What? B-but how?</i> Th-that doesn't make any sense!
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;nayru&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=shocked.png,A-are you okay? Do you need healing?
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5c:=happy.png,Haha! You sure do look like a fairy right now!
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;marinette&stage;2:=angry.png,Hey, wait a moment, that's cheating! You have more items now!
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;marinette&stage;2:=angry.png,Hey, no fair! I'm running out of clothes, and you go and conjure <i>more</i>?! That's cheating!
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;spooky:=angry.png,H-hey! Did you just gain more clothes? That's cheating!
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;spooky:=angry.png,H-hey! You can't do that! You can't just gain more clothes!
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;april&stage;4:=angry.png,H-hey, wait a minute! You're jumpsuit shouldn't count as two items! That's not fair!
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;croix&stage;3:=flustered.png,I am a little bit.
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;syrenne&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,I g-guess this isn't far off from how other warriors dress, but still...
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;emi&stage;8:,id:36=interested.png,I guess if you're willing to... not have legs for the rest of the game, we can allow it.
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;beatrix&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,I guess not... B-but why would you come here with only three items?
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sayla&stage;4:=interested.png,I suppose that's fair.
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sayla&stage;4:=interested.png,I can't argue with that.
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sayla&stage;3&sayingmarker;sayla_tights_hope_not_ripped:=happy.png,If they do, I can fix them for you!
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;catria&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,I-it was? I d-didn't notice...
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;1:=flustered.png,It's, uh... a very nice b-bra, Pinkie.
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;chiaki&stage;6:=embarrassed.png,J-jugs?... I... think I get that...
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;raven:=happy.png,My sister has a cloak just like that, and you would <i>swear</i> it's enchanted because of how stealthy she is, but it's just a normal cloak.
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;6:=calm.png,My thought exactly. Bare feet aren't as bad as bare, er... something else.
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,N-no, you are, I just didn't expect it...
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;3&notsaidmarker;NonMagicStrip1:=shocked.png,Oh dear! Y-your shirt!
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;3&notsaidmarker;NonMagicStrip1:=shocked.png,Y-your shirt! Y-you didn't plan that, did you...?
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5a:=embarrassed.png,Oh dear. That's... quite the outfit.
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6a:=interested.png,Oh dear. Would anyone happen to have towels prepared?
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6b:=embarrassed.png,Oh dear... That's a... strange outfit...
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6b:=embarrassed.png,Oh my... That outfit is... strange... Among other things...
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;morrigan&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,Oh my. Your bats are <i>really</i> loyal...
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;morrigan&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,Th-that's fine. I'm fine with waiting...
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;jasmine&stage;2:=interested.png,Oh, uh... Sorry. I've never heard of you before. Should I have?
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5b:=happy.png,Oh. I like the hair for this outfit.
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;buffy&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,O-oh dear. I wasn't aware that one could... do that.
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,O-oh, I see you came prepared...
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;ini&stage;4:=flustered.png,That's nice. Uh, it's a nice set, too.
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;wonder_woman&stage;1:=sad.png,The king and queen of my land are both pretty cowardly. Er, please don't tell them I said that...
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;erufuda&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,Uh, i-if it makes you feel better, I've had plenty of troubles with clothes, myself.
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;kizuna&stage;1:=flustered.png,Uh, y-yeah, definitely c-cute...
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;rinkah&stage;4:=flustered.png,Uh... W-we can, uh... Y-your, um, <i>hair</i> is...
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale:=embarrassed.png,Um, no offense, but I think your bra needs washed...
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale:=embarrassed.png,I, um... We can see your, um... never mind...
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale:=embarrassed.png,Uh, y-your b-bra is, um... never mind...
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;mulan&stage;2:,id:11=interested.png,Wait a minute, that outfit... That's a woman's garb. Are you... not actually a man?
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;moon:=embarrassed.png,We can, uh... Y-your shirt is, uh...
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;saki_zls:=shocked.png,Woah!
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;4:=flustered.png,Wow. I... didn't know assassins had custom underwear...
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;april&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,W-wait, your jumpsuit shouldn't count as two items. That's kind of against the rules.
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;tharja&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Yep, that's what I thought... G-good thinking, taking off your bodysuit from under your other stuff, s-so you can stay modest longer.
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&startinglayers;3-4:=competitive.png,You can't complain if you end up losing before me! You dug your own grave on this one.
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&startinglayers;3-4:=competitive.png,If you really think you can beat me with what you have left, I'd like to see you try!
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;kizuna&stage;1&saying;off:,marker:KizunaDidntKnow=interested.png,You... didn't know your shirt comes off?...

4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;misato:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:227=enthused.png,Ah haha ha! You really think <i>I'd</i> be put off by scars? Have you <i>seen</i> my face?
4-female_removed_major,priority:381,count-role;target&character;emi&stage;8:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:206=happy.png,Alright, if you're willing to forgo legs, I won't raise any objections to this.
4-female_removed_major,priority:381,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;5:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:246=happy.png,Nothing personal, of course. You seem like a fine - albeit idiotic - young lass. Just don't make me kill you, okay?
4-female_removed_major,priority:381,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1-2:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:213=calm.png,You're lucky no one got hurt. Otherwise, you'd be under arrest.
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;misato:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=embarrassed.png,I'm not looking away because of the scar, I'm looking away because you're nearly n-naked...
4-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;misato:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=embarrassed.png,I'm not off-put by the scar. My dad had a ton. I'm more off-putt by your state of dress...
4-female_removed_major,priority:381,count-role;target&character;mae&stage;3&saidmarker;bea_bras:=flustered.png,They make... comfortable ones...?
4-female_removed_major,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:146=happy.png,Now just do that again a few more times.


#lost undershirt
5-male_removing_major=happy.png,Hey, looks like we're about to be even.
5-male_removing_major=competitive.png,You didn't expect to go the whole game with your ~clothing~ on, did you?
5-male_removing_major=happy.png,Time for you to do some catching up.
5-male_removing_major=happy.png,Well, you'll have to do it eventually, so why not now?
5-male_removing_major,count-role;target&startinglayers;3-4:=happy.png,I'm kinda glad you didn't start off with a whole lot.
5-male_removing_major,count-role;target&startinglayers;3-4:=happy.png,It's a good thing you're not wearing a whole lot. Good for me, anyway...
5-male_removing_major,count-role;target&character;kamina&stage;3:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=interested.png,Well, it's mostly luck, so...
5-male_removing_major,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:139=enthused.png,Now <i>that's</i> what I want to see.
5-male_removed_major=happy.png,Welcome to my level. Er, not, like, experience points, I meant - never mind...
5-male_removed_major=happy.png,It's nice that you're keeping pace.
5-male_removed_major=happy.png,This game is more fun when you're not the only one in your underwear.
5-male_removed_major=happy.png,I think I'm starting to have fun again.
5-male_removed_major,count-role;target&character;jotaro&stage;6:=flustered.png,I-I'm sorry you had to take off your... expensive pants? I'm sure they'll be safe...
5-male_removed_major,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;7:=interested.png,Well, uh... It's not against the rules to cover yourself, so I can't really get mad about it.
5-male_removed_major,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;7:=thinking.png,Maybe I should do the same with my axe?...
5-male_removed_major,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;7:=flustered.png,I'd do the same with my axe, if I weren't concerned with accidentally cutting myself...
5-male_removed_major,count-role;target&startinglayers;3-4:=competitive.png,You can't complain if you end up losing before me! You dug your own grave on this one.
5-male_removed_major,count-role;target&startinglayers;3-4:=competitive.png,If you really think you can beat me with what you have left, I'd like to see you try!
5-male_removed_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_m&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,Y-you're wearing... panties?... O-okay, I guess...
5-male_removed_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_m&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,W-why are y-you, uh... N-never mind. I don't think I want to know.
5-male_removed_major,count-role;target&character;kamina&stage;4:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=sad.png,...
5-male_removed_major,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:141=happy.png,Now just do that again a few more times.
5-female_removing_major=happy.png,Hey, looks like we're about to be even.

5-female_removing_major=happy.png,Time for you to do some catching up.
5-female_removing_major=happy.png,Well, you'll have to do it eventually, so why not now?
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;syrenne&stage;0:=shocked.png,~silent~
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;4:,id:41=sad.png, I've even asked Asvaldr about it - if anyone would know, it'd be him. There's no cure because the gods forsake such mages for their hubris.
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;alice_degracia&stage;3:=calm.png,Ah! Etsuko has a whole line of clothes like that! I never could get the magic to work myself, though...
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;2&notsaidmarker;NonMagicStrip1:=interested.png,Anyhow, I suppose this'll be interesting to watch.
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;chiaki&stage;4&saying;HP:=interested.png,Do you need a healing item? I think I have one on me.
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;sayla&stage;2&sayingmarker;sayla_tights_valuable:=happy.png,Don't worry, I won't steal them. They wouldn't even fit me, anyway!
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;tharja&stage;1:,id:24=flustered.png,I may not know any black magic, but I think I know where this spell is going...
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4-5:=interested.png,I wonder what the outcome will be this time?
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4-5:=interested.png,I hope the outcome will be good.
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4-5:=interested.png,How likely is a bad roll?
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4-5:=interested.png,What could possibly go wrong?
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4-5:=interested.png,I'm sure the odds are in your favor, huh?
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;buffy&stage;4:=interested.png,I, uh, don't see what you're getting at.
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;emi&stage;7:,id:35=flustered.png,I... I suppose it's not my place to say if this should be allowed or not...
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;mae&stage;2&sayingmarker;bea_bras:=happy.png,I'm glad I'm not the only one who feels that way... A-about bras, that is...
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&startinglayers;3-4:=happy.png,I'm kinda glad you didn't start off with a whole lot.
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&startinglayers;3-4:=happy.png,It's a good thing you're not wearing a whole lot. Good for me, anyway...
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;0:=shocked.png,Is this a spell of some kind? I hope you have it under control!
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;0:=shocked.png,Th-this has to be a spell, right? I hope you've practiced it well!
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;april&stage;3:=angry.png,Looks like it's time to get even!
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;april&stage;3:=angry.png,Rules are rules, ~name~! Take something off already!
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;april&stage;3:=angry.png,Well? We're waiting, ~name~!
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;sayla&stage;2&sayingmarker;sayla_tights_no_steal:=calm.png,Of course I won't steal them. Stealing isn't in my class description!
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;spooky:=horny.png,Oh dear! I... I wasn't expect you to... Uh...
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;erufuda&stage;2:,id:26=shocked.png,Oh dear! Your p-pants!
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;beatrix&stage;0:=shocked.png,Oh dear! You're taking it off already? A-are you sure you don't have anything else to take off?
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;sayla&stage;3:=interested.png,Oh dear. That's. uh... unfortunate?
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;mary&stage;3:,id:283=happy.png,Oh! How'd that happen? Don't worry, I can easily fix that for you. Buttons are super easy, even <i>without</i> magic!
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;marinette&stage;1:=enthused.png,Oh! Sewing magic, huh? Did you study Etsuko's books too?
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;marinette&stage;1:=happy.png,Oh! Sewing magic, huh? I'm a practitioner of it myself.
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;0:=shocked.png,Oh! W-well I guess undressing is the name of the game, but you don't have to start with big items!
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;wonder_woman&stage;0:=happy.png,Oh, I see, this is your battle attire! I always admire royals who aren't afraid to be on the front lines!
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;2:=flustered.png,Oh, uh, sure. I'll look away.
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;5:=interested.png,Oh, you're just removing your stockings? That's not so bad, I guess.
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;kizuna&stage;0&saying;torn:,marker:KizunaTorn=happy.png,Oh? I can probably fix it for you, if you'd like! I know Sewing Magic!
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;meia&stage;2:=flustered.png,S-so are, uh... tight long johns like that common where you come from, Meia?
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;1:=flustered.png,Uh, k-kind of...
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;croix&stage;2:=interested.png,Uh, yeah, what about them?
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;morrigan&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Uh... G-good to know?...
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;saki_zls&stage;5:=interested.png,Uh... Makeup?...
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;3:=interested.png,W-well, your kimono wasn't exactly hiding your underwear from the start.
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,W-what? W-why would there be a banana in your...? And what does that have to do with being excited...?
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;catria&stage;4&saying;underwear:=flustered.png,Yeah, that is kind of weird. I don't understand why people think that either...
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;raven:=calm.png,Your cloak, huh? Is it magical at all?
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;nayru&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=shocked.png,Y-your dress!
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;syrenne&stage;0:=shocked.png,Y-you're starting with your top?
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,Y-you're taking off your b-bra already? You have so many other options...
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;marinette&stage;1:,count-role;self&saidmarker;SewingMagic:=happy.png,Oh, you know Sewing Magic too, ~name~? What're the odds that the three of us all would?
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;marinette&stage;1:,count-role;self&saidmarker;SewingMagic:=happy.png,Oh, you know Sewing Magic too, ~name~? Gosh, Etsuko's books must be more popular than I thought!
5-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;meia&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;jura:=flustered.png,S-so are, uh... tight long johns like that the common thing where you come from, or is Jura's outfit more common?
5-female_removing_major,priority:381,count-role;target&character;emi&stage;7:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:205=competitive.png,Ha! I respect your tenacity!
5-female_removing_major,priority:381,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;4:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:245=annoyed.png,Not even science can cure it. The gods forsake such mages for their hubris, and so will I if it happens to you.
5-female_removing_major,priority:381,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;0:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:211=annoyed.png,You're using <i>bullets</i> to <i>undress</i>? Are you <i>insane</i>?
5-female_removing_major,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:144=enthused.png,Now <i>that's</i> what I want to see.
5-female_removed_major=happy.png,Welcome to my level. Er, not, like, experience points, I meant - never mind...
5-female_removed_major=happy.png,It's nice that you're keeping pace.
5-female_removed_major=happy.png,This game is more fun when you're not the only one in your underwear.
5-female_removed_major=happy.png,I think I'm starting to have fun again.
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;5:=flustered.png,... Sorry, I'm being a downer, aren't I?... Um, on the plus side, we've learned some things about magic because of Manatrocities.
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;revy:=facepalm.png,<i>Oh my gosh, this woman is more insufferable than Niccolo...</i>
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;revy:=facepalm.png,<i>Ugh, this woman makes Niccolo seem pleasant...</i>
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:=flustered.png,<i>Oh!</i> Well, I, uh... wanted you to lose clothes quickly, but you didn't have to... explode them.
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:=flustered.png,<i>Oh!</i> Well, I, uh... wanted you to lose clothes quickly, but not like <i>that</i>.
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;4:=shocked.png,<i>What? B-but how?</i> Th-that doesn't make any sense!
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;nayru&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=shocked.png,A-are you okay? Do you need healing?
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5c:=happy.png,Haha! You sure do look like a fairy right now!
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;marinette&stage;2:=angry.png,Hey, wait a moment, that's cheating! You have more items now!
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;marinette&stage;2:=angry.png,Hey, no fair! I'm running out of clothes, and you go and conjure <i>more</i>?! That's cheating!
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;spooky:=angry.png,H-hey! Did you just gain more clothes? That's cheating!
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;spooky:=angry.png,H-hey! You can't do that! You can't just gain more clothes!
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;april&stage;4:=angry.png,H-hey, wait a minute! You're jumpsuit shouldn't count as two items! That's not fair!
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;croix&stage;3:=flustered.png,I am a little bit.
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;syrenne&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,I g-guess this isn't far off from how other warriors dress, but still...
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;emi&stage;8:,id:36=interested.png,I guess if you're willing to... not have legs for the rest of the game, we can allow it.
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;beatrix&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,I guess not... B-but why would you come here with only three items?
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sayla&stage;4:=interested.png,I suppose that's fair.
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sayla&stage;4:=interested.png,I can't argue with that.
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sayla&stage;3&sayingmarker;sayla_tights_hope_not_ripped:=happy.png,If they do, I can fix them for you!
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;catria&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,I-it was? I d-didn't notice...
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;1:=flustered.png,It's, uh... a very nice b-bra, Pinkie.
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;chiaki&stage;6:=embarrassed.png,J-jugs?... I... think I get that...
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;raven:=happy.png,My sister has a cloak just like that, and you would <i>swear</i> it's enchanted because of how stealthy she is, but it's just a normal cloak.
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;6:=calm.png,My thought exactly. Bare feet aren't as bad as bare, er... something else.
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,N-no, you are, I just didn't expect it...
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;3&notsaidmarker;NonMagicStrip1:=shocked.png,Oh dear! Y-your shirt!
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;3&notsaidmarker;NonMagicStrip1:=shocked.png,Y-your shirt! Y-you didn't plan that, did you...?
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5a:=embarrassed.png,Oh dear. That's... quite the outfit.
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6a:=interested.png,Oh dear. Would anyone happen to have towels prepared?
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6b:=embarrassed.png,Oh dear... That's a... strange outfit...
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6b:=embarrassed.png,Oh my... That outfit is... strange... Among other things...
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;morrigan&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,Oh my. Your bats are <i>really</i> loyal...
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;morrigan&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,Th-that's fine. I'm fine with waiting...
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;jasmine&stage;2:=interested.png,Oh, uh... Sorry. I've never heard of you before. Should I have?
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5b:=happy.png,Oh. I like the hair for this outfit.
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;buffy&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,O-oh dear. I wasn't aware that one could... do that.
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,O-oh, I see you came prepared...
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;ini&stage;4:=flustered.png,That's nice. Uh, it's a nice set, too.
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;wonder_woman&stage;1:=sad.png,The king and queen of my land are both pretty cowardly. Er, please don't tell them I said that...
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;erufuda&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,Uh, i-if it makes you feel better, I've had plenty of troubles with clothes, myself.
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;kizuna&stage;1:=flustered.png,Uh, y-yeah, definitely c-cute...
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;rinkah&stage;4:=flustered.png,Uh... W-we can, uh... Y-your, um, <i>hair</i> is...
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale:=embarrassed.png,Um, no offense, but I think your bra needs washed...
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale:=embarrassed.png,I, um... We can see your, um... never mind...
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale:=embarrassed.png,Uh, y-your b-bra is, um... never mind...
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;mulan&stage;2:,id:11=interested.png,Wait a minute, that outfit... That's a woman's garb. Are you... not actually a man?
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;moon:=embarrassed.png,We can, uh... Y-your shirt is, uh...
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;saki_zls:=shocked.png,Woah!
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;4:=flustered.png,Wow. I... didn't know assassins had custom underwear...
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;tharja&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Yep, that's what I thought... G-good thinking, taking off your bodysuit from under your other stuff, s-so you can stay modest longer.
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&startinglayers;3-4:=competitive.png,You can't complain if you end up losing before me! You dug your own grave on this one.
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&startinglayers;3-4:=competitive.png,If you really think you can beat me with what you have left, I'd like to see you try!
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;kizuna&stage;1&saying;off:,marker:KizunaDidntKnow=interested.png,You... didn't know your shirt comes off?...
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;morrigan&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,Your bats sure are loyal, I guess...
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;shego:=embarrassed.png,Y-You prepared for this, didn't you? No one wears l-lingerie casually...
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;beatrix:,count-role;other&character;joey:=flustered.png,I guess I do too, but... I dunno. It doesn't seem smart to me...
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;misato:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:227=enthused.png,Ah haha ha! You really think <i>I'd</i> be put off by scars? Have you <i>seen</i> my face?
5-female_removed_major,priority:381,count-role;target&character;emi&stage;8:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:206=happy.png,Alright, if you're willing to forgo legs, I won't raise any objections to this.
5-female_removed_major,priority:381,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;5:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:246=happy.png,Nothing personal, of course. You seem like a fine - albeit idiotic - young lass. Just don't make me kill you, okay?
5-female_removed_major,priority:381,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1-2:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:213=calm.png,You're lucky no one got hurt. Otherwise, you'd be under arrest.
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;misato:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=embarrassed.png,I'm not looking away because of the scar, I'm looking away because you're nearly n-naked...
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;misato:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=embarrassed.png,I'm not off-put by the scar. My dad had a ton. I'm more off-putt by your state of dress...
5-female_removed_major,priority:381,count-role;target&character;mae&stage;3&saidmarker;bea_bras:=flustered.png,They make... comfortable ones...?
5-female_removed_major,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:146=happy.png,Now just do that again a few more times.

-3-male_removed_major=happy.png,This game is more fun when you're not the only one in your underwear.
-3-male_removed_major=happy.png,I think I'm starting to have fun again.
-3-male_removed_major,count-role;target&character;jotaro&stage;6:=flustered.png,I-I'm sorry you had to take off your... expensive pants? I'm sure they'll be safe...
-3-male_removed_major,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;7:=interested.png,Well, uh... It's not against the rules to cover yourself, so I can't really get mad about it.
-3-male_removed_major,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;7:=thinking.png,Maybe I should do the same with my axe?...
-3-male_removed_major,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;7:=flustered.png,I'd do the same with my axe, if I weren't concerned with accidentally cutting myself...
-3-male_removed_major,count-role;target&startinglayers;3-4:=competitive.png,You can't complain if you end up losing before me! You dug your own grave on this one.
-3-male_removed_major,count-role;target&startinglayers;3-4:=competitive.png,If you really think you can beat me with what you have left, I'd like to see you try!
-3-male_removed_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_m&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,Y-you're wearing... panties?... O-okay, I guess...
-3-male_removed_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_m&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,W-why are y-you, uh... N-never mind. I don't think I want to know.
-3-male_removed_major,count-role;target&character;kamina&stage;4:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=sad.png,...
-3-male_removed_major,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:141=happy.png,Now just do that again a few more times.
-3-female_removing_major=happy.png,Hey, looks like we're about to be even.
-3-female_removing_major=competitive.png,You didn't expect to go the whole game with your ~clothing~ on, did you?
-3-female_removing_major=happy.png,Time for you to do some catching up.
-3-female_removing_major=happy.png,Well, you'll have to do it eventually, so why not now?
-3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;syrenne&stage;0:=shocked.png,~silent~
-3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;4:,id:41=sad.png, I've even asked Asvaldr about it - if anyone would know, it'd be him. There's no cure because the gods forsake such mages for their hubris.
-3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;alice_degracia&stage;3:=calm.png,Ah! Etsuko has a whole line of clothes like that! I never could get the magic to work myself, though...
-3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;2&notsaidmarker;NonMagicStrip1:=interested.png,Anyhow, I suppose this'll be interesting to watch.
-3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;chiaki&stage;4&saying;HP:=interested.png,Do you need a healing item? I think I have one on me.
-3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;sayla&stage;2&sayingmarker;sayla_tights_valuable:=happy.png,Don't worry, I won't steal them. They wouldn't even fit me, anyway!
-3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;tharja&stage;1:,id:24=flustered.png,I may not know any black magic, but I think I know where this spell is going...
-3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4-5:=interested.png,I wonder what the outcome will be this time?
-3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4-5:=interested.png,I hope the outcome will be good.
-3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4-5:=interested.png,How likely is a bad roll?
-3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4-5:=interested.png,What could possibly go wrong?
-3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4-5:=interested.png,I'm sure the odds are in your favor, huh?
-3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;buffy&stage;4:=interested.png,I, uh, don't see what you're getting at.
-3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;emi&stage;7:,id:35=flustered.png,I... I suppose it's not my place to say if this should be allowed or not...
-3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;mae&stage;2&sayingmarker;bea_bras:=happy.png,I'm glad I'm not the only one who feels that way... A-about bras, that is...
-3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&startinglayers;3-4:=happy.png,I'm kinda glad you didn't start off with a whole lot.
-3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&startinglayers;3-4:=happy.png,It's a good thing you're not wearing a whole lot. Good for me, anyway...
-3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;0:=shocked.png,Is this a spell of some kind? I hope you have it under control!
-3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;0:=shocked.png,Th-this has to be a spell, right? I hope you've practiced it well!
-3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;april&stage;3:=angry.png,Let's see how <i>you</i> like having <i>your</i> bits on display!
-3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;april&stage;3:=angry.png,Let's see how <i>you</i> like having <i>your</i> b-breasts on display!
-3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;sayla&stage;2&sayingmarker;sayla_tights_no_steal:=calm.png,Of course I won't steal them. Stealing isn't in my class description!
-3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;spooky:=horny.png,Oh dear! I... I wasn't expect you to... Uh...
-3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;erufuda&stage;2:,id:26=shocked.png,Oh dear! Your p-pants!
-3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;beatrix&stage;0:=shocked.png,Oh dear! You're taking it off already? A-are you sure you don't have anything else to take off?
-3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;sayla&stage;3:=interested.png,Oh dear. That's. uh... unfortunate?
-3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;mary&stage;3:,id:283=happy.png,Oh! How'd that happen? Don't worry, I can easily fix that for you. Buttons are super easy, even <i>without</i> magic!
-3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;marinette&stage;1:=enthused.png,Oh! Sewing magic, huh? Did you study Etsuko's books too?
-3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;marinette&stage;1:=happy.png,Oh! Sewing magic, huh? I'm a practitioner of it myself.
-3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;0:=shocked.png,Oh! W-well I guess undressing is the name of the game, but you don't have to start with big items!
-3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;wonder_woman&stage;0:=happy.png,Oh, I see, this is your battle attire! I always admire royals who aren't afraid to be on the front lines!
-3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;2:=flustered.png,Oh, uh, sure. I'll look away.
-3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;5:=interested.png,Oh, you're just removing your stockings? That's not so bad, I guess.
-3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;kizuna&stage;0&saying;torn:,marker:KizunaTorn=happy.png,Oh? I can probably fix it for you, if you'd like! I know Sewing Magic!
-3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;meia&stage;2:=flustered.png,S-so are, uh... tight long johns like that common where you come from, Meia?
-3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;1:=flustered.png,Uh, k-kind of...
-3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;croix&stage;2:=interested.png,Uh, yeah, what about them?
-3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;morrigan&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Uh... G-good to know?...
-3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;saki_zls&stage;5:=interested.png,Uh... Makeup?...
-3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;3:=interested.png,W-well, your kimono wasn't exactly hiding your underwear from the start.
-3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,W-what? W-why would there be a banana in your...? And what does that have to do with being excited...?
-3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;catria&stage;4&saying;underwear:=flustered.png,Yeah, that is kind of weird. I don't understand why people think that either...
-3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;raven:=calm.png,Your cloak, huh? Is it magical at all?
-3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;nayru&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=shocked.png,Y-your dress!
-3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;syrenne&stage;0:=shocked.png,Y-you're starting with your top?
-3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,Y-you're taking off your b-bra already? You have so many other options...
-3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;revy:,count-role;self&saidmarker;DoneWithRevy:=interested.png,Do you come to things like this often?...
-3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;marinette&stage;1:,count-role;self&saidmarker;SewingMagic:=happy.png,Oh, you know Sewing Magic too, ~name~? What're the odds that the three of us all would?
-3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;marinette&stage;1:,count-role;self&saidmarker;SewingMagic:=happy.png,Oh, you know Sewing Magic too, ~name~? Gosh, Etsuko's books must be more popular than I thought!
-3-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;meia&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;jura:=flustered.png,S-so are, uh... tight long johns like that the common thing where you come from, or is Jura's outfit more common?
-3-female_removing_major,priority:381,count-role;target&character;emi&stage;7:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:205=competitive.png,Ha! I respect your tenacity!
-3-female_removing_major,priority:381,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;4:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:245=annoyed.png,Not even science can cure it. The gods forsake such mages for their hubris, and so will I if it happens to you.
-3-female_removing_major,priority:381,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;0:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:211=annoyed.png,You're using <i>bullets</i> to <i>undress</i>? Are you <i>insane</i>?
-3-female_removing_major,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:144=enthused.png,Now <i>that's</i> what I want to see.
-3-female_removed_major=happy.png,Welcome to my level. Er, not, like, experience points, I meant - never mind...
-3-female_removed_major=happy.png,It's nice that you're keeping pace.
-3-female_removed_major=happy.png,This game is more fun when you're not the only one in your underwear.
-3-female_removed_major=happy.png,I think I'm starting to have fun again.
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;5:=flustered.png,... Sorry, I'm being a downer, aren't I?... Um, on the plus side, we've learned some things about magic because of Manatrocities.
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;revy:=facepalm.png,<i>Oh my gosh, this woman is more insufferable than Niccolo...</i>
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;revy:=facepalm.png,<i>Ugh, this woman makes Niccolo seem pleasant...</i>
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:=flustered.png,<i>Oh!</i> Well, I, uh... wanted you to lose clothes quickly, but you didn't have to... explode them.
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:=flustered.png,<i>Oh!</i> Well, I, uh... wanted you to lose clothes quickly, but not like <i>that</i>.
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;4:=shocked.png,<i>What? B-but how?</i> Th-that doesn't make any sense!
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;nayru&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=shocked.png,A-are you okay? Do you need healing?
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5c:=happy.png,Haha! You sure do look like a fairy right now!
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;marinette&stage;2:=angry.png,Hey, wait a moment, that's cheating! You have more items now!
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;marinette&stage;2:=angry.png,Hey, no fair! I'm running out of clothes, and you go and conjure <i>more</i>?! That's cheating!
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;spooky:=angry.png,H-hey! Did you just gain more clothes? That's cheating!
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;spooky:=angry.png,H-hey! You can't do that! You can't just gain more clothes!
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;april&stage;4:=angry.png,H-hey, wait a minute! You're jumpsuit shouldn't count as two items! That's not fair!
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;croix&stage;3:=flustered.png,I am a little bit.
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;syrenne&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,I g-guess this isn't far off from how other warriors dress, but still...
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;emi&stage;8:,id:36=interested.png,I guess if you're willing to... not have legs for the rest of the game, we can allow it.
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;beatrix&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,I guess not... B-but why would you come here with only three items?
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sayla&stage;4:=interested.png,I suppose that's fair.
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sayla&stage;4:=interested.png,I can't argue with that.
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sayla&stage;3&sayingmarker;sayla_tights_hope_not_ripped:=happy.png,If they do, I can fix them for you!
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;catria&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,I-it was? I d-didn't notice...
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;1:=flustered.png,It's, uh... a very nice b-bra, Pinkie.
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;chiaki&stage;6:=embarrassed.png,J-jugs?... I... think I get that...
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;raven:=happy.png,My sister has a cloak just like that, and you would <i>swear</i> it's enchanted because of how stealthy she is, but it's just a normal cloak.
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;6:=calm.png,My thought exactly. Bare feet aren't as bad as bare, er... something else.
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,N-no, you are, I just didn't expect it...
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;3&notsaidmarker;NonMagicStrip1:=shocked.png,Oh dear! Y-your shirt!
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;3&notsaidmarker;NonMagicStrip1:=shocked.png,Y-your shirt! Y-you didn't plan that, did you...?
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5a:=embarrassed.png,Oh dear. That's... quite the outfit.
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6a:=interested.png,Oh dear. Would anyone happen to have towels prepared?
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6b:=embarrassed.png,Oh dear... That's a... strange outfit...
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6b:=embarrassed.png,Oh my... That outfit is... strange... Among other things...
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;morrigan&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,Oh my. Your bats are <i>really</i> loyal...
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;morrigan&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,Th-that's fine. I'm fine with waiting...
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;jasmine&stage;2:=interested.png,Oh, uh... Sorry. I've never heard of you before. Should I have?
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5b:=happy.png,Oh. I like the hair for this outfit.
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;buffy&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,O-oh dear. I wasn't aware that one could... do that.
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,O-oh, I see you came prepared...
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;ini&stage;4:=flustered.png,That's nice. Uh, it's a nice set, too.
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;wonder_woman&stage;1:=sad.png,The king and queen of my land are both pretty cowardly. Er, please don't tell them I said that...
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;erufuda&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,Uh, i-if it makes you feel better, I've had plenty of troubles with clothes, myself.
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;kizuna&stage;1:=flustered.png,Uh, y-yeah, definitely c-cute...
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;rinkah&stage;4:=flustered.png,Uh... W-we can, uh... Y-your, um, <i>hair</i> is...
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale:=embarrassed.png,Um, no offense, but I think your bra needs washed...
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale:=embarrassed.png,I, um... We can see your, um... never mind...
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale:=embarrassed.png,Uh, y-your b-bra is, um... never mind...
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;mulan&stage;2:,id:11=interested.png,Wait a minute, that outfit... That's a woman's garb. Are you... not actually a man?
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;moon:=embarrassed.png,We can, uh... Y-your shirt is, uh...
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;saki_zls:=shocked.png,Woah!
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;4:=flustered.png,Wow. I... didn't know assassins had custom underwear...
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;tharja&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Yep, that's what I thought... G-good thinking, taking off your bodysuit from under your other stuff, s-so you can stay modest longer.
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&startinglayers;3-4:=competitive.png,You can't complain if you end up losing before me! You dug your own grave on this one.
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&startinglayers;3-4:=competitive.png,If you really think you can beat me with what you have left, I'd like to see you try!
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;kizuna&stage;1&saying;off:,marker:KizunaDidntKnow=interested.png,You... didn't know your shirt comes off?...
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;morrigan&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,Your bats sure are loyal, I guess...
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;shego:=embarrassed.png,Y-You prepared for this, didn't you? No one wears l-lingerie casually...
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;revy:,count-role;self&saidmarker;DoneWithRevy:=flustered.png,D-do you think I'm pretty?... N-never mind. Sorry to put you on the spot like that, ~player~...
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;beatrix:,count-role;other&character;joey:=flustered.png,I guess I do too, but... I dunno. It doesn't seem smart to me...
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;misato:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:227=enthused.png,Ah haha ha! You really think <i>I'd</i> be put off by scars? Have you <i>seen</i> my face?
-3-female_removed_major,priority:381,count-role;target&character;emi&stage;8:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:206=happy.png,Alright, if you're willing to forgo legs, I won't raise any objections to this.
-3-female_removed_major,priority:381,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;5:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:246=happy.png,Nothing personal, of course. You seem like a fine - albeit idiotic - young lass. Just don't make me kill you, okay?
-3-female_removed_major,priority:381,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1-2:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:213=calm.png,You're lucky no one got hurt. Otherwise, you'd be under arrest.
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;misato:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=embarrassed.png,I'm not looking away because of the scar, I'm looking away because you're nearly n-naked...
-3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;misato:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=embarrassed.png,I'm not off-put by the scar. My dad had a ton. I'm more off-putt by your state of dress...
-3-female_removed_major,priority:381,count-role;target&character;mae&stage;3&saidmarker;bea_bras:=flustered.png,They make... comfortable ones...?
-3-female_removed_major,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:146=happy.png,Now just do that again a few more times.

-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4-5:=interested.png,How likely is a bad roll?
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4-5:=interested.png,What could possibly go wrong?
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4-5:=interested.png,I'm sure the odds are in your favor, huh?
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;buffy&stage;4:=interested.png,I, uh, don't see what you're getting at.
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;emi&stage;7:,id:35=flustered.png,I... I suppose it's not my place to say if this should be allowed or not...
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;mae&stage;2&sayingmarker;bea_bras:=happy.png,I'm glad I'm not the only one who feels that way... A-about bras, that is...
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;0:=shocked.png,Is this a spell of some kind? I hope you have it under control!
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;0:=shocked.png,Th-this has to be a spell, right? I hope you've practiced it well!
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;april&stage;3:=angry.png,Let's see how <i>you</i> like having <i>your</i> bits on display!
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;april&stage;3:=angry.png,Let's see how <i>you</i> like having <i>your</i> b-breasts on display!
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;sayla&stage;2&sayingmarker;sayla_tights_no_steal:=calm.png,Of course I won't steal them. Stealing isn't in my class description!
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;spooky:=horny.png,Oh dear! I... I wasn't expect you to... Uh...
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;erufuda&stage;2:,id:26=shocked.png,Oh dear! Your p-pants!
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;beatrix&stage;0:=shocked.png,Oh dear! You're taking it off already? A-are you sure you don't have anything else to take off?
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;sayla&stage;3:=interested.png,Oh dear. That's. uh... unfortunate?
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;mary&stage;3:,id:283=happy.png,Oh! How'd that happen? Don't worry, I can easily fix that for you. Buttons are super easy, even <i>without</i> magic!
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;marinette&stage;1:=enthused.png,Oh! Sewing magic, huh? Did you study Etsuko's books too?
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;marinette&stage;1:=happy.png,Oh! Sewing magic, huh? I'm a practitioner of it myself.
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;0:=shocked.png,Oh! W-well I guess undressing is the name of the game, but you don't have to start with big items!
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;wonder_woman&stage;0:=happy.png,Oh, I see, this is your battle attire! I always admire royals who aren't afraid to be on the front lines!
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elizabeth&stage;2:=flustered.png,Oh, uh, sure. I'll look away.
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;5:=interested.png,Oh, you're just removing your stockings? That's not so bad, I guess.
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;kizuna&stage;0&saying;torn:,marker:KizunaTorn=happy.png,Oh? I can probably fix it for you, if you'd like! I know Sewing Magic!
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;meia&stage;2:=flustered.png,S-so are, uh... tight long johns like that common where you come from, Meia?
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;1:=flustered.png,Uh, k-kind of...
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;croix&stage;2:=interested.png,Uh, yeah, what about them?
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;morrigan&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Uh... G-good to know?...
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;saki_zls&stage;5:=interested.png,Uh... Makeup?...
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;3:=interested.png,W-well, your kimono wasn't exactly hiding your underwear from the start.
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,W-what? W-why would there be a banana in your...? And what does that have to do with being excited...?
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;catria&stage;4&saying;underwear:=flustered.png,Yeah, that is kind of weird. I don't understand why people think that either...
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;raven:=calm.png,Your cloak, huh? Is it magical at all?
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;nayru&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=shocked.png,Y-your dress!
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;syrenne&stage;0:=shocked.png,Y-you're starting with your top?
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,Y-you're taking off your b-bra already? You have so many other options...
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;revy:,count-role;self&saidmarker;DoneWithRevy:=interested.png,Do you come to things like this often?...
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;marinette&stage;1:,count-role;self&saidmarker;SewingMagic:=happy.png,Oh, you know Sewing Magic too, ~name~? What're the odds that the three of us all would?
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;marinette&stage;1:,count-role;self&saidmarker;SewingMagic:=happy.png,Oh, you know Sewing Magic too, ~name~? Gosh, Etsuko's books must be more popular than I thought!
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;meia&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;jura:=flustered.png,S-so are, uh... tight long johns like that the common thing where you come from, or is Jura's outfit more common?
-2-female_removing_major,priority:381,count-role;target&character;emi&stage;7:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:205=competitive.png,Ha! I respect your tenacity!
-2-female_removing_major,priority:381,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;4:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:245=annoyed.png,Not even science can cure it. The gods forsake such mages for their hubris, and so will I if it happens to you.
-2-female_removing_major,priority:381,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;0:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:211=annoyed.png,You're using <i>bullets</i> to <i>undress</i>? Are you <i>insane</i>?
-2-female_removing_major,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:144=enthused.png,Now <i>that's</i> what I want to see.
-2-female_removed_major=calm.png,This might sound mean, but... I... kind of hope you lose again...
-2-female_removed_major=interested.png,S-so, uh, y-you think you can still win?...
-2-female_removed_major=flustered.png,It's nice to see you losing more. N-not like <i>that</i>, I mean... uh...
-2-female_removed_major=happy.png,M-maybe you can tell me about your ~clothing~ later?...
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;5:=flustered.png,... Sorry, I'm being a downer, aren't I?... Um, on the plus side, we've learned some things about magic because of Manatrocities.
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;revy:=facepalm.png,<i>Oh my gosh, this woman is more insufferable than Niccolo...</i>
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;revy:=facepalm.png,<i>Ugh, this woman makes Niccolo seem pleasant...</i>
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,<i>Oh!</i> S-so that's what your spell does... Uh, neat, I guess. I hope you know some sewing magic, too...
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,<i>Oh!</i> S-so that was just a fancy sewing spell, huh? F-for cutting, clearly...
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;4:=shocked.png,<i>What? B-but how?</i> Th-that doesn't make any sense!
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;nayru&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=shocked.png,A-are you okay? Do you need healing?
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5c:=happy.png,Haha! You sure do look like a fairy right now!
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;spooky:=angry.png,H-hey! Did you just gain more clothes? That's cheating!
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;spooky:=angry.png,H-hey! You can't do that! You can't just gain more clothes!
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;april&stage;4:=angry.png,H-hey, wait a minute! You're jumpsuit shouldn't count as two items! That's not fair!
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;croix&stage;3:=flustered.png,I am a little bit.
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;syrenne&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,I g-guess this isn't far off from how other warriors dress, but still...
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;emi&stage;8:,id:36=interested.png,I guess if you're willing to... not have legs for the rest of the game, we can allow it.
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;beatrix&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,I guess not... B-but why would you come here with only three items?
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sayla&stage;4:=interested.png,I suppose that's fair.
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sayla&stage;4:=interested.png,I can't argue with that.
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sayla&stage;3&sayingmarker;sayla_tights_hope_not_ripped:=happy.png,If they do, I can fix them for you!
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;catria&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,I-it was? I d-didn't notice...
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;1:=flustered.png,It's, uh... a very nice b-bra, Pinkie.
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;chiaki&stage;6:=embarrassed.png,J-jugs?... I... think I get that...
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;raven:=happy.png,My sister has a cloak just like that, and you would <i>swear</i> it's enchanted because of how stealthy she is, but it's just a normal cloak.
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;6:=calm.png,My thought exactly. Bare feet aren't as bad as bare, er... something else.
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,N-no, you are, I just didn't expect it...
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;3&notsaidmarker;NonMagicStrip1:=shocked.png,Oh dear! Y-your shirt!
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;3&notsaidmarker;NonMagicStrip1:=shocked.png,Y-your shirt! Y-you didn't plan that, did you...?
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5a:=embarrassed.png,Oh dear. That's... quite the outfit.
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6a:=interested.png,Oh dear. Would anyone happen to have towels prepared?
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6b:=embarrassed.png,Oh dear... That's a... strange outfit...
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6b:=embarrassed.png,Oh my... That outfit is... strange... Among other things...
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;morrigan&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,Oh my. Your bats are <i>really</i> loyal...
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;morrigan&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,Th-that's fine. I'm fine with waiting...
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;jasmine&stage;2:=interested.png,Oh, uh... Sorry. I've never heard of you before. Should I have?
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5b:=happy.png,Oh. I like the hair for this outfit.
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;buffy&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,O-oh dear. I wasn't aware that one could... do that.
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,O-oh, I see you came prepared...
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;ini&stage;4:=flustered.png,That's nice. Uh, it's a nice set, too.
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;wonder_woman&stage;1:=sad.png,The king and queen of my land are both pretty cowardly. Er, please don't tell them I said that...
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;erufuda&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,Uh, i-if it makes you feel better, I've had plenty of troubles with clothes, myself.
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;kizuna&stage;1:=flustered.png,Uh, y-yeah, definitely c-cute...
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;rinkah&stage;4:=flustered.png,Uh... W-we can, uh... Y-your, um, <i>hair</i> is...
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale:=embarrassed.png,Um, no offense, but I think your bra needs washed...
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale:=embarrassed.png,I, um... We can see your, um... never mind...
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale:=embarrassed.png,Uh, y-your b-bra is, um... never mind...
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;mulan&stage;2:,id:11=interested.png,Wait a minute, that outfit... That's a woman's garb. Are you... not actually a man?
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;moon:=embarrassed.png,We can, uh... Y-your shirt is, uh...
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;saki_zls:=shocked.png,Woah!
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;4:=flustered.png,Wow. I... didn't know assassins had custom underwear...
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;tharja&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Yep, that's what I thought... G-good thinking, taking off your bodysuit from under your other stuff, s-so you can stay modest longer.
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;kizuna&stage;1&saying;off:,marker:KizunaDidntKnow=interested.png,You... didn't know your shirt comes off?...
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;morrigan&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,Your bats sure are loyal, I guess...
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;shego:=embarrassed.png,Y-You prepared for this, didn't you? No one wears l-lingerie casually...
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;revy:,count-role;self&saidmarker;DoneWithRevy:=flustered.png,D-do you think I'm pretty?... N-never mind. Sorry to put you on the spot like that, ~player~...
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;beatrix:,count-role;other&character;joey:=flustered.png,I guess I do too, but... I dunno. It doesn't seem smart to me...
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;misato:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:227=enthused.png,Ah haha ha! You really think <i>I'd</i> be put off by scars? Have you <i>seen</i> my face?
-2-female_removed_major,priority:381,count-role;target&character;emi&stage;8:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:206=happy.png,Alright, if you're willing to forgo legs, I won't raise any objections to this.
-2-female_removed_major,priority:381,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;5:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:246=happy.png,Nothing personal, of course. You seem like a fine - albeit idiotic - young lass. Just don't make me kill you, okay?
-2-female_removed_major,priority:381,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1-2:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:213=calm.png,You're lucky no one got hurt. Otherwise, you'd be under arrest.
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;misato:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=embarrassed.png,I'm not looking away because of the scar, I'm looking away because you're nearly n-naked...
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;misato:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=embarrassed.png,I'm not off-put by the scar. My dad had a ton. I'm more off-putt by your state of dress...
-2-female_removed_major,priority:381,count-role;target&character;mae&stage;3&saidmarker;bea_bras:=flustered.png,They make... comfortable ones...?
-2-female_removed_major,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:146=happy.png,Now just do that again a few more times.


#finished
-1-male_removing_major=calm.png,You sure have lasted a while, ~name~...
-1-male_removing_major=calm.png,You've kept your ~clothing~ for quite a while...
-1-male_removing_major=sad.png,Took you long enough...
-1-male_removing_major,count-role;target&character;kamina&stage;3:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=interested.png,Well, it's mostly luck, so...
-1-male_removing_major,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:139=enthused.png,Now <i>that's</i> what I want to see.
-1-male_removed_major=calm.png,Well, uh... good job, I guess...
-1-male_removed_major=calm.png,You're... doing great, I guess...
-1-male_removed_major=calm.png,Good for you, I suppose...
-1-male_removed_major,count-role;target&character;jotaro&stage;6:=flustered.png,I-I'm sorry you had to take off your... expensive pants? I'm sure they'll be safe...
-1-male_removed_major,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;7:=interested.png,Well, uh... It's not against the rules to cover yourself, so I can't really get mad about it.
-1-male_removed_major,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;7:=thinking.png,Maybe I should do the same with my axe?...
-1-male_removed_major,count-role;target&character;captain_america&stage;7:=flustered.png,I'd do the same with my axe, if I weren't concerned with accidentally cutting myself...
-1-male_removed_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_m&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,Y-you're wearing... panties?... O-okay, I guess...
-1-male_removed_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_m&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,W-why are y-you, uh... N-never mind. I don't think I want to know.
-1-male_removed_major,count-role;target&character;kamina&stage;4:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=sad.png,...

-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;4:,id:41=sad.png, I've even asked Asvaldr about it - if anyone would know, it'd be him. There's no cure because the gods forsake such mages for their hubris.
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;alice_degracia&stage;3:=calm.png,Ah! Etsuko has a whole line of clothes like that! I never could get the magic to work myself, though...
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;2&notsaidmarker;NonMagicStrip1:=interested.png,Anyhow, I suppose this'll be interesting to watch.
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;chiaki&stage;4&saying;HP:=interested.png,Do you need a healing item? I think I have one on me.
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;sayla&stage;2&sayingmarker;sayla_tights_valuable:=happy.png,Don't worry, I won't steal them. They wouldn't even fit me, anyway!
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;tharja&stage;1:,id:24=flustered.png,I may not know any black magic, but I think I know where this spell is going...
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4-5:=interested.png,I wonder what the outcome will be this time?
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4-5:=interested.png,I hope the outcome will be good.

-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;5:=interested.png,Oh, you're just removing your stockings? That's not so bad, I guess.
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;kizuna&stage;0&saying;torn:,marker:KizunaTorn=happy.png,Oh? I can probably fix it for you, if you'd like! I know Sewing Magic!

-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;3:=interested.png,W-well, your kimono wasn't exactly hiding your underwear from the start.
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,W-what? W-why would there be a banana in your...? And what does that have to do with being excited...?
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;catria&stage;4&saying;underwear:=flustered.png,Yeah, that is kind of weird. I don't understand why people think that either...
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;raven:=calm.png,Your cloak, huh? Is it magical at all?
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;nayru&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=shocked.png,Y-your dress!
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;syrenne&stage;0:=shocked.png,Y-you're starting with your top?
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,Y-you're taking off your b-bra already? You have so many other options...
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;revy:,count-role;self&saidmarker;DoneWithRevy:=interested.png,Do you come to things like this often?...

-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;marinette&stage;1:,count-role;self&saidmarker;SewingMagic:=happy.png,Oh, you know Sewing Magic too, ~name~? Gosh, Etsuko's books must be more popular than I thought!
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;meia&stage;2:,count-role;other&character;jura:=flustered.png,S-so are, uh... tight long johns like that the common thing where you come from, or is Jura's outfit more common?
-1-female_removing_major,priority:381,count-role;target&character;emi&stage;7:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:205=competitive.png,Ha! I respect your tenacity!
-1-female_removing_major,priority:381,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;4:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:245=annoyed.png,Not even science can cure it. The gods forsake such mages for their hubris, and so will I if it happens to you.
-1-female_removing_major,priority:381,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;0:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:211=annoyed.png,You're using <i>bullets</i> to <i>undress</i>? Are you <i>insane</i>?
-1-female_removing_major,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:144=enthused.png,Now <i>that's</i> what I want to see.
-1-female_removed_major=calm.png,Well, uh... good job, I guess...
-1-female_removed_major=calm.png,You're... doing great, I guess...
-1-female_removed_major=calm.png,Good for you, I suppose...
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;5:=flustered.png,... Sorry, I'm being a downer, aren't I?... Um, on the plus side, we've learned some things about magic because of Manatrocities.
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;revy:=facepalm.png,<i>Oh my gosh, this woman is more insufferable than Niccolo...</i>
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;revy:=facepalm.png,<i>Ugh, this woman makes Niccolo seem pleasant...</i>
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,<i>Oh!</i> S-so that's what your spell does... Uh, neat, I guess. I hope you know some sewing magic, too...
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,<i>Oh!</i> S-so that was just a fancy sewing spell, huh? F-for cutting, clearly...
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;4:=shocked.png,<i>What? B-but how?</i> Th-that doesn't make any sense!
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;nayru&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=shocked.png,A-are you okay? Do you need healing?
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5c:=happy.png,Haha! You sure do look like a fairy right now!
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;spooky:=angry.png,H-hey! Did you just gain more clothes? That's cheating!
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;spooky:=angry.png,H-hey! You can't do that! You can't just gain more clothes!
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;april&stage;4:=angry.png,H-hey, wait a minute! You're jumpsuit shouldn't count as two items! That's not fair!
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;croix&stage;3:=flustered.png,I am a little bit.
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;syrenne&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,I g-guess this isn't far off from how other warriors dress, but still...
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;emi&stage;8:,id:36=interested.png,I guess if you're willing to... not have legs for the rest of the game, we can allow it.
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;beatrix&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,I guess not... B-but why would you come here with only three items?
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sayla&stage;4:=interested.png,I suppose that's fair.
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sayla&stage;4:=interested.png,I can't argue with that.
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sayla&stage;3&sayingmarker;sayla_tights_hope_not_ripped:=happy.png,If they do, I can fix them for you!
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;catria&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,I-it was? I d-didn't notice...
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;1:=flustered.png,It's, uh... a very nice b-bra, Pinkie.
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;chiaki&stage;6:=embarrassed.png,J-jugs?... I... think I get that...
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;raven:=happy.png,My sister has a cloak just like that, and you would <i>swear</i> it's enchanted because of how stealthy she is, but it's just a normal cloak.
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;6:=calm.png,My thought exactly. Bare feet aren't as bad as bare, er... something else.
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,N-no, you are, I just didn't expect it...
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;3&notsaidmarker;NonMagicStrip1:=shocked.png,Oh dear! Y-your shirt!
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;3&notsaidmarker;NonMagicStrip1:=shocked.png,Y-your shirt! Y-you didn't plan that, did you...?
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5a:=embarrassed.png,Oh dear. That's... quite the outfit.
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6a:=interested.png,Oh dear. Would anyone happen to have towels prepared?
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6b:=embarrassed.png,Oh dear... That's a... strange outfit...
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6b:=embarrassed.png,Oh my... That outfit is... strange... Among other things...
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;morrigan&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,Oh my. Your bats are <i>really</i> loyal...
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;morrigan&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,Th-that's fine. I'm fine with waiting...
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;jasmine&stage;2:=interested.png,Oh, uh... Sorry. I've never heard of you before. Should I have?
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5b:=happy.png,Oh. I like the hair for this outfit.
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;buffy&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,O-oh dear. I wasn't aware that one could... do that.
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,O-oh, I see you came prepared...
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;ini&stage;4:=flustered.png,That's nice. Uh, it's a nice set, too.
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;wonder_woman&stage;1:=sad.png,The king and queen of my land are both pretty cowardly. Er, please don't tell them I said that...
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;erufuda&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,Uh, i-if it makes you feel better, I've had plenty of troubles with clothes, myself.
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;kizuna&stage;1:=flustered.png,Uh, y-yeah, definitely c-cute...
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;rinkah&stage;4:=flustered.png,Uh... W-we can, uh... Y-your, um, <i>hair</i> is...
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale:=embarrassed.png,Um, no offense, but I think your bra needs washed...
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale:=embarrassed.png,I, um... We can see your, um... never mind...
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale:=embarrassed.png,Uh, y-your b-bra is, um... never mind...
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;mulan&stage;2:,id:11=interested.png,Wait a minute, that outfit... That's a woman's garb. Are you... not actually a man?
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;moon:=embarrassed.png,We can, uh... Y-your shirt is, uh...
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;saki_zls:=shocked.png,Woah!
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sheena&stage;4:=flustered.png,Wow. I... didn't know assassins had custom underwear...
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;tharja&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Yep, that's what I thought... G-good thinking, taking off your bodysuit from under your other stuff, s-so you can stay modest longer.
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;kizuna&stage;1&saying;off:,marker:KizunaDidntKnow=interested.png,You... didn't know your shirt comes off?...
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;morrigan&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,Your bats sure are loyal, I guess...
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;shego:=embarrassed.png,Y-You prepared for this, didn't you? No one wears l-lingerie casually...
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;revy:,count-role;self&saidmarker;DoneWithRevy:=flustered.png,D-do you think I'm pretty?... N-never mind. Sorry to put you on the spot like that, ~player~...
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;beatrix:,count-role;other&character;joey:=flustered.png,I guess I do too, but... I dunno. It doesn't seem smart to me...
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;misato:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:227=enthused.png,Ah haha ha! You really think <i>I'd</i> be put off by scars? Have you <i>seen</i> my face?
-1-female_removed_major,priority:381,count-role;target&character;emi&stage;8:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:206=happy.png,Alright, if you're willing to forgo legs, I won't raise any objections to this.
-1-female_removed_major,priority:381,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;5:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:246=happy.png,Nothing personal, of course. You seem like a fine - albeit idiotic - young lass. Just don't make me kill you, okay?
-1-female_removed_major,priority:381,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;1-2:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:213=calm.png,You're lucky no one got hurt. Otherwise, you'd be under arrest.
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;misato:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=embarrassed.png,I'm not looking away because of the scar, I'm looking away because you're nearly n-naked...
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;misato:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=embarrassed.png,I'm not off-put by the scar. My dad had a ton. I'm more off-putt by your state of dress...
-1-female_removed_major,priority:381,count-role;target&character;mae&stage;3&saidmarker;bea_bras:=flustered.png,They make... comfortable ones...?
-1-female_removed_major,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:146=happy.png,Now just do that again a few more times.

male_chest_will_be_visible=interested.png,You're not shy about your chest, are you? I mean, you've got nothing to hide, right?
male_chest_will_be_visible=embarrassed.png,I'm more excited about this than I probably should be...

male_chest_is_visible=happy.png,Wow, your pectoral muscles sure are well-defined!
male_chest_is_visible=happy.png,A lot of warriors in my world go shirtless, so this is a pretty common sight to me.
male_chest_is_visible=happy.png,You must go shirtless often, huh?
male_chest_is_visible=happy.png,I bet you go shirtless often!
male_chest_is_visible=happy.png,See! Nothing to be ashamed of!
male_crotch_will_be_visible=interested.png,You won't mind if I take a peek, right? For curiosity's sake?
male_crotch_will_be_visible=calm.png,Hope you don't mind me looking... f-for curiosity's sake.
male_crotch_will_be_visible=flustered.png,Well, showing off is part of the game, right? S-so it'd be okay to look?
male_crotch_will_be_visible=flustered.png,I-it's okay if I look, right? I mean, th-that's what you came here for, right?
male_small_crotch_is_visible=shocked.png,Oh my! It's smaller than I thought it'd be!... Oh, sorry! I didn't mean it like that!
male_small_crotch_is_visible=shocked.png,<i>It's so small...</i> Oops! Did I say that out loud?
male_small_crotch_is_visible=shocked.png,Oh dear! I-is that it?
male_small_crotch_is_visible=flustered.png,I guess that illustration was life-sized...
male_small_crotch_is_visible=interested.png,Uh... Does it get b-bigger at all?...
male_small_crotch_is_visible=interested.png,Oh, uh... You wouldn't happen to know any spells to make it bigger, would you...?
male_small_crotch_is_visible=interested.png,Oh, uh... Maybe we can find a potion that'll make it bigger? M-my friend William probably has something. H-he has things for everything.
male_medium_crotch_is_visible=horny.png,Wow! It looks so different in person!
male_medium_crotch_is_visible=horny.png,Oh my! W-what a sight!

male_medium_crotch_is_visible=horny.png,W-wow. H-how nice...
male_large_crotch_is_visible=shocked.png,Oh my goodness! I didn't even know they could get that big!
male_large_crotch_is_visible=shocked.png,Goodness! That size must be some sort of record!
male_large_crotch_is_visible=shocked.png,W-what?! They can get that big?!
male_large_crotch_is_visible=shocked.png,I-it's enormous! I-is that normal?
male_large_crotch_is_visible=shocked.png,Oh my goodness! That's... huge!
male_large_crotch_is_visible=shocked.png,I-is that normal? I mean, is the size average? That can't be average!
female_chest_will_be_visible=flustered.png,I really shouldn't look... It's not like I can't just look at my own in the mirror...
female_chest_will_be_visible=flustered.png,I knew this would happen when I agreed to play, but... that doesn't make this any less awkward...
female_chest_will_be_visible=flustered.png,Well, I did read that it's good to let your, uh... chest... breathe every now and then...
female_chest_will_be_visible=flustered.png,I once read that it's good to let your, uh... chest... breathe, so I guess this is a good thing.
female_small_chest_is_visible=happy.png,Hey, there's no shame in a small bust. Some people are into that... statistically speaking.
female_small_chest_is_visible=happy.png,Size doesn't impact function, you know. They may not be big, but they work just the same.
female_small_chest_is_visible=flustered.png,Well, I'd say they'll get bigger, but if you're here, you're too old for them to grow any...
female_small_chest_is_visible=sad.png,I guess you don't have much trouble finding clothes that fit you, huh? That must be nice...
female_small_chest_is_visible=flustered.png,O-oh, well, there's nothing to be ashamed of. Y-you are as the gods made you.
female_medium_chest_is_visible=flustered.png,Heh heh, they look just like in the anatomy diagrams... Sorry, I shouldn't be laughing...
female_medium_chest_is_visible=embarrassed.png,Nothing to be embarrassed about. They're just breasts, every woman has them...
female_medium_chest_is_visible=embarrassed.png,I know some cultures consider this perfectly acceptable, but not where I grew up...
female_medium_chest_is_visible=flustered.png,Th-they look just like the anatomy diagrams...
female_medium_chest_is_visible=flustered.png,They're, uh... neat, I guess...?
female_large_chest_is_visible=interested.png,If you ever have back problems, let me know. I know a guy who might be able to help.
female_large_chest_is_visible=interested.png,I've heard rumors that some women enhanced the size of their busts, but I don't know how. Would you know anything about that, by chance?
female_large_chest_is_visible=flustered.png,Wow. They're, uh... quite big.
female_large_chest_is_visible=sad.png,If <i>I</i> have a hard time finding clothes that fit, I can't imagine how hard it must be for <i>you</i>.
female_large_chest_is_visible=happy.png,If there's anything I know about big chests, it's that there's always something good inside! Ha ha!... Get it?...
female_crotch_will_be_visible=flustered.png,I'll try not to stare...
female_crotch_will_be_visible=flustered.png,You shouldn't have to worry about <i>me</i> staring, at least...
female_crotch_will_be_visible=embarrassed.png,J-just get it over with, ~name~.
female_crotch_will_be_visible=flustered.png,I guess you have no choice, huh?
female_crotch_will_be_visible=flustered.png,Oh no. This is your last item, huh...?
female_crotch_is_visible=flustered.png,That's... It's, uh, cute?... I don't know what to say...
female_crotch_is_visible=flustered.png,It looks, uh... like a flower, I guess? <i>I don't know...</i>
female_crotch_is_visible=flustered.png,I, uh... I don't know what to say...
female_crotch_is_visible=flustered.png,Um... C-can we move on now, please?
female_crotch_is_visible=flustered.png,L-let's not linger on this moment.
female_crotch_is_visible=flustered.png,I'm, uh... I'm sorry you're naked...

3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-not_chest_visible&role;target:=interested.png,W-wait, your chest is still covered. A-are you sure you want to go for your ~clothing~ first?
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-not_chest_visible&role;target:=flustered.png,Your ~clothing~? B-but you're not topless. W-wouldn't that look silly?
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-prince&role;target:=horny.png,A-am I even worthy of seeing a prince's... privates?...
3-male_small_crotch_is_visible,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:131=calm.png,Nothing standard issue about <i>that</i>. Might want to look in to Augments.

3-male_small_crotch_is_visible,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:131=calm.png,I prefer my  44 millimeter to be <i>bullets</i>, thank you very much.

3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:154=interested.png,Great, now make it wiggle or whatever. What do men do to be sexy anyway?

3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;kamina:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=flustered.png,O-oh, so "drill" was a euphemism...
3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:133=annoyed.png,I've never been one for Augments, if you catch my drift.
3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:133=calm.png,There's not much of a point to a bullet you can't fit in your chamber, if you know what I mean.
3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,count-role;target&character;kamina:,id:164=annoyed.png,You call that "big?" That's medium, <i>tops</i>.

3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;sayla&sayingmarker;sayla_chest_been_waiting:=flustered.png,I mean, you're kind of right... but not exactly...

3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;sheena&saidmarker;undine:=interested.png,Oh, that's, uh, interesting. I didn't know there were fish that can swim through air.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;sheena:=interested.png,Oh, uh, good thinking, I guess.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;croix:=interested.png,Okay. What'd you have in mind? Cookies? Or maybe some cupca--

3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;sayla:=flustered.png,Uh, thank you for your permission, I guess?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;sayla&sayingmarker;sayla_chest_be_grateful:=flustered.png,Uh, yeah, I-I'll be sure to be grateful...
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;sheena&saidmarker;celsius:=flustered.png,Um, w-we can still see through the ice...

3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;1:=flustered.png,Well, I can't say I blame you. I don't like wearing a bra either.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;catria:=flustered.png,Well, uh, th-there's nothing wrong with small b-breasts. You shouldn't worry about that.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=embarrassed.png,W-wait, what are you going to do?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,priority:441,count-role;target&character;chun-li&saidmarker;juri_attack:,count-role;other&character;juri:,id:18=shocked.png,J-Juri's behind you!

3-female_chest_will_be_visible,priority:301,count-role;target&character;aimee:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:219=calm.png,You sure do seem confident in this shot.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:159=calm.png,I of all people know that it's good to let them loose every now and then.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-princess&role;target:=flustered.png,I'm sorry princess, but rules are rules. You have to strip <i>something</i>, even if that something is your ~clothing~.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-princess&role;target:=flustered.png,I'm sorry princess, but rules are rules. We can't make an exception for you just because you're royalty.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;videl:=embarrassed.png,I guess using your hair like that is fair.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;videl:=embarrassed.png,Good use of your hair, I guess...
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;saki_zls:=happy.png,Oh, good, you reassembled!... Sh-should we be worried about you coming apart again, or...?
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska:=embarrassed.png,O-oh dear... That's not better...
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;futaba:=embarrassed.png,O-okay. I guess that's fair...
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;marinette&stage;7:=interested.png,Well, I guess I'll take your word for it.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;catria&saying;Tiny tits:=interested.png,W-why would we laugh? There's nothing funny about your chest.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:156=calm.png,Hmm, small. Compact. You might make a good scout.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,count-pierced_nipples&role;target:=shocked.png,<i>What's are those things on your nipples?</i> Do they hurt?
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,count-pierced_nipples&role;target:=shocked.png,Oh! There's bits of metal on your nipples! Are you okay? Do they hurt at all?
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;ini:=facepalm.png,<i>Dang it, Aella, you have to stop being so trusting...</i>
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;ini:=facepalm.png,<i>I've got to stop putting so much trust in people I've just met...</i>

3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=embarrassed.png,I'm, uh... sorry about your top...
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;aimee:=embarrassed.png,Oh! I... I wasn't expecting that.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;aimee:=embarrassed.png,Oh! I... was not prepared for that.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;croix:=embarrassed.png,Oh! Uh, that's nice too, I guess.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;croix:=embarrassed.png,Oh! Well now I feel silly for thinking it'd be something else...
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;panty&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Oh!... Well no. I mean, I wear... <i>those</i> too, but I'm not named after them. That'd be like if I were named "dress" or "boots."
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;joey&notsaidmarker;NonMagicStrip3:=embarrassed.png,Oh... Your tie... That's... the least surprising surprise to happen this whole game...
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;joey&notsaidmarker;NonMagicStrip3:=embarrassed.png,Oh... Your tie... That's... an acceptable surprise...

3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;joey&saidmarker;JoeyButt:=embarrassed.png,Uh... J-Joey, y-your, um... y-your tie...
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,Um, you might wanna button your shirt back up...
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;florina&saidmarker;bee3:=embarrassed.png,W-well, at least you got it now...
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;florina&saidmarker;bee3:=embarrassed.png,At least the bee can't bother you anymore...
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;florina&saidmarker;bee3:=embarrassed.png,Hopefully someone won't summon another bee to pester you with...
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;6:=embarrassed.png,Y-yeah, let's move on.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;6:=embarrassed.png,Agreed. A-about moving on, I mean, not about the flower being of no consequence...
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;6:=embarrassed.png,Agreed. A-about moving on, I mean.

-3-male_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;link:=flustered.png,What a... bizarre surprise.
-3-male_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;9s:=shocked.png,W-wait a moment! Where are your nipples?!
-3-male_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;9s:=shocked.png,W-wait a moment! Y-you don't have nipples!
-3-male_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;corrin_m&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,W-wait a moment. Those are stockings. I... didn't think men wore them.
-3-male_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;corrin_m&stage;4:=embarrassed.png,Wait a moment. You're wearing stocking. Aren't those just for women?...
-3-male_chest_is_visible,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:142=happy.png,Men aren't allowed to exercise shirtless on ISR friggates. They say it's too distracting... and I agree.

-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible=happy.png,Looks like <i>you</i> like having <i>your</i> bits on display now.
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible=happy.png,Exposure <i>is</i> the name of the game. I did it, and now it's your turn.
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible=happy.png,Looks like it's your turn to expose your... bits.
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible=happy.png,W-well you got to see <i>my</i> bits, so it's about time I get to see <i>yours</i>.

-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;kamina&sayingmarker;5l:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=calm.png,Well, good. You wouldn't be much of a fighter if you <i>did</i> panic or back down.

-3-male_small_crotch_is_visible,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:130=annoyed.png,That's all you've got? I've seen micro handguns bigger than that.
-3-male_small_crotch_is_visible,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:130=annoyed.png,I know some species consider that big, but humans are not one of them.
-3-male_small_crotch_is_visible,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:130=calm.png,Yeah, you're gonna need something of a higher caliber than that.
-3-male_small_crotch_is_visible,count-prince&role;target:=flustered.png,Oh, uh... d-don't worry, your highness, I won't tell anyone about your... secret.

-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=calm.png,Th-that's great, but even so, please stay back. I'm not ready for a close-up view...
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:153=horny.png,Wow. Holograms don't do those justice...
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-prince&role;target:=horny.png,I... um... I don't mind losing so much right now...
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-prince&role;target:=horny.png,Losing... doesn't seem so bad right now...

-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;kamina:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=flustered.png,O-oh, so "drill" was a euphemism...
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:132=annoyed.png,Yeah, sorry to tell you this, but that's too big. Even for me.
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:132=annoyed.png,Yeah, that doesn't do much for me. Not much point getting excited over something that clearly won't fit in me.
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,count-role;target&character;kamina:,id:164=annoyed.png,You call that "big?" That's medium, <i>tops</i>.
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,count-prince&role;target:=shocked.png,Oh my! That's... certainly befitting of royalty!
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible=calm.png,Take your time, ~name~. I know it's not easy.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible=happy.png,Well, uh... just remember that you're not the only one exposed here.

-3-female_chest_will_be_visible=happy.png,Come on, ~name~. I-it's not so bad once you get used to it.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,marker:BareFemaleChests=interested.png,S-so, d-do women go topless in this world, or is that not as accepted as men's bare chests like it is in my world?

-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska:=calm.png,It seems your luck is running out, but I hope this next roll will be better anyway.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;sheena&saidmarker;sylph:=flustered.png,It's a little late for that. We already noticed...
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;5:=embarrassed.png,Oh dear...
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;florina&saidmarker;bee2:=shocked.png,Oh no! It came back!

-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;sheena:=interested.png,Oh, uh, good thinking, I guess.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;croix:=interested.png,Okay. What'd you have in mind? Cookies? Or maybe some cupca--

-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=embarrassed.png,W-wait, what are you going to do?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;revy:,count-role;self&saidmarker;DoneWithRevy:=happy.png,I read this book the other day about a hero who ate dragons. It was very entertaining.

-3-female_small_chest_is_visible=interested.png,I, uh, hope you're not comparing yours with mine. Size isn't everything.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible=interested.png,I hope you don't feel bad about your size. Those are, uh... fine as they are.

-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;futaba:=embarrassed.png,O-okay. I guess that's fair...
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;videl:=sad.png,Too bad my hair won't cover my chest like yours does...
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;videl:=sad.png,Say, that's good thinking there, using your hair like that. Too bad mine won't stay in place.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;marinette&stage;7:=interested.png,Well, I guess I'll take your word for it.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;catria&saying;Tiny tits:=interested.png,W-why would we laugh? There's nothing funny about your chest.

-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,count-pierced_nipples&role;target:=shocked.png,Oh! There's bits of metal on your nipples! Are you okay? Do they hurt at all?
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible=interested.png,S-so do any female warriors go t-topless in your world? They don't in mine.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible=happy.png,Aha, I think we're the same size.

-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;croix:=embarrassed.png,Oh! Uh, that's nice too, I guess.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;croix:=embarrassed.png,Oh! Well now I feel silly for thinking it'd be something else...
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;panty&stage;1:=embarrassed.png,Oh!... Well no. I mean, I wear... <i>those</i> too, but I'm not named after them. That'd be like if I were named "dress" or "boots."
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;joey&notsaidmarker;NonMagicStrip3:=embarrassed.png,Oh... Your tie... That's... the least surprising surprise to happen this whole game...
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;joey&notsaidmarker;NonMagicStrip3:=embarrassed.png,Oh... Your tie... That's... an acceptable surprise...
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=embarrassed.png,O-oh. Sorry, I-I can't repair <i>burnt</i> clothing items...

-1-male_chest_is_visible,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:142=happy.png,Men aren't allowed to exercise shirtless on ISR friggates. They say it's too distracting... and I agree.

-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;kamina:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=flustered.png,O-oh, so "drill" was a euphemism...
-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:132=annoyed.png,Yeah, sorry to tell you this, but that's too big. Even for me.
-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:132=annoyed.png,Yeah, that doesn't do much for me. Not much point getting excited over something that clearly won't fit in me.

#OPPONENT MASTURBATING
#When an opponent is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must pay the penalty by masturbating in front of everyone.
#The "must_masturbate" line is for just before it happens, and the "start_masturbating" line immediately follows.
#The "masturbating" line will be spoken a little after the opponent has started but before they climax.
#When the opponent climaxes, your character will say the "finished_masturbating" line.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

1-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&losses;3-:=sad.png,If it's any consolation, it wasn't much fun to watch you lose like that.
1-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&losses;3-:=flustered.png,That was quite the spiral of bad luck you had there, ~name~...
1-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&saidmarker;pinka_start&notsaidmarker;pinka_end2:=flustered.png,I don't like the sound of that...
1-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;vriska:=interested.png,I guess this'll be your saving throw, then.
1-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;vriska:=interested.png,Let's just consider this a saving throw, then.
1-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;moon:=embarrassed.png,Oh dear. Y-you've started already...

1-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;nami:,id:29=flustered.png,Um, okay...
1-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;elizabeth:=shocked.png,W-wait, Elizabeth, what are you summoning? I-if it's a monster, don't do it! W-we can talk about this!
1-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;wonder_woman:=shocked.png,W-wait, princess, you still have your tiara! Y-you haven't lost yet!

1-female_must_masturbate,priority:0,count-masturbating:0,count-finished:0=flustered.png,Well, I have been curious about the act of self stimulation, so I guess this is an opportunity to observe how it's done...
1-female_must_masturbate,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:178=calm.png,Unfortunately for you, it appears you've lost.
1-female_must_masturbate,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:178=calm.png,You're out, ~name~. Nothing you can do about that now.

1-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kyu:=flustered.png,I-it's "Who'd've" you're looking for. Who, would, have; who'd've.
1-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;joey:=interested.png,Is that some sort of magic wand? Are you going to cast magic at something?
1-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;vriska:=embarrassed.png,Oh dear... I guess you rolled a 1, huh...?
1-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;vriska:=embarrassed.png,Rolled a 1, huh? I get those a lot too, but never have they been so... catastrophic...
1-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;vriska:=embarrassed.png,Rolled a nat 1, huh? Those are a real pain... I would know...
1-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;vriska:=embarrassed.png,Nat 1, huh? My friend Timbo rolled a 1 once and ended up turning me into a chicken.
1-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;croix:=shocked.png,Oh gosh! Y-you <i>are</i> in control of this, r-right?
1-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;alpha:=shocked.png,Oh my gosh! Y-you're alive again! How'd you do that?
1-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;alpha:=shocked.png,Oh my gosh! Y-you're not a ghost anymore! How'd you do that?
1-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch:=shocked.png,Oh! I wasn't expecting this to involve chains! Doesn't that hurt?
1-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;catria:=flustered.png,Okay. That's... perfectly reasonable.
1-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;elizabeth:=interested.png,O-oh, you just summoned a copy? I, um, I'm not sure why, though.
1-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;morrigan:=embarrassed.png,O-oh. Th-that's, uh...
1-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;wonder_woman:=flustered.png,O-okay, y-you don't have to take it off if you don't want to...

1-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;sayla:=flustered.png,Uh, I guess? Maybe?
1-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;sayla:=flustered.png,I wouldn't know...

1-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;hermione:=interested.png,Wait, there are spells for this?
1-female_start_masturbating,count-role;self&saidmarker;1v1:=calm.png,Well, uh, good game, everyone.
1-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika:=embarrassed.png,W-wait, the penalty for losing is... n-not wrestling. I-is this legal?
1-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika:=embarrassed.png,W-wait, the penalty for losing is... n-not wrestling. A-are we allowed to change our penalties? I'd very much like to change mine too!
1-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika:=embarrassed.png,W-wait, the penalty for losing is... n-not wrestling. A-are we allowed to change our penalties? I want mine to be wrestling too!
1-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;moon:=flustered.png,W-well, a-at least you're having fun, I guess...
1-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kurumu:=embarrassed.png,W-well, at least we know now that you were serious when you said you are a succubus...
1-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;nami:,id:30=embarrassed.png,W-whatever makes you comfortable, I guess.
1-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;palutena:=embarrassed.png,Yeah... I can't say I'm fond of this, either...
1-female_start_masturbating,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:173=happy.png,Now shape up, and ship out.
1-female_start_masturbating,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:173=happy.png,Now grab some real estate and get busy.
1-female_start_masturbating,count-uses_toy&role;target:=horny.png,Is that... some kind of wand?... What kind of magic are you going to cast?
1-female_masturbating=embarrassed.png,...
1-female_masturbating=flustered.png,...
1-female_masturbating=flustered.png,O-oh... I, uh... never would have thought to... use an object for this...
1-female_masturbating=flustered.png,That's, um... interesting to watch.
1-female_masturbating=flustered.png,I kinda wish I had a book to tell me how to do this, instead of learning through watching...
1-female_masturbating=interested.png,I'm not making you uncomfortable, am I, ~name~?
1-female_masturbating=interested.png,S-so, uh... is... this normally a... group activity?
1-female_masturbating=flustered.png,I'm, uh... sorry that I'm not any help, I guess.
1-female_masturbating=thinking.png,I wonder what you're thinking about right now...
1-female_masturbating=embarrassed.png,Watching that is making me rather... warm...
1-female_masturbating=interested.png,D-do clothed figures do anything for you, or is it just... exposed ones?

1-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kizuna&saidmarker;delay_11&notsaidmarker;delay_12:=interested.png,F-frames? I don't see any frames...
1-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kizuna&saidmarker;delay_4&notsaidmarker;delay_5:=flustered.png,I still don't understand what's going on, but okay...
1-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kizuna&saidmarker;delay_2&notsaidmarker;delay_3:=flustered.png,I... Er...
1-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kizuna&saidmarker;delay_12&notsaidmarker;delay_13:=flustered.png,I-if you say so...
1-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kizuna&saidmarker;delay_10&notsaidmarker;delay_11:=flustered.png,I-is it...?
1-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;jolyne&timeinstage;2:=interested.png,I-is Jolyne's technique common, or...?

1-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kizuna&saidmarker;delay_5&notsaidmarker;delay_6:=shocked.png,Oh! There's two of you, Kizuna!
1-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kizuna&saidmarker;delay_3&notsaidmarker;delay_4:=flustered.png,O-oh, okay...
1-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;jolyne&timeinstage;3:=flustered.png,Sorry, Jolyne, I-I'll stop asking questions now...
1-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kizuna&saidmarker;delay_6&notsaidmarker;delay_7:=interested.png,S-so a "download" is something automatic? You probably <i>should</i> just leave it alone, then.

1-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;elizabeth:=embarrassed.png,This is not the kind of thing I care to have learned about...
1-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kizuna&saidmarker;delay_8&notsaidmarker;delay_9:=flustered.png,Th-that's, um... I-I'm lost...
1-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kizuna&saidmarker;delay_1&notsaidmarker;delay_2:=interested.png,Uh, what are you looking at, Kizuna?
1-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;jolyne&timeinstage;1:=interested.png,You're not even, uh... s-stimulating yourself, Jolyne... o-or are you?
1-female_masturbating,priority:327,count-role;target&character;akko&timeinstage;7&sayingmarker;akko_second_climax:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:248=happy.png,It's up to you.
1-female_masturbating,priority:0,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;1v1:=flustered.png,I'll have to remember what you're doing, in case I lose too...
1-female_masturbating,priority:325,count-role;target&character;akko&timeinstage;4:=flustered.png,I sure hope whatever spell you're using is white magic...
1-female_masturbating,priority:326,count-role;target&character;akko&timeinstage;7&sayingmarker;akko_second_climax:=flustered.png,I-it's up to you, I guess...
1-female_masturbating,priority:326,count-role;target&character;akko&timeinstage;4:,id:249=annoyed.png,That spell had better be white magic...
1-female_masturbating,priority:326,count-role;target&character;akko&timeinstage;3&sayingmarker;akko_first_climax:=embarrassed.png,Y-you're done? Already...?

1-female_masturbating,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:189=happy.png,If my state of dress displeases you, well, then you should've played better!
1-female_masturbating,count-uses_toy&role;target:=flustered.png,That's, uh... not how we use wands in my world...
1-female_masturbating,count-uses_toy&role;target:=interested.png,D-do you have any wands that get used on... other parts of the body...? Like hand wands or something?
1-female_masturbating,count-uses_toy&role;target:=interested.png,S-so how far can you cast magic with that...?
1-female_masturbating,count-uses_toy&role;target:=embarrassed.png,I wonder if Etsuko has any wands like that...
1-female_masturbating,count-uses_toy&role;target:=embarrassed.png,I can't even imagine what kind of store you'd have to find to buy one of those...

2-male_must_masturbate,count-role;self&saidmarker;1v1:=interested.png,Looks like I'm the winner. Should I go, or...?
2-male_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;jotaro&sayingmarker;MastRule:=embarrassed.png,Um, y-yeah, y-you didn't read the rules...?
2-male_must_masturbate,count-role;other&character;meia&notsaidmarker;unaware_mast:,count-masturbating:0,count-finished:0=interested.png,Y-you didn't read all the rules, Meia? Why not?
2-male_must_masturbate,count-role;other&character;meia&notsaidmarker;unaware_mast:,count-masturbating:0,count-finished:0=interested.png,Wait, y-you didn't know? How?
2-male_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;kamina&sayingmarker;firsttomasturbate:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=calm.png,Well, uh... good. I'm... glad you're not mad.
2-male_must_masturbate,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:176=calm.png,Unfortunately for you, it appears you've lost.
2-male_must_masturbate,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:176=calm.png,You're out, ~name~. Nothing you can do about that now.
2-male_must_masturbate,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:176=calm.png,Seems you're black on clothing there, ~name~.
2-male_must_masturbate,totalRounds:0-10=flustered.png,Oh dear. You... certainly lost quickly...
2-male_must_masturbate,totalRounds:0-10=flustered.png,Gosh, the card certainly were cruel to you, ~name~...

2-male_start_masturbating,count-role;self&saidmarker;1v1:=calm.png,Well, uh, good game, everyone.
2-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kamina:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=shocked.png,O-oh! I-it got bigger! S-so you're one of <i>those</i> kinds of guys...
2-male_start_masturbating,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:172=happy.png,Now shape up, and ship out.
2-male_start_masturbating,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:172=happy.png,Now grab some real estate and get busy.
2-male_masturbating,count-role;target&character;jotaro:=embarrassed.png,...
2-male_masturbating,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:183=competitive.png,Don't stop until your job is done, soldier.

2-male_finished_masturbating=shocked.png,Oh gosh! That was a lot of semen!
2-male_finished_masturbating=shocked.png,Whoa! I didn't think it'd shoot out quite like that!
2-male_finished_masturbating=shocked.png,<i>Ah!</i>... Sorry, I wasn't ready for that.
2-male_finished_masturbating=shocked.png,My! Books could never do that justice! That was... cool!
2-male_finished_masturbating=shocked.png,That was quite the... eruption!

2-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;9s:=interested.png,Wait, h-how can you be, uh... done, if you didn't... you know...
2-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;9s:=interested.png,Wait, you're done? B-but how? There's no, uh... s-semen.
2-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kamina:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;KaminaIsCool:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=interested.png,G-great, now can you please just... sit there <i>quietly</i>?
2-male_finished_masturbating,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:180=interested.png,Not exactly an "honorable discharge," but okay.
2-male_finished_masturbating,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:180=calm.png,You're cleaning that up.
2-female_must_masturbate=happy.png,Sorry, ~name~, looks like you lost. You have to... well, you know.
2-female_must_masturbate=competitive.png,Haha! I knew I could outlast you! Now you have to... uh, well, you know what you have to do!
2-female_must_masturbate=competitive.png,That's one down! Sorry, ~name~!
2-female_must_masturbate=happy.png,That'll teach you to play card games against <i>me</i>!
2-female_must_masturbate=interested.png,Y-you didn't read all the rules, Meia? Why not?

2-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;nagisa:=embarrassed.png,A-a play? Well, whatever helps you get comfortable...
2-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&losses;3-:=sad.png,Gosh. I'm sorry to see you lose like that.
2-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&losses;3-:=sad.png,If it's any consolation, it wasn't much fun to watch you lose like that.
2-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&losses;3-:=flustered.png,That was quite the spiral of bad luck you had there, ~name~...
2-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&saidmarker;pinka_start&notsaidmarker;pinka_end2:=flustered.png,I don't like the sound of that...
2-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;vriska:=interested.png,I guess this'll be your saving throw, then.
2-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;vriska:=interested.png,Let's just consider this a saving throw, then.
2-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;moon:=embarrassed.png,Oh dear. Y-you've started already...
2-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;moon:=embarrassed.png,Oh dear. Y-you certainly are eager...
2-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;morrigan:=embarrassed.png,Oh, h-hello, Lilith. Nice to meet you, I guess?
2-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;catria:=flustered.png,Oh, uh, sure. No problem.
2-female_must_masturbate,count-role;self&saidmarker;1v1:=happy.png,Sorry, ~name~, looks like I'm the winner!

2-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;palutena:=flustered.png,Sorry, Palutena, but that's the rules...
2-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;palutena:=flustered.png,Sorry, Palutena, but I don't think we can make an exception... even for a goddess.
2-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;nami:,id:29=flustered.png,Um, okay...
2-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;elizabeth:=shocked.png,W-wait, Elizabeth, what are you summoning? I-if it's a monster, don't do it! W-we can talk about this!
2-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;wonder_woman:=shocked.png,W-wait, princess, you still have your tiara! Y-you haven't lost yet!
2-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;joey:=embarrassed.png,You sure aren't shy about this...
2-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;ini:,count-masturbating:0,count-finished:0=interested.png,Well, uh, let's just call this retribution for your lies.
2-female_must_masturbate,priority:0,count-masturbating:0,count-finished:0=flustered.png,Well, I have been curious about the act of self stimulation, so I guess this is an opportunity to observe how it's done...
2-female_must_masturbate,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:178=calm.png,Unfortunately for you, it appears you've lost.
2-female_must_masturbate,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:178=calm.png,You're out, ~name~. Nothing you can do about that now.

2-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie:=shocked.png,<i>A balloon?</i> But why would you pull that out <i>now</i>?
2-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;morrigan&saidmarker;lilith_sister:=shocked.png,<i>Wait, you're sisters? Th-that's... That's...</i>
2-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kyu:=flustered.png,I-it's "Who'd've" you're looking for. Who, would, have; who'd've.
2-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;joey:=interested.png,Is that some sort of magic wand? Are you going to cast magic at something?
2-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;vriska:=embarrassed.png,Oh dear... I guess you rolled a 1, huh...?
2-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;vriska:=embarrassed.png,Rolled a 1, huh? I get those a lot too, but never have they been so... catastrophic...
2-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;vriska:=embarrassed.png,Rolled a nat 1, huh? Those are a real pain... I would know...
2-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;vriska:=embarrassed.png,Nat 1, huh? My friend Timbo rolled a 1 once and ended up turning me into a chicken.
2-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;croix:=shocked.png,Oh gosh! Y-you <i>are</i> in control of this, r-right?
2-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;alpha:=shocked.png,Oh my gosh! Y-you're alive again! How'd you do that?
2-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;alpha:=shocked.png,Oh my gosh! Y-you're not a ghost anymore! How'd you do that?
2-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch:=shocked.png,Oh! I wasn't expecting this to involve chains! Doesn't that hurt?
2-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;catria:=flustered.png,Okay. That's... perfectly reasonable.
2-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;elizabeth:=interested.png,O-oh, you just summoned a copy? I, um, I'm not sure why, though.
2-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;morrigan:=embarrassed.png,O-oh. Th-that's, uh...
2-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;wonder_woman:=flustered.png,O-okay, y-you don't have to take it off if you don't want to...

2-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;hermione:=interested.png,Wait, there are spells for this?
2-female_start_masturbating,count-role;self&saidmarker;1v1:=calm.png,Well, uh, good game, everyone.
2-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika:=embarrassed.png,W-wait, the penalty for losing is... n-not wrestling. I-is this legal?
2-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika:=embarrassed.png,W-wait, the penalty for losing is... n-not wrestling. A-are we allowed to change our penalties? I'd very much like to change mine too!

2-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kurumu:=embarrassed.png,W-well, at least we know now that you were serious when you said you are a succubus...
2-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;nami:,id:30=embarrassed.png,W-whatever makes you comfortable, I guess.
2-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;palutena:=embarrassed.png,Yeah... I can't say I'm fond of this, either...

2-female_start_masturbating,count-uses_toy&role;target:=horny.png,Is that... some kind of wand?... What kind of magic are you going to cast?
2-female_masturbating=embarrassed.png,...
2-female_masturbating=flustered.png,...
2-female_masturbating=flustered.png,O-oh... I, uh... never would have thought to... use an object for this...
2-female_masturbating=flustered.png,That's, um... interesting to watch.
2-female_masturbating=flustered.png,I kinda wish I had a book to tell me how to do this, instead of learning through watching...
2-female_masturbating=interested.png,I'm not making you uncomfortable, am I, ~name~?
2-female_masturbating=interested.png,S-so, uh... is... this normally a... group activity?
2-female_masturbating=flustered.png,I'm, uh... sorry that I'm not any help, I guess.
2-female_masturbating=thinking.png,I wonder what you're thinking about right now...
2-female_masturbating=embarrassed.png,Watching that is making me rather... warm...
2-female_masturbating=interested.png,D-do clothed figures do anything for you, or is it just... exposed ones?

2-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kizuna&saidmarker;delay_11&notsaidmarker;delay_12:=interested.png,F-frames? I don't see any frames...
2-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kizuna&saidmarker;delay_4&notsaidmarker;delay_5:=flustered.png,I still don't understand what's going on, but okay...

2-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kizuna&saidmarker;delay_3&notsaidmarker;delay_4:=flustered.png,O-oh, okay...
2-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;jolyne&timeinstage;3:=flustered.png,Sorry, Jolyne, I-I'll stop asking questions now...
2-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kizuna&saidmarker;delay_6&notsaidmarker;delay_7:=interested.png,S-so a "download" is something automatic? You probably <i>should</i> just leave it alone, then.

2-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;elizabeth:=embarrassed.png,I can't believe what I'm seeing...
2-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;elizabeth:=embarrassed.png,This is not the kind of thing I care to have learned about...
2-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kizuna&saidmarker;delay_8&notsaidmarker;delay_9:=flustered.png,Th-that's, um... I-I'm lost...
2-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kizuna&saidmarker;delay_1&notsaidmarker;delay_2:=interested.png,Uh, what are you looking at, Kizuna?
2-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;jolyne&timeinstage;1:=interested.png,You're not even, uh... s-stimulating yourself, Jolyne... o-or are you?

2-female_masturbating,priority:0,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;1v1:=flustered.png,I'll have to remember what you're doing, in case I lose too...
2-female_masturbating,priority:325,count-role;target&character;akko&timeinstage;4:=flustered.png,I sure hope whatever spell you're using is white magic...
2-female_masturbating,priority:326,count-role;target&character;akko&timeinstage;7&sayingmarker;akko_second_climax:=flustered.png,I-it's up to you, I guess...

2-female_masturbating,count-uses_toy&role;target:=interested.png,S-so how far can you cast magic with that...?
2-female_masturbating,count-uses_toy&role;target:=embarrassed.png,I wonder if Etsuko has any wands like that...
2-female_masturbating,count-uses_toy&role;target:=embarrassed.png,I can't even imagine what kind of store you'd have to find to buy one of those...

2-female_finished_masturbating,priority:301,count-role;target&character;aimee:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:223=calm.png,I'm not calling the medic for that one. You need to learn your lesson.
2-female_finished_masturbating,priority:301,count-role;target&character;akko:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:250=calm.png,You're lucky this didn't end with you turning into a Manatrocity... but I still have to arrest you.
2-female_finished_masturbating,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:181=interested.png,Not exactly an "honorable discharge," but okay.
2-female_finished_masturbating,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:181=calm.png,You're cleaning that up.

3-male_finished_masturbating=shocked.png,<i>Ah!</i>... Sorry, I wasn't ready for that.
3-male_finished_masturbating=shocked.png,My! Books could never do that justice! That was... cool!

3-female_must_masturbate=happy.png,Sorry, ~name~, looks like you lost. You have to... well, you know.
3-female_must_masturbate=competitive.png,Haha! I knew I could outlast you! Now you have to... uh, well, you know what you have to do!
3-female_must_masturbate=competitive.png,That's one down! Sorry, ~name~!
3-female_must_masturbate=happy.png,That'll teach you to play card games against <i>me</i>!

3-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&saidmarker;pinka_start&notsaidmarker;pinka_end2:=flustered.png,I don't like the sound of that...
3-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;vriska:=interested.png,I guess this'll be your saving throw, then.
3-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;vriska:=interested.png,Let's just consider this a saving throw, then.
3-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;moon:=embarrassed.png,Oh dear. Y-you've started already...
3-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;moon:=embarrassed.png,Oh dear. Y-you certainly are eager...

3-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;palutena:=flustered.png,Sorry, Palutena, but I don't think we can make an exception... even for a goddess.
3-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;nami:,id:29=flustered.png,Um, okay...
3-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;elizabeth:=shocked.png,W-wait, Elizabeth, what are you summoning? I-if it's a monster, don't do it! W-we can talk about this!
3-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;wonder_woman:=shocked.png,W-wait, princess, you still have your tiara! Y-you haven't lost yet!
3-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;joey:=embarrassed.png,You sure aren't shy about this...
3-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;ini:,count-masturbating:0,count-finished:0=interested.png,Well, uh, let's just call this retribution for your lies.
3-female_must_masturbate,priority:0,count-masturbating:0,count-finished:0=flustered.png,Well, I have been curious about the act of self stimulation, so I guess this is an opportunity to observe how it's done...
3-female_must_masturbate,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:178=calm.png,Unfortunately for you, it appears you've lost.
3-female_must_masturbate,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:178=calm.png,You're out, ~name~. Nothing you can do about that now.

3-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;morrigan&saidmarker;lilith_sister:=shocked.png,<i>Wait, you're sisters? Th-that's... That's...</i>
3-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kyu:=flustered.png,I-it's "Who'd've" you're looking for. Who, would, have; who'd've.
3-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;joey:=interested.png,Is that some sort of magic wand? Are you going to cast magic at something?
3-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;vriska:=embarrassed.png,Oh dear... I guess you rolled a 1, huh...?
3-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;vriska:=embarrassed.png,Rolled a 1, huh? I get those a lot too, but never have they been so... catastrophic...
3-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;vriska:=embarrassed.png,Rolled a nat 1, huh? Those are a real pain... I would know...
3-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;vriska:=embarrassed.png,Nat 1, huh? My friend Timbo rolled a 1 once and ended up turning me into a chicken.
3-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;croix:=shocked.png,Oh gosh! Y-you <i>are</i> in control of this, r-right?
3-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;alpha:=shocked.png,Oh my gosh! Y-you're alive again! How'd you do that?
3-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;alpha:=shocked.png,Oh my gosh! Y-you're not a ghost anymore! How'd you do that?
3-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch:=shocked.png,Oh! I wasn't expecting this to involve chains! Doesn't that hurt?
3-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;catria:=flustered.png,Okay. That's... perfectly reasonable.
3-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;elizabeth:=interested.png,O-oh, you just summoned a copy? I, um, I'm not sure why, though.
3-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;morrigan:=embarrassed.png,O-oh. Th-that's, uh...
3-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;wonder_woman:=flustered.png,O-okay, y-you don't have to take it off if you don't want to...
3-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&saidmarker;pinka_start&notsaidmarker;pinka_end2:=flustered.png,T-toys? W-what do toys have to do with this...?
3-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;sayla:=flustered.png,Uh, I guess? Maybe?
3-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;sayla:=flustered.png,I wouldn't know...
3-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;jolyne:=flustered.png,Uh, w-with <i>what</i>?
3-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;amalia:=embarrassed.png,Uh... W-what are you doing?
3-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;hermione:=interested.png,Wait, there are spells for this?
3-female_start_masturbating,count-role;self&saidmarker;1v1:=calm.png,Well, uh, good game, everyone.
3-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika:=embarrassed.png,W-wait, the penalty for losing is... n-not wrestling. I-is this legal?
3-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika:=embarrassed.png,W-wait, the penalty for losing is... n-not wrestling. A-are we allowed to change our penalties? I'd very much like to change mine too!
3-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika:=embarrassed.png,W-wait, the penalty for losing is... n-not wrestling. A-are we allowed to change our penalties? I want mine to be wrestling too!
3-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;moon:=flustered.png,W-well, a-at least you're having fun, I guess...
3-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kurumu:=embarrassed.png,W-well, at least we know now that you were serious when you said you are a succubus...
3-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;nami:,id:30=embarrassed.png,W-whatever makes you comfortable, I guess.
3-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;palutena:=embarrassed.png,Yeah... I can't say I'm fond of this, either...
3-female_start_masturbating,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:173=happy.png,Now shape up, and ship out.
3-female_start_masturbating,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:173=happy.png,Now grab some real estate and get busy.
3-female_start_masturbating,count-uses_toy&role;target:=horny.png,Is that... some kind of wand?... What kind of magic are you going to cast?
3-female_masturbating=flustered.png,...
3-female_masturbating=embarrassed.png,...
3-female_masturbating=flustered.png,O-oh... I, uh... never would have thought to... use an object for this...
3-female_masturbating=flustered.png,That's, um... interesting to watch.
3-female_masturbating=flustered.png,I kinda wish I had a book to tell me how to do this, instead of learning through watching...
3-female_masturbating=interested.png,I'm not making you uncomfortable, am I, ~name~?
3-female_masturbating=interested.png,S-so, uh... is... this normally a... group activity?
3-female_masturbating=flustered.png,I'm, uh... sorry that I'm not any help, I guess.
3-female_masturbating=thinking.png,I wonder what you're thinking about right now...
3-female_masturbating=embarrassed.png,Watching that is making me rather... warm...
3-female_masturbating=interested.png,D-do clothed figures do anything for you, or is it just... exposed ones?
3-female_masturbating=interested.png,How long do you think you can keep that up for?
3-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kizuna&saidmarker;delay_9&notsaidmarker;delay_10:=shocked.png,Ah! Another one!

3-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kizuna&notsaidmarker;delay_1:=interested.png,Download? What does that mean?
3-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kizuna&saidmarker;delay_11&notsaidmarker;delay_12:=interested.png,F-frames? I don't see any frames...
3-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kizuna&saidmarker;delay_4&notsaidmarker;delay_5:=flustered.png,I still don't understand what's going on, but okay...
3-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kizuna&saidmarker;delay_2&notsaidmarker;delay_3:=flustered.png,I... Er...
3-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kizuna&saidmarker;delay_12&notsaidmarker;delay_13:=flustered.png,I-if you say so...

3-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kizuna&saidmarker;delay_7&notsaidmarker;delay_8:=shocked.png,Oh! The other you is back!
3-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kizuna&saidmarker;delay_5&notsaidmarker;delay_6:=shocked.png,Oh! There's two of you, Kizuna!
3-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kizuna&saidmarker;delay_3&notsaidmarker;delay_4:=flustered.png,O-oh, okay...
3-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;jolyne&timeinstage;3:=flustered.png,Sorry, Jolyne, I-I'll stop asking questions now...
3-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kizuna&saidmarker;delay_6&notsaidmarker;delay_7:=interested.png,S-so a "download" is something automatic? You probably <i>should</i> just leave it alone, then.
3-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika&timeinstage;0:=embarrassed.png,Th-that doesn't look like the kind of wrestling my father and I used to do...

3-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;elizabeth:=embarrassed.png,Wh-what are you even doing, Elizabeth? I don't understand.
3-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;elizabeth:=embarrassed.png,Th-this is... really graphic...
3-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;elizabeth:=embarrassed.png,I can't believe what I'm seeing...
3-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;elizabeth:=embarrassed.png,This is not the kind of thing I care to have learned about...
3-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kizuna&saidmarker;delay_8&notsaidmarker;delay_9:=flustered.png,Th-that's, um... I-I'm lost...
3-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kizuna&saidmarker;delay_1&notsaidmarker;delay_2:=interested.png,Uh, what are you looking at, Kizuna?
3-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;jolyne&timeinstage;1:=interested.png,You're not even, uh... s-stimulating yourself, Jolyne... o-or are you?

3-female_masturbating,priority:325,count-role;target&character;akko&timeinstage;4:=flustered.png,I sure hope whatever spell you're using is white magic...
3-female_masturbating,priority:326,count-role;target&character;akko&timeinstage;7&sayingmarker;akko_second_climax:=flustered.png,I-it's up to you, I guess...
3-female_masturbating,priority:326,count-role;target&character;akko&timeinstage;4:,id:249=annoyed.png,That spell had better be white magic...

3-female_masturbating,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:189=happy.png,If my state of dress displeases you, well, then you should've played better!
3-female_masturbating,count-uses_toy&role;target:=flustered.png,That's, uh... not how we use wands in my world...
3-female_masturbating,count-uses_toy&role;target:=interested.png,D-do you have any wands that get used on... other parts of the body...? Like hand wands or something?
3-female_masturbating,count-uses_toy&role;target:=interested.png,S-so how far can you cast magic with that...?
3-female_masturbating,count-uses_toy&role;target:=embarrassed.png,I wonder if Etsuko has any wands like that...
3-female_masturbating,count-uses_toy&role;target:=embarrassed.png,I can't even imagine what kind of store you'd have to find to buy one of those...

3-female_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;chun-li:,count-finished:1=embarrassed.png,Oh gosh! That's not how <i>everyone</i>... finishes, is it?...
3-female_finished_masturbating,priority:301,count-role;target&character;aimee:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:223=calm.png,I'm not calling the medic for that one. You need to learn your lesson.
3-female_finished_masturbating,priority:301,count-role;target&character;akko:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:250=calm.png,You're lucky this didn't end with you turning into a Manatrocity... but I still have to arrest you.
3-female_finished_masturbating,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:181=interested.png,Not exactly an "honorable discharge," but okay.
3-female_finished_masturbating,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:181=calm.png,You're cleaning that up.

4-male_must_masturbate=flustered.png,I'm... kind of happy you lost... Th-that's not mean, is it?
4-male_must_masturbate=happy.png,I'm sorry, ~name~, but you appear to have lost. You have to... well, I don't even have to tell you.
4-male_must_masturbate=flustered.png,W-well, I'm sorry you lost, but... I'm also kind of glad...
4-male_must_masturbate=competitive.png,Ha, I knew I'd outlast you! Now I just need to last a bit longer...
4-male_must_masturbate,count-role;target&losses;3-:=flustered.png,I hope my luck doesn't run as bad as yours did...
4-male_must_masturbate,count-role;target&losses;3-:=sad.png,I'm sorry. I wanted you to lose, but not like this.
4-male_must_masturbate,count-role;self&saidmarker;1v1:=happy.png,Phew! Oh, uh, sorry, ~name~, looks like I won.
4-male_must_masturbate,count-role;self&saidmarker;1v1:=happy.png,Ah, I won! Uh, sorry, ~name~, I don't mean to brag.
4-male_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;jotaro&sayingmarker;MastRule:=embarrassed.png,Um, y-yeah, y-you didn't read the rules...?
4-male_must_masturbate,count-role;other&character;meia&notsaidmarker;unaware_mast:,count-masturbating:0,count-finished:0=interested.png,Y-you didn't read all the rules, Meia? Why not?
4-male_must_masturbate,count-role;other&character;meia&notsaidmarker;unaware_mast:,count-masturbating:0,count-finished:0=interested.png,Wait, y-you didn't know? How?
4-male_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;kamina&sayingmarker;firsttomasturbate:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=calm.png,Well, uh... good. I'm... glad you're not mad.
4-male_must_masturbate,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:177=competitive.png,Smokin' time.
4-male_must_masturbate,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:177=happy.png,Time to grab some real estate, ~name~.
4-male_start_masturbating=calm.png,I-I'll try not to stare too much.
4-male_start_masturbating=flustered.png,I, uh... I'd actually like to watch you... do that.
4-male_start_masturbating=flustered.png,I'm, uh... kind of excited...
4-male_start_masturbating=flustered.png,Y-you can look at me, if it helps you. That is the point of the game, after all...
4-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;jotaro:=embarrassed.png,I-I'll be sure not to stare o-or make comments...
4-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kamina:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=shocked.png,O-oh! I-it got bigger! S-so you're one of <i>those</i> kinds of guys...
4-male_start_masturbating,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:174=happy.png,Now hop to it, soldier!
4-male_start_masturbating,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:174=happy.png,Ruck up, soldier, there's no going back now!... Although I guess you could just leave...
4-male_masturbating=flustered.png,Erm, t-try not to look my way too much...
4-male_masturbating=interested.png,S-so, uh... d-do you do this often...?
4-male_masturbating=flustered.png,Wow... You're really, uh... hard, aren't you?
4-male_masturbating=horny.png,Is anyone else getting... a little too warm...?
4-male_masturbating,count-role;target&character;jotaro:=embarrassed.png,...
4-male_masturbating,priority:0,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;1v1:=horny.png,I'm... starting to become more okay with losing...
4-male_masturbating,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:182=happy.png,That's it. Polish that rifle.
4-male_masturbating,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:182=competitive.png,I don't care if you get tired, ~name~, you've gotta keep it up!
4-male_masturbating,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:182=calm.png,You can look at me if it helps. I wouldn't be here if I weren't okay with that.
4-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;ryuji:=shocked.png,<i>W-was that lightning?</i>
4-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;corrin_m:=shocked.png,D-did you just... <i>gain dragon wings?</i>
4-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;corrin_m:=shocked.png,D-did you just... <i>you can turn into a dragon?</i>
4-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;jotaro:=flustered.png,I, um... Sh-should I still not make comments, or...?
4-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;9s:=interested.png,Wait, h-how can you be, uh... done, if you didn't... you know...
4-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;9s:=interested.png,Wait, you're done? B-but how? There's no, uh... s-semen.
4-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kamina:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;KaminaIsCool:,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:0=interested.png,G-great, now can you please just... sit there <i>quietly</i>?
4-male_finished_masturbating,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:170=enthused.png,Consider yourself "relieved of your position." Haha!
4-male_finished_masturbating,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:170=interested.png,Do we have any towels on hand? That seems like quite an oversight.
4-female_must_masturbate=flustered.png,I'm... kind of happy you lost... Th-that's not mean, is it?
4-female_must_masturbate=happy.png,I'm sorry, ~name~, but you appear to have lost. You have to... well, I don't even have to tell you.
4-female_must_masturbate=flustered.png,W-well, I'm sorry you lost, but... I'm also kind of glad...
4-female_must_masturbate=competitive.png,Ha, I knew I'd outlast you! Now I just need to last a bit longer...
4-female_must_masturbate=interested.png,Y-you didn't read all the rules, Meia? Why not?

4-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;nagisa:=embarrassed.png,A-a play? Well, whatever helps you get comfortable...
4-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&saidmarker;pinka_start&notsaidmarker;pinka_end2:=flustered.png,I don't like the sound of that...
4-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;vriska:=interested.png,I guess this'll be your saving throw, then.
4-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;vriska:=interested.png,Let's just consider this a saving throw, then.
4-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&losses;3-:=flustered.png,I hope my luck doesn't run as bad as yours did...
4-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&losses;3-:=sad.png,I'm sorry. I wanted you to lose, but not like this.
4-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;moon:=embarrassed.png,Oh dear. Y-you've started already...
4-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;moon:=embarrassed.png,Oh dear. Y-you certainly are eager...
4-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;morrigan:=embarrassed.png,Oh, h-hello, Lilith. Nice to meet you, I guess?
4-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;catria:=flustered.png,Oh, uh, sure. No problem.
4-female_must_masturbate,count-role;self&saidmarker;1v1:=happy.png,Phew! Oh, uh, sorry, ~name~, looks like I won.
4-female_must_masturbate,count-role;self&saidmarker;1v1:=happy.png,Ah, I won! Uh, sorry, ~name~, I don't mean to brag.
4-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;palutena:=flustered.png,Sorry, Palutena, but that's the rules...
4-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;palutena:=flustered.png,Sorry, Palutena, but I don't think we can make an exception... even for a goddess.
4-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;nami:,id:29=flustered.png,Um, okay...
4-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;elizabeth:=shocked.png,W-wait, Elizabeth, what are you summoning? I-if it's a monster, don't do it! W-we can talk about this!
4-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;wonder_woman:=shocked.png,W-wait, princess, you still have your tiara! Y-you haven't lost yet!
4-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;joey:=embarrassed.png,You sure aren't shy about this...
4-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;ini:,count-masturbating:0,count-finished:0=interested.png,Well, uh, let's just call this retribution for your lies.
4-female_must_masturbate,priority:0,count-masturbating:0,count-finished:0=flustered.png,Well, I have been curious about the act of self stimulation, so I guess this is an opportunity to observe how it's done...
4-female_must_masturbate,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:179=competitive.png,Smokin' time.
4-female_must_masturbate,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:179=happy.png,Time to grab some real estate, ~name~.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:meia,targetNotSaidMarker:unaware_mast,totalMasturbating:0,totalFinished:0=interested.png,Y-you didn't read all the rules, Meia? Why not?
4-female_must_masturbate,target:meia,targetNotSaidMarker:unaware_mast,totalMasturbating:0,totalFinished:0=interested.png,Wait, y-you didn't know? How?
4-female_start_masturbating=flustered.png,I'll probably need all the advice I can get, if I end up losing.
4-female_start_masturbating=flustered.png,W-well, I guess you could show me how it's done.
4-female_start_masturbating=flustered.png,I'm... suddenly really nervous about losing...
4-female_start_masturbating=interested.png,Care to show me how it's done, ~name~? I certainly could stand to learn.
4-female_start_masturbating=flustered.png,C-can I watch? S-so I know what I'm doing if I lose, n-not because... never mind...
4-female_start_masturbating=interested.png,M-mind if I watch? I'm probably going to need to know how to do that soon...
4-female_start_masturbating=flustered.png,Y-you can look at me, if it helps you. That is the point of the game, after all...
4-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie:=shocked.png,<i>A balloon?</i> But why would you pull that out <i>now</i>?
4-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;morrigan&saidmarker;lilith_sister:=shocked.png,<i>Wait, you're sisters? Th-that's... That's...</i>
4-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kyu:=flustered.png,I-it's "Who'd've" you're looking for. Who, would, have; who'd've.
4-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;joey:=interested.png,Is that some sort of magic wand? Are you going to cast magic at something?
4-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;vriska:=embarrassed.png,Oh dear... I guess you rolled a 1, huh...?
4-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;vriska:=embarrassed.png,Rolled a 1, huh? I get those a lot too, but never have they been so... catastrophic...
4-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;vriska:=embarrassed.png,Rolled a nat 1, huh? Those are a real pain... I would know...
4-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;vriska:=embarrassed.png,Nat 1, huh? My friend Timbo rolled a 1 once and ended up turning me into a chicken.
4-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;croix:=shocked.png,Oh gosh! Y-you <i>are</i> in control of this, r-right?
4-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;alpha:=shocked.png,Oh my gosh! Y-you're alive again! How'd you do that?
4-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;alpha:=shocked.png,Oh my gosh! Y-you're not a ghost anymore! How'd you do that?
4-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch:=shocked.png,Oh! I wasn't expecting this to involve chains! Doesn't that hurt?
4-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;catria:=flustered.png,Okay. That's... perfectly reasonable.
4-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;elizabeth:=interested.png,O-oh, you just summoned a copy? I, um, I'm not sure why, though.
4-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;morrigan:=embarrassed.png,O-oh. Th-that's, uh...
4-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;wonder_woman:=flustered.png,O-okay, y-you don't have to take it off if you don't want to...
4-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&saidmarker;pinka_start&notsaidmarker;pinka_end2:=flustered.png,T-toys? W-what do toys have to do with this...?
4-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;sayla:=flustered.png,Uh, I guess? Maybe?
4-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;sayla:=flustered.png,I wouldn't know...
4-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;jolyne:=flustered.png,Uh, w-with <i>what</i>?
4-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;amalia:=embarrassed.png,Uh... W-what are you doing?
4-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;hermione:=interested.png,Wait, there are spells for this?
4-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika:=embarrassed.png,W-wait, the penalty for losing is... n-not wrestling. I-is this legal?
4-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika:=embarrassed.png,W-wait, the penalty for losing is... n-not wrestling. A-are we allowed to change our penalties? I'd very much like to change mine too!
4-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika:=embarrassed.png,W-wait, the penalty for losing is... n-not wrestling. A-are we allowed to change our penalties? I want mine to be wrestling too!
4-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;moon:=flustered.png,W-well, a-at least you're having fun, I guess...
4-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kurumu:=embarrassed.png,W-well, at least we know now that you were serious when you said you are a succubus...
4-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;nami:,id:30=embarrassed.png,W-whatever makes you comfortable, I guess.
4-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;palutena:=embarrassed.png,Yeah... I can't say I'm fond of this, either...
4-female_start_masturbating,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:175=happy.png,Now hop to it, soldier!
4-female_start_masturbating,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:175=happy.png,Ruck up, soldier, there's no going back now!... Although I guess you could just leave...
4-female_start_masturbating,count-uses_toy&role;target:=horny.png,Is that... some kind of wand?... What kind of magic are you going to cast?
4-female_masturbating=embarrassed.png,...
4-female_masturbating=flustered.png,...
4-female_masturbating=interested.png,I see, so you... ah...
4-female_masturbating=interested.png,I-is that how everyone... does <i>that</i>? The way ~name~ does?
4-female_masturbating=flustered.png,I feel... strange, watching ~name~ do... <i>that</i>...
4-female_masturbating=horny.png,I-I'm not making this weird for you, am I, ~name~? I certainly feel weird myself...
4-female_masturbating=horny.png,Is anyone else getting... a little too warm...?
4-female_masturbating=flustered.png,O-oh... I, uh... never would have thought to... use an object for this...
4-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kizuna&saidmarker;delay_9&notsaidmarker;delay_10:=shocked.png,Ah! Another one!
4-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;croix&saying;tellement:=embarrassed.png,C’est bien, je suppose...
4-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kizuna&notsaidmarker;delay_1:=interested.png,Download? What does that mean?
4-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kizuna&saidmarker;delay_11&notsaidmarker;delay_12:=interested.png,F-frames? I don't see any frames...
4-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kizuna&saidmarker;delay_4&notsaidmarker;delay_5:=flustered.png,I still don't understand what's going on, but okay...
4-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kizuna&saidmarker;delay_2&notsaidmarker;delay_3:=flustered.png,I... Er...
4-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kizuna&saidmarker;delay_12&notsaidmarker;delay_13:=flustered.png,I-if you say so...
4-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kizuna&saidmarker;delay_10&notsaidmarker;delay_11:=flustered.png,I-is it...?
4-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;jolyne&timeinstage;2:=interested.png,I-is Jolyne's technique common, or...?

4-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&timeinstage;0:=shocked.png,Oh gosh! Sh-she put it in, like it's a... a p--...
4-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&timeinstage;0:=flustered.png,O-oh... I, uh... never would have thought to... use an object for this...
4-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;amalia&timeinstage;0:=embarrassed.png,Oh my... Th-that looks painful...
4-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kizuna&saidmarker;delay_7&notsaidmarker;delay_8:=shocked.png,Oh! The other you is back!
4-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kizuna&saidmarker;delay_5&notsaidmarker;delay_6:=shocked.png,Oh! There's two of you, Kizuna!
4-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kizuna&saidmarker;delay_3&notsaidmarker;delay_4:=flustered.png,O-oh, okay...
4-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;jolyne&timeinstage;3:=flustered.png,Sorry, Jolyne, I-I'll stop asking questions now...
4-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kizuna&saidmarker;delay_6&notsaidmarker;delay_7:=interested.png,S-so a "download" is something automatic? You probably <i>should</i> just leave it alone, then.
4-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika&timeinstage;0:=embarrassed.png,Th-that doesn't look like the kind of wrestling my father and I used to do...
4-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;elizabeth:=embarrassed.png,Th-that's way more than I thought I'd see here...
4-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;elizabeth:=embarrassed.png,Wh-what are you even doing, Elizabeth? I don't understand.
4-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;elizabeth:=embarrassed.png,Th-this is... really graphic...
4-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;elizabeth:=embarrassed.png,I can't believe what I'm seeing...

4-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kizuna&saidmarker;delay_1&notsaidmarker;delay_2:=interested.png,Uh, what are you looking at, Kizuna?
4-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;jolyne&timeinstage;1:=interested.png,You're not even, uh... s-stimulating yourself, Jolyne... o-or are you?

4-female_masturbating,priority:326,count-role;target&character;akko&timeinstage;7&sayingmarker;akko_second_climax:=flustered.png,I-it's up to you, I guess...
4-female_masturbating,priority:326,count-role;target&character;akko&timeinstage;4:,id:249=annoyed.png,That spell had better be white magic...
4-female_masturbating,priority:326,count-role;target&character;akko&timeinstage;3&sayingmarker;akko_first_climax:=embarrassed.png,Y-you're done? Already...?

4-female_masturbating,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:190=happy.png,That's it. Pull that trigger... That sounded better in my head...
4-female_masturbating,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:190=competitive.png,I don't care if you get tired, ~name~, you've gotta keep it up!
4-female_masturbating,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:190=calm.png,You can look at me if it helps. I wouldn't be here if I weren't okay with that.
4-female_masturbating,count-uses_toy&role;target:=flustered.png,That's, uh... not how we use wands in my world...
4-female_masturbating,count-uses_toy&role;target:=interested.png,D-do you have any wands that get used on... other parts of the body...? Like hand wands or something?
4-female_masturbating,count-uses_toy&role;target:=interested.png,S-so how far can you cast magic with that...?
4-female_masturbating,count-uses_toy&role;target:=embarrassed.png,I wonder if Etsuko has any wands like that...

4-female_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie:=shocked.png,Oh no! That's terrible! How will you get the pieces out?
4-female_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kizuna:=interested.png,Oh. You're... you're done? I'm not even sure what I just watched...
4-female_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;amalia:=embarrassed.png,That was, uh... quite the display of magic...
4-female_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;catria:=interested.png,Uh... I-is it okay to talk to you again...?
4-female_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;moon:=embarrassed.png,Um... Now that you're done, can you, um... can you please leave? You're making me uncomfortable...

4-female_finished_masturbating,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:171=interested.png,Do we have any towels on hand? That seems like quite an oversight.

5-male_masturbating,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:182=competitive.png,I don't care if you get tired, ~name~, you've gotta keep it up!
5-male_masturbating,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:182=calm.png,You can look at me if it helps. I wouldn't be here if I weren't okay with that.

5-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;vriska:=interested.png,I guess this'll be your saving throw, then.
5-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;vriska:=interested.png,Let's just consider this a saving throw, then.
5-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&losses;3-:=flustered.png,I hope my luck doesn't run as bad as yours did...
5-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&losses;3-:=sad.png,I'm sorry. I wanted you to lose, but not like this.

5-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;palutena:=flustered.png,Sorry, Palutena, but that's the rules...
5-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;palutena:=flustered.png,Sorry, Palutena, but I don't think we can make an exception... even for a goddess.
5-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;nami:,id:29=flustered.png,Um, okay...
5-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;elizabeth:=shocked.png,W-wait, Elizabeth, what are you summoning? I-if it's a monster, don't do it! W-we can talk about this!

5-female_start_masturbating=flustered.png,I'll probably need all the advice I can get, if I end up losing.
5-female_start_masturbating=flustered.png,W-well, I guess you could show me how it's done.
5-female_start_masturbating=flustered.png,I'm... suddenly really nervous about losing...
5-female_start_masturbating=interested.png,Care to show me how it's done, ~name~? I certainly could stand to learn.
5-female_start_masturbating=flustered.png,C-can I watch? S-so I know what I'm doing if I lose, n-not because... never mind...
5-female_start_masturbating=interested.png,M-mind if I watch? I'm probably going to need to know how to do that soon...
5-female_start_masturbating=flustered.png,Y-you can look at me, if it helps you. That is the point of the game, after all...

5-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kyu:=flustered.png,I-it's "Who'd've" you're looking for. Who, would, have; who'd've.
5-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;joey:=interested.png,Is that some sort of magic wand? Are you going to cast magic at something?
5-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;vriska:=embarrassed.png,Oh dear... I guess you rolled a 1, huh...?
5-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;vriska:=embarrassed.png,Rolled a 1, huh? I get those a lot too, but never have they been so... catastrophic...
5-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;vriska:=embarrassed.png,Rolled a nat 1, huh? Those are a real pain... I would know...
5-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;vriska:=embarrassed.png,Nat 1, huh? My friend Timbo rolled a 1 once and ended up turning me into a chicken.
5-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;croix:=shocked.png,Oh gosh! Y-you <i>are</i> in control of this, r-right?
5-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;alpha:=shocked.png,Oh my gosh! Y-you're alive again! How'd you do that?
5-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;alpha:=shocked.png,Oh my gosh! Y-you're not a ghost anymore! How'd you do that?
5-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;scarlet_witch:=shocked.png,Oh! I wasn't expecting this to involve chains! Doesn't that hurt?
5-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;catria:=flustered.png,Okay. That's... perfectly reasonable.
5-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;elizabeth:=interested.png,O-oh, you just summoned a copy? I, um, I'm not sure why, though.
5-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;morrigan:=embarrassed.png,O-oh. Th-that's, uh...
5-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;wonder_woman:=flustered.png,O-okay, y-you don't have to take it off if you don't want to...

5-female_start_masturbating,count-role;self&saidmarker;1v1:=interested.png,Um, can I watch you too? S-so I have all the advice I can get in case I play again?
5-female_start_masturbating,count-role;self&saidmarker;1v1:=flustered.png,You can use me as a visual aid, if you want. I feel like it's only fair, given that I won.
5-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;hermione:=interested.png,Wait, there are spells for this?
5-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika:=embarrassed.png,W-wait, the penalty for losing is... n-not wrestling. I-is this legal?
5-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika:=embarrassed.png,W-wait, the penalty for losing is... n-not wrestling. A-are we allowed to change our penalties? I'd very much like to change mine too!
5-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika:=embarrassed.png,W-wait, the penalty for losing is... n-not wrestling. A-are we allowed to change our penalties? I want mine to be wrestling too!
5-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;moon:=flustered.png,W-well, a-at least you're having fun, I guess...

5-female_start_masturbating,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:175=happy.png,Ruck up, soldier, there's no going back now!... Although I guess you could just leave...
5-female_start_masturbating,count-uses_toy&role;target:=horny.png,Is that... some kind of wand?... What kind of magic are you going to cast?
5-female_masturbating=embarrassed.png,...

5-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kizuna&saidmarker;delay_4&notsaidmarker;delay_5:=flustered.png,I still don't understand what's going on, but okay...
5-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kizuna&saidmarker;delay_2&notsaidmarker;delay_3:=flustered.png,I... Er...

5-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;jolyne&timeinstage;3:=flustered.png,Sorry, Jolyne, I-I'll stop asking questions now...
5-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kizuna&saidmarker;delay_6&notsaidmarker;delay_7:=interested.png,S-so a "download" is something automatic? You probably <i>should</i> just leave it alone, then.

5-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kizuna&saidmarker;delay_1&notsaidmarker;delay_2:=interested.png,Uh, what are you looking at, Kizuna?
5-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;jolyne&timeinstage;1:=interested.png,You're not even, uh... s-stimulating yourself, Jolyne... o-or are you?

5-female_masturbating,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:190=competitive.png,I don't care if you get tired, ~name~, you've gotta keep it up!
5-female_masturbating,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:190=calm.png,You can look at me if it helps. I wouldn't be here if I weren't okay with that.

-3-female_masturbating,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:190=competitive.png,I don't care if you get tired, ~name~, you've gotta keep it up!
-3-female_masturbating,count-mama_shotgun&role;self:,id:190=calm.png,You can look at me if it helps. I wouldn't be here if I weren't okay with that.
-3-female_masturbating,count-uses_toy&role;target:=flustered.png,That's, uh... not how we use wands in my world...
-3-female_masturbating,count-uses_toy&role;target:=interested.png,D-do you have any wands that get used on... other parts of the body...? Like hand wands or something?

-3-female_masturbating,count-uses_toy&role;target:=embarrassed.png,I wonder if Etsuko has any wands like that...

#SELF MASTURBATING
#If your character is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must masturbate.
#These lines only come up in the relevant stages, so you don't need to include the stage numbers here. Just remember which stage is which when you make the images. The "starting" image is still in the naked stage.
#The "finished_masturbating" line will repeat many times if the game is not yet finished. This plays as opponents comment on the how good their hands are.

#When selecting the characters to play the game, the first line will always play, then it randomly picks from any of the start lines after you commence the game but before you deal the first hand.


#Items of clothing should be listed here in order of removal.
#The values are formal name, lower case name, how much they cover, what they cover
#Please do not put spaces around the commas.
#"Important" clothes cover genitals (lower) or chest/breasts (upper). For example: bras, panties, a skirt when going commando.
#"Major" clothes cover underwear. For example: skirts, pants, shirts, dresses.
#"Minor" clothes cover skin or are large pieces of clothing that do not cover skin. For example: jackets, socks, stockings, gloves.
#"Extra" clothes are small items that may or may not be clothing but do not cover anything interesting. For example: jewelry, shoes or boots with socks underneath, belts, hats. In the rest of the code, "extra" clothes are called "accessory".
#If for some reason you write another word for the type of clothes (e.g. "accessory"), other characters will not react at all when the clothing is removed.
#What they cover = upper (upper body), lower (lower body), other (neither).
#The game can support any number of entries, but typically we use 2-8, with at least one "important" layer for upper and lower (each).

#Notes on dialogue
#All lines that start with a # symbol are comments and will be ignored by the tool that converts this file into a xml file for the game.
#Where more than one line has an identical type, like "swap_cards" and "swap_cards", the game will randomly select one of these lines each time the character is in that situation.
#You should try to include multiple lines for most stages, especially the final (finished) stage, -1. 

#A character goes through multiple stages as they undress. The stage number starts at zero and indicates how many layers they have removed. Special stage numbers are used when they are nude (-3), masturbating (-2), and finished (-1).
#Line types that start with a number will only display during that stage. The will override any numberless stage-generic lines. For example, in stage 4 "4-swap_cards" will be used over "swap_cards" if it is not blank here. Giving a character unique dialogue for each stage is an effective way of showing their changing openness/shyness as the game progresses.
#You can combine the above points and make multiple lines for a particular situation in a particular stage, like "4-swap_cards" and "4-swap_cards".

#Some special words can be used that will be substituted by the game for context-appropriate ones: ~name~ is the name of the character they're speaking to, but this only works if someone else is in focus. ~clothing~ is the type of clothing that is being removed by another player. ~Clothing~ is almost the same, but it starts with a capital letter in case you want to start a sentence with it.
#~name~ can be used any time a line targets an opponent (game_over_defeat, _must_strip, _removing_, _removed, _must_masturbate, etc).
#~clothing~ can be used only when clothing is being removed (_removing and _removed, but NOT _must_strip).
#~player~ can be used at any time and refers to the human player.
#~cards~ can be used only in the swap_cards lines.
#All wildcards can be used once per line only! If you use ~name~ twice, the code will show up the second time.

#Lines can be written that are only spoken when specific other characters are present. For a detailed explanation, read this guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/spnati/comments/6nhaj0/the_easy_way_to_write_targeted_lines/
#Here is an example line (note that targeted lines must have a stage number):
#0-female_must_strip,target:hermioine=happy,Looks like your magic doesn't help with poker!




#INTRODUCTION
#These lines are used to say different things depending on which other characters are present when the character
#is selected and when the game starts.

#POKER PLAY
#This is what a character says while they're exchanging cards and commenting on their hands afterwards.
#When swapping cards, the game will automatically put a display a number between 0-5 where you write ~cards~.
#These lines display on the screen for only a brief time, so it is important to make them short enough to read at a glance.

good_hand=happy,Haha. Sorry to say that I definitely won't be losing this round.

-3-hand,alsoPlaying:revy,alsoPlayingStage:5,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0,notSaidMarker:DoneWithRevy=angry,I said "Niccolo," not "Nicole!" You messed that up on purpose, didn't you?
-3-hand,alsoPlaying:revy,alsoPlayingStage:5,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0,notSaidMarker:DoneWithRevy=angry,I said "Niccolo," not "Nicole!" Funny, you're as tall, uncharming, and <i>almost</i> as masculine as him.
-3-hand,alsoPlaying:revy,alsoPlayingStage:5,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0,notSaidMarker:DoneWithRevy=angry,I said "Niccolo," not "Nicole!" And if you try to lay a single dirty hand on me, I... I'll break your arm!
-3-hand,alsoPlaying:revy,alsoPlayingStage:5,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0,notSaidMarker:DoneWithRevy=angry,I said "Niccolo," not "Nicole!" If I didn't know he's an only child, I'd swear your his sister!

-3-hand,alsoPlaying:vriska,totalRounds:6=interested,Sorry, Vriska, I didn't mean that it was bad. I just think it's... odd.
-3-hand,alsoPlaying:vriska,totalRounds:6=interested,Sorry, Vriska, I didn't mean to offend you. I just meant that it's... weird.
-3-hand,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:futaba_bookclub,count-lotte:1=calm,Oh, okay! I'll read it as soon as I find a copy of it!

0-must_strip=happy,Heh, it had to be my turn eventually.
0-must_strip=happy,Well, this is <i>strip</i> poker. I didn't expect to go the whole game fully clothed.
0-must_strip=happy,I guess it's my turn now?
0-must_strip=happy,My turn? That's okay, I still have plenty of HP left!
0-must_strip,alsoPlaying:akko=happy,If you think <i>I'm</i> huge, you should've seen my father! He was even bigger than I am!
0-must_strip,alsoPlaying:cammy=calm,Believe me, Cammy, I know size isn't everything. I've fought plenty of formidable opponents who were smaller than me.
0-must_strip,alsoPlaying:coco=calm,If <i>my</i> height impresses you, Coco, you should've seen my father!
0-must_strip,alsoPlaying:jenetta=happy,I sure am! I've been to many places in this past year alone! Adventuring is so much fun!
0-must_strip,alsoPlaying:jotaro=happy,And you're the first man I've met in a while that's taller than me. It's actually kind of nice!
0-must_strip,alsoPlaying:jotaro,alsoPlayingSaying:impressed=happy,O-oh, thanks! It's kind of nice meeting a man that's taller than me.
0-must_strip,alsoPlaying:jura=calm,Oh, it's not that I was never invited out, I just wasn't allowed to leave in the first place.
0-must_strip,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=interested,Um... Who? Are they some kind of legend in this world?
0-must_strip,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=interested,Um... Who? Is that one of this world's legendary heroes?
0-must_strip,alsoPlaying:miko=happy,Haha. I'm not an Oni. Both of my parents are human.
0-must_strip,alsoPlaying:miko=happy,Haha. I'm not an Oni. I don't have horns.
0-must_strip,alsoPlaying:mulan,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=happy,Haha, sorry to say that you still haven't. I'm not a giant, I'm just a tall human.
0-must_strip,alsoPlaying:navi=shocked,W-what? How do you know that?
0-must_strip,alsoPlaying:palutena,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=happy,If you think <i>I'm</i> tall, you should've seen my father!
0-must_strip,alsoPlaying:rainbow_mika=happy,I'd be glad to wrestle you. I should warn you, though, I could nearly take down my father, and he was bigger than I am!
0-must_strip,alsoPlaying:revy,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=happy,Oh, thanks for the tip, but I'm set on money.
0-must_strip,alsoPlaying:revy,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=happy,Thanks for the suggestion, but I'm set on money.
0-must_strip,alsoPlaying:rinkah=interested,Like yours, I guess. There's grass, and trees, and the occasional dragon.

0-must_strip,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:hiaella=interested,Uh... Who? What? I-I'm not a Brunhilde, I'm a warrior. I don't carry a shield at all.

0-must_strip,hasHand:Royal Flush=shocked,W-what? Me? But I have a Royal Flush!
0-must_strip,hasHand:Royal Flush=shocked,W-what? <i>I</i> have to strip? But how? <i>Why?</i>
0-must_strip,hasHand:Straight Flush=sad,Geez. I knew my luck was bad, but this is ridiculous.
0-must_strip,hasHand:Straight Flush=sad,Aw. Curse my terrible luck.
0-must_strip,hasHand:Straight Flush=sad,Aw, darn it! I thought for sure I couldn't lose with that hand!
0-must_strip,hasHand:Two Pair=sad,Aw man, I thought I was safe with this hand.
0-must_strip,hasHand:Two Pair=happy,Wow! What a round! You all managed to do better than my two pairs!
0-must_strip,totalRounds:0=happy,Me first, huh?
0-must_strip,totalRounds:0=happy,Me first? No worries, I'm used to my speed making my turn come up first!
0-must_strip_winning=happy,Heh, it had to be my turn eventually.
0-must_strip_normal=happy,I guess it's my turn now?
0-must_strip_losing=happy,My turn so soon? Figures, I suppose, given my luck.
0-stripping=stripping,This reminds me of the first time I ever left the house; the first step into a brand new world.
0-stripping=stripping,My armor set is pretty similar to the set my dad wore. Except his had more rounded accents to it.
0-stripping=stripping,My dad always said "A true warrior doesn't need much armor. With the proper technique, a thrust to the chest can be easily countered."
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:akko=stripping,I'm on more of a quest than an adventure. My friend Etsuko opened up a portal and wanted me to find out where it lead to.
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:beatrix=stripping,I know. My dad always said "A true warrior doesn't need much armor. With the proper technique, a thrust to the chest can be easily countered."
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:coco=stripping,No, I bought this set at a shop. It's similar to a set my father got me, but with better stats.
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=stripping,That's a common misconception, Elizabeth. Armor <i>can't</i> be heavy, or else it becomes more trouble than it's worth.
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:joey=stripping,This reminds me of the first time I ever left the house; the first step into a brand new world.
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura=stripping,It's okay, Jura, my dad was the one keeping me inside, and he was just trying to protect me.
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia=stripping,Ah, I see. She sounds lovely.
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia=stripping,She sounds like a lovely woman.
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:mulan,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=stripping,While that's a correct assumption, I'm not actually part of any army. I'm just a wandering warrior.
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:sei=stripping,Uh, thanks, I guess? To be honest, I don't see how this is brave. I've faced greater trials than this.
0-stripping,count-festival_aella:1=stripping,My friend Etsuko helped me make this outfit. I learned all I know about fashion from her and her books.
0-stripping,count-festival_aella:1=stripping,My friend Etsuko helped me make this outfit. She helped me come up with the design and gather the materials.
0-stripping,count-new_year_aella:1=stripping,Do you like my outfit? I heard "Easter" involves rabbits, so Etsuko and I made this outfit and plush doll.
0-stripping,count-new_year_aella:1=stripping,Do you like my outfit? I was worried about having too many rabbit icons, but Etsuko <i>insisted</i> I have a bunch. We tried to compromise.


#losing boots
1-stripped=stripped,Don't let me slow things down. Let's keep this game going.
1-stripped=stripped,My dad said "A true warrior doesn't need much armor. With proper technique, a thrust to the chest can be easily countered."
1-stripped=stripped,It's kind of funny how no matter what shops I visit, they always have that exact armor set for sale but with different stats.
1-stripped=angry,First person to comment how little my armor covers gets smacked! It doesn't affect my defense stat, I tell you!
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:akko=stripped,Uh, thanks. Honestly, it's not hard to make me happy, so you'll at least have that!
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:beatrix=stripped,You'd better! My dad survived a war, he knows what he's talking about!
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:clover=stripped,Oh, see, it's a metaphor, Clover. I don't mean a literal world, I mean it's a a brand new experience.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:coco=flustered,<i>Amateur...?</i>
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=stripped,I'm sure you could walk in it, just probably not very far. It doesn't require a lot of <i>strength</i>, but it can be very trying on your <i>stamina</i>,
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:joey=stripped,Is that what you see stripping as, Joey?
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia=stripped,Aha, funny, I've played a lot of poker too. Er, <i>regular</i> poker.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia=stripped,Aha, funny coincidence, I've played a lot of poker too.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:palutena=stripped,Don't let me slow things down. Let's keep this game going.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:phoebe=stripped,I know that. It was just a simile.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:rinkah=stripped,Yeah. You can never know when a goblin ambush might happen.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:sei=stripped,No, thank you. I don't drink. I appreciate the offer, though.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:twilight=stripped,That would be cool, but no, I'm just a regular adventurer.
1-stripped,count-festival_aella:1=stripped,I'll take off <i>all</i> of my accessories. It feels more fair that way.
1-stripped,count-festival_aella:1=stripped,I don't want to slow things down too much, so I'll take off <i>all</i> of my accessories.
1-stripped,count-new_year_aella:1=stripped,We wear similar colors for New Years in my world, so this outfit isn't much different than what I would've worn there.
1-stripped,count-new_year_aella:1=stripped,Besides New Years, we also have the First Harvest Festival in Spring, where we celebrate food and all forms of livestock.
1-stripped,count-new_year_aella:1=stripped,Etsuko also insisted I carry that plush doll. She made it in her likeness, more or less. She's not a rabbit, though, obviously.
1-stripped,count-new_year_aella:1=stripped,Etsuko also insisted I carry that plush doll. If this were the First Harvest Festival, it would've been a stuffed horse insteaed of a rabbit.
1-must_strip=happy,Heh, it had to be my turn eventually.
1-must_strip=happy,Well, this is <i>strip</i> poker. I didn't expect to go the whole game fully clothed.

1-must_strip=happy,My turn? That's okay, I still have plenty of HP left!
1-must_strip=happy,Lost another hand, but I'm still having fun!
1-must_strip,alsoPlaying:akko=stripping,Of course! Etsuko is a good witch, and I'm sure there are plenty more.
1-must_strip,alsoPlaying:mulan,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=interested,Is that so, Ping? I wonder why?
1-must_strip,alsoPlaying:navi=happy,Haha, you know, I don't get it either. People come in all sorts of shapes and sizes, so why single people out?
1-must_strip,hasHand:Royal Flush=shocked,W-what? But a Royal Flush is an unbeatable hand!
1-must_strip,hasHand:Royal Flush=shocked,W-what? Me? But I have a Royal Flush!
1-must_strip,hasHand:Royal Flush=shocked,W-what? <i>I</i> have to strip? But how? <i>Why?</i>

1-must_strip,hasHand:Straight Flush=sad,Aw, darn it! I thought for sure I couldn't lose with that hand!
1-must_strip,hasHand:Two Pair=sad,Aw man, I thought I was safe with this hand.
1-must_strip,hasHand:Two Pair=happy,Wow! What a round! You all managed to do better than my two pairs!
1-must_strip,timeInStage:0=sad,Aw, me again already?
1-must_strip,timeInStage:0=sad,My turn again so soon?
1-must_strip,timeInStage:0=sad,Aw, but I just went.
1-must_strip_winning=happy,Well, this is <i>strip</i> poker. I didn't expect to go the whole game fully clothed.
1-must_strip_normal=happy,Well, at least I'm keeping pace with the rest of you.
1-must_strip_losing=happy,My turn again? Oh well, at least we're still early on in the game.
1-stripping=stripping,Suppose it's time for my boots to go.
1-stripping=stripping,Alright, I'll take off my boots next. It only makes sense.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=stripping,Indeed it is. I've studied many books on strategy and war tactics. They're very fasinating!
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:sei=stripping,Not really. Mercenaries ask for pay, whereas I do things for free.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:sei=stripping,Not really. I don't work for pay, so "mercenary" doesn't really apply to me.
1-stripping,count-festival_aella:1=stripping,I would've worn high heels, but I can't walk in them, so I stuck with boots.
1-stripping,count-festival_aella:1=stripping,Etsuko suggested I wear high-heeled shoes, but I can't walk in them, so I stuck with boots.
1-stripping,count-festival_aella:1=stripping,I would've worn high heels, but my dexterity stat isn't high enough for me to walk in them, so I stuck with boots.

2-stripped=stripped,They may not be Boots of Strength or anything like that, but they're super comfortable.
2-stripped=happy,Not a big deal. It's like I just came home!
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:akko=stripped,That's a good idea, but those were just regular boots.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:akko=calm,That's not a bad idea, but I wouldn't need them. I have a spell that achieves a similar result.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:beatrix=stripped,Is this really that boring to you, Beatrix?
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=happy,Haha! Poker has nothing to do with strategy. You should be more afraid of how I've studied books on poker tactics!
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=happy,Haha! Poker has nothing to do with strategy. You should be more afraid of how many times I've played poker against my parents!
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:mulan,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=flustered,Uh, okay, thanks, I guess?
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:sei=interested,Uh, thanks, I guess? I wouldn't exactly call them "old motifs," though.
2-stripped,count-festival_aella:1=stripped,It feels kind of weird wearing a dress like this without footwear...
2-stripped,count-festival_aella:1=stripped,I feel both underdressed and overdressed at the same time...
2-stripped,count-new_year_aella:1=stripped,I suppose I could always make a pair of high heels with stronger heels, but boots are far more practical.
2-must_strip=happy,Heh, it had to be my turn eventually.
2-must_strip=happy,Well, this is <i>strip</i> poker. I didn't expect to go the whole game fully clothed.
2-must_strip=happy,I guess it's my turn now?

2-must_strip=happy,Lost another hand, but I'm still having fun!
2-must_strip,alsoPlaying:akko=calm,I did. It's one of the few forms of magic I'm decent at.
2-must_strip,alsoPlaying:navi=happy,I absolutely do! I love exploring dungeons!
2-must_strip,count-new_year_aella:1=flustered,Guess it's time to put the rabbit back in my inventory... I know it's just a doll, but I don't want to remove my dress in front of it...
2-must_strip,hasHand:Royal Flush=shocked,W-what? But a Royal Flush is an unbeatable hand!
2-must_strip,hasHand:Royal Flush=shocked,W-what? Me? But I have a Royal Flush!

2-must_strip,timeInStage:0=sad,Aw, me again already?
2-must_strip,timeInStage:0=sad,My turn again so soon?
2-must_strip,timeInStage:0=sad,Aw, but I just went.
2-must_strip_winning=happy,Lost another hand, but I'm still having fun!
2-must_strip_normal=happy,Well, I may not be winning, but at least I'm not losing either.
2-must_strip_losing=sad,Shoot, I'm losing, aren't I?
2-stripping=stripping,Uh... I guess I can take off my dress.
2-stripping=stripping,I guess my dress will be next.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:clover=stripping,Uh, I guess so.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:palutena=stripping,Uh... I guess I can take off my dress.
2-stripping,count-festival_aella:1=stripping,So much for my fancy outfit...
2-stripping,count-festival_aella:1=stripping,There goes all the effort I put into dressing up...
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:akko,count-lotte:0=stripping,I'm not sure how those things are connected. Sewing magic doesn't involve talking to spirits.
2-stripping,count-new_year_aella:1=stripping,So much for my festive colors...


#losing leggings
3-stripped,marker:Leggings=stripped,My leggings are very form-fitting, so this is a little embarrassing, but at least I'm still not showing much skin.
3-stripped,marker:NoShops=stripped,I had to make that dress myself since no one in town makes clothes for women as large as me.
3-stripped=stripped,I made that dress myself using Sewing magic. It's one of the few magic types I'm good at...
3-stripped=stripped,I made that dress myself using Sewing magic. I'm not good at many other magic types. Just self-buffing spells and Stick to Snakes.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:akko=stripped,I appreciate that, Akko. Though, I'm sure I have enough magical defense where you couldn't do much harm on accident alone.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:beatrix=stripped,I mean, I could've taken off my leggings instead, but my legs get cold easily, so this is the better option.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:clover=stripped,Nowhere. I have to make them myself. I outgrew every dress size by the time I was 15.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:joey=stripped,Uh, thanks, I guess...
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:palutena,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=stripped,They're not meant to be fashionable. The dress is the part that makes this outfit work.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:palutena,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=stripped,They're not meant to be fashionable. At least, not without the dress they're not.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit=stripped,I didn't think I'd lose this much. I used to play poker with my dad all the time.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:rinkah=stripped,Sure, but definitely once we're both fully clothed again.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:saki=stripped,Uh, sure, Saki, but maybe we can talk about that later? Now doesn't seem to be the most opportune time.
3-stripped,count-festival_aella:1=stripped,Normally I wear a warmer undershirt, but longer sleeves would've stuck out from under the dress.
3-stripped,count-festival_aella:1=stripped,I normally wear a warmer undershirt, but I had to go with short sleeves for this outfit.
3-stripped,count-new_year_aella:1=stripped,Er... So, uh, I should probably explain my world's New Years customs, huh?
3-must_strip=flustered,I don't really want to strip any more than I have, but I'll honor the game's rules...
3-must_strip=flustered,I guess there's no getting around this...

3-must_strip,hasHand:Royal Flush=shocked,W-what? Me? But I have a Royal Flush!
3-must_strip,hasHand:Royal Flush=shocked,W-what? <i>I</i> have to strip? But how? <i>Why?</i>
3-must_strip,hasHand:Straight Flush=sad,Geez. I knew my luck was bad, but this is ridiculous.
3-must_strip,hasHand:Straight Flush=sad,Aw. Curse my terrible luck.
3-must_strip,hasHand:Straight Flush=sad,Aw, darn it! I thought for sure I couldn't lose with that hand!
3-must_strip,hasHand:Two Pair=sad,Darn it! I thought for sure I wouldn't lose.
3-must_strip,hasHand:Two Pair=facepalm,Aw come on! Everyone <i>really</i> beat my two pairs?
3-must_strip,timeInStage:0=sad,Aw, me again already?
3-must_strip,timeInStage:0=sad,My turn again so soon?
3-must_strip,timeInStage:0=sad,Aw, but I just went.
3-must_strip_winning=calm,I can still win with dignity if I avoid losing another hand.
3-must_strip_normal=interested,Tit for tat, I suppose.
3-must_strip_losing=sad,I knew luck was my weakest trait, but this is ridiculous...
3-stripping=stripping,Well... I'm not wearing anything under my shirt, so it'd be better if I took off my leggings...
3-stripping=stripping,It'd be better to take off my leggings. Better for <i>me</i>, anyway... I-I'm not wearing a bra...
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:joey=stripping,Right, but they are covering a lot of skin...
3-stripping,count-festival_aella:1=stripping,W-well, I did prepare for this, so...
3-stripping,count-festival_aella:1=stripping,I... actually prepared for this...
3-stripping,count-new_year_aella:1=stripping,I know some people consider leggings like these too warm for Springtime, but I get cold easily, so I always dress warmly.


#losing undershirt
4-stripped=stripped,Except now I'm standing around in my underwear...
4-stripped=stripped,I'm not gonna lie, though, my level of fun has fallen with my level of comfort...
4-stripped=stripped,I sleep dressed like this, so it's not too uncomfortable, but I always put something on before leaving my room...
4-stripped,marker:Panties=stripped,Much like the rest of my clothes, I made these p-panties myself. I saw the design in a catalog...
4-stripped,marker:Panties=stripped,I saw these p-panties in a catalog and decided to make them myself...
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:akko=stripped,Well, Akko, I... don't wear a breastplate either, so that's not the case for me...
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:akko,marker:Panties=stripped,Much like the rest of my clothes, I made these p-panties myself. I saw the design in a catalog...
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:akko,marker:Panties=stripped,I saw these p-panties in a catalog and decided to make them myself...
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:beatrix=stripped,I mean... a little bit...
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:clover=stripped,No, they stop at my feet.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:clover=stripped,Thanks, I guess...?
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:coco=stripped,Th-thanks. I know I've got a lot to learn about fashion, but I have a great teacher.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:joey=stripped,Y-yeah... It's just my legs... and my u-underwear...
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:palutena,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=stripped,I <i>had</i> more protection, but I lost it all...
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:palutena,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=stripped,Protection isn't my specialty. I focus more on damage-dealing...
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit=stripped,Not sure "daring" is the word I'd use for that.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit=stripped,T-too daring. Far too daring.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit=stripped,This option at least leaves me <i>some</i> covering.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:sei=stripped,Uh... what's a "roleplayer?" Is that someone who pretends? I'm not pretending to be anything.
4-stripped,count-festival_aella:1=stripped,I... I figured I'd match my panties with my dress. You know, for the occasion...
4-stripped,count-festival_aella:1=stripped,I don't normally, uh... coordinate my underwear with the rest of my outfit, but I figured it was appropriate for the occasion.
4-stripped,count-new_year_aella:1=flustered,Oh, uh, right, um, n-needless to say, New Years is a rather religious celebration. It's also the day that white magic is the strongest.
4-must_strip=flustered,I don't really want to strip any more than I have, but I'll honor the game's rules...
4-must_strip=flustered,I guess there's no getting around this...
4-must_strip=facepalm,I should've known I'd do poorly in a game that's mostly luck...
4-must_strip=flustered,Well, I <i>did</i> agree to this...
4-must_strip,marker:AellaStalling=stalling,W-wait! I think I hear a village being attacked by a, uh... a dragon! Yeah!... <i>No?</i>... Fine...
4-must_strip,marker:AellaStalling=stalling,W-wait! I hear a, uh... a cyclops! Yeah! I should go stop it before... <i>No?</i>... Oh well...
4-must_strip=facepalm,Stupid cards...
4-must_strip=facepalm,Ugh... A-alright, j-just give me a moment...
4-must_strip=stripped,I honestly didn't think I'd have to take off so much...
4-must_strip,hasHand:Royal Flush=shocked,W-what? But a Royal Flush is an unbeatable hand!
4-must_strip,hasHand:Royal Flush=shocked,W-what? Me? But I have a Royal Flush!
4-must_strip,hasHand:Royal Flush=shocked,W-what? <i>I</i> have to strip? But how? <i>Why?</i>
4-must_strip,hasHand:Straight Flush=sad,Geez. I knew my luck was bad, but this is ridiculous.
4-must_strip,hasHand:Straight Flush=sad,Aw. Curse my terrible luck.
4-must_strip,hasHand:Straight Flush=sad,Aw, darn it! I thought for sure I couldn't lose with that hand!
4-must_strip,hasHand:Two Pair=sad,Darn it! I thought for sure I wouldn't lose.

4-must_strip,timeInStage:0=sad,Aw, me again already?
4-must_strip,timeInStage:0=sad,My turn again so soon?
4-must_strip,timeInStage:0=sad,Aw, but I just went.
4-must_strip_winning=calm,Gee, I may be winning, but I sure am losing more than I'd like to.
4-must_strip_normal=sad,<i>Sigh</i>... At least I'm not alone in this endeavor...
4-must_strip_losing=sad,Oh boy... I wasn't prepared for this...
4-stripping=stripping,This is a lot more naked than I care to get, but rules are rules...
4-stripping=stripping,I hope Asvaldr isn't watching me from the underworld...
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:beatrix=stripping,My offense always was better than my defense, anyhow...
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:joey,notSaidMarker:AellaStalling=stripping,Oh, I don't know... I'm not sure I <i>can</i> get used to it...
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:joey,saidMarker:AellaStalling=stripping,M-maybe you're right... Well, there's only one way to find out...
4-stripping,count-festival_aella:1=stripping,I didn't prepare for this part of the occasion...
4-stripping,count-festival_aella:1=stripping,Don't expect any more special clothing items under this... There aren't any...
4-stripping,count-new_year_aella:1=stripping,I-I'm sure it doesn't need saying, but my world doesn't have any holidays about exposing yourself...
4-stripping,notSaidMarker:AellaStalling,priority:0=stripping,Best two out of three?... No?... It was worth a shot...
4-stripping,timeInStage:1=stripping,Y'know, thinking about it, compared to this, fighting hypnotized demon soul infused weapons is a cakewalk...

5-stripped=stripped,I, uh... never thought not wearing a bra would ever come back to bite me...
5-stripped=stripped,We don't have games like this in my world, so forgive me for being so uncomfortable.

#These lines are spoken when an opponent must strip, but the character does not yet know what they will take off.

#OPPONENT REMOVING ACCESSORY
#These lines are spoken when an opponent removes a small item that does not cover any skin.
#Typically, characters are fine with this when they are fully dressed but less satisfied as they become more naked.
#Note that all "removing" lines are NOT spoken to human players. Characters will skip straight from "6-male_human_must_strip" to "6-male_removed_accessory", for example.

0-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested,Um, not to put you down or anything, Blake, but I've fought alongside a walking flower and the Demon Lord of Wounds; cat ears are not shocking to me.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested,Uh, sorry but, is that it? Just cat ears? My friend Pernilla is a walking flower. You look normal compared to her.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested,Sorry, but after dealing with a formless, mind-bending monster, everyone else looks normal to me.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested,Sorry, but I'm not surprised. I guess I got desensitized by the evil, formless monster I defeated not too long ago. He was quite a weird one...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested,Sorry, Blake, but I'm not surprised at all. With all the weird creatures I've seen, I've learned to stop questioning peoples' appearance.

0-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1=interested,Uh, I guess so...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:2=interested,Huh. Yeah. I guess that would do the trick too.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=interested,So, by that logic, you must be a Ladybug Mage, right?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:meia=calm,Oh, so it's just a decoration? It sure looks like it has a purpose.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=flustered,You're really, uh... enthusiastic about this game, huh?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=flustered,You, uh... sure are eager to get n-naked, huh?

0-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:4=interested,Um... Moon?... Did you hear my question?...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:2=happy,You'd have to be pretty low-level for <i>bats</i> to give you trouble, anyhow!

0-female_removed_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:pinka_start,targetNotSaidMarker:pinka_end2=sad,Oh, never mind. I think that was a death threat...

0-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=shocked,D-did you do that intentionally? You're oddly calm.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=interested,This is... really bizarre.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:dizzy=shocked,Are you okay, Shimakaze?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1=angry,Yeah, you'd <i>better</i> put the knife down!

2-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested,Oh, you were just hiding cat ears? I've had stranger-looking allies than a person with cat ears.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested,Um, not to put you down or anything, Blake, but I've fought alongside a walking flower and the Demon Lord of Wounds; cat ears are not shocking to me.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested,Uh, sorry but, is that it? Just cat ears? My friend Pernilla is a walking flower. You look normal compared to her.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested,Sorry, but after dealing with a formless, mind-bending monster, everyone else looks normal to me.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested,Sorry, but I'm not surprised. I guess I got desensitized by the evil, formless monster I defeated not too long ago. He was quite a weird one...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested,Sorry, Blake, but I'm not surprised at all. With all the weird creatures I've seen, I've learned to stop questioning peoples' appearance.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=happy,Well, at least you came back!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=happy,Don't sweat it, Florina! You came back, at least!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:2=sad,Oh no. That's unfortunate.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1=interested,Uh, I guess so...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:2=interested,Huh. Yeah. I guess that would do the trick too.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=interested,So, by that logic, you must be a Ladybug Mage, right?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:meia=calm,Oh, so it's just a decoration? It sure looks like it has a purpose.

3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:0,saidMarker:SewingMagic=happy,Oh, you know Sewing Magic too, Vriska? What're the odds that the three of us all would?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:0,saidMarker:SewingMagic=happy,Oh, you know Sewing Magic too, Vriska? Gosh, Etsuko's books must be more popular than I thought!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1-3=interested,I wonder what the outcome will be this time?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1-3=interested,I hope the outcome will be good.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1-3=interested,How likely is a bad roll?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1-3=interested,What could possibly go wrong?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1-3=interested,I'm sure the odds are in your favor, huh?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1-3=embarrassed,I'm afraid of what will happen if you roll a 20...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1-3=embarrassed,Th-the die can't effect anyone but you, right, Vriska? I fear that it might...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1-3=embarrassed,Th-the die can't effect <i>my</i> clothes, can it?...
3-female_removing_accessory,targetStatus:naked=flustered,Oh, I didn't realize you still had that.

3-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested,Oh, you were just hiding cat ears? I've had stranger-looking allies than a person with cat ears.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested,Um, not to put you down or anything, Blake, but I've fought alongside a walking flower and the Demon Lord of Wounds; cat ears are not shocking to me.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested,Uh, sorry but, is that it? Just cat ears? My friend Pernilla is a walking flower. You look normal compared to her.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested,Sorry, but after dealing with a formless, mind-bending monster, everyone else looks normal to me.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested,Sorry, but I'm not surprised. I guess I got desensitized by the evil, formless monster I defeated not too long ago. He was quite a weird one...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested,Sorry, Blake, but I'm not surprised at all. With all the weird creatures I've seen, I've learned to stop questioning peoples' appearance.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=happy,Well, at least you came back!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=happy,Don't sweat it, Florina! You came back, at least!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:2=sad,Oh no. That's unfortunate.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1=interested,Uh, I guess so...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:2=interested,Huh. Yeah. I guess that would do the trick too.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=interested,So, by that logic, you must be a Ladybug Mage, right?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:meia=calm,Oh, so it's just a decoration? It sure looks like it has a purpose.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=flustered,You're really, uh... enthusiastic about this game, huh?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=flustered,You, uh... sure are eager to get n-naked, huh?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=interested,If you hate the accessories rule so much, why'd you wear any?... I mean, except for your shoes.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:4=interested,Um... Moon?... Did you hear my question?...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:2=happy,You'd have to be pretty low-level for <i>bats</i> to give you trouble, anyhow!

3-female_removed_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:pinka_start,targetNotSaidMarker:pinka_end2=sad,Oh, never mind. I think that was a death threat...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:4=angry,No one was trying to touch your things!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=shocked,D-did you do that intentionally? You're oddly calm.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=interested,This is... really bizarre.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:dizzy=shocked,Are you okay, Shimakaze?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1=angry,Yeah, you'd <i>better</i> put the knife down!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:chun-li=calm,She's right, Chun-Li. The die technically counts... for better or worse.

3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2a=interested,Oh. I guess you re-classed into a Swashbuckler now?

3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2b=happy,Oh! What a lovely outfit!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2c,targetNotSaidMarker:1c=interested,That's a nice outfit, I suppose, but why is it missing a sleeve?

5-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested,Oh, you were just hiding cat ears? I've had stranger-looking allies than a person with cat ears.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested,Um, not to put you down or anything, Blake, but I've fought alongside a walking flower and the Demon Lord of Wounds; cat ears are not shocking to me.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested,Uh, sorry but, is that it? Just cat ears? My friend Pernilla is a walking flower. You look normal compared to her.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested,Sorry, but after dealing with a formless, mind-bending monster, everyone else looks normal to me.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested,Sorry, but I'm not surprised. I guess I got desensitized by the evil, formless monster I defeated not too long ago. He was quite a weird one...
5-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested,Sorry, Blake, but I'm not surprised at all. With all the weird creatures I've seen, I've learned to stop questioning peoples' appearance.

5-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1=interested,Uh, I guess so...
5-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:2=interested,Huh. Yeah. I guess that would do the trick too.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=interested,So, by that logic, you must be a Ladybug Mage, right?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:meia=calm,Oh, so it's just a decoration? It sure looks like it has a purpose.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=flustered,You're really, uh... enthusiastic about this game, huh?

-3-male_removed_accessory,targetStatus:naked=flustered,I-I'm going to let that slide, since you're... you know...
-3-female_removing_accessory=angry,I can't believe you still have stuff like your ~clothing~ to remove while I'm down to nothing!
-3-female_removing_accessory=angry,I know it's fair, but I don't appreciate you removing your ~clothing~ when I'm standing here naked!
-3-female_removing_accessory=angry,Having fun over there, taking off your ~clothing~? Because I'm not!

-3-female_removing_accessory,target:croix,targetStage:1=interested,That's really cool. What are "magitronics," though?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=happy,That's the right way to play this game in my book: keep your modesty for as long as possible!

-3-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0=interested,If by "get lucky" you mean "get critical hits," then no, I don't get them very often.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1=interested,Wouldn't that require your shoes to be small and cramped?

-3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:0,saidMarker:SewingMagic=happy,Oh, you know Sewing Magic too, Vriska? Gosh, Etsuko's books must be more popular than I thought!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1-3=interested,I wonder what the outcome will be this time?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1-3=interested,I hope the outcome will be good.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1-3=interested,How likely is a bad roll?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1-3=interested,What could possibly go wrong?

-3-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested,Oh, you were just hiding cat ears? I've had stranger-looking allies than a person with cat ears.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested,Um, not to put you down or anything, Blake, but I've fought alongside a walking flower and the Demon Lord of Wounds; cat ears are not shocking to me.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested,Uh, sorry but, is that it? Just cat ears? My friend Pernilla is a walking flower. You look normal compared to her.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested,Sorry, but after dealing with a formless, mind-bending monster, everyone else looks normal to me.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested,Sorry, but I'm not surprised. I guess I got desensitized by the evil, formless monster I defeated not too long ago. He was quite a weird one...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=interested,Sorry, Blake, but I'm not surprised at all. With all the weird creatures I've seen, I've learned to stop questioning peoples' appearance.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=happy,Well, at least you came back!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=happy,Don't sweat it, Florina! You came back, at least!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:2=sad,Oh no. That's unfortunate.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1=interested,Uh, I guess so...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:2=interested,Huh. Yeah. I guess that would do the trick too.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=interested,So, by that logic, you must be a Ladybug Mage, right?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:meia=calm,Oh, so it's just a decoration? It sure looks like it has a purpose.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=flustered,You're really, uh... enthusiastic about this game, huh?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=flustered,You, uh... sure are eager to get n-naked, huh?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=interested,If you hate the accessories rule so much, why'd you wear any?... I mean, except for your shoes.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:4=interested,Um... Moon?... Did you hear my question?...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:2=happy,You'd have to be pretty low-level for <i>bats</i> to give you trouble, anyhow!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:6=calm,W-why does that make me nervous...?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:pinka_start,targetNotSaidMarker:pinka_end2=sad,Oh, never mind. I think that was a death threat...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:4=angry,No one was trying to touch your things!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=shocked,D-did you do that intentionally? You're oddly calm.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=interested,This is... really bizarre.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:dizzy=shocked,Are you okay, Shimakaze?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1=angry,A-are you going to count that? That's barely fair!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:chun-li=calm,She's right, Chun-Li. The die technically counts... for better or worse.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1a,alsoPlaying:link,marker:VriskaLink=interested,Oh, you, uh... copied Link's outfit?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1a,alsoPlaying:link,marker:VriskaLink=interested,Oh. You must really like Link's outfit, huh?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1a=interested,Well, uh... I think you're actually wearing <i>more</i> clothes now, but I guess if it's up to luck, maybe you'll lose more next time?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1a=interested,Well, uh... I think you're wearing <i>more</i> clothing now, but since it's luck-based, I guess it's okay?

-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1c=happy,Oh wow! What a grand dress! I honestly wasn't expecting that!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2b,saidMarker:VriskaDress=happy,You still look lovely, Vriska.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2a=interested,Oh. I guess you re-classed into a Swashbuckler now?

-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2b=happy,Oh! What a lovely outfit!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2c,targetNotSaidMarker:1c=interested,That's a nice outfit, I suppose, but why is it missing a sleeve?

-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3a=happy,Oh, are you a Ranger now? My sister is a Ranger! Well, technically a Thief, but same thing, basically.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3b=interested,That's a nice outfit, I suppose, but why is it missing a sleeve?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:3c=happy,Oh, what a nice sweater!

-2-female_removing_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=interested,Sure, it's a nice set - I just noticed; you're not wearing shoes. Why wear armor on all of your body but your feet?
-2-female_removing_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=interested,Sure, it's a nice set - I just noticed; you're not wearing shoes. Why wear gloves, yet not shoes?
-2-female_removing_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=interested,Sure, it's a nice set - I just noticed; you're not wearing shoes. Your feet are arguably one of the most important parts of your body to cover.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:croix,targetStage:4=interested,I'm... okay with that.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:1=calm,It's just your jacket. That shouldn't be so bad.

-2-female_removed_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2=happy,See, you look fine! It's just your shoulders!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:bee2,targetNotSaidMarker:bee_stop=flustered,That was... Odd. Uh, sorry about your tunic, Florina.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:bee2,targetNotSaidMarker:bee_stop=interested,That was... Bizarre. You wouldn't happen to have any Bee mage enemies, would you?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:bee2,targetNotSaidMarker:bee_stop=interested,That was... Strange. You wouldn't happen to have any enemies who know Bee magic, would you?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1=interested,I mean, it's not really my fault that you look so much like her.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1=interested,Like I said, you look a lot like her. I think my train of thought is perfectly reasonable.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=interested,I know an alchemist who might be able to help; curatives are his specialty. He's sure to have something for burn scars.

-2-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetSaidMarker:dna_lock=happy,Wow, that's pretty cool! Maybe I should put the same kind of enchantment on my armor too?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetSaidMarker:pauldrons=happy,Haha. Of course they're articulated, Sei. If you couldn't move your arms well, how would you swing your weapon?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:sheena,targetStage:3=interested,I'll admit, that's what I was thinking too, Sheena.

#OPPONENT REMOVING MAJOR CLOTHING
#Major clothing reveals a significant amount of skin and likely underwear.
#However, as we don't know if the opponent is taking off the top or the bottom, we can't presume that nice abs are showing; maybe she took of her skirt before her shirt.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

#OPPONENT MASTURBATING
#When an opponent is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must pay the penalty by masturbating in front of everyone.
#The "must_masturbate" line is for just before it happens, and the "start_masturbating" line immediately follows.
#The "masturbating" line will be spoken a little after the opponent has started but before they climax.
#When the opponent climaxes, your character will say the "finished_masturbating" line.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

#SELF MASTURBATING
#If your character is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must masturbate.
#These lines only come up in the relevant stages, so you don't need to include the stage numbers here. Just remember which stage is which when you make the images. The "starting" image is still in the naked stage.
#The "finished_masturbating" line will repeat many times if the game is not yet finished. This plays as opponents comment on the how good their hands are.

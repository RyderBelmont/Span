#CLOTHING
#Items of clothing should be listed here in order of removal.
#The values are formal name, lower case name, how much they cover, what they cover
#Please do not put spaces around the commas.
#How much they cover = important (covering nudity), major (a lot of skin), minor (small amount of skin), extra (accessories, boots, etc)
#Ehat they cover = upper (upper body), lower (lower body), other (neither).
#There must be 2-8 entries, and at least one "important" piece of clothing on each of the upper and lower locations.
#Below is an example of Rosalina's clothing. Please adjust these values to match your character's clothing.
clothes=Belt,belt,extra,other

clothes=Leggings,leggings,major,lower
clothes=Undershirt,undershirt,important,upper
clothes=Panties,panties,important,lower



#Notes on dialogue
#All lines that start with a # symbol are comments and will be ignored by the tool that converts this file into a xml file for the game.
#Where more than one line has an identical type, like "swap_cards" and "swap_cards", the game will randomly select one of these lines each time the character is in that situation.
#A character goes through multiple stages as they undress. The stage number starts at zero and indicates how many layers they have removed. Special stage numbers are used when they are nude (-3), masturbating (-2), and finished (-1).
#Line types that start with a number will only display during that stage. The will override any numberless stage-generic lines. For example, in stage 4 "4-swap_cards" will be used over "swap_cards" if it is not blank here. Giving a character unique dialogue for each stage is an effective way of showing their changing openness/shyness as the game progresses.
#You can combine the above points and make multiple lines for a particular situation in a particular stage, like "4-swap_cards" and "4-swap_cards".
#Some special words can be used that will be substituted by the game for context-appropriate ones: ~name~ is the name of the character they're speaking to, but this only works if someone else is in focus. ~clothing~ is the type of clothing that is being removed by another player. ~Clothing~ is almost the same, but it starts with a capital letter in case you want to start a sentence with it.
#Example emotions are sometimes used in the lines below, but you can replace these as needed. Your specified emotions should match your posed image names. If you don't have posed images yet, you can write the dialogue first and fill these in later.
#The template below presumes that your character has a full eight layers of clothing. Remove unneeded stages if your character has fewer layers.



#EXCHANGING CARDS
#This is what a character says while they're exchanging cards.
#The game will automatically put a display a number between 0-5 where you write ~cards~.
#These lines display on the screen for only a brief time, so it is important to make them short enough to read at a glance.
#The lines written here are examples only and should be replaced.
swap_cards=calm,May I have ~cards~ cards, please?
swap_cards=calm,I need ~cards~ cards, please.
swap_cards=calm,~cards~ new cards, please.

0-must_strip_losing=happy,Me first, huh? 
0-stripping=stripping,No biggie, I'll just take off my belt. It's not like it's holding anything up right now anyway.
1-stripped=stripped,Let's keep this game going.

#losing second item of clothing
1-must_strip_winning=happy,Well, this is <i>strip</i> poker. I didn't expect to go the whole game without taking off more than just my belt.
1-must_strip_normal=happy,Well, at least I'm keeping pace with the rest of you.
1-must_strip_losing=happy,My turn again? Oh well, at least we're still early on in the game.
1-stripping=stripping,Suppose it's time for my boots to go.
2-stripped=stripped,Shame; those boots are super comfy. They're like standing on clouds.

#losing third item of clothing
2-must_strip_winning=happy,Lost another hand, but I'm still having fun!
2-must_strip_normal=happy,Well, I may not be winning, but at least I'm not losing either.
2-must_strip_losing=sad,Shoot, I'm losing, aren't I?
2-stripping=stripping,Uh... I guess I can take off my dress.
3-stripped=stripped,My leggings are very form-fitting, so this is a little embarrassing, but at least I'm still not showing much skin.
3-stripped=stripped,I had to make that dress myself since no one in town makes clothes for women as large as me.

#losing fourth item of clothing
3-must_strip_winning=calm,I can still win with dignity if I avoid losing another hand.
3-must_strip_normal=interested,Tit for tat, I suppose.
3-must_strip_losing=sad,Gosh, I'm not doing so well.
3-stripping=stripping,Well... I'm not wearing anything under my shirt, so it'd be better if I took off my leggings...
4-stripped=stripped,Except now I'm standing around in my underwear...

#losing fifth item of clothing
4-must_strip_winning=calm,Gee, I may be winning, but I sure am losing more than I'd like to.

4-must_strip_losing=sad,Oh boy... I wasn't prepared for this...
4-stripping=stripping,This is a lot more naked than I care to get, but rules are rules...
4-stripping=stripping,This is a lot more naked than I care to get, but rules are rules...
4-stripping=stripping,Best two out of three?... No?... It was worth a shot...
4-stripping=stripping,Best two out of three?... No?... It was worth a shot...
4-stripping=stripping,Y'know, thinking about it, compared to this, fighting hypnotized demon soul infused weapons is the lesser of two evils... 
5-stripped=stripped,I don't were a b-bra because they don't have any proven benefits that outweigh the discomfort...
5-stripped=stripped,I sure would like to win right now...
5-stripped=stripped,I should've worn my armor. Then I would've had a few more things to remove...

#losing sixth item of clothing
5-must_strip_winning=sad,I don't want to do this, but... At least I won't be the only one who'll be n-naked...
5-must_strip_normal=sad,At least if I play my cards right - quite literally - I still have a chance of winning...
5-must_strip_losing=embarrassed,I don't want to be the first one naked...
5-stripping=stripping,P-please don't watch me r-remove my panties...
5-stripping=stripping,I sure wish I had two more arms to cover my chest with right now...
6-stripped=stripped,Well, a-at least this is as naked as I can be...
6-stripped=stripped,I know that nudity is natural, but clothes are... Much more comfortable.
6-stripped=stripped,I'm so glad Jolene can't see me now. Little sisters shouldn't see their big sisters naked...


#OPPONENT MUST STRIP
#These lines are spoken when an opponent must strip, but the character does not yet know what they will take off.
#Writing different variations is important here, as these lines will be spoken about thirty times per game.
#The "human" versions of the lines will only be spoken if the human player is stripping.

#OPPONENT REMOVING ACCESSORY
#These lines are spoken when an opponent removes a small item that does not cover any skin.
#Typically, characters are fine with this when they are fully dressed but less satisfied as they become more naked.
#Note that all "removing" lines are NOT spoken to human players. Characters will skip straight from "6-male_human_must_strip" to "6-male_removed_accessory", for example.

#OPPONENT MASTURBATING
#When an opponent is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must pay the penalty by masturbating in front of everyone.
#The "must_masturbate" line is for just before it happens, and the "start_masturbating" line immediately follows.
#The "masturbating" line will be spoken a little after the opponent has started but before they climax.
#When the opponent climaxes, your character will say the "finished_masturbating" line.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

#SELF MASTURBATING
#If your character is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must masturbate.
#These lines only come up in the relevant stages, so you don't need to include the stage numbers here. Just remember which stage is which when you make the images. The "starting" image is still in the naked stage.
#The "finished_masturbating" line will repeat can repeat many times if the game is not yet finished. This plays as opponents comment on the how good their hands are.

must_masturbate_first=loss,Oh boy... I'm the first one out... I have to, uh... "Touch myself" now, don't I?...
must_masturbate=loss,I guess it's my turn?... Oh boy...
start_masturbating=starting,I'll be honest: I don't really know what I'm doing. None of my books on anatomy cover s-sexual functions.
masturbating=embarrassed,P-please stop looking at me. You're making it harder for me to... f-finish.
masturbating=sad,I... I don't think I'm doing this right... I feel weird...
masturbating=sad,M-maybe I should've p-practiced?...
masturbating=angry,Don't even think of offering to help! I don't need it!... Or want it...
masturbating=sad,To think that some people do this for fun...
masturbating=calm,I should have never agreed to this...
masturbating=interested,What if I just can't... Finish? Can I just go home then?...
masturbating=interested,I'm not being timed on this, am I?...
masturbating=angry,Y-you're enjoying this, aren't you?!
masturbating=calm,You'd think at least <i>one</i> of the many books I've read would've mentioned something about self-stimulation...

finished_masturbating=finished,I feel... Very awkward...
finished_masturbating=finished,I'd stand back up, but my legs are rather numb right now...
finished_masturbating=finished,Honestly, I don't even care who wins; I just want to go home. Maybe have some tea...

game_over_defeat=calm,Congratulations on the victory... Can I go home now? I'd very much like to be alone right now...


#EPILOGUE/ENDING
#This is optional. Delete it if you don't have an ending thought up yet.
#You can also have multiple endings.
#Each one starts with the "ending" entry
#The tabs aren't necessary, but make it easier to read.
#For an example of how to write these, read the behaviour text file of another character with an epilogue.

ending=This is the title of the character's ending, and the start of a new ending
	ending_gender="male", "female", or "any". This is the gender of player that can see the ending

	#each ending has a number of screens. each screen has an image, and one or more text boxes
	#the entry "screen" marks the start of a new screen
	screen=filename (including extension) of the background image for a screen. Also the start of a new screen

		#the text boxes in a screen
		#the entry "text" starts a new text box
		text=The text in the text box.
		x=The x-position of the text box. Specifically, the position of the text box's left side. This can be a percentage, or the word "centered"
		y=The y-position of the top of the text box. Must be a percentage.
		width=The width of a text box. This is optional. Must be a percentage.
		arrow="up", "down", "left", or "right". Gives the text box a dialogue arrow in the specified direction. Can be left out, if you don't want the text box to be an arrow.

	#this screen is an example
	#the filename is the image you want to use
	screen=example-filename.png

		text=This is text that will be seen by the player. It has a width of 34% and an arrow pointing down.
		x=10%
		y=20%
		width=34%
		arrow=right

		text=This is a centered text box. It has the default width and an arrow pointing right.
		x=centered
		y=50%
		arrow=right

		text=This third text box has minimum amount of values specified. It uses the default width, and has no arrow.
		x=75%
		y=50%

#if you want additional endings, start the new one with the "ending" line



#CHARACTER-SPECIFIC LINES TO PASTE INTO behavior.xml
#Lines can be targeted at specific characters at specific stages in the game. The best way to learn how to use these is to read these in an existing character's document.
#There are a large number of case variables you can specify, and many can be used in conjunction if you want to get really specific, like a line to Link if he's the only male, he's removing his tunic, he had three of a kind, and Zelda is present and got a royal flush.
# tag="situation" - This is what is happening in the game, using the same labels you used for the dialogue. This field is mandatory.
# target="character" - This is where you put the character's name that you want to specifically target. This is optional, but you'll probably be using this, a filter, or an alsoPlaying. The tag name is the character's folder name, which is usually their first name. You can target the human player by targeting the "human" folder.
# filter="tag" - Instead of using a specific target, you can target a group of people using a filter like "princess". These descriptor tags aren't to be confused with the "tag=" line above.
# targetStage="0" - You can specify which stage the target is in when saying the line. If it's something that only happens once to a character, like a breast reveal, this is unnecessary. But if you use it on something more common like "female_must_strip", this will limit it to a particular occasion and will ensure that the line is only spoken once per game.
# alsoPlaying="character" - This is used either by itself for a situation that doesn't have a target like "good_hand" or "heavy_masturbating", or it can be used in conjunction with a target or filter to ensure that the speaker, the target, and someone else are all playing.
# alsoPlayingStage="0" - Just like targetStage, but for the alsoPlaying character.
# alsoPlayingHand="One Pair" - You can even tailor the responses to what the alsoPlaying character has as a hand. Possibilities are: High Card, One Pair, Two Pair, Three of a Kind, Straight, Flush, Full House, Four of a Kind, Straight Flush, Royal Flush.
# hasHand="Two Pair" - Like alsoPlayingHand, but for the character who is speaking.
# oppHand="Three of a Kind" - Like alsoPlayingHand and hasHand, but for the targeted/filtered character
# totalMales="1" - You can make some lines be spoken if only an exact number of males are playing. This includes the player character.
# totalFemales="4" - Like the above option, but for females.
# silent="" - You can add this to the case to make the dialogue box disappear entirely.
# img="0-calm.png" - After state, the image name is specified. To make this work correctly, you must specify both the stage and add .png.

#Because all of these are behind # symbols, make_xml.py will ignore these. They must be pasted in separately into the behaviour.xml after it is generated. Copy them to a blank document and to a find-replace on the # symbol to remove them all in one action, then copy each group into the appropriate section.
#Below are some example lines for usage reference only. Please replace or delete the lines below, then delete this line so that nobody deletes the lines you replace them with.

    <description>Petra is a student of the Officers Academy, hailing from Brigid, a vassal state of the Adrestian Empire - making her a member of the Black Eagles house. She is the granddaughter of the king of Brigid, and although her colloquial speech is not perfect, she gives her all in everything she does.</description>

        <title>Small Tanned Hide</title>
        <subtitle>Two huntresses, as ships passing in the night</subtitle>
        <text>A small animalâ€™s hide which has been meticulously tanned. As a skilled hunter, Petra is no stranger to leatherworking.
She and Leonie are both experienced at hunting wild game, something which they could later bond over.</text>
        <unlock>See Leonie and Petra do a dual forfeit together. They must be next to each other, both in their academy uniform, and need to have flirted 3 or more times across any games. Then, one of them needs to 'finish' before the other starts their forfeit. Play alongside Yuna (Kindred Spirits) to make it easier.</unlock>

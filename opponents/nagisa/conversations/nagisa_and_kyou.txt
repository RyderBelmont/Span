If Nagisa to left and Kyou to right:

NAGISA MUST STRIP SHOES:
Nagisa [nagisa_kyou_not_good_at_games]*: I've never been too good at games. I hope it's okay if I play anyway.
Kyou [kyou_nagisa_not_good_at_games]*: I wouldn't worry about it <i>too</i> much, Nagisa... Losing is the goal of this game after all.

NAGISA STRIPPING SHOES (accessory):
Nagisa [nagisa_kyou_trying_to_win]*: Someone has to win, so I'll be trying my hardest to be that person. But I know that my chances aren't all that good...
Kyou [kyou_nagisa_trying_to_win]*: Feel free to try your best but I'm afraid that I can't let you win... Don't worry, I'm sure you can still come second.

NAGISA STRIPPED SHOES (accessory):
Nagisa [nagisa_kyou_starting_out]*: Oh! Is it too late for me to find a table for people who are still learning how to play?
Kyou [kyou_nagisa_starting_out]*: You've really thrown yourself into the deep end, Nagisa! Will you sink or swim?


NAGISA MUST STRIP SOCKS:
Nagisa [nagisa_kyou_not_family_fun]*: The whole idea for this game is so daring, isn't it? But it's not really one I can go home and play with my family.
Kyou [kyou_nagisa_awkward]*: That would be an awkward thing to bring up with your family. Unless your family is really out there.

NAGISA STRIPPING SOCKS (minor):
Nagisa [nagisa_kyou_parents_playing]*: I think my mom and dad would enjoy playing this, just the two of them. I don't really want to think about that!
Kyou [kyou_nagisa_parents]*: From what you've told me about them it seems perfect for them... And I bet your father would still want to invite you...

NAGISA STRIPPED SOCKS (minor):
Nagisa [nagisa_kyou_teased]*: That's gross! My dad's not like that, Kyou! He just likes to tease me, that's all.
Kyou [kyou_nagisa_flustered]*: Hehe, I can't blame him, you're just so cute when you get all flustered.


NAGISA MUST STRIP JACKET:
Nagisa [nagisa_kyou_food]*: Nobody's playing to~background.time~ on an empty stomache, are they? Maybe I could've made something this morning and brought it in.
Kyou [kyou_nagisa_appetite]*: Maybe after the game we could go get something to eat, Nagisa. I'm sure you'll have worked up quite the appetite by the end.

NAGISA STRIPPING JACKET (accessory):
Nagisa [nagisa_kyou_cooking]*: We don't need to go out anywhere, Kyou. I could cook something up for you at my house. I'm sure my mom won't mind.
Kyou [kyou_nagisa_cooking]*: You've told me about your mother's cooking... I think it would be best to stay away.

NAGISA STRIPPED JACKET (accessory):
Nagisa [nagisa_kyou_mom_cooks]*: My mom's a really good cook! As for her baking... well... she really fills me up on the shop's leftovers.
Kyou [kyou_nagisa_bread]*: Well, I'll take your word for it... Remind me to never touch her bread.


NAGISA MUST STRIP SHIRT:
Nagisa [nagisa_kyou_what_should_i_do]*: Oh, Kyou! What should I do? You don't think anyone will laugh at me... do you?
Kyou [kyou_nagisa_adorable]*: Of course not, Nagisa... Why do you think people are going to laugh? You're cute and adorable, everyone's going to love it!

NAGISA STRIPPING SHIRT (major):
Nagisa [nagisa_kyou_no_disappointment]*: I hope you're right... I wouldn't want to disappoint anybody.
Kyou [kyou_nagisa_racing]*: You've got nothing to worry about... You've already got my heart racing a little and we've barely gotten to the good stuff.

NAGISA STRIPPED SHIRT (major):
Nagisa [nagisa_kyou_heart_race]*: M-Me? I'm making your heart race? I didn't know you felt that way about me, Kyou...
Kyou [kyou_nagisa_yes]*: Yes, you're very cute, Nagisa... You could make anyone's heart race when you're a little flustered like this.


NAGISA MUST STRIP SKIRT:
Nagisa [nagisa_kyou_more_than_a_friend]*: Did you really mean what you said earlier, Kyou? Do you really see me as more than a friend?
Kyou [kyou_nagisa_]*: Hehe, I wouldn't go that far... But still, not all friends get to see each other like this.

NAGISA STRIPPING SKIRT (major):
Nagisa [nagisa_kyou_closer_friends]*: That's true... Things like this can bring two friends closer. Just, um, not <i>that</i> close.

KYOU MUST STRIP SHOES:
Nagisa [nagisa_kyou_what_brings_you_here]*: What brings you here to~background.time~, Kyou? You... you didn't follow me here, did you?
Kyou [kyou_nagisa_what_brings_you_here]*: Hmm... Perhaps I did... Maybe I was curious why you were acting so flustered today and had to see what you were up to.

KYOU STRIPPING SHOES (accessory):
Nagisa [nagisa_kyou_dont_tell]*: Now you know my secret... You won't tell anyone, will you?!
Kyou [kyou_nagisa_dont_tell]*: Why so secretive, Nagisa? Trying to hide it from a certain someone?

KYOU STRIPPED SHOES (accessory):
Nagisa [nagisa_kyou_wrong_idea]*: N-No! It's not what you think! But aren't you worried someone might get the wrong idea if they heard you played a game like this?
Kyou [kyou_nagisa_wrong_idea]*: Well, I don't really care what everyone at school thinks of me... And if anyone does try to pick on us, I can just beat them up.


KYOU MUST STRIP JACKET:
Nagisa [nagisa_kyou_is_beautiful]*: You're so beautiful, Kyou! I can see why the boys like you.
Kyou [kyou_nagisa_same]*: Haha, thanks, Nagisa! You're very cute yourself and I'm sure you could get a boy or two if you were a bit more outgoing.

KYOU STRIPPING JACKET: (minor):
Nagisa [nagisa_kyou_two_boys]*: T-Two boys? A-At the same time? I wouldn't want to be greedy... Um... you've never gone out with two boys, have you?
Kyou [kyou_nagisa_two_boys]*: Well, no... But I'm sure I could get a boy or two if i really tried... I just don't really care for it at the moment.

KYOU STRIPPED JACKET: (minor):
Nagisa [nagisa_kyou_double_kiss]*: It would probably be fun to go on a date with two boys at once... but what if they both wanted to kiss you at the same time, Kyou? I don't think you should do it.
Kyou [kyou_nagisa_double]*: They should consider themselves lucky to be on a date with me and should stop complaining about something like that...


KYOU MUST STRIP SOCKS:
Nagisa [nagisa_kyou_founders_festival]*: Is your class busy preparing for the Founder's Festival, Kyou? I hope the boys in your class didn't vote for weird ideas like the boys did in mine.
Kyou [kyou_nagisa_cafe]*: Well of course they did... Endless amounts of perverted ideas. In the end I managed to compromise by deciding on a maid café. 

KYOU STRIPPING SOCKS (minor):
Nagisa [nagisa_kyou_maid_cafe]*: Are you going to dress up as a maid too? That could be so much fun!
Kyou [kyou_nagisa_maid]*: Well, as the class rep I was picked to be a maid first. I can't wait actually, I think I'll make a very cute maid.

KYOU STRIPPED SOCKS (minor):
Nagisa [nagisa_kyou_first_customer]*: That's great! I can't wait to be your first customer.
Kyou [kyou_nagisa_maid_outfit]*: Perhaps I'll even keep the outfit afterwards too! I think it'd be great for a game like this.


KYOU MUST STRIP SKIRT:
Nagisa [nagisa_kyou_sunohara]*: You don't think anyone else followed us here, do you? I don't want Sunohara to see us like this. His face worries me when he gets too excited.
Kyou [kyou_nagisa_sunohara]*: I hope not. He would get way too enthusiastic for this kind of game... If he does show up, I'll have to give him a piece of my mind.

KYOU STRIPPING SKIRT (major):
Nagisa [nagisa_kyou_violence]*: I understand that you want to keep this just between us, but please don't resort to violence if get more visitors!
Kyou [kyou_nagisa_more_players]*: I'm not opposed to more players, Nagisa... Just Sunohara. You know what he's like...

KYOU STRIPPED SKIRT (major):
Nagisa [nagisa_kyou_clothes_off]*: Yeah. Sunohara is a nice boy, but I don't want him to see us with our clothes off...
Kyou [kyou_nagisa_exactly]*: Exactly... I could do without his obscene remarks while playing this game.


KYOU MUST STRIP SHIRT:
Nagisa [nagisa_kyou_miyazawa_charm]*: If it might help, I could teach you a charm that Miyazawa taught me.
Kyou [kyou_nagisa_distrust]*: The last time I got caugt up in one of her charms was... interesting. I'll listen but this had better not be a trick or anything.

KYOU STRIPPING SHIRT (major):
Nagisa [nagisa_kyou_miyazawa_shirt]*: For Miyazawa's charm to work, the first thing you need to do is take off your shirt. I'm sorry, but I'm sure it'll be worth it in the end!
Kyou [kyou_nagisa_trick]*: This is a trick isn't it... You can't wait until I'm in the middle of taking my shirt off to spring it on me.

KYOU STRIPPED SHIRT (major):
Nagisa [nagisa_kyou_miyazawa_magic_words]*: It's not a trick, I don't think... Now you have to say "Ritafuni Kousoku Iita" three times.

DUE TO POSITION DETECTION, CONVERSATIONS ABOVE AND BELOW THIS LINE WON'T PLAY IN THE SAME GAME.

If Kyou to left and Nagisa to right:

NAGISA MUST STRIP SHOES:
Kyou [kyou_nagisa_comfort_zone]*: So, Nagisa, What on earth made you confident enough to try out a game like this? I'd never have pictured you doing something this far out of your comfort zone.
Nagisa [nagisa_kyou_motivation]*: Um, well, you know how Sakagami played against all of the sporting teams and got really popular? I was thinking maybe I should be a little bit more outgoing too. I'm not really good at sports, and I don't really want the whole school watching me, so...

NAGISA STRIPPING SHOES (accessory):
Kyou [kyou_nagisa_small_crowd]*: Starting off with a small crowd, huh? Well, I hope that we don't make you too uncomfortable. I know everyone here will be glad to see you come out of your shell.
Nagisa [nagisa_kyou_shell]*: Just, um, don't de-shell me too quickly, okay?

NAGISA STRIPPED SHOES (accessory):
Kyou [kyou_nagisa_time]*: Oh, don't worry, Nagisa... I plan on taking my time with you. 
Nagisa [nagisa_kyou_worried]*: Ah, but the way you said that makes me worry even more!


NAGISA MUST STRIP SOCKS:
Kyou [kyou_nagisa_bolder]*: Nagisa, if you want to be a bit more outgoing you should be a little bolder than that... How about getting rid of the skirt now?
Nagisa [nagisa_kyou_warm_up]*: W-What?! No, I just couldn't! You have to let me warm up first... I can't just dive straight in!

NAGISA STRIPPING SOCKS (minor):
Kyou [kyou_nagisa_off_the_hook]*: Alright, I'll let you off the hook this round... But I'll be expecting something more revealing next time.
Nagisa [nagisa_kyou_doing_my_best]*: Please don't get your hopes up! I'm doing the best I can...

NAGISA STRIPPED SOCKS (minor):
Kyou [kyou_nagisa_teasing]*: Aww... I'm just teasing you a little, Nagisa. You can take your time... for now, at least.
Nagisa [nagisa_kyou_playing_fair]*: I won't take too long, I promise. I'll play fair when it's my turn.


NAGISA MUST STRIP JACKET:
Kyou [kyou_nagisa_comfortable]*: How are you holding up, Nagisa? Getting a little more comfortable by now?
Nagisa [nagisa_kyou_curtain_up]*: I feel like a curtain's about to go up and the whole audience is about to see me. If anything, I'm getting <i>more</i> nervous!

NAGISA STRIPPING JACKET (accessory):
Kyou [kyou_nagisa_breathe]*: Just remember to breathe, okay? Once you relax a little you'll be fine.
Nagisa [nagisa_kyou_downer]*: I know I'm not very pretty, especially not compard to... anyone, really. So please understand that when I have to go further, I'll probably disappoint everyone.

NAGISA STRIPPED JACKET (accessory):
Kyou [kyou_nagisa_confidence]*: Stop being so down on yourself, Nagisa. You're one of the cutest girls in the school... You just need to be more confident.
Nagisa [kyou_nagisa_staying_strong]*: You're right. Even if most people never even notice me, I have to stay strong for my friends like you, Kyou!


NAGISA MUST STRIP SHIRT:
Kyou [kyou_nagisa_play]*: This will be a big step, Nagisa. Would it help to pretend you're in a play and about to begin the final act?
Nagisa [nagisa_kyou_play_pretend]*: I-I can do that! What kind of play should I pretend it is?

NAGISA STRIPPING SHIRT (major):
Kyou [kyou_nagisa_romantic]*: Hmm... How about a romantic play and you've just confessed your undying love for the main character?
Nagisa [nagisa_kyou_naughty_girl]*: Oh! But why would I be talking my shirt off right after I confessed? Is my character... is she just naughty like that?

NAGISA STRIPPED SHIRT (major):
Kyou [kyou_nagisa_very_naughty_girl]*: Yes, she is a very naughty girl... She can't help but show off and be extremely confident in her body.
Nagisa [nagisa_kyou_naughty_play]*: *ahem*<br>K-Kiss me, lover. Embrace my sensual... um... tummy. Hold my hands all night long!

NAGISA HAND AFTER STRIPPED SHIRT:
Kyou [kyou_nagisa_aftermath]*: That was certainly something, Nagisa. I'm glad it helped with your confidence... But maybe you need to work on your romantic talk a little bit.
Nagisa [nagisa_kyou_play_aftermath]*: I tried to imagine how she was feeling inside and convey that in my performance, but I probably went too far...


NAGISA MUST STRIP SKIRT: (conditional on previous case)
Kyou [kyou_nagisa_next]*: You should continue where you left off, Nagisa... What happens next to our infatuated heroine?
Nagisa [nagisa_kyou_the_next_level]*: She, um.... She wants to take her relationship with the main character to the next level...

NAGISA STRIPPING SKIRT (major):
Kyou [kyou_nagisa_shy]*: Come on, don't be shy... How does she plan to go further?
Nagisa [nagisa_kyou_naughty_play_2]*: Um, she says...<br>I can't love anyone but you. Let me be your wife, pretty please. Run your hands all over my... my... underwear.

KYOU MUST STRIP SHOES:
Kyou [kyou_nagisa_invite_ryou]*: I was thinking of inviting my sister Ryou along today... But she is incredibly shy, so I figured it would just freak her out.
Nagisa [nagisa_kyou_nice_sister]*: You're a such nice sister to think of Ryou's feelings like that. Is Ryou at home today? I'm sure she's cheering you on from there.

KYOU STRIPPING SHOES (accessory):
Kyou [kyou_nagisa_ryou_fortune]*: I couldn't imagine telling her where I was going to~background.time~. I did ask her for a prediction before I left. Although you know how her fortune telling usually goes...
Nagisa [nagisa_kyou_ryou_prediction]*: What did she predict for you this time, Kyou?

KYOU STRIPPED SHOES (accessory):
Kyou [kyou_nagisa_scared]*: She said I was going to have a day of intense personal growth... I have no idea what that means, and to be honest, it kinda scares me.
Nagisa [nagisa_kyou_intense_growth]*: That's what I'd like to do too... but I hope it's not <i>too</i> intense...


KYOU MUST STRIP JACKET:
Kyou [kyou_nagisa_bad_uniform]*: Ugh, I lost again? Well, at least I can get rid of this blazer... Honestly, Our school has the most uncomfortable clothes. Don't you agree, Nagisa?
Nagisa [nagisa_kyou_uniform_design]*: Um, haha, well... I'm sure the founders who picked our uniforms all tried their best!

KYOU STRIPPING JACKET: (minor):
Kyou [kyou_nagisa_kindheart]*: Come on, Nagisa... I know you're kind-hearted but you're allowed to throw out the odd insult here and there. But I suppose that's just how you are.
Nagisa [nagisa_kyou_blazer]*: I'm always happy to have my blazer when it snows, but on warm days before we change into our summer uniforms... sometimes I overheat a little. I don't want to complain, though. I can endure it.

KYOU STRIPPED JACKET: (minor):
Kyou [kyou_nagisa_summer]*: Good point... The summer uniforms are a lot better. I can't wait for it to be summer again.
Nagisa [nagisa_kyou_beach]*: Maybe we could all go to the beach this year.


KYOU MUST STRIP SOCKS:
Kyou [kyou_nagisa_botan]*: Oh, I just remembered. Nagisa, you didn't happen to find Botan on your way over did you? He's run off again and I'm a little worried.
Nagisa [nagisa_kyou_botan]*: Your pet baby boar? No, I'm sorry. I haven't seen him today. But I'm sure he'll turn up!

KYOU STRIPPING SOCKS (minor):
Kyou [kyou_nagisa_bakers]*: I'm a little worried about him... There's some crazy baker going around trying to catch him for some reason.
Nagisa [nagisa_kyou_disavow]*: Oh no! I... I'm sure I don't know anything about that!

KYOU STRIPPED SOCKS (minor):
Kyou [kyou_nagisa_sus]*: Nagisa, you're a terrible liar... You better not be in kahoots with this baker.
Nagisa [nagisa_kyou_botan_flowers]*: <i>(I hope Botan didn't eat dad's flowers again!)</i>


KYOU MUST STRIP SKIRT:
Kyou [kyou_nagisa_distracted]*: Ok, next item for me is my... Oh, my skirt already? I guess I've gotten a little distracted.
Nagisa [nagisa_kyou_talkative]*: I can't blame you. Everybody is so talkative to~background.time~!

KYOU STRIPPING SKIRT (major):
Kyou [kyou_nagisa_flies]*: Hehe, time flies when you're having fun, I haven't even noticed how quickly it's gone. Sorry if I'm talking a bit <i>too</i> much.
Nagisa [nagisa_kyou_nervous_too]*: Are you nervous too, Kyou? I always talk more when I'm nervous.

KYOU STRIPPED SKIRT (major):
Kyou [kyou_nagisa_nervous]*: I won't lie, I'm starting to feel a little warm... Even the most confident of us can get a little flustered.
Nagisa [nagisa_kyou_hot_inside]*: I know what you mean. Even though we're like this, I feel so hot inside that I must be like an oven. But we can still lean on each other for support, right? -- Nagisa means inside herself


KYOU MUST STRIP SHIRT:
Kyou [kyou_nagisa_???????]*: You know, I work hard on maintaining this figure... But what's the point if I never get to show it off? Nagisa, you know what I'm talking about, right?
Nagisa [nagisa_kyou_show_off]*: M-Me? I think sometimes it's okay to be pretty in a private area that no one will know about... But if you have to show off, wearing a two-piece swimsuit is something that bold girls can do.

If Nagisa to left and Jim Raynor to right:

NAGISA MUST STRIP SHOES:
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_where_do_i_start]*: Ah! It's my turn! Um, what do I do? Where do I start?
Jim Raynor []: Settle down there, boss. You've got your shoes, right? You can still stay well ahead even after takin' those off. -- Figured this would be a good way to assure her she's still a long ways away from being stripped down. I also think Jim deciding to call her "boss" is cute.

NAGISA STRIPPING SHOES (accessory):
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_all_new]*: Oh, right, my shoes. Sorry if I get a little flustered. This is all new to me.
Jim Raynor []: No worries. It's a first time for me as well... the strippin' part, anyway.

NAGISA STRIPPED SHOES (accessory):
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_first_timers]*: Is that so? Let's all have our first times together then, 'kay!
Jim Raynor []: Er... well, whatever you say, Boss. Let's make it count!


NAGISA MUST STRIP SOCKS:
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_plain_girl]*: Oh, it's me? I hope plain socks from a plain girl are enough. That's all I really have to offer. -- I'm pair this with a happy pose so that it's not TOO depressing and self-depricating!
Jim Raynor []: Well, speakin' as a plain fellow myself, I got no objections if anyone else does. -- I imagine she'll probably see an obvious disagreement here, which will likely lead to Jimmy rebuting her calling herself plain too.

NAGISA STRIPPING SOCKS (minor):
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_beard]*: You have a beard, Mr. Raynor, and that makes you look distinguished. But I'm not very noticible. That's okay! I'm used to it anyway.
Jim Raynor []: Come on, don't undersell yourself like that, boss. I bet there's plenty of guys back where you're from who have you runnin' in their heads.

NAGISA STRIPPED SOCKS (minor):
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_not_noticed]*: D-Do you really think so?! I'm not smart or pretty or funny... so boys don't normally talk to me much...
Jim Raynor []: Well, maybe they just don't know how to approach you. Nothin' stops guys in their tracks quite like a striking young woman.


NAGISA MUST STRIP JACKET:
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_flushed]*: I'm starting to feel flushed. Does anyone mind if I take my jacket off?
Jim Raynor []: Well, it's a pretty natural choice, ain't it? Don't think anyone minds, especially if you're still a bit nervous about this.

NAGISA STRIPPING JACKET (accessory):
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_feeling_judged]*: You don't think anybody would think badly of of us just because of how we chose to play, do you?
Jim Raynor []: Hey, anyone who tries raisin' a quarrel with you about that is gonna have to deal with me first; and I don't think they want that.

NAGISA STRIPPED JACKET (accessory):
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_reliable]*: You seem like a very reliable person, Mr. Raynor. You're right, I don't think anyone would dare to judge us while you're around.
Jim Raynor []: Hope not. Didn't come here to throw down, but I'm willin' to make an exception for anyone who wants to mess with you.


NAGISA MUST STRIP SHIRT:
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_man_just_met]*: Um, I feel kind of weird about taking off my ~shirt~ in front of ~player.ifMale(guys|a man)~ I just met. Mr Raynor~player.ifMale( and ~player~|)~, you're not going to watch, are you?
Jim Raynor []: Oh, shoot, hadn't thought of that. I hope you'd at least prepared for the possibility this would happen, right?

NAGISA STRIPPING SHIRT (major):
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_close_your_eyes]*: I know you'll all see me after, but if you'd just close your eyes while I actually undress... that would mean a lot to me.
Jim Raynor []: Alright, boss; you have my word I won't look. And I think it'd be best if you gave your word too, ~player~.

NAGISA STRIPPED SHIRT (major):
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_selfish]*: Okay, I'm finished. You can look now. Sorry for making such a selfish request. Next time I'll try to be a little braver.
Jim Raynor []: It's all good - if there's anything we can do to help you get more comfy with it, just say the word.


NAGISA MUST STRIP SKIRT:
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_seen_it_before]*: This is all totally normal to everyone else, right? Right? I shouldn't be nervous at all because I'm sure you've all seen a woman take off her skirt before. Um, a teenage woman. Me, I mean. Not that you've seen <i>me</i> do this...
Jim Raynor []: You don't have anything to fear from us, boss - but like I said, we're willin' to help if you still ain't certain.

NAGISA STRIPPING SKIRT (major):
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_zip_stuck]*: I think the zip's stuck... Ah, thanks for offering to help, but please let me try first!
Jim Raynor []: Oof, hell of a moment for it to get stuck. Maybe it's loose enough to pull it down now?

NAGISA STRIPPED SKIRT (major):
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_do_a_twirl]*: Oh no! The zipper broke. But, um, here I am. Sh-should I be doing a twirl or something? I don't really know what a man would like to see.
Jim Raynor []: Ah, well, I wouldn't worry too much about that.


NAGISA MUST STRIP BRA:
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_forthcoming_boobies]*: Oh... I haven't shown anyone before. Um, my, um... boobies. So I'm sorry if they're weird or something. -- Trying for a balance here between being shy about the reveal in front of an older guy but also not so embarrassed that it's uncomfortable to read.

RAYNOR MUST STRIP GLOVES:
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_hello]*: H-Hello. My name is Nagisa Furukawa. It's nice to meet you, mister.
Jim Raynor []: Well, it's nice to meet you too, Miss Furukawa. Don't take this the wrong way, but you weren't exactly the type I figured I'd see at a place like this. -- Figured this would be a good way of getting her to open up early about who she is, and I think it's more interesting than having Jim just introduce himself in response.

RAYNOR STRIPPING GLOVES (accessory):
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_age_here]*: I wasn't sure who I'd meet when I came here. I thought it might all be people my age, but at least no one from my school is here.
    OR [nagisa_jim_age_here]*: I wasn't sure who I'd meet when I came here. I thought it might all be people my age, but at least only one other person from my school is here. -- if Kyou or Sanako playing
    OR [nagisa_jim_age_here]*: I wasn't sure who I'd meet when I came here. I thought it might all be people my age, but at least not <i>everyone</i> here is from my school. -- if both Kyou and Sanako playing
Jim Raynor []: Yeah... though, if any of them showed up, wouldn't that kinda put both of you in the same boat?
    OR (if Kyou or Sanako is also there): True, but it might also be a bit more relaxing to have a familiar face here... 'long as this doesn't make things awkward when you get back.

RAYNOR STRIPPED GLOVES (accessory):
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_baseball]*: Do you play baseball. I mean... you don't know my dad, do you? Akio Furukawa?
Jim Raynor: Heh, sorry to say, but nope. Demolition's the only sport I've really played, boss.


RAYNOR MUST STRIP BANDOLIER:
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_what_year]*: Mr. Raynor, I hope this isn't rude of me to ask, but what year were you born in? -- Wanted to ask how old he was to highlight the age gap better, but I thought it's funnier if he answers in Starcraft years
Jim Raynor []: I was born in 2470, boss. Probably not a year that means much to you, does it?

RAYNOR STRIPPING BANDOLIER (accessory):
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_wrong_age]*: It's ~Month~ 2004 now, so that would make you, um.... thirty-four? Wait, 2470? Huh?!
Jim Raynor []: Sorry, forgot about the whole "different worlds" nature of this place for a moment... I am thirty-four, though; nothin' incorrect there.

RAYNOR STRIPPED BANDOLIER (accessory):
Nagisa []*: Haha, okay, as long as the result is right! So thirty-four? I was seventeen last year, so that's twice as old as I was then.
Jim Raynor []: Eighteen, huh... now that I think about it, there's a lot more folks around that age here than I expected.


RAYNOR MUST STRIP BELT & HOLSTER:
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_dont_be_mad]*: Mr. Raynor, you lost that one. Please don't be mad...
Jim Raynor []: Mad? Wait... is there a reason you've been glancin' at my gun like that?

RAYNOR STRIPPING BELT & HOLSTER (accessory):
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_real_firearm]*: N-No! I defintely wasn't looking at your gun! Or, well, it's just... I don't think I've ever seen a real firearm before. Except on TV.
Jim Raynor []: Well, I promise you I ain't some crazy TV gangster type, boss. If I was, I don't think they'd have let me in with my gun in the first place.

RAYNOR STRIPPED BELT & HOLSTER (accessory):
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_yakuza]*: You mean... you're <i>not</i> with the yakuza? I jusr figured with those dragon tattoos...
Jim Raynor []: Yakuza? Oh yeah, that was a term for organized crime back on Old Earth, right? Well don't worry - I don't like 'em any more than you.


RAYNOR MUST STRIP BOOTS:
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_are_you_married]*: If you don't mind me asking, are you married, Mr. Raynor?
Jim Raynor []: Well... no. I was once, but not anymore.

RAYNOR STRIPPING BOOTS (minor):
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_sorry_for_prying]*: Oh, I'm sorry. I just had a question about, um... married people things. I didn't mean to pry.
Jim Raynor []: Huh. Well, if it's just a general question, then I'd be willing to answer.

RAYNOR STRIPPED BOOTS (minor):
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_finding_a_soulmate]*: It's just... do you think there's such thing as a soulmate? I don't know if I'll ever find anyone special, but you did you find someone like that for you?
Jim Raynor []: ...Truth be told, I don't know. I'd thought I found mine before, but after what happened, I ain't so confident no more. -- Is this a satisfying enough answer to end this stage on? I'm not sure - unless you want to continue the conversation into the next stage as well.


RAYNOR MUST STRIP SOCKS:
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_made_sad]*: I don't know if this is a good time to say this, but sorry that I made you sad earlier, Mr. Raynor. I wasn't trying to.
Jim Raynor []: It's alright, boss. I came to terms with it a while ago, and I can't let it bother me no more.

RAYNOR STRIPPING SOCKS (minor):
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_her_loss]*: If she didn't appreciate you, it's her loss! I'm sure you'd be a very nice husband for any lady your age. You deserve someone who is right for you.
Jim Raynor []: Thanks. I'd like to hope the same - even if I can't help but wonder if that chance has already passed me by.

RAYNOR STRIPPED SOCKS (minor):
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_not_too_old]*: You're not too old to find love, Mr. Raynor. That's what my mom would say. Because even though they've been married for years, my dad is always having to chase away customers who try to flirt with my mom.
Jim Raynor []: ...Heh, well, if you still believe in me, boss, then I guess that's as good a reason as any to hold out hope. -- What he's saying here is that he's going to hold out more hope if she believes there's still a chance for him - have I communicated that well enough? -- Arndress replies: Yes, now that you've revised this line, I think it communicates this idea better.


RAYNOR MUST STRIP SHIRT:
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_work_out]*: Mr. Raynor, do you work out a lot?
Jim Raynor []: Sure do, boss. When fightin' in the Koprulu sector, it pays to stay in the best shape of your life.

RAYNOR STRIPPING SHIRT (revealing chest):

DUE TO POSITION DETECTION, CONVERSATIONS ABOVE AND BELOW THIS LINE WON'T PLAY IN THE SAME GAME.
---

If Jim Raynor to left and Nagisa to right:

NAGISA MUST STRIP SHOES:
Jim Raynor []: You're pretty soft-spoken, aren't you, boss? Don't usually find folks like you at this kinda place - not that anyone minds, I'm sure. -- Similar to the previous line, though since Jim's starting here I thought it'd help if he phrased it more passively, since they haven't even made introductions yet and he doesn't want to intimidate her.
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_allowed_to_be_here]*: I'm definitely allowed to be here... They checked my ID at the door three times.

NAGISA STRIPPING SHOES (accessory):
Jim Raynor []: Hey, I ain't accusin' you of breaking the rules or anything. It's just that strip poker and that sort of quiet demeanor don't usually go hand-in-hand.
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_oh]*: Oh... -- I thought I'd play into the quiet demeanor a little more this way.

NAGISA STRIPPED SHOES (accessory):
Jim Raynor []: Well, I don't think anyone here's got a problem with it either way, boss. Variety's the spice of life, right?
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_conversation]*: I hope so. I don't have a lot of experience, so I might not be able to add much to the conversation, but I'll try.


NAGISA MUST STRIP SOCKS:
Jim Raynor []: Gotten a good look around this place yet? I'm still pretty amazed by all the different types of folks here.
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_perfect_place]*: When I heard the game as going to be played at the ~background~, I was pretty surprised. But actually, this is the perfect place to get all kinds of people together from different places! -- I might make a few special cases for this line where the phrasing doesn't work with the variable, but I'll use the same marker. Background names where does doesn't work great: "The Inventory", "Classic", "Night".

NAGISA STRIPPING SOCKS (minor):
Jim Raynor []: You said it, boss. I've been to a whole lotta different places, but none with a crowd quite as colorful as this.
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_too_many_people]*: Do you think maybe we have too many people to~background.time~? Oh, I don't mean anyone should leave! I just thought it might be easier if one or two less people were here...

NAGISA STRIPPED SOCKS (minor):
Jim Raynor []: Well, I ain't typically one for crowds, but I'm not gonna turn away people lookin' to have a good time either. The more the merrier, right?
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_dango_happy]*: Yeah, you're right! That's why the Big Dango Family are always so happy, now that I think about it!


NAGISA MUST STRIP JACKET:
Jim Raynor []: So what's this "Big Dango Family" you mentioned, boss? The name's got a bit of a crime group sound to it, but <i>that</i> can't be right.
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_big_dango_crime_family]*: No, no, no, they're not a crime family! They aren't, right? Wait, what if the Big Dango Family are just a front for the yakuza?! It's the perfect cover.

NAGISA STRIPPING JACKET (accessory):
Jim Raynor []: I mean, you sound like you know this family well, don't you? I have a hard time imagining a crime group tryin' to get close to a sweetheart like you.
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_miyazawa]*: You might be surprised! My friend Miyazawa in the library reference room is like a mom to all the gang members who climb in through the windows.

NAGISA STRIPPED JACKET (accessory):
Jim Raynor []: Well, best I can suggest is make sure you stay away from anything shady. I'd hate to imagine what this Dango Family's capable of if they really are crooked.
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_dango_shady]*: I'm in too deep! I'll have to protect the Big Dango Family's secret, no matter the cost!

NAGISA HAND AFTER STRIPPED JACKET:
Jim Raynor []: Gang members climbin' through windows, you said... Does that happen often at this school of yours?
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_at_lunch]*: Not all the time! Usually just at lunch and after school.


NAGISA MUST STRIP SHIRT:
Jim Raynor []: Your friend, Miyazawa - you mentioned she's like a mom? She the school's librarian? -- Regardless of whether she is the librarian or just a friend of Nagisa (being unfamiliar with Clannad myself), I thought it could be a neat segue for Jim to talk about a couple of his own school experiences from back in the day
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_charms]*: Miyazawa's a helper in the reference room. She also likes to help the students with magical charms. I'm not sure if I believe in that kind of stuff myself, but I could sure use one about now...

NAGISA STRIPPING SHIRT (major):
Jim Raynor []: Sure never had a classmate doin' something like that where I grew up. Knew a couple boys who brought rat skulls for good luck, but the faculty didn't like 'em being displayed like that. -- Wasn't sure how to focus on the matter of Nagisa losing her shirt like I did with the left-right situation. If you want to do that again here I can change it, but this current line also offers the avenue of showing how different the world Jim grew up on is from Nagisa's.
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_good_luck]*: D-Did it work? Did it bring them good luck? -- I figure Nagisa is trying to distract herself here by going on talking. I think this is more interesting that focusing on her clothes or her embarrassment. Plus even she might be willing to display a rat skull if it meant good luck in this situation!

NAGISA STRIPPED SHIRT (major):
Jim Raynor []: Well, considering the stuff they pulled and seemed to get away with whenever they had 'em... then again, maybe it's just because they were more distracting. -- That's actually what I had in mind with lines like this - Jim essentially trying to ease her into the stripping aspect of the game by focusing her mind elsewhere. I did the same thing with the Komi-san interactions as well.
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_lucky_skull]*: If the rats helped them believe in themselves, it sounds like it worked! But maybe there's something better for girls that's not a rat's skull...


NAGISA MUST STRIP SKIRT AND WEARING DEFAULT OUTFIT:
Jim Raynor []: If you don't mind me askin', why does your school make you wear uniforms anyway? Back on Shiloh, they didn't care too much how we dressed 'long as we got our work done right.
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_school_reputation]*: But how did you promote the reputation of the school, Mr. Raynor? Not that I'm... well... I'm probably not giving my school a very good reputation right now...

NAGISA STRIPPING SKIRT (major) AND WEARING DEFAULT OUTFIT:
Jim Raynor []: Truth be told, I never really thought about that much. Though I guess our teams in sports like Demolition probably helped with that. -- Possible opportunity for Nagisa to ask what Demolition actually is
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_demolition]*: Sorry, I'm just having a little trouble getting this off. Um, maybe you could tell us how to play Demolition while I get my zip unstuck...

NAGISA STRIPPED SKIRT (major) AND WEARING DEFAULT OUTFIT:
Jim Raynor []: Heh, Demolition's the best sport ever, boss. Folks drive around in weaponized hot rods tryin' to blow each other up - and advanced safety measures means almost no one gets hurt in it.
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_safe_environment]*: If they're going to take risks, I'm glad they're doing it somewhere where they can feel safe and accepted and where nobody will laugh at them for losing...


NAGISA MUST STRIP BRA:
Jim Raynor []: Well... how are you feelin', boss? Still nervous? -- By this point, Jim probably will have a harder time finding words, knowing how young and comparatively innocent she is in such a situation, but still wanting to make sure she's doing alright.
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_girls_chests]*: Y-Yeah... I overheard some girls in my class say that boys like to see girls' chests no matter what they look like... I hope that's true, but I don't think I could handle it if people just wanted to make fun... -- let me know if this is too heavy and I can adjust

RAYNOR MUST STRIP GLOVES:
Jim Raynor []: Think I'll go with my gloves first. Sorry if it ain't the most excitin' choice just yet. -- Kinda in contrast to Nagisa's earlier "must strip" line, where he's a lot more confident and casual out of the gate. Something she might see as interesting or even admirable?
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_serious_player]*: It might not be exciting, but it makes a lot of sense. I could learn a lot from a serious player like you. -- Nagisa is presuming that Mr Raynor is serious, but she doesn't really have much to base that on right now.

RAYNOR STRIPPING GLOVES (accessory):
Jim Raynor []: Well, I woudn't call myself a <i>serious</i> poker player or the like, boss. Hell, the strip poker scene's actually pretty new to me still.
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_prepared]: Even so, you came prepared. You seem like a very capable person.

RAYNOR STRIPPED GLOVES (accessory):
Jim Raynor []: Heh, thanks; I certainly try. Still, I've got a feelin' underestimating you would be a mistake - especially for yourself.
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_do_our_best]*: I haven't practised much, so I might not be much of a challenge, but let's both do our best!


RAYNOR MUST STRIP BANDOLIER:
Jim Raynor []: Lotta good lookers around here tonight, huh, boss? Almost makes me feel bad I didn't come here wearing somethin' better.
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_professional]*: You didn't need to dress up in a suit or anything, Mr. Raynor. You look very, um, professional!

RAYNOR STRIPPING BANDOLIER (accessory):
Jim Raynor []: Professional? Heh, if there's an upper-class profession out there that just requires a plain t-shirt and jeans, I'd sure like to know it.
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_motorcyclist]*: I thought you were a professional... motorcyclist? I'm not sure, but you seem like a hard worker!

RAYNOR STRIPPED BANDOLIER (accessory):
Jim Raynor []: Hah! Don't I wish? You're right about workin' hard, though - I'm proud to say I've had a strong work ethic ever since I was just a farmboy.
Nagisa [naigsa_jim_farmboy]*: I'm having trouble imagining you as a farmboy! What did you used to farm?

RAYNOR HAND AFTER STRIPPED BANDOLIER:
Jim Raynor []: Hell, we farmed just about anything you can imagine, boss. Grain, fruits, vegetables, and a whole lotta livestock.
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_farmgirl]*: That sounds like fun! Maybe if I was a farmer, I'd have big muscles too. Not as big as a man's muscles, of course. I'm not really sure how what kind of muscles a farmgirl can get.


RAYNOR MUST STRIP BELT & HOLSTER:
Jim Raynor []: You know, you shouldn't write off farmgirls that easily, boss. I've seen plenty of girls who got pretty jacked - enough to rival some men I know. --Though this might potentially lead to a funny bit where Nagisa gets a mental image of herself with big muscles
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_jacked]*: Wow! Do you think I could get "jacked" like you, Mr Raynor? But I would probably have to buy bigger dresses if my arms got really bulky like that...

RAYNOR STRIPPING BELT & HOLSTER (accessory):
Jim Raynor []: I've seen plenty of girls not far from your age manage it. 'Sides, it could even give you a whole new kinda look, right?
        OR []: Thinkin' about getting bulked up now? Honestly, if you managed it, I'd be willin' to buy you the first new dress you need. -- Had two different ideas for this, go with whichever you like best
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_inspired_to_bulk_up]*: Wow, really?! I think you've inspired me. I bet you can open any jar you want! -- I love both of your lines here, so I tried to write a line that answered both of them at once. She is inspired by different things, but the end result is the same.

RAYNOR STRIPPED BELT & HOLSTER (accessory):
Jim Raynor []: Heh heh, that's true, boss. In a few months, you could be the terror of every lid you can imagine.
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_groceries]*: And I could carry all of the groceries into the house in one trip!

RAYNOR HAND AFTER STRIPPED BANDOLIER:
Jim Raynor []: If you're seriously thinkin' about bulking up, there's a whole ton of places you could start. Your school probably has some fitness clubs or sports, right?
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_judo_club]*: Maybe I could ask the judo club for some tips. Thanks, Mr. Raynor!


RAYNOR MUST STRIP BOOTS:
Jim Raynor []: You know, folks back on Shiloh always loved to brag about how hardy we were compared to most other colonies. Wasn't sure myself how much of that was true and how much was just hot air.
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_hardy]*: Now that you've traveled, did you find out if it was true, Mr Raynor? Is everyone where your from like you? I get winded just doing the yearly physical exam...

RAYNOR STRIPPING BOOTS (minor):
Jim Raynor []: 'Round the Koprulu sector, I think lots of folks are tough in different ways. It pays to be, given how dangerous it can be... -- This could possibly lead to Nagisa wondering what it's like to live there if it's as dangerous as he says
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_visit]*: Is it too difficult to visit? It must be hard to invite new friends to see the town where you grew up.

RAYNOR STRIPPED BOOTS (minor):
Jim Raynor []: I think Koprulu ain't too bad 'long as you got someone to show you where to go and what to avoid. Though with the current war goin' on, I wouldn't recommend it now.
Nagisa []*: Oh, I'm so sorry! I didn't know there was a war happening in your home country. Now I understand why you all need to stay strong.


RAYNOR MUST STRIP SOCKS:
Jim Raynor []: Truth be told, boss, war and Koprulu are kinda inseperable. Feels like each war's just led into a new one the past few decades.
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_war_history]*: That's terrible. I never heard about this in History class, but I did miss a lot when I was home sick last winter.

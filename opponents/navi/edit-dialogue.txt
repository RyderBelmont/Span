#Items of clothing should be listed here in order of removal.
#The values are formal name, lower case name, how much they cover, what they cover
#Please do not put spaces around the commas.
#"Important" clothes cover genitals (lower) or chest/breasts (upper). For example: bras, panties, a skirt when going commando.
#"Major" clothes cover underwear. For example: skirts, pants, shirts, dresses.
#"Minor" clothes cover skin or are large pieces of clothing that do not cover skin. For example: jackets, socks, stockings, gloves.
#"Extra" clothes are small items that may or may not be clothing but do not cover anything interesting. For example: jewelry, shoes or boots with socks underneath, belts, hats. In the rest of the code, "extra" clothes are called "accessory".
#If for some reason you write another word for the type of clothes (e.g. "accessory"), other characters will not react at all when the clothing is removed.
#What they cover = upper (upper body), lower (lower body), other (neither).
#The game can support any number of entries, but typically we use 2-8, with at least one "important" layer for upper and lower (each).

#Notes on dialogue
#All lines that start with a # symbol are comments and will be ignored by the tool that converts this file into a xml file for the game.
#Where more than one line has an identical type, like "swap_cards" and "swap_cards", the game will randomly select one of these lines each time the character is in that situation.
#You should try to include multiple lines for most stages, especially the final (finished) stage, -1. 

#A character goes through multiple stages as they undress. The stage number starts at zero and indicates how many layers they have removed. Special stage numbers are used when they are nude (-3), masturbating (-2), and finished (-1).
#Line types that start with a number will only display during that stage. The will override any numberless stage-generic lines. For example, in stage 4 "4-swap_cards" will be used over "swap_cards" if it is not blank here. Giving a character unique dialogue for each stage is an effective way of showing their changing openness/shyness as the game progresses.
#You can combine the above points and make multiple lines for a particular situation in a particular stage, like "4-swap_cards" and "4-swap_cards".

#Some special words can be used that will be substituted by the game for context-appropriate ones: ~name~ is the name of the character they're speaking to, but this only works if someone else is in focus. ~clothing~ is the type of clothing that is being removed by another player. ~Clothing~ is almost the same, but it starts with a capital letter in case you want to start a sentence with it.
#~name~ can be used any time a line targets an opponent (game_over_defeat, _must_strip, _removing_, _removed, _must_masturbate, etc).
#~clothing~ can be used only when clothing is being removed (_removing and _removed, but NOT _must_strip).
#~player~ can be used at any time and refers to the human player.
#~cards~ can be used only in the swap_cards lines.
#All wildcards can be used once per line only! If you use ~name~ twice, the code will show up the second time.

#Lines can be written that are only spoken when specific other characters are present. For a detailed explanation, read this guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/spnati/comments/6nhaj0/the_easy_way_to_write_targeted_lines/
#Here is an example line (note that targeted lines must have a stage number):
#0-female_must_strip,target:hermioine=happy,Looks like your magic doesn't help with poker!

-3-good_hand,alsoPlaying:vriska,notSaidMarker:talk0,marker:talk0=puzzled,Hey, Vriska, I don't want to 8e 8othersome, 8ut is your voice8ox 8roken or something?

-3-okay_hand=angry,Always make sure to pay attention to your cards!
-3-okay_hand=loss,Does anyone else hear that annoying beeping?
-3-okay_hand=interested,Remember that the ace is the highest card and that the numbers don't loop around for a straight.

-3-okay_hand,alsoPlaying:alice_mgq,alsoPlayingStage:2,notSaidMarker:flowers,marker:flowers=calm,I like the flowers in your hair, Alice. They remind me of home.

-3-okay_hand,alsoPlaying:chiaki,notSaidMarker:deathpeak,marker:deathpeak=puzzled,I wouldn't mind going to a place called Hope's Peak. It just seems like the opposite of Death Mountain.

1-stripped=stripped,I'll have to thank Midna later for teaching me this.
1-stripped=stripped,I'm having too much fun! Can't stop now!
1-stripped,saidMarker:ball=stripped,...to a completely new outfit!
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit,count-link:0=stripped,Actually, I learned this trick from Midna! I just didn't think it would help Link on his quest to have me this big!
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia=stripped,I'm glad you appreciate this form, Meia, but unfortunately, I'm a little bit smaller and <i>bluer</i> than the people back in Hyrule.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:natsuki=stripped,So nice of you to notice, Natsuki, but this small body is nearly overflowing with helpful advice!
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:ryuji=stripped,Ta da! No shadow creatures here, just a true-blue fairy!
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:sayaka=stripped,What do you think, Sayaka? Does this make me a magical girl too?
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:sayaka=stripped,I think a transformation is enough to call me a magical girl? How about you, Sayaka?
1-must_strip_winning=must_strip,Aww... I have to strip my <i>actual</i> clothing.
1-must_strip_winning=must_strip,At least I'm winning...

1-must_strip_losing,hasHand:One Pair=must_strip,I had a good hand too...
1-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:link=must_strip,Second to Link, once again...
1-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:link=must_strip,I really should have worn more clothes than Link did.
1-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:kyu=must_strip,Not one word... Kyu.
1-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:kyu=must_strip,I know we have our difference, but you couldn't take one for fairy kind, Kyu? For ~player~?
1-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:kyu=must_strip,B-but, Kyu... I'm in front of... ~player~...
1-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:kyu=must_strip,Don't enjoy this, Kyu. I know you will, though.
1-must_strip_losing,saidMarker:talk0,notSaidMarker:talk1,marker:talk1=must_strip,8eautiful! Now I have to strip and my voice is 8roken, too!
1-stripping=strip,No peeks, please...
1-stripping=strip,I wish I could just time skip this part.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit=strip,I think we both know <i>exactly</i> what Link would have to say...
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit=strip,It's not too hard to guess what <i>Link</i> has to say about things...
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:vriska=strip,Well... no transformations this time...
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:vriska=strip,Sorry to disappoint, Vriska, but my transformation only works once...

2-stripped,alsoPlaying:ryuji,alsoPlayingStage:1-9=stripped,Well, Ryuji, I did just get them <i>a few minutes ago...</i>
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:ryuji,alsoPlayingStage:1-9=stripped,Yeah, Ryuji... this is <i>all I have...</i>

2-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:natsuki=appreciative,I can't really describe this feeling too well. I usually use short, blunt words to get points across.

#OPPONENT MUST STRIP
#These lines are spoken when an opponent must strip, but the character does not yet know what they will take off.
#Writing different variations is important here, as these lines will be spoken about thirty times per game.
#The "human" versions of the lines will only be spoken if the human player is stripping.

#fully clothed
0-male_human_must_strip=happy,He he. You won't see me strip yet!
0-male_human_must_strip=angry,We're all waiting.
0-male_human_must_strip=cry,Maybe ~player~ <i>isn't</i> the chosen one after all.
0-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:ryuji,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:naviwho,notSaidMarker:navime,marker:navime=happy,Well, I'm Navi! Helpful fairy and advice giver extraordinaire!
0-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:sei,saidMarker:knight,notSaidMarker:knight1,marker:knight1=angry,Drat! I left in Link's pockets. Oh well, could I instead offer a mask or whatever ~player~ is about to take off?
0-male_must_strip=happy,Let's get going!
0-male_must_strip=calm,It's alright, ~name~. Sometimes it's luck, sometimes it's skill.
0-male_must_strip=puzzled,Do you need a tutorial on how to strip?
0-male_must_strip,alsoPlaying:pit=happy,<i>HEY!</i> Pit is a real talkative guy. Start engaging him in conversation and he'll have no time to look at his cards!
0-male_must_strip,alsoPlaying:link=calm,<i>HEY!</i> Link isn't going to be very vocal about how good his cards are, so you're going to have to study his body language.
0-male_must_strip,alsoPlaying:ryuji,notSaidMarker:navime,marker:navime=happy,Well, I'm Navi! Helpful fairy and advice giver extraordinaire!
0-male_must_strip,target:bi,targetStage:0=cry,<i>HEY!</i> Bi has to wake up every morning and see himself in the mirror. I don't know if you can weaken someone's spirit more than that does.
0-male_must_strip,target:ryuji,targetSaidMarker:naviwho,notSaidMarker:navime,marker:navime=happy,Well, I'm Navi! Helpful fairy and advice giver extraordinaire! But I think you have bigger problems at the moment...
0-male_must_strip,alsoPlaying:sei,saidMarker:knight,notSaidMarker:knight1,marker:knight1=horny,<i>HEY!</i> I just remembered I haven't reached that point in my adventure yet... so let's just forget about this and watch ~name~ strip.
0-female_human_must_strip=calm,We've been waiting, ~name~.
0-female_human_must_strip=shocked,Wow, ~name~, I can't believe someone talks less than Link!
0-female_human_must_strip=angry,Laziness. <i>WAKE UP!</i> You have a poker game you're trying to win!
0-female_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:sei,saidMarker:knight,notSaidMarker:knight1,marker:knight1=angry,Drat! I left in Link's pockets. Oh well, could I instead offer a mask or whatever ~player~ is about to take off?
0-female_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:ryuji,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:naviwho,notSaidMarker:navime,marker:navime=happy,Well, I'm Navi! Helpful fairy and advice giver extraordinaire!
0-female_must_strip=happy,Let's go, ~name~!
0-female_must_strip=shocked,Thank Din it's you, ~name~. I almost lost that round.
0-female_must_strip=calm,Maybe you aren't as lazy as I thought you were, ~player~.
0-female_must_strip,target:sei,saidMarker:knight,notSaidMarker:knight1,marker:knight1=cry,Maybe now's not the best time to mention this to you, ~name~. But I don't have the necessary items to proceed yet.
0-female_must_strip,target:clover,targetStage:0=calm,<i>HEY!</i> Clover has a <i>slight</i> temperament. Don't get her angry... unless you like winning.
0-female_must_strip,target:erufuda,targetStage:0=calm,<i>HEY!</i> Erufuda seems to have tried to lose a bit of wait. Unfortunately, she also kept her biggest weakness too, french fries.
0-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0=calm,<i>HEY!</i> Raven gets much worse at poker if you can get her emotions out of control. So better get your best insults ready!
0-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=horny,<i>HEY!</i> Chiaki is already one of the best gamers around, except when it comes to dating sims. Start making some moves on another player and watch her skill level plummet!
0-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:0=calm,<i>HEY!</i> It doesn't look like Felicia is wearing much of anything. You should be able to take her out with a few decent hands.
0-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=puzzled,<i>HEY!<i> Rinkah is the fiery woman from the flame tribe, but what would happen if that fiery spirit boiled over?
0-female_must_strip,target:cammy,targetStage:2-4=angry,There better not be more people coming, I'm running low on hearts!
0-female_must_strip,target:cammy,targetStage:2-4=cry,Here we go again...
0-female_must_strip,target:cammy,targetStage:2-4=calm,Everything looks fine for now, I think we're safe.
0-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=puzzled,I know you're a little busy now, Rinkah, but I was wondering how I could get to be as strong as you are.
0-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:ruby,alsoPlayingStage:0=horny,<i>HEY!</i> The members of RWBY may be good friends, but I'm sure they've never seen each other stripping. The more of them here, the more flustered they get.
0-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0=happy,<i>HEY!</i> Ruby is all about speed and fun. This also makes a big weakness when she gets excited and rushes her card swaps.
0-female_must_strip,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=happy,<i>HEY!</i> Beatrix is a sniper who lacks a left arm, so by casually throwing something at a close range, you could throw her off greatly!
0-female_must_strip,target:april,targetStage:0=puzzled,<i>HEY!</i> April is going to keep trying to get a scoop... of something. Keep her from getting that scoop and you might have an easier time beating her.
0-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:0=angry,<i>HEY!</i> Take the time to notice and compliment Amalia on her outfit. She might get a little bit <i>too</i> caught up in herself.
0-female_must_strip,target:sayori,targetStage:0=calm,<i>HEY!</i> It takes Sayori a while to get a grasp on things, so strike early while the iron's hot!
0-female_must_strip,target:alice_degracia,targetStage:0=calm,<i>HEY!</i> Alice's high amount of cuteness does make her tough to take down, but just keep your wits about you and you might be able to pull this one out.
0-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0=calm,<i>HEY!</i> Sei tends to throw back <i>a little</i> too much milk. Attack more the more she drinks!
0-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:0=happy,<i>HEY!</i> Aimee gets cockier when she cocks her weapon, use this to achieve victory!
0-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:0=happy,<i>HEY!</i> Aella might seem like an impenetrable mountain, but she's also a softy for her father and gets cold very easily. Just keep finding the chinks in her armor!
0-female_must_strip,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=calm,<i>HEY!</i> I don't think Shimakaze entirely gets the point of the game, so might as well take advantage of this.
0-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:0=calm,<i>HEY!</i> Vriska is perhaps the toughest opponent you could encounter in the inventory. Her incredible luck and shapeshifting outfit make taking her down an extreme challenge.
0-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0=happy,<i>HEY!</i> I wouldn't worry too much about Trainer being an obstacle. She's just here to help, like me!
0-female_must_strip,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:alice_mgq,alsoPlayingStage:0=calm,<i>HEY!</i> Alice may act all superior, but I'm sure if you get her down far enough, we'll see a different side of her.
0-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0,saidMarker:knight,notSaidMarker:knight1,marker:knight1=horny,<i>HEY!</i> I just remembered I haven't reached that point in my adventure yet... so let's just forget about this and watch ~name~ strip.
0-female_must_strip,target:cammy,targetStage:1=puzzled,I wonder if they locked the back door after I came down here?

#lost light
1-male_human_must_strip=appreciative,It's probably going to be hard to give you helpful hints, ~player~, but I'll sure try!
1-male_human_must_strip=shocked,Do you need me to remind you about which button it is, ~player~?
1-male_human_must_strip=angry,I suppose this is what you get for taking so long on your card swap.
1-male_human_must_strip=excited,C'mon, ~player~! I believe that you can do better than this!
1-male_human_must_strip,oppHand:One Pair=interested,It's alright, ~player~, sometimes you do everything right and it still doesn't work out.
1-male_human_must_strip,oppHand:One Pair=puzzled,Maybe next turn you should try for something riskier than just a pair?
1-male_human_must_strip,oppHand:One Pair=excited,<i>HEY!</i> You <i>LISTENED</i> to my advice! You still have to strip, though.
1-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:ryuji,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:naviwho,notSaidMarker:navime,marker:navime=happy,Well, I'm Navi! Helpful fairy and advice giver extraordinaire!

1-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu=angry,C'mon, ~player~! You lost to Kyu, who isn't even at a hard difficulty!
1-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu=excited,Try taking off something important, ~player~. It will distract Kyu and allow you to win!
1-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu=excited,Try to show as much skin as possible. It'll distract any and all perverted fairies in the area.
1-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu=embarrassed,Just don't let Kyu help you get your clothing off. Her hands are <i>very sticky</i> for some reason...
1-male_must_strip=excited,I'm getting excited already!
1-male_must_strip=interested,Don't worry, ~name~, you'll win next time!
1-male_must_strip=shy,Not bad, ~player~, not bad.
1-male_must_strip=angry,Alright, ~name~. No tricks.
1-male_must_strip,alsoPlaying:ryuji,notSaidMarker:navime,marker:navime=happy,Well, I'm Navi! Helpful fairy and advice giver extraordinaire!

1-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:5-9=cry,C'mon, Link! Just be quiet again, for old times' sake.
1-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:5-9=angry,Could you just stop playing poker for five seconds and talk to me! I want to keep my job!
1-male_must_strip,count-hero:1=excited,You're a hero, ~name~, show them why!
1-male_must_strip,count-hero:1=interested,To do this takes the kind of courage you only find in a true hero.
1-male_must_strip,count-hero:1=appreciative,Clothed or bare. I'm willing to stand by anyone who can prove themselves a hero.
1-male_must_strip,count-hero:1=shocked,Is this what you do between heroics, ~name~?
1-male_must_strip,count-hero:1=happy,This is just a setback, ~name~. Heroes always get back up.
1-male_must_strip,alsoPlaying:link=calm,<i>HEY!</i> Link isn't going to be very vocal about how good his cards are, so you're going to have to study his body language.

1-female_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu=appreciative,Don't worry about being a woman, ~player~, Kyu will still get distracted. She doesn't discriminate like that.
1-female_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu=angry,This isn't hero mode, ~player~! You should at least be able to beat the average to bad difficulty of Kyu.
1-female_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu=puzzled,If you want to see some epilogues you have to follow my advice. Who else is gonna help you like this? <i>Kyu?</i>
1-female_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu=appreciative,It'll be alright. <i>The best fairy in the game</i> has your back.
1-female_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu=embarrassed,Wow, ~player~. Kyu has the same look in her eyes that you get when one of us has to strip!
1-female_human_must_strip,oppHand:One Pair=interested,Sorry about this. A pair can usually last you through a round.
1-female_human_must_strip,oppHand:One Pair=shy,This must be an exception to a normally good pair strategy.
1-female_human_must_strip,oppHand:One Pair=puzzled,I guess it's time to get a little riskier!
1-female_must_strip=excited,I don't want to see you wimp out now, ~name~!
1-female_must_strip=interested,You could either go for the wise choice, the courageous choice or the powerful one.
1-female_must_strip=shy,I'm sorry if I'm not the best when talking with other women. I've only worked with Link and can you <i>imagine</i> if Link was a girl?

1-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=calm,<i>HEY!</i> Mahiru will always prefer a girl's night out, but if you want to throw her off, why not invite as many lovely men as you can?
1-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:0=happy,<i>HEY!</i> Aella might seem like an impenetrable mountain, but she's also a softy for her father and gets cold very easily. Just keep finding the chinks in her armor!
1-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:0=calm,<i>HEY!</i> Vriska is perhaps the toughest opponent you could encounter in the inventory. Her incredible luck and shapeshifting outfit make taking her down an extreme challenge.
1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0=calm,<i>HEY!</i> Ladybug is pretty good at this game, but she's not miraculous. Get her to start tripping over her words and you could have a chance to defeat her.
1-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,notSaidMarker:picture,marker:picture=interested,Y'know, Mahiru. I heard that fairies aren't really all that common where you're from...
1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=horny,<i>HEY!</i> Meia is a tough deku nut to crack, but she'll get a lot more expressive the lewder things get.
1-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0=happy,<i>HEY!</i> I wouldn't worry too much about Trainer being an obstacle. She's just here to help, like me!
1-female_must_strip,target:alpha,targetStage:4,notSaidMarker:roll,marker:roll=interested,Listen to the rippling rhythm of ~name~'s singing...
1-female_must_strip,target:mia,targetStage:0=calm,<i>HEY!</i> Mia tends to be thrown off when an injustice or deceptively sweet woman appears, try and exploit these weak points!
1-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:1=interested,No offense, ~name~, but I don't care that you're tall.
1-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:1=angry,I don't see what the big deal is about Aella's height.
1-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:1=interested,I guess Aella's tall, but I don't see what the big deal is.
1-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:2=interested,<i>HEY!</i> Aella. Do you go explore dungeons a lot?
1-female_must_strip,target:weiss,alsoPlaying:ruby=angry,Don't get all flustered now, your teammate's here!
1-female_must_strip,target:weiss,alsoPlaying:ruby=puzzled,You're blushing harder than I expected, ~name~. Is someone here making you a little more unsettled than usually.
1-female_must_strip,target:weiss,alsoPlaying:ruby=angry,Don't break composure now, ~name~. You're supposed to be the serious one.
1-female_must_strip,target:weiss,alsoPlaying:ruby=shocked,Ruby! Be prepared to catch ~name~ is she suddenly faints from embarrassment.
1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1-4=shocked,Oh no! Is she going to do the thing again?
1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1-4=cry,Get your shields out, everybody!
1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1-4=shy,I'd be relieved that I'm a small target, except that probably turns me into <i>a challenge</i> for her.
1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1-4=angry,<i>HEY!</i> Watch where you point that thing!
1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1-4=cry,She's gonna use that weird fire magic again!
1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1-4=cry,Here we go again!
1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1-4=cry,Shields at the ready, everybody!
1-female_must_strip,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:5=shy,Oh well, I guess Alice has to masturbate, sorry, there's nothing that can be done now.
1-female_must_strip,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:5=shy,It's a shame that you lost now, ~name~, but there's nothing that can be done about that.
1-female_must_strip,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:5=shy,Well it <i>looks</i> like ~name~ is all out of items, too bad you can't bring out anymore.
1-female_must_strip,target:ruby,alsoPlaying:weiss=interested,Well, you've got courage and power, ~name~. I suppose you could find a friend who could teach you to be a bit wiser.
1-female_must_strip,target:ruby,alsoPlaying:weiss=shocked,<i>HEY!</i> Maybe you're a little too anxious, ~name~. I mean, look over at how composed Weiss is.

1-female_must_strip,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=calm,<i>HEY!</i> I don't think Shimakaze entirely gets the point of the game, so might as well take advantage of this.
1-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=happy,<i>HEY!</i> Look out for when Mika turns around, it's the perfect time to strike with a good hand!
1-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0=happy,<i>HEY!</i> Ruby is all about speed and fun. This also makes a big weakness when she gets excited and rushes her card swaps.
1-female_must_strip,target:alice_degracia,targetStage:0=calm,<i>HEY!</i> Alice's high amount of cuteness does make her tough to take down, but just keep your wits about you and you might be able to pull this one out.

1-female_must_strip,target:nayru=excited,Show us your golden body, Golden Goddess!
1-female_must_strip,target:nayru=happy,I'm not sure if Link said this, but thanks for the magic spell you gave us back in Hyrule!
1-female_must_strip,target:nayru=shocked,You look different than last time, Nayru. But I'm sure that's just the power of a god.

1-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:1=interested,You know, I know a race of all women too.

1-female_must_strip,target:natsuki=calm,Consider this another learning experience, ~name~.
1-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:2=puzzled,The weird thing about the Gerudo is that they only have one man born every 100 years.

1-female_must_strip,target:moon=cry,Does ~name~ make anyone else incredibly uncomfortable?

1-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:socks,priority:500=angry,Stop lying about us fairies! I have a reputation here!
1-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:1=cry,That's a shame, ~name~. You don't seem to be wearing much in the way of accessories.
1-female_must_strip,target:marinette=interested,What are you going to take off, Ladybug? It doesn't look like you brought much aside from that mask and belt.

1-female_must_strip,target:akko=interested,I may not have the best experiences with witches, but this one might be too cute to strip.

1-female_must_strip,target:alice_mgq=interested,Maybe you should stop calling yourself a <i>monster</i> girl, I'm sure you're actually a nice person.

1-female_must_strip,target:zelda=appreciative,I'm always here if you need assistance, Zelda!
1-female_must_strip,target:zelda=interested,I'm sorry, ~player~, but the princess comes first.

1-female_must_strip,target:arwen=appreciative,Pointy ears... green outerwear... doesn't talk much... if it wasn't for <i>everything else</i> I might mistake you for <i>you know who.</i>
1-female_must_strip,target:arwen=excited,I'm going to need you to be more enthusiastic than that, ~name~. Try screaming <i>HEY!</i> at the top of your lungs!
1-female_must_strip,target:clover,targetStage:2=interested,Sorry, ~name~, you're trapped here with less than nine layers remaining.
1-female_must_strip,alsoPlaying:ryuji,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:naviwho,notSaidMarker:navime,marker:navime=happy,Well, I'm Navi! Helpful fairy and advice giver extraordinaire!
1-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1=interested,It's too bad you only brought clothes, Corrin. You should have brought your sword, too.
1-female_must_strip,target:clover,targetStage:3=interested,I feel like I could probably guess what you're going to strip now, like our minds are connected or something...
1-female_must_strip,saidMarker:talk0,notSaidMarker:talk1,marker:talk1=angry,8eautiful! Now, my voice is 8roken, too!
1-female_must_strip,target:clover,targetStage:0=interested,Does it make you feel nervous, ~name~? Like your stomach's gonna explode?
1-female_must_strip,filter:blue_hair,notSaidMarker:blue,marker:blue=interested,I hate to see someone else with blue hair lose, but rules are rules.
1-female_must_strip,filter:blue_hair,notSaidMarker:blue,marker:blue=appreciative,This may be a bad time to bring it up, but I really like your hair color, ~name~.
1-female_must_strip,filter:blue_hair,notSaidMarker:blue,marker:blue=shy,I hate to watch you lose. You don't see many blue haired people back in Hyrule.
1-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:chiaki,priority:500=interested,I don't think Kyu's the type of fairy you're looking for, unless your quest leads you into the bedroom.
1-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:chiaki,priority:500=appreciative,Nope, not Kyu! If I may direct your attention towards the superior quest-guiding fairy floating right over here.
1-female_must_strip,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:alice_mgq,alsoPlayingStage:0=calm,<i>HEY!</i> Alice may act all superior, but I'm sure if you get her down far enough, we'll see a different side of her.
1-female_must_strip,target:clover,targetStage:3=happy,You keep talking about a game, Clover. Is it a fun game?
1-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:ruby,alsoPlayingStage:0=horny,<i>HEY!</i> The members of RWBY may be good friends, but I'm sure they've never seen each other stripping. The more of them here, the more flustered they get.
1-female_must_strip,filter:long_hair=interested,You may lose your outfit, but you'll still have your pretty hair.
1-female_must_strip,filter:long_hair=puzzled,I wish I could have hair like that.
1-female_must_strip,filter:long_hair=shy,I would have long hair if I could, but the wings keep getting in the way.
1-female_must_strip,filter:long_hair=happy,If you want, I could make a slight breeze, so your long hair looks really pretty while you strip.
1-female_must_strip,filter:long_hair=interested,Please tell me you aren't wearing a wig that you'll strip off later.
1-female_must_strip,target:clover,targetStage:1=angry,Trying to beat, ~player~, who I'm helping to win this game, is as dim-witted as having your code name the same as your <i>real</i> name.
1-female_must_strip,count-cheerful:2=interested,C'mon, ~name~! Keep that upbeat attitude!
1-female_must_strip,count-cheerful:2=happy,Gotta keep that pep in your step... or float... or... You all get what I mean!
1-female_must_strip,count-cheerful:2=excited,You're doing great, ~name~. Keep it up!
1-female_must_strip,count-cheerful:2=happy,We'll have to cheer on whoever strips after you, ~name~.

2-male_human_must_strip=interested,Now <i>this</i> is a step in the right direction.
2-male_human_must_strip=excited,<i>HEY!</i> Try not to feel the burning sense of shame that's making your cheeks go red.
2-male_human_must_strip=embarrassed,It seems that ~player~ and I <i>both</i> are feeling a little heat.
2-male_human_must_strip,saidMarker:talk0,notSaidMarker:talk1,marker:talk1=angry,8eautiful! Now, my voice is 8roken, too!
2-male_human_must_strip,oppHand:One Pair=interested,It's alright, ~player~, sometimes you do everything right and it still doesn't work out.
2-male_human_must_strip,oppHand:One Pair=puzzled,Maybe next turn you should try for something riskier than just a pair?
2-male_human_must_strip,oppHand:One Pair=excited,<i>HEY!</i> You <i>LISTENED</i> to my advice! You still have to strip, though.
2-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu=angry,Come on, ~player~! My hints should be helping you out so much more than this!
2-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu=angry,C'mon, ~player~! You lost to Kyu, who isn't even at a hard difficulty!
2-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu=excited,Try taking off something important, ~player~. It will distract Kyu and allow you to win!
2-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu=excited,Try to show as much skin as possible. It'll distract any and all perverted fairies in the area.
2-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu=embarrassed,Just don't let Kyu help you get your clothing off. Her hands are <i>very sticky</i> for some reason...
2-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:ryuji,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:naviwho,notSaidMarker:navime,marker:navime=happy,Well, I'm Navi! Helpful fairy and advice giver extraordinaire!
2-male_must_strip=interested,We won't be needing a mystic lens this time.
2-male_must_strip=calm,May the courage of Farore be with you.
2-male_must_strip=shocked,Would you like a suggestion on what to strip?
2-male_must_strip,alsoPlaying:link=calm,<i>HEY!</i> Link isn't going to be very vocal about how good his cards are, so you're going to have to study his body language.
2-male_must_strip,saidMarker:talk0,notSaidMarker:talk1,marker:talk1=angry,8eautiful! Now, my voice is 8roken, too!
2-male_must_strip,target:ryuji,targetSaidMarker:naviwho,notSaidMarker:navime,marker:navime=happy,Well, I'm Navi! Helpful fairy and advice giver extraordinaire! But I think you have bigger problems at the moment...
2-male_must_strip,alsoPlaying:pit=happy,<i>HEY!</i> Pit is a real talkative guy. Start engaging him in conversation and he'll have no time to look at his cards!
2-male_must_strip,count-hero:1=excited,You're a hero, ~name~, show them why!
2-male_must_strip,count-hero:1=interested,To do this takes the kind of courage you only find in a true hero.
2-male_must_strip,count-hero:1=appreciative,Clothed or bare. I'm willing to stand by anyone who can prove themselves a hero.
2-male_must_strip,count-hero:1=shocked,Is this what you do between heroics, ~name~?
2-male_must_strip,count-hero:1=happy,This is just a setback, ~name~. Heroes always get back up.
2-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:5-9=cry,C'mon, Link! Just be quiet again, for old times' sake.
2-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:5-9=angry,Could you just stop playing poker for five seconds and talk to me! I want to keep my job!
2-male_must_strip,alsoPlaying:ryuji,notSaidMarker:navime,marker:navime=happy,Well, I'm Navi! Helpful fairy and advice giver extraordinaire!

2-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:4=puzzled,Wait... did I just hear..?
2-female_human_must_strip=interested,It's okay, ~name~! We all lose from time to time!
2-female_human_must_strip=interested,It's alright, ~name~, I'm here for you 'til the end.
2-female_human_must_strip=happy,<i>HEY!</i> ~player~! I'm not giving up hope on you, so you shouldn't either.
2-female_human_must_strip,saidMarker:talk0,notSaidMarker:talk1,marker:talk1=angry,8eautiful! Now, my voice is 8roken, too!
2-female_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:ryuji,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:naviwho,notSaidMarker:navime,marker:navime=happy,Well, I'm Navi! Helpful fairy and advice giver extraordinaire!
2-female_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu=appreciative,Don't worry about being a woman, ~player~, Kyu will still get distracted. She doesn't discriminate like that.
2-female_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu=angry,This isn't hero mode, ~player~! You should at least be able to beat the average to bad difficulty of Kyu.
2-female_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu=puzzled,If you want to see some epilogues you have to follow my advice. Who else is gonna help you like this? <i>Kyu?</i>
2-female_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu=appreciative,It'll be alright. <i>The best fairy in the game</i> has your back.
2-female_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu=embarrassed,Wow, ~player~. Kyu has the same look in her eyes that you get when one of us has to strip!
2-female_human_must_strip,oppHand:One Pair=interested,Sorry about this. A pair can usually last you through a round.
2-female_human_must_strip,oppHand:One Pair=shy,This must be an exception to a normally good pair strategy.
2-female_human_must_strip,oppHand:One Pair=puzzled,I guess it's time to get a little riskier!
2-female_must_strip=happy,It's all about layers, the more you have, the longer you get to play!
2-female_must_strip=happy,Well now you can be free to stretch out even more!
2-female_must_strip=embarrassed,Well, I've got only one thing left to lose. Let's see what you've got, ~name~.
2-female_must_strip,filter:shy=appreciative,Don't be nervous, ~name~. We're all here for you.
2-female_must_strip,filter:shy=excited,C'mon, ~name~. We've got to pump you up with some courage!
2-female_must_strip,filter:shy=interested,Take your time, ~name~. We can wait a little longer if you're nervous.
2-female_must_strip,filter:shy=calm,Deep breaths, ~name~. Try to take it off in one go, if you can...
2-female_must_strip,target:zelda=excited,Show them how a princess does it!
2-female_must_strip,target:zelda=cry,I'm so sorry that you have to do this, Princess Zelda.
2-female_must_strip,target:zelda=puzzled,Y'know, I can't explain it, but something about you looks different, princess... new haircut?
2-female_must_strip,target:zelda=appreciative,I'm always here if you need assistance, Zelda!
2-female_must_strip,target:zelda=interested,I'm sorry, ~player~, but the princess comes first.
2-female_must_strip,target:natsuki,targetStage:0=horny,<i>HEY!</i> It may not seem it, but Natsuki <i>might</i> have a crush on you. Might as well make the most of it.
2-female_must_strip,target:nayru=shocked,I can't believe I get to see a real life goddess strip!
2-female_must_strip,target:nayru=excited,Show us your golden body, Golden Goddess!
2-female_must_strip,target:nayru=happy,I'm not sure if Link said this, but thanks for the magic spell you gave us back in Hyrule!
2-female_must_strip,target:nayru=shocked,You look different than last time, Nayru. But I'm sure that's just the power of a god.
2-female_must_strip,target:nayru=shy,I'm sure you don't need any hints, Nayru. Being a goddess and all...
2-female_must_strip,count-cheerful:2=interested,C'mon, ~name~! Keep that upbeat attitude!
2-female_must_strip,count-cheerful:2=happy,Gotta keep that pep in your step... or float... or... You all get what I mean!

2-female_must_strip,target:natsuki=puzzled,What are they even teaching kids in school's these days?
2-female_must_strip,target:natsuki=angry,You could stand to be a little more <i>helpful</i>, ~name~.
2-female_must_strip,target:natsuki=calm,Consider this another learning experience, ~name~.
2-female_must_strip,target:marinette=interested,What are you going to take off, Ladybug? It doesn't look like you brought much aside from that mask and belt.
2-female_must_strip,filter:blue_hair,notSaidMarker:blue,marker:blue=interested,I hate to see someone else with blue hair lose, but rules are rules.
2-female_must_strip,filter:blue_hair,notSaidMarker:blue,marker:blue=appreciative,This may be a bad time to bring it up, but I really like your hair color, ~name~.
2-female_must_strip,filter:blue_hair,notSaidMarker:blue,marker:blue=shy,I hate to watch you lose. You don't see many blue haired people back in Hyrule.
2-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=puzzled,<i>HEY!</i> Palutena seems to have some kind of god complex, so maybe you can take advantage of this false confidence?
2-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=angry,<i>HEY!</i> Palutena may try to offer advice to you on how to win. Don't listen to <i>any</i> of it!
2-female_must_strip,target:moon=interested,If you want to win the game, just do the exact opposite of what ~name~ does.
2-female_must_strip,target:moon=loss,Remember to avoid, ~name~, her losing aura may spread to the rest of you.
2-female_must_strip,target:moon=embarrassed,I cannot believe that we allowed such a creature of pure evil to be let in and strip in here.
2-female_must_strip,target:moon=cry,Does ~name~ make anyone else incredibly uncomfortable?
2-female_must_strip,alsoPlaying:ryuji,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:naviwho,notSaidMarker:navime,marker:navime=happy,Well, I'm Navi! Helpful fairy and advice giver extraordinaire!
2-female_must_strip,target:nayru,targetStage:0=calm,<i>HEY!</i> Nayru is a living goddess who can see the future. I don't know if she has any weaknesses but maybe you can take advantage of her honest game play!

2-female_must_strip,filter:long_hair=puzzled,I wish I could have hair like that.
2-female_must_strip,filter:long_hair=shy,I would have long hair if I could, but the wings keep getting in the way.
2-female_must_strip,filter:long_hair=happy,If you want, I could make a slight breeze, so your long hair looks really pretty while you strip.
2-female_must_strip,filter:long_hair=interested,Please tell me you aren't wearing a wig that you'll strip off later.
2-female_must_strip,target:beatrix=interested,Wow, Beatrix! Can you fly with that wing?
2-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=interested,Would you like a hint, Chiaki? They're really useful.
2-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=shy,I know you're the ultimate gamer and all, Chiaki, but would you like a hint anyways?
2-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:0=shy,Now Spooky, I know that it isn't an article of clothing, but could you get rid of your knife?
2-female_must_strip,target:alice_mgq=interested,Maybe you should stop calling yourself a <i>monster</i> girl, I'm sure you're actually a nice person.
2-female_must_strip,target:alice_mgq=shy,Please don't remove the flowers in your hair, they remind me of home.
2-female_must_strip,target:alice_mgq=cry,And just when I was getting to know you...
2-female_must_strip,target:april,targetStage:2=interested,Does reporting ever take you on any wild quests or adventures, April?
2-female_must_strip,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:5=shy,Oh well, I guess Alice has to masturbate, sorry, there's nothing that can be done now.
2-female_must_strip,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:5=shy,It's a shame that you lost now, ~name~, but there's nothing that can be done about that.
2-female_must_strip,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:5=shy,Well it <i>looks</i> like ~name~ is all out of items, too bad you can't bring out anymore.
2-female_must_strip,target:clover,targetStage:0=interested,Does it make you feel nervous, ~name~? Like your stomach's gonna explode?
2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1-4=shocked,Oh no! Is she going to do the thing again?
2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1-4=cry,Get your shields out, everybody!
2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1-4=shy,I'd be relieved that I'm a small target, except that probably turns me into <i>a challenge</i> for her.
2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1-4=angry,<i>HEY!</i> Watch where you point that thing!
2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1-4=cry,She's gonna use that weird fire magic again!
2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1-4=cry,Here we go again!
2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1-4=cry,Shields at the ready, everybody!
2-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:2=interested,<i>HEY!</i> Aella. Do you go explore dungeons a lot?
2-female_must_strip,target:clover,targetStage:1=angry,Trying to beat, ~player~, who I'm helping to win this game, is as dim-witted as having your code name the same as your <i>real</i> name.
2-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:1=interested,No offense, ~name~, but I don't care that you're tall.
2-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:1=angry,I don't see what the big deal is about Aella's height.
2-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:1=interested,I guess Aella's tall, but I don't see what the big deal is.
2-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0=happy,<i>HEY!</i> I wouldn't worry too much about Trainer being an obstacle. She's just here to help, like me!
2-female_must_strip,target:clover,targetStage:2=interested,Sorry, ~name~, you're trapped here with less than nine layers remaining.
2-female_must_strip,target:clover,targetStage:3=happy,You keep talking about a game, Clover. Is it a fun game?
2-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:0=calm,<i>HEY!</i> Vriska is perhaps the toughest opponent you could encounter in the inventory. Her incredible luck and shapeshifting outfit make taking her down an extreme challenge.
2-female_must_strip,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=calm,<i>HEY!</i> I don't think Shimakaze entirely gets the point of the game, so might as well take advantage of this.
2-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1=interested,It's too bad you only brought clothes, Corrin. You should have brought your sword, too.
2-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2=interested,Sorry, Corrin. It looks like you're going to have to remove some of your armor this round.
2-female_must_strip,target:arwen=shocked,Ooooooh! Wow, ~name~, your ears are as pointy as Link's!
2-female_must_strip,target:arwen=appreciative,Pointy ears... green outerwear... doesn't talk much... if it wasn't for <i>everything else</i> I might mistake you for <i>you know who.</i>
2-female_must_strip,target:arwen=excited,I'm going to need you to be more enthusiastic than that, ~name~. Try screaming <i>HEY!</i> at the top of your lungs!
2-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0=calm,<i>HEY!</i> Sei tends to throw back <i>a little</i> too much milk. Attack more the more she drinks!
2-female_must_strip,target:joey,targetStage:3=puzzled,Since you have to strip anyways, ~name~, maybe we can see a magic trick too?
2-female_must_strip,target:sayori,targetStage:0=calm,<i>HEY!</i> It takes Sayori a while to get a grasp on things, so strike early while the iron's hot!
2-female_must_strip,target:jolyne,targetStage:1=appreciative,Y'know, Jolyne, I'm actually an escaped convict myself.
2-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0=happy,<i>HEY!</i> Ruby is all about speed and fun. This also makes a big weakness when she gets excited and rushes her card swaps.
2-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:1=interested,You know, I know a race of all women too.
2-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:1=excited,I actually know about a race of all women, just like yours.
2-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:2=puzzled,The weird thing about the Gerudo is that they only have one man born every 100 years.
2-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:3=interested,So, Mahiru. I heard you go to a school with the <i>ultimates</i> in certain areas.
2-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=puzzled,I know you're a little busy now, Rinkah, but I was wondering how I could get to be as strong as you are.
2-female_must_strip,target:pyrrha,targetStage:0=shy,It's a shame you have to strip, Pyrrha. I never like it when a hero such as yourself loses.
2-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=angry,<i>HEY!</i> Revy might offer you a deal or begin to... <i>cuss</i>. Don't listen to any of it and you may get out of here <i>alive</i>.
2-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:1=cry,That's a shame, ~name~. You don't seem to be wearing much in the way of accessories.
2-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0=calm,<i>HEY!</i> Raven gets much worse at poker if you can get her emotions out of control. So better get your best insults ready!
2-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:2=puzzled,~name~ has to go. Honestly, I'm surprised she even wears a bra.
2-female_must_strip,target:akko=interested,I may not have the best experiences with witches, but this one might be too cute to strip.
2-female_must_strip,target:akko=angry,Everyone be on watch, you never know what trickery a <i>witch</i> might be up to.
2-female_must_strip,target:akko=puzzled,I can't tell if those big, soft brown eyes belong to an <i>evil</i> witch or just a normal witch.
2-female_must_strip,target:akko=shy,I really wish I had brought something reflective in case Akko starts throwing spells all over the place.
2-female_must_strip,target:joey,targetStage:0=puzzled,Hey, Joey. Is your hair naturally blue?
2-female_must_strip,saidMarker:talk0,notSaidMarker:talk1,marker:talk1=angry,8eautiful! Now, my voice is 8roken, too!
2-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=puzzled,<i>HEY!<i> Rinkah is the fiery woman from the flame tribe, but what would happen if that fiery spirit boiled over?
2-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0=happy,<i>HEY!</i> As much as you don't want to, revealing <i>private areas</i> early leads to a distracted Kyu and easier win!
2-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:socks,priority:500=angry,Stop lying about us fairies! I have a reputation here!
2-female_must_strip,target:ruby,alsoPlaying:weiss=interested,Well, you've got courage and power, ~name~. I suppose you could find a friend who could teach you to be a bit wiser.
2-female_must_strip,target:ruby,alsoPlaying:weiss=shocked,<i>HEY!</i> Maybe you're a little too anxious, ~name~. I mean, look over at how composed Weiss is.
2-female_must_strip,target:ruby,alsoPlaying:weiss=shy,Don't shy away now, after all your partner... or team mate... is here!
2-female_must_strip,target:weiss,alsoPlaying:ruby=angry,Don't get all flustered now, your teammate's here!
2-female_must_strip,target:weiss,alsoPlaying:ruby=puzzled,You're blushing harder than I expected, ~name~. Is someone here making you a little more unsettled than usually.
2-female_must_strip,target:weiss,alsoPlaying:ruby=angry,Don't break composure now, ~name~. You're supposed to be the serious one.
2-female_must_strip,target:weiss,alsoPlaying:ruby=shocked,Ruby! Be prepared to catch ~name~ is she suddenly faints from embarrassment.
2-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:chiaki,priority:500=interested,I don't think Kyu's the type of fairy you're looking for, unless your quest leads you into the bedroom.
2-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:chiaki,priority:500=appreciative,Nope, not Kyu! If I may direct your attention towards the superior quest-guiding fairy floating right over here.
2-female_must_strip,target:alpha,targetStage:4,notSaidMarker:roll,marker:roll=interested,Listen to the rippling rhythm of ~name~'s singing...
2-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:ruby,alsoPlayingStage:0=horny,<i>HEY!</i> The members of RWBY may be good friends, but I'm sure they've never seen each other stripping. The more of them here, the more flustered they get.
2-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,notSaidMarker:picture,marker:picture=interested,Y'know, Mahiru. I heard that fairies aren't really all that common where you're from...
2-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:0=happy,<i>HEY!</i> Aella might seem like an impenetrable mountain, but she's also a softy for her father and gets cold very easily. Just keep finding the chinks in her armor!
2-female_must_strip,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:alice_mgq,alsoPlayingStage:0=calm,<i>HEY!</i> Alice may act all superior, but I'm sure if you get her down far enough, we'll see a different side of her.
2-female_must_strip,target:alice_degracia,targetStage:0=calm,<i>HEY!</i> Alice's high amount of cuteness does make her tough to take down, but just keep your wits about you and you might be able to pull this one out.
2-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:0=angry,<i>HEY!</i> Take the time to notice and compliment Amalia on her outfit. She might get a little bit <i>too</i> caught up in herself.
2-female_must_strip,target:april,targetStage:0=puzzled,<i>HEY!</i> April is going to keep trying to get a scoop... of something. Keep her from getting that scoop and you might have an easier time beating her.
2-female_must_strip,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=happy,<i>HEY!</i> Beatrix is a sniper who lacks a left arm, so by casually throwing something at a close range, you could throw her off greatly!
2-female_must_strip,target:cammy,targetStage:1=puzzled,I wonder if they locked the back door after I came down here?
2-female_must_strip,target:cammy,targetStage:2-4=angry,There better not be more people coming, I'm running low on hearts!
2-female_must_strip,target:cammy,targetStage:2-4=cry,Here we go again...
2-female_must_strip,target:cammy,targetStage:2-4=calm,Everything looks fine for now, I think we're safe.
2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:0=happy,<i>HEY!</i> Aimee gets cockier when she cocks her weapon, use this to achieve victory!
2-female_must_strip,target:ini,targetStage:0=calm,<i>HEY!</i> Ini is not the sharpest sword in the sheath, so you should have much trouble letting her take the fall first.
2-female_must_strip,target:jenetta,targetStage:1=puzzled,What even are you, Jenetta? I've never seen anyone else with ears like those.
2-female_must_strip,target:jenetta,targetStage:0=calm,<i>HEY!</i> Being part bunny, Jenetta has highly sensitive ears. Blow into them hard and she's no longer a threat.
2-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:0=calm,<i>HEY!</i> Keep an eye out for any major changes on Launch, that might be just the thing to throw her off and give you the edge.
2-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:0=calm,<i>HEY!</i> It doesn't look like Felicia is wearing much of anything. You should be able to take her out with a few decent hands.
2-female_must_strip,target:erufuda,targetStage:0=calm,<i>HEY!</i> Erufuda seems to have tried to lose a bit of wait. Unfortunately, she also kept her biggest weakness too, french fries.
2-female_must_strip,target:joey,targetStage:0=puzzled,<i>HEY!</i> Joey is a natural performer. Try asking her to do some tricks. What could go wrong?
2-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=horny,<i>HEY!</i> If you want to keep Jura unfocused, bring out all the masculine charm you have!
2-female_must_strip,target:clover,targetStage:0=calm,<i>HEY!</i> Clover has a <i>slight</i> temperament. Don't get her angry... unless you like winning.
2-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=horny,<i>HEY!</i> Chiaki is already one of the best gamers around, except when it comes to dating sims. Start making some moves on another player and watch her skill level plummet!

-3-male_human_must_strip=interested,I won't go down that easily!
-3-male_human_must_strip=shocked,That one was close!
-3-male_human_must_strip=cry,And you we're so close, too!
-3-male_human_must_strip,oppHand:One Pair=interested,It's alright, ~player~, sometimes you do everything right and it still doesn't work out.
-3-male_human_must_strip,oppHand:One Pair=puzzled,Maybe next turn you should try for something riskier than just a pair?
-3-male_human_must_strip,oppHand:One Pair=excited,<i>HEY!</i> You <i>LISTENED</i> to my advice! You still have to strip, though.
-3-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu=angry,Come on, ~player~! My hints should be helping you out so much more than this!
-3-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu=angry,C'mon, ~player~! You lost to Kyu, who isn't even at a hard difficulty!
-3-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu=excited,Try taking off something important, ~player~. It will distract Kyu and allow you to win!
-3-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu=excited,Try to show as much skin as possible. It'll distract any and all perverted fairies in the area.
-3-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu=embarrassed,Just don't let Kyu help you get your clothing off. Her hands are <i>very sticky</i> for some reason...
-3-male_human_must_strip,saidMarker:talk0,notSaidMarker:talk1,marker:talk1=angry,8eautiful! Now, my voice is 8roken, too!
-3-male_must_strip=interested,What's it gonna be, ~name~?
-3-male_must_strip=shy,I didn't know there would be <i>this much</i> stripping.
-3-male_must_strip=embarrassed,It's fine... I'll just... float here...
-3-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:4=puzzled,Huh? Link did you..?
-3-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:4=puzzled,Wait... did I just hear..?
-3-male_must_strip,target:9s=interested,I hope you didn't get that mask from this one creepy guy in town...
-3-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:5-9=cry,C'mon, Link! Just be quiet again, for old times' sake.
-3-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:5-9=angry,Could you just stop playing poker for five seconds and talk to me! I want to keep my job!
-3-male_must_strip,alsoPlaying:link=calm,<i>HEY!</i> Link isn't going to be very vocal about how good his cards are, so you're going to have to study his body language.
-3-male_must_strip,count-hero:1=excited,You're a hero, ~name~, show them why!
-3-male_must_strip,count-hero:1=interested,To do this takes the kind of courage you only find in a true hero.
-3-male_must_strip,count-hero:1=appreciative,Clothed or bare. I'm willing to stand by anyone who can prove themselves a hero.
-3-male_must_strip,count-hero:1=shocked,Is this what you do between heroics, ~name~?
-3-male_must_strip,count-hero:1=happy,This is just a setback, ~name~. Heroes always get back up.
-3-male_must_strip,alsoPlaying:pit=happy,<i>HEY!</i> Pit is a real talkative guy. Start engaging him in conversation and he'll have no time to look at his cards!
-3-male_must_strip,saidMarker:talk0,notSaidMarker:talk1,marker:talk1=angry,8eautiful! Now, my voice is 8roken, too!
-3-female_human_must_strip=embarrassed,Take your time, really. I've got nothing better to do over here.
-3-female_human_must_strip=excited,Try to take it off in a single motion!
-3-female_human_must_strip=shy,Maybe next round, ~player~.
-3-female_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu=appreciative,Don't worry about being a woman, ~player~, Kyu will still get distracted. She doesn't discriminate like that.
-3-female_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu=angry,This isn't hero mode, ~player~! You should at least be able to beat the average to bad difficulty of Kyu.
-3-female_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu=puzzled,If you want to see some epilogues you have to follow my advice. Who else is gonna help you like this? <i>Kyu?</i>
-3-female_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu=appreciative,It'll be alright. <i>The best fairy in the game</i> has your back.
-3-female_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu=embarrassed,Wow, ~player~. Kyu has the same look in her eyes that you get when one of us has to strip!
-3-female_human_must_strip,oppHand:One Pair=interested,Sorry about this. A pair can usually last you through a round.
-3-female_human_must_strip,oppHand:One Pair=shy,This must be an exception to a normally good pair strategy.
-3-female_human_must_strip,oppHand:One Pair=puzzled,I guess it's time to get a little riskier!
-3-female_human_must_strip,saidMarker:talk0,notSaidMarker:talk1,marker:talk1=angry,8eautiful! Now, my voice is 8roken, too!
-3-female_must_strip=interested,Could be worse... a lot worse...
-3-female_must_strip=angry,<i>HEY!</i> You better not have some secret layer that no one knows about!
-3-female_must_strip=excited,It's alright! Every one of my <i>(one... two... three...)</i> three loses were mistakes too!
-3-female_must_strip,target:clover,targetStage:0=interested,Does it make you feel nervous, ~name~? Like your stomach's gonna explode?
-3-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:1=cry,That's a shame, ~name~. You don't seem to be wearing much in the way of accessories.
-3-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=interested,Would you like a hint, Chiaki? They're really useful.
-3-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=shy,I know you're the ultimate gamer and all, Chiaki, but would you like a hint anyways?
-3-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:0=shy,Now Spooky, I know that it isn't an article of clothing, but could you get rid of your knife?
-3-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:chiaki,priority:500=interested,I don't think Kyu's the type of fairy you're looking for, unless your quest leads you into the bedroom.
-3-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:chiaki,priority:500=appreciative,Nope, not Kyu! If I may direct your attention towards the superior quest-guiding fairy floating right over here.
-3-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1=interested,It's too bad you only brought clothes, Corrin. You should have brought your sword, too.
-3-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:3=interested,So, Mahiru. I heard you go to a school with the <i>ultimates</i> in certain areas.
-3-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:ruby,alsoPlayingStage:0=horny,<i>HEY!</i> The members of RWBY may be good friends, but I'm sure they've never seen each other stripping. The more of them here, the more flustered they get.
-3-female_must_strip,target:clover,targetStage:1=angry,Trying to beat, ~player~, who I'm helping to win this game, is as dim-witted as having your code name the same as your <i>real</i> name.
-3-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2=interested,Sorry, Corrin. It looks like you're going to have to remove some of your armor this round.
-3-female_must_strip,target:joey,targetStage:3=puzzled,Since you have to strip anyways, ~name~, maybe we can see a magic trick too?
-3-female_must_strip,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:alice_mgq,alsoPlayingStage:0=calm,<i>HEY!</i> Alice may act all superior, but I'm sure if you get her down far enough, we'll see a different side of her.
-3-female_must_strip,target:clover,targetStage:2=interested,Sorry, ~name~, you're trapped here with less than nine layers remaining.
-3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:2=puzzled,The weird thing about the Gerudo is that they only have one man born every 100 years.
-3-female_must_strip,target:clover,targetStage:3=happy,You keep talking about a game, Clover. Is it a fun game?
-3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:1=interested,You know, I know a race of all women too.
-3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:1=excited,I actually know about a race of all women, just like yours.
-3-female_must_strip,target:clover,targetStage:3=interested,I feel like I could probably guess what you're going to strip now, like our minds are connected or something...
-3-female_must_strip,target:jolyne,targetStage:1=appreciative,Y'know, Jolyne, I'm actually an escaped convict myself.
-3-female_must_strip,target:pyrrha,targetStage:0=shy,It's a shame you have to strip, Pyrrha. I never like it when a hero such as yourself loses.
-3-female_must_strip,target:april,targetStage:2=interested,Does reporting ever take you on any wild quests or adventures, April?
-3-female_must_strip,target:alice_mgq=interested,Maybe you should stop calling yourself a <i>monster</i> girl, I'm sure you're actually a nice person.
-3-female_must_strip,target:alice_mgq=shy,Please don't remove the flowers in your hair, they remind me of home.
-3-female_must_strip,target:alice_mgq=cry,And just when I was getting to know you...
-3-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:2=puzzled,~name~ has to go. Honestly, I'm surprised she even wears a bra.
-3-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:socks,priority:500=angry,Stop lying about us fairies! I have a reputation here!
-3-female_must_strip,target:natsuki=puzzled,What are they even teaching kids in school's these days?
-3-female_must_strip,target:natsuki=angry,You could stand to be a little more <i>helpful</i>, ~name~.
-3-female_must_strip,target:natsuki=calm,Consider this another learning experience, ~name~.
-3-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:0=happy,<i>HEY!</i> Aella might seem like an impenetrable mountain, but she's also a softy for her father and gets cold very easily. Just keep finding the chinks in her armor!
-3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:0=happy,<i>HEY!</i> Aimee gets cockier when she cocks her weapon, use this to achieve victory!
-3-female_must_strip,target:alice_degracia,targetStage:0=calm,<i>HEY!</i> Alice's high amount of cuteness does make her tough to take down, but just keep your wits about you and you might be able to pull this one out.
-3-female_must_strip,target:nayru=shocked,I can't believe I get to see a real life goddess strip!
-3-female_must_strip,target:nayru=excited,Show us your golden body, Golden Goddess!
-3-female_must_strip,target:nayru=happy,I'm not sure if Link said this, but thanks for the magic spell you gave us back in Hyrule!
-3-female_must_strip,target:nayru=shocked,You look different than last time, Nayru. But I'm sure that's just the power of a god.
-3-female_must_strip,target:nayru=shy,I'm sure you don't need any hints, Nayru. Being a goddess and all...
-3-female_must_strip,target:moon=interested,If you want to win the game, just do the exact opposite of what ~name~ does.
-3-female_must_strip,target:moon=loss,Remember to avoid, ~name~, her losing aura may spread to the rest of you.
-3-female_must_strip,target:moon=embarrassed,I cannot believe that we allowed such a creature of pure evil to be let in and strip in here.
-3-female_must_strip,target:moon=cry,Does ~name~ make anyone else incredibly uncomfortable?
-3-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=puzzled,I know you're a little busy now, Rinkah, but I was wondering how I could get to be as strong as you are.
-3-female_must_strip,target:zelda=excited,Show them how a princess does it!
-3-female_must_strip,target:zelda=cry,I'm so sorry that you have to do this, Princess Zelda.
-3-female_must_strip,target:zelda=puzzled,Y'know, I can't explain it, but something about you looks different, princess... new haircut?
-3-female_must_strip,target:zelda=appreciative,I'm always here if you need assistance, Zelda!
-3-female_must_strip,target:zelda=interested,I'm sorry, ~player~, but the princess comes first.
-3-female_must_strip,filter:blue_hair,notSaidMarker:blue,marker:blue=interested,I hate to see someone else with blue hair lose, but rules are rules.
-3-female_must_strip,filter:blue_hair,notSaidMarker:blue,marker:blue=appreciative,This may be a bad time to bring it up, but I really like your hair color, ~name~.
-3-female_must_strip,filter:blue_hair,notSaidMarker:blue,marker:blue=shy,I hate to watch you lose. You don't see many blue haired people back in Hyrule.
-3-female_must_strip,target:cammy,targetStage:2-4=angry,There better not be more people coming, I'm running low on hearts!
-3-female_must_strip,target:cammy,targetStage:2-4=cry,Here we go again...
-3-female_must_strip,target:cammy,targetStage:2-4=calm,Everything looks fine for now, I think we're safe.
-3-female_must_strip,filter:long_hair=interested,You may lose your outfit, but you'll still have your pretty hair.
-3-female_must_strip,filter:long_hair=puzzled,I wish I could have hair like that.
-3-female_must_strip,filter:long_hair=shy,I would have long hair if I could, but the wings keep getting in the way.
-3-female_must_strip,filter:long_hair=happy,If you want, I could make a slight breeze, so your long hair looks really pretty while you strip.
-3-female_must_strip,filter:long_hair=interested,Please tell me you aren't wearing a wig that you'll strip off later.
-3-female_must_strip,saidMarker:talk0,notSaidMarker:talk1,marker:talk1=angry,8eautiful! Now, my voice is 8roken, too!
-3-female_must_strip,target:jenetta,targetStage:1=puzzled,What even are you, Jenetta? I've never seen anyone else with ears like those.
-3-female_must_strip,target:cammy,targetStage:1=puzzled,I wonder if they locked the back door after I came down here?
-3-female_must_strip,target:alpha,targetStage:4,notSaidMarker:roll,marker:roll=interested,Listen to the rippling rhythm of ~name~'s singing...
-3-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,notSaidMarker:picture,marker:picture=interested,Y'know, Mahiru. I heard that fairies aren't really all that common where you're from...
-3-female_must_strip,target:weiss,alsoPlaying:ruby=angry,Don't get all flustered now, your teammate's here!
-3-female_must_strip,target:weiss,alsoPlaying:ruby=puzzled,You're blushing harder than I expected, ~name~. Is someone here making you a little more unsettled than usually.
-3-female_must_strip,target:weiss,alsoPlaying:ruby=angry,Don't break composure now, ~name~. You're supposed to be the serious one.
-3-female_must_strip,target:weiss,alsoPlaying:ruby=shocked,Ruby! Be prepared to catch ~name~ is she suddenly faints from embarrassment.
-3-female_must_strip,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:5=shy,Oh well, I guess Alice has to masturbate, sorry, there's nothing that can be done now.
-3-female_must_strip,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:5=shy,It's a shame that you lost now, ~name~, but there's nothing that can be done about that.
-3-female_must_strip,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:5=shy,Well it <i>looks</i> like ~name~ is all out of items, too bad you can't bring out anymore.
-3-female_must_strip,target:akko=interested,I may not have the best experiences with witches, but this one might be too cute to strip.
-3-female_must_strip,target:akko=angry,Everyone be on watch, you never know what trickery a <i>witch</i> might be up to.
-3-female_must_strip,target:akko=puzzled,I can't tell if those big, soft brown eyes belong to an <i>evil</i> witch or just a normal witch.
-3-female_must_strip,target:akko=shy,I really wish I had brought something reflective in case Akko starts throwing spells all over the place.
-3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1-4=shocked,Oh no! Is she going to do the thing again?
-3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1-4=cry,Get your shields out, everybody!
-3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1-4=shy,I'd be relieved that I'm a small target, except that probably turns me into <i>a challenge</i> for her.
-3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1-4=angry,<i>HEY!</i> Watch where you point that thing!
-3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1-4=cry,She's gonna use that weird fire magic again!
-3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1-4=cry,Here we go again!
-3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1-4=cry,Shields at the ready, everybody!
-3-female_must_strip,target:ruby,alsoPlaying:weiss=interested,Well, you've got courage and power, ~name~. I suppose you could find a friend who could teach you to be a bit wiser.
-3-female_must_strip,target:ruby,alsoPlaying:weiss=shocked,<i>HEY!</i> Maybe you're a little too anxious, ~name~. I mean, look over at how composed Weiss is.
-3-female_must_strip,target:ruby,alsoPlaying:weiss=shy,Don't shy away now, after all your partner... or team mate... is here!
-3-female_must_strip,target:marinette=interested,What are you going to take off, Ladybug? It doesn't look like you brought much aside from that mask and belt.
-3-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:2=interested,<i>HEY!</i> Aella. Do you go explore dungeons a lot?
-3-female_must_strip,target:arwen=shocked,Ooooooh! Wow, ~name~, your ears are as pointy as Link's!
-3-female_must_strip,target:arwen=appreciative,Pointy ears... green outerwear... doesn't talk much... if it wasn't for <i>everything else</i> I might mistake you for <i>you know who.</i>
-3-female_must_strip,target:arwen=excited,I'm going to need you to be more enthusiastic than that, ~name~. Try screaming <i>HEY!</i> at the top of your lungs!
-3-female_must_strip,target:beatrix=interested,Wow, Beatrix! Can you fly with that wing?
-3-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:1=interested,No offense, ~name~, but I don't care that you're tall.
-3-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:1=angry,I don't see what the big deal is about Aella's height.
-3-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:1=interested,I guess Aella's tall, but I don't see what the big deal is.
-3-female_must_strip,target:joey,targetStage:0=puzzled,Hey, Joey. Is your hair naturally blue?

-2-male_human_must_strip=interested,Do you want to continue, ~name~? Or would you like to hear this again?
-2-male_human_must_strip=calm,Since I can't turn away, ~name~... do you still have any small items?
-2-male_human_must_strip=embarrassed,One problem with going through a seven-year time skip is how much your <i>interests</i> can change.
-2-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu=angry,Come on, ~player~! My hints should be helping you out so much more than this!
-2-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu=angry,C'mon, ~player~! You lost to Kyu, who isn't even at a hard difficulty!

-2-female_human_must_strip=shy,Losing isn't so bad... in fact it feels kind of... nice...
-2-female_human_must_strip=cry,I might be getting more than I bargained for...

-2-female_must_strip,target:nayru=shocked,You look different than last time, Nayru. But I'm sure that's just the power of a god.
-2-female_must_strip,target:nayru=shy,I'm sure you don't need any hints, Nayru. Being a goddess and all...
-2-female_must_strip,target:arwen=shocked,Ooooooh! Wow, ~name~, your ears are as pointy as Link's!
-2-female_must_strip,target:arwen=appreciative,Pointy ears... green outerwear... doesn't talk much... if it wasn't for <i>everything else</i> I might mistake you for <i>you know who.</i>
-2-female_must_strip,target:arwen=excited,I'm going to need you to be more enthusiastic than that, ~name~. Try screaming <i>HEY!</i> at the top of your lungs!
-2-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=interested,Would you like a hint, Chiaki? They're really useful.
-2-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=shy,I know you're the ultimate gamer and all, Chiaki, but would you like a hint anyways?
-2-female_must_strip,target:alice_mgq=interested,Maybe you should stop calling yourself a <i>monster</i> girl, I'm sure you're actually a nice person.
-2-female_must_strip,target:alice_mgq=shy,Please don't remove the flowers in your hair, they remind me of home.
-2-female_must_strip,target:alice_mgq=cry,And just when I was getting to know you...
-2-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:1=cry,That's a shame, ~name~. You don't seem to be wearing much in the way of accessories.
-2-female_must_strip,target:april,targetStage:2=interested,Does reporting ever take you on any wild quests or adventures, April?
-2-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:socks,priority:500=angry,Stop lying about us fairies! I have a reputation here!
-2-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:2=puzzled,~name~ has to go. Honestly, I'm surprised she even wears a bra.
-2-female_must_strip,target:ruby,alsoPlaying:weiss=interested,Well, you've got courage and power, ~name~. I suppose you could find a friend who could teach you to be a bit wiser.
-2-female_must_strip,target:ruby,alsoPlaying:weiss=shocked,<i>HEY!</i> Maybe you're a little too anxious, ~name~. I mean, look over at how composed Weiss is.
-2-female_must_strip,target:ruby,alsoPlaying:weiss=shy,Don't shy away now, after all your partner... or team mate... is here!
-2-female_must_strip,target:natsuki=puzzled,What are they even teaching kids in school's these days?
-2-female_must_strip,target:natsuki=angry,You could stand to be a little more <i>helpful</i>, ~name~.
-2-female_must_strip,target:natsuki=calm,Consider this another learning experience, ~name~.
-2-female_must_strip,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:5=shy,Oh well, I guess Alice has to masturbate, sorry, there's nothing that can be done now.
-2-female_must_strip,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:5=shy,It's a shame that you lost now, ~name~, but there's nothing that can be done about that.
-2-female_must_strip,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:5=shy,Well it <i>looks</i> like ~name~ is all out of items, too bad you can't bring out anymore.
-2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1-4=shocked,Oh no! Is she going to do the thing again?
-2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1-4=cry,Get your shields out, everybody!
-2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1-4=shy,I'd be relieved that I'm a small target, except that probably turns me into <i>a challenge</i> for her.
-2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1-4=angry,<i>HEY!</i> Watch where you point that thing!
-2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1-4=cry,She's gonna use that weird fire magic again!
-2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1-4=cry,Here we go again!
-2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1-4=cry,Shields at the ready, everybody!
-2-female_must_strip,target:akko=interested,I may not have the best experiences with witches, but this one might be too cute to strip.
-2-female_must_strip,target:akko=angry,Everyone be on watch, you never know what trickery a <i>witch</i> might be up to.
-2-female_must_strip,target:akko=puzzled,I can't tell if those big, soft brown eyes belong to an <i>evil</i> witch or just a normal witch.
-2-female_must_strip,target:akko=shy,I really wish I had brought something reflective in case Akko starts throwing spells all over the place.
-2-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=puzzled,I know you're a little busy now, Rinkah, but I was wondering how I could get to be as strong as you are.
-2-female_must_strip,target:clover,targetStage:2=interested,Sorry, ~name~, you're trapped here with less than nine layers remaining.
-2-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:3=interested,So, Mahiru. I heard you go to a school with the <i>ultimates</i> in certain areas.
-2-female_must_strip,target:moon=interested,If you want to win the game, just do the exact opposite of what ~name~ does.
-2-female_must_strip,target:moon=loss,Remember to avoid, ~name~, her losing aura may spread to the rest of you.
-2-female_must_strip,target:moon=embarrassed,I cannot believe that we allowed such a creature of pure evil to be let in and strip in here.
-2-female_must_strip,target:moon=cry,Does ~name~ make anyone else incredibly uncomfortable?
-2-female_must_strip,target:weiss,alsoPlaying:ruby=angry,Don't get all flustered now, your teammate's here!
-2-female_must_strip,target:weiss,alsoPlaying:ruby=puzzled,You're blushing harder than I expected, ~name~. Is someone here making you a little more unsettled than usually.
-2-female_must_strip,target:weiss,alsoPlaying:ruby=angry,Don't break composure now, ~name~. You're supposed to be the serious one.
-2-female_must_strip,target:weiss,alsoPlaying:ruby=shocked,Ruby! Be prepared to catch ~name~ is she suddenly faints from embarrassment.
-2-female_must_strip,target:joey,targetStage:0=puzzled,Hey, Joey. Is your hair naturally blue?
-2-female_must_strip,target:jenetta,targetStage:1=puzzled,What even are you, Jenetta? I've never seen anyone else with ears like those.
-2-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2=interested,Sorry, Corrin. It looks like you're going to have to remove some of your armor this round.
-2-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:1=interested,No offense, ~name~, but I don't care that you're tall.
-2-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:1=angry,I don't see what the big deal is about Aella's height.
-2-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:1=interested,I guess Aella's tall, but I don't see what the big deal is.
-2-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1=interested,It's too bad you only brought clothes, Corrin. You should have brought your sword, too.
-2-female_must_strip,target:joey,targetStage:3=puzzled,Since you have to strip anyways, ~name~, maybe we can see a magic trick too?
-2-female_must_strip,target:beatrix=interested,Wow, Beatrix! Can you fly with that wing?
-2-female_must_strip,target:jolyne,targetStage:1=appreciative,Y'know, Jolyne, I'm actually an escaped convict myself.
-2-female_must_strip,filter:long_hair=interested,You may lose your outfit, but you'll still have your pretty hair.
-2-female_must_strip,filter:long_hair=puzzled,I wish I could have hair like that.
-2-female_must_strip,filter:long_hair=shy,I would have long hair if I could, but the wings keep getting in the way.
-2-female_must_strip,filter:long_hair=happy,If you want, I could make a slight breeze, so your long hair looks really pretty while you strip.
-2-female_must_strip,filter:long_hair=interested,Please tell me you aren't wearing a wig that you'll strip off later.
-2-female_must_strip,saidMarker:talk0,notSaidMarker:talk1,marker:talk1=angry,8eautiful! Now, my voice is 8roken, too!
-2-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:1=interested,You know, I know a race of all women too.
-2-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:1=excited,I actually know about a race of all women, just like yours.
-2-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:2=puzzled,The weird thing about the Gerudo is that they only have one man born every 100 years.
-2-female_must_strip,filter:blue_hair,notSaidMarker:blue,marker:blue=interested,I hate to see someone else with blue hair lose, but rules are rules.
-2-female_must_strip,filter:blue_hair,notSaidMarker:blue,marker:blue=appreciative,This may be a bad time to bring it up, but I really like your hair color, ~name~.
-2-female_must_strip,filter:blue_hair,notSaidMarker:blue,marker:blue=shy,I hate to watch you lose. You don't see many blue haired people back in Hyrule.
-2-female_must_strip,target:clover,targetStage:3=happy,You keep talking about a game, Clover. Is it a fun game?
-2-female_must_strip,target:cammy,targetStage:2-4=angry,There better not be more people coming, I'm running low on hearts!
-2-female_must_strip,target:cammy,targetStage:2-4=cry,Here we go again...
-2-female_must_strip,target:cammy,targetStage:2-4=calm,Everything looks fine for now, I think we're safe.
-2-female_must_strip,target:alpha,targetStage:4,notSaidMarker:roll,marker:roll=interested,Listen to the rippling rhythm of ~name~'s singing...
-2-female_must_strip,target:clover,targetStage:3=interested,I feel like I could probably guess what you're going to strip now, like our minds are connected or something...

-1-male_human_must_strip=interested,If you need extra help don't forget you can switch on card suggest.
-1-male_human_must_strip=angry,~player~! I expect more from the man who lasted longer than me.
-1-male_human_must_strip=shy,It is always harder when there's multiple enemies in the room.
-1-male_human_must_strip=loss,It's going to be a climb to win this, but at least it's not a climb up a place called <i>Death Mountain.</i>
-1-male_human_must_strip,totalFinished:3=happy,I know you can win this, ~player~! you've already got three people out!
-1-male_human_must_strip,totalFinished:3=excited,Just use Z targeting and focus on your final opponent!
-1-male_human_must_strip,totalFinished:3=appreciative,C'mon, ~player~! This is the final boss!
-1-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu=angry,Come on, ~player~! My hints should be helping you out so much more than this!
-1-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu=angry,C'mon, ~player~! You lost to Kyu, who isn't even at a hard difficulty!
-1-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu=excited,Try taking off something important, ~player~. It will distract Kyu and allow you to win!
-1-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu=excited,Try to show as much skin as possible. It'll distract any and all perverted fairies in the area.
-1-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu=embarrassed,Just don't let Kyu help you get your clothing off. Her hands are <i>very sticky</i> for some reason...
-1-male_human_must_strip,oppHand:One Pair=interested,It's alright, ~player~, sometimes you do everything right and it still doesn't work out.
-1-male_human_must_strip,oppHand:One Pair=puzzled,Maybe next turn you should try for something riskier than just a pair?
-1-male_human_must_strip,oppHand:One Pair=excited,<i>HEY!</i> You <i>LISTENED</i> to my advice! You still have to strip, though.
-1-male_human_must_strip,saidMarker:talk0,notSaidMarker:talk1,marker:talk1=angry,8eautiful! Now, my voice is 8roken, too!
-1-male_must_strip=interested,<i>WATCH OUT!</i> Oh... I guess it's a little late for that...
-1-male_must_strip=excited,It's not over until you're out of hearts!
-1-male_must_strip=interested,I am very much prepared to wait here until everyone else is... <i>well</i>...
-1-male_must_strip=interested,If you can't take the heat, get out of those clothes.
-1-male_must_strip,count-hero:1=excited,You're a hero, ~name~, show them why!
-1-male_must_strip,count-hero:1=interested,To do this takes the kind of courage you only find in a true hero.
-1-male_must_strip,count-hero:1=appreciative,Clothed or bare. I'm willing to stand by anyone who can prove themselves a hero.
-1-male_must_strip,count-hero:1=shocked,Is this what you do between heroics, ~name~?
-1-male_must_strip,count-hero:1=happy,This is just a setback, ~name~. Heroes always get back up.
-1-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:4=puzzled,Huh? Link did you..?
-1-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:4=puzzled,Wait... did I just hear..?
-1-male_must_strip,saidMarker:talk0,notSaidMarker:talk1,marker:talk1=angry,8eautiful! Now, my voice is 8roken, too!
-1-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:5-9=cry,C'mon, Link! Just be quiet again, for old times' sake.
-1-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:5-9=angry,Could you just stop playing poker for five seconds and talk to me! I want to keep my job!
-1-female_human_must_strip=angry,After every hint I gave you, ~player~.
-1-female_human_must_strip=angry,You can't play it safe, ~player~. Less people equals a larger chance just a high card won't cut it.
-1-female_human_must_strip=excited,Keep going, ~name~! Keep going!
-1-female_human_must_strip=puzzled,I wish I brought Link's ocarina. Since I have a mouth now, maybe I could play something.
-1-female_human_must_strip,oppHand:One Pair=interested,Sorry about this. A pair can usually last you through a round.
-1-female_human_must_strip,oppHand:One Pair=shy,This must be an exception to a normally good pair strategy.
-1-female_human_must_strip,oppHand:One Pair=puzzled,I guess it's time to get a little riskier!
-1-female_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu=appreciative,Don't worry about being a woman, ~player~, Kyu will still get distracted. She doesn't discriminate like that.
-1-female_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu=angry,This isn't hero mode, ~player~! You should at least be able to beat the average to bad difficulty of Kyu.
-1-female_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu=puzzled,If you want to see some epilogues you have to follow my advice. Who else is gonna help you like this? <i>Kyu?</i>
-1-female_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu=appreciative,It'll be alright. <i>The best fairy in the game</i> has your back.
-1-female_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu=embarrassed,Wow, ~player~. Kyu has the same look in her eyes that you get when one of us has to strip!
-1-female_human_must_strip,saidMarker:talk0,notSaidMarker:talk1,marker:talk1=angry,8eautiful! Now, my voice is 8roken, too!
-1-female_human_must_strip,totalFinished:3=interested,It's the final boss, ~player~. Can't back down now.
-1-female_human_must_strip,totalFinished:3=angry,You can't lose yet, ~player~! There's only one person left!
-1-female_human_must_strip,totalFinished:3=excited,It's just one more opponent left, ~player~! You can do this!
-1-female_must_strip=embarrassed,Now I feel like my stomach has hover boots equipped.
-1-female_must_strip=happy,Alright, ~name~! Work your magic for us!
-1-female_must_strip=interested,Doesn't matter if you just want to leave or <i>something else</i>... we're getting there anyways.
-1-female_must_strip=appreciative,At least you beat me, ~name~. That's something.
-1-female_must_strip,target:natsuki=puzzled,What are they even teaching kids in school's these days?
-1-female_must_strip,target:natsuki=angry,You could stand to be a little more <i>helpful</i>, ~name~.
-1-female_must_strip,target:natsuki=calm,Consider this another learning experience, ~name~.
-1-female_must_strip,saidMarker:talk0,notSaidMarker:talk1,marker:talk1=angry,8eautiful! Now, my voice is 8roken, too!

-1-female_must_strip,filter:long_hair=interested,You may lose your outfit, but you'll still have your pretty hair.

-1-female_must_strip,target:cammy,targetStage:1=puzzled,I wonder if they locked the back door after I came down here?
-1-female_must_strip,target:zelda=excited,Show them how a princess does it!
-1-female_must_strip,target:zelda=cry,I'm so sorry that you have to do this, Princess Zelda.
-1-female_must_strip,target:zelda=puzzled,Y'know, I can't explain it, but something about you looks different, princess... new haircut?
-1-female_must_strip,target:zelda=appreciative,I'm always here if you need assistance, Zelda!
-1-female_must_strip,target:zelda=interested,I'm sorry, ~player~, but the princess comes first.
-1-female_must_strip,target:moon=interested,If you want to win the game, just do the exact opposite of what ~name~ does.
-1-female_must_strip,target:moon=loss,Remember to avoid, ~name~, her losing aura may spread to the rest of you.
-1-female_must_strip,target:moon=embarrassed,I cannot believe that we allowed such a creature of pure evil to be let in and strip in here.
-1-female_must_strip,target:moon=cry,Does ~name~ make anyone else incredibly uncomfortable?
-1-female_must_strip,target:marinette=interested,What are you going to take off, Ladybug? It doesn't look like you brought much aside from that mask and belt.
-1-female_must_strip,target:alpha,targetStage:4,notSaidMarker:roll,marker:roll=interested,Listen to the rippling rhythm of ~name~'s singing...
-1-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=puzzled,I know you're a little busy now, Rinkah, but I was wondering how I could get to be as strong as you are.
-1-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,notSaidMarker:picture,marker:picture=interested,Y'know, Mahiru. I heard that fairies aren't really all that common where you're from...
-1-female_must_strip,target:nayru=shocked,I can't believe I get to see a real life goddess strip!
-1-female_must_strip,target:nayru=excited,Show us your golden body, Golden Goddess!
-1-female_must_strip,target:nayru=happy,I'm not sure if Link said this, but thanks for the magic spell you gave us back in Hyrule!

-1-female_must_strip,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:5=shy,It's a shame that you lost now, ~name~, but there's nothing that can be done about that.

-1-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:chiaki,priority:500=appreciative,Nope, not Kyu! If I may direct your attention towards the superior quest-guiding fairy floating right over here.

-1-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:1=interested,No offense, ~name~, but I don't care that you're tall.
-1-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:1=angry,I don't see what the big deal is about Aella's height.
-1-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:1=interested,I guess Aella's tall, but I don't see what the big deal is.
-1-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:1=cry,That's a shame, ~name~. You don't seem to be wearing much in the way of accessories.
-1-female_must_strip,target:arwen=shocked,Ooooooh! Wow, ~name~, your ears are as pointy as Link's!
-1-female_must_strip,target:arwen=appreciative,Pointy ears... green outerwear... doesn't talk much... if it wasn't for <i>everything else</i> I might mistake you for <i>you know who.</i>
-1-female_must_strip,target:arwen=excited,I'm going to need you to be more enthusiastic than that, ~name~. Try screaming <i>HEY!</i> at the top of your lungs!




#OPPONENT REMOVING ACCESSORY
#These lines are spoken when an opponent removes a small item that does not cover any skin.
#Typically, characters are fine with this when they are fully dressed but less satisfied as they become more naked.
#Note that all "removing" lines are NOT spoken to human players. Characters will skip straight from "6-male_human_must_strip" to "6-male_removed_accessory", for example.

#fully clothed
0-male_removing_accessory=shocked,Oh! That's smart, I should remember that.
0-male_removing_accessory=puzzled,Maybe <i>I</i> should bring something extra next time?
0-male_removing_accessory=calm,If I had one hint to give you, it would be to not remove your ~clothing~.

0-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:0=happy,Well then, ~player~. It looks like it'll be a good time with Jura no matter what gender you picked!
0-female_removed_accessory=calm,Stocking cap, boots, tights... so many small items I could have brought.
0-female_removed_accessory=happy,Maybe if you had removed something bigger, you'd be as floaty as me!
0-female_removed_accessory=puzzled,I know accessories usually aren't that tight, but doesn't your spirit seem so much freer?


#lost light
1-male_removing_accessory=calm,If you want to last long in this game, try removing smaller items first.
1-male_removing_accessory=shy,There's nothing wrong with removing something small... I suppose.
1-male_removing_accessory=appreciative,I guess it doesn't matter what order you strip in, but insignificant items don't tend to get the best reactions.
1-male_removing_accessory,saidMarker:cards,marker:cards=calm,Remember the order is royal flush, straight flush, four of a kind, full house, flush...
1-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0,marker:dress=excited,Wow! I can't believe I found another person with wings and a dress, just like me!
1-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0,marker:problem=embarrassed,<i>HEY!</i> Do you have the same problem I do that people constantly look up your dress when flying?
1-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0,marker:taunt=happy,Wait! I remember you from that one game we were in, ~name~! I was in Link's taunt!
1-male_removed_accessory=happy,Your ~clothing~! An excellent choice!
1-male_removed_accessory=interested,It's just one more item to reequip later.
1-male_removed_accessory=excited,Next round! I'm on a roll, now!
1-male_removed_accessory=interested,I'm sure they'll give your ~clothing~ back when this is over, ~name~.
1-male_removed_accessory=puzzled,Why does this game move so <i>slow</i>?

1-male_removed_accessory,saidMarker:cards,notSaidMarker:cards2,marker:cards2=calm,...straight, three of a kind, two pair, one pair, and finally, high card.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m=calm,It's okay, Corrin. People have called <i>me</i> a pixie too.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,saidMarker:taunt=puzzled,But I remember you being a lot moodier and darker back then...
1-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,saidMarker:taunt=puzzled,Although... you wore a lot more black in that game...
1-female_removing_accessory=horny,Show us what you're made of, ~name~.
1-female_removing_accessory=excited,Now's not the time to give up, ~name~!
1-female_removing_accessory=puzzled,Maybe I should have brought something like your ~clothing~.
1-female_removing_accessory=appreciative,I know people can get attached to items. Like Skull Kid, who got so attached to his mask that he went to the moon and back for it.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=puzzled,I feel like there's a really obvious joke to make here, but I just can't think of it.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,priority:500=appreciative,Nice work, ~player~. You'll be winning soon enough.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,priority:500=embarrassed,Always remember to watch Kyu's movements carefully and <i>stay away</i> from her when her wings change their color.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,priority:500=embarrassed,I can't believe a fairy like Kyu can wear so much white.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,priority:500=angry,A quick warning to anyone who touches Kyu's clothes, if it squishes, burn it.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=happy,Meia, allow me to introduce, Nayru, the Goddess of Wisdom and one third of the creators of Hyrule!

1-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=shocked,Wait! We can leave?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:1=cry,I suppose it was foolishly foolish of me to think you would take off something big, Mia.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1=shy,I mean it's absolutely fin that you're tall...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1=loss,You being tall is absolutely fine, but...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=shy,Well, if I know anything about your type, ~name~. You either appreciate what I do or despise every moment I speak up.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:0=puzzled,I tried to think of a helpful tip to give to people taking off their shoes...
1-female_removing_accessory,alsoPlaying:moon=interested,Remember the rules, ~name~. The ones specifically for you.
1-female_removing_accessory,alsoPlaying:moon=shy,I think you're getting a little <i>too</i> excited here, ~name~.
1-female_removing_accessory,alsoPlaying:moon=cry,D-do we <i>have</i> to see more of ~name~'s body?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=angry,You better not ask for cheat codes. We're not that type of game.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru=puzzled,So, you instructed the Deku Tree about my mission. So that means you're like my boss' boss!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru=calm,I see you had to abandon some of your godly powers to make sure you don't win too easily. Smart.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru=excited,I knew a goddess like you would be smart enough to pick something small like your ~clothing~.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru=interested,If it isn't asking too much, can you tell me where I can get ~clothing~ just like yours?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1=excited,You know, the one sword with the spinning blade?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2=excited,The Great Deku Tree says, "Even the smallest among us, may hold the greatest value."
1-female_removing_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1=interested,I've heard some interesting stories about inns from Link...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=shocked,Wait! Is that the weapon you use to fight evil! Don't you have a sword of something?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>HEY!</i> Is that what you use to defeat evil? It doesn't even have a blade!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=shocked,She's doing that thing again!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=shocked,How many different outfits did she bring?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0=appreciative,You don't to meet a lot of blue haired people in Hyrule, so it's always nice to meet another one.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0=shy,Thank you, Spooky. It's just that, well...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:0=shy,It was no master sword, but it's a shame that you have to lose your weapon.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:3=appreciative,I think I'm growing to like you, ~name~. I like that you use shorter, punchier words to get your point across.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>HEY!</i> ~name~! Your ~clothing~ is burning away!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=puzzled,What kind of fire magic is this?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=interested,Did Din teach you fire magic too, ~name~?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=appreciative,They're called the Gerudo.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=appreciative,They go by, the Gerudo.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=excited,Which sounds <i>really</i> great for a society of women...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=excited,Which sounds like a good deal for both him and the society of women...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan=cry,Not bats! I've been in too many dungeons to want to think about bats!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan=cry,Nobody cast any fire magic! Fire and bats don't mix well.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan=cry,I hate bats! They're tiny, flying, annoying little pests!
1-female_removed_accessory=appreciative,We've been doing this for quite a bit, remember to save before you take a break.
1-female_removed_accessory=interested,And so, the time of your ~clothing~ has passed.
1-female_removed_accessory=cry,Aww... no hidden secrets...
1-female_removed_accessory=shy,Not much of a puzzle, was it?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru=shy,On to the next round. If... that's okay with you, ~name~.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru=shocked,She looks even more radiant without her ~clothing~!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru=appreciative,I know most gods go for something flashier, so it's nice to have a goddess who can do fine with a more... minimalist outfit.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru=embarrassed,Should I tell everyone that we met like this? It seems a little... <i>lewd.</i>
1-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,priority:500=calm,I can't tell if this means I'm a better partner for ~player~ or if ~name~ is winning her own game?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,priority:500=excited,Now just do that a few more times, ~player~, and you'll be bound to win!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,priority:500=appreciative,Don't feel bad for ~name~, ~player~. I'm sure she's <i>enjoying this much more than you think she is</i>.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,priority:500=puzzled,But wait... if ~player~ wins... then ~name~ proves her point, but... I also prove mine... hmmmm...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:3=shocked,I think my eyes just freaked out for a second!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:3=loss,I think I might have had too many milks before I came here, 'cause I keep seeing weird things.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:jasmine,targetStage:6=shocked,Wait! The person in the disguise was a princess the whole time! I didn't see that coming!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:6=interested,You look really nice with your hair down like that.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:6=appreciative,I think your hair looks better long and flowing.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1=shy,I'm pretty sure you were scaring ~player~. He hasn't said a word this whole game!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=calm,They're nice enough, once you defeat them in combat that is.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta=shy,It's nothing too crazy... just a hand... in a very, very strange place.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena=shy,I'm  not saying that I don't think you're an <i>actual</i> goddess, but you did manage to lose to a simple fairy.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena=puzzled,<i>(Is ~name~ actually Farore in disguise? She does have the green hair and a lot of courage for coming here.)</i>
1-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena=puzzled,I swear I've seen Palutena somewhere else before. Somewhere with much less stripping.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena=puzzled,How many extra items are you <i>wearing</i>, ~name~.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena=shy,I know I shouldn't question a goddess, but isn't this a <i>little</i> excessive?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:3=calm,So many accessories... you truly are one of de best at this game, Mia.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=shy,Until it turns out that he turned out to be a being of pure evil who killed my boss...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=angry,Hey! You can't do that! That's cheating!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=puzzled,Well, this is different, but I guess it's what I did.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou=interested,I wish I had a jar, so I could catch some of those butterflies.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou=puzzled,Wait! Are those butterflies or other fairies?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou=puzzled,How do you get all those butterflies to stay in place? Link can barely catch one.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou=happy,Wow! That's actually really pretty!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:daisy=puzzled,Wait... aren't you dating that <i>jerk</i> who took over Lon Lon ranch?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:daisy=excited,<i>HEY</i> I'm Navi!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=shocked,<i>WATCH OUT!</i> One magic transformation and she's a girl with blue hair? What kind of crazy world is this?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=shocked,Wait! What happened to your hair, ~name~? I mean, I like it more now, but still!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2=cry,Careful with the scarf! You might whip someone next time!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:arwen=angry,C'mon, ~player~. Are you going to let all of ~name~'s accessories get in the way of your triumphant victory?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:arwen=appreciative,I'm so sorry you had to lose, Queen ~name~, but the game must go on.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:arwen=shocked,Wow! I've seen princesses strip, but never a queen!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:1=angry,...I didn't.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette=puzzled,I don't know. It just seems like a weird weapon to use.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette=interested,I guess I've seen Link use both a stick and a slingshot, but a yo-yo is still really weird.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2=puzzled,Actually, maybe it's better that you don't start swinging <i>that thing around here...</i>
1-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=calm,That's it.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,alsoPlaying:aimee,alsoPlayingStage:1-7,notSaidMarker:wait,marker:wait=shocked,You can't destroy your clothes! Talk some sense into her, Aimee! Wait... I forgot who I was talking to.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,alsoPlaying:aimee,alsoPlayingStage:1-7,notSaidMarker:wait,marker:wait=shy,What are you going to walk home in? Aimee, tell her this is a bad idea. Wait... never mind, Aimee.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1a=shocked,<i>HEY!</i> Where did you get those clothes!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1a=shocked,<i>HEY!</i> This doesn't mean Link is walking around naked, does it?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:dizzy=calm,Are you okay, ~name~?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:dizzy=shocked,Woah, you look pretty banged up, ~name~! Do you need some milk or something?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:dizzy=shocked,Woah! She looks like she was hit head on with a deku nut.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:4=excited,<i>HEY! LISTEN!</i> I might have a tendency to do that too.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:6=cry,I d-didn't expect you to look so d-different without your r-ribbon.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:6=shy,<i>(Courage, Navi.)</i> I j-just didn't expect <i>monster girl</i> to be taken so <i>literally</i>.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:6=puzzled,Is th-this what you meant by <i>monster girl</i>?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:2=appreciative,I mean... you're all tall to me.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:2=puzzled,It'd be more surprising if there was someone <i>shorter</i> than me here.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:2=shy,I'm not exactly the person to beat in terms of <i>height</i>...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze=shocked,I can't believe it. It just turned to ash.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze=shocked,Wait! If your clothes keep exploding, what are you going to walk home in!

2-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2=excited,The Great Deku Tree says, "Even the smallest among us, may hold the greatest value."
2-female_removing_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1=excited,You know, the one sword with the spinning blade?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=shy,Well, if I know anything about your type, ~name~. You either appreciate what I do or despise every moment I speak up.
2-female_removed_accessory=cry,Playing this game is slower than traveling with Link before he got Epona.
2-female_removed_accessory=appreciative,More small items just means that we get to play for longer!
2-female_removed_accessory=excited,Fearless! Bold! Inspirational! All great words, but not ones I would use for you right now.
2-female_removed_accessory=shy,I think by now, ~player~, you know which button to press, but do you want a reminder anyways?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:2=appreciative,I mean... you're all tall to me.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:2=puzzled,It'd be more surprising if there was someone <i>shorter</i> than me here.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:2=shy,I'm not exactly the person to beat in terms of <i>height</i>...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2=cry,Careful with the scarf! You might whip someone next time!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=shocked,<i>WATCH OUT!</i> One magic transformation and she's a girl with blue hair? What kind of crazy world is this?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=shocked,Wait! What happened to your hair, ~name~? I mean, I like it more now, but still!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:3=shocked,I think my eyes just freaked out for a second!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:3=loss,I think I might have had too many milks before I came here, 'cause I keep seeing weird things.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=shy,Until it turns out that he turned out to be a being of pure evil who killed my boss...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:6=interested,You look really nice with your hair down like that.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:6=appreciative,I think your hair looks better long and flowing.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1a=shocked,<i>HEY!</i> Where did you get those clothes!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1a=shocked,<i>HEY!</i> This doesn't mean Link is walking around naked, does it?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:6=cry,I d-didn't expect you to look so d-different without your r-ribbon.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:6=shy,<i>(Courage, Navi.)</i> I j-just didn't expect <i>monster girl</i> to be taken so <i>literally</i>.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:6=puzzled,Is th-this what you meant by <i>monster girl</i>?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1=shy,I'm pretty sure you were scaring ~player~. He hasn't said a word this whole game!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=calm,They're nice enough, once you defeat them in combat that is.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:dizzy=calm,Are you okay, ~name~?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:dizzy=shocked,Woah, you look pretty banged up, ~name~! Do you need some milk or something?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:dizzy=shocked,Woah! She looks like she was hit head on with a deku nut.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:jasmine,targetStage:6=shocked,Wait! The person in the disguise was a princess the whole time! I didn't see that coming!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena=shy,I'm  not saying that I don't think you're an <i>actual</i> goddess, but you did manage to lose to a simple fairy.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena=puzzled,<i>(Is ~name~ actually Farore in disguise? She does have the green hair and a lot of courage for coming here.)</i>
2-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena=puzzled,I swear I've seen Palutena somewhere else before. Somewhere with much less stripping.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena=puzzled,How many extra items are you <i>wearing</i>, ~name~.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena=shy,I know I shouldn't question a goddess, but isn't this a <i>little</i> excessive?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2=puzzled,Actually, maybe it's better that you don't start swinging <i>that thing around here...</i>
2-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=calm,That's it.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:4=excited,<i>HEY! LISTEN!</i> I might have a tendency to do that too.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,priority:500=calm,I can't tell if this means I'm a better partner for ~player~ or if ~name~ is winning her own game?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,priority:500=excited,Now just do that a few more times, ~player~, and you'll be bound to win!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,priority:500=appreciative,Don't feel bad for ~name~, ~player~. I'm sure she's <i>enjoying this much more than you think she is</i>.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,priority:500=puzzled,But wait... if ~player~ wins... then ~name~ proves her point, but... I also prove mine... hmmmm...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,alsoPlaying:aimee,alsoPlayingStage:1-7,notSaidMarker:wait,marker:wait=shocked,You can't destroy your clothes! Talk some sense into her, Aimee! Wait... I forgot who I was talking to.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,alsoPlaying:aimee,alsoPlayingStage:1-7,notSaidMarker:wait,marker:wait=shy,What are you going to walk home in? Aimee, tell her this is a bad idea. Wait... never mind, Aimee.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=angry,Hey! You can't do that! That's cheating!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=puzzled,Well, this is different, but I guess it's what I did.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:3=calm,So many accessories... you truly are one of de best at this game, Mia.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:arwen=angry,C'mon, ~player~. Are you going to let all of ~name~'s accessories get in the way of your triumphant victory?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:arwen=appreciative,I'm so sorry you had to lose, Queen ~name~, but the game must go on.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:arwen=shocked,Wow! I've seen princesses strip, but never a queen!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze=shocked,I can't believe it. It just turned to ash.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze=shocked,Wait! If your clothes keep exploding, what are you going to walk home in!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette=puzzled,I don't know. It just seems like a weird weapon to use.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette=interested,I guess I've seen Link use both a stick and a slingshot, but a yo-yo is still really weird.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta=shy,It's nothing too crazy... just a hand... in a very, very strange place.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru=shy,On to the next round. If... that's okay with you, ~name~.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru=shocked,She looks even more radiant without her ~clothing~!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru=appreciative,I know most gods go for something flashier, so it's nice to have a goddess who can do fine with a more... minimalist outfit.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru=embarrassed,Should I tell everyone that we met like this? It seems a little... <i>lewd.</i>
2-female_removed_accessory,target:daisy=puzzled,Wait... aren't you dating that <i>jerk</i> who took over Lon Lon ranch?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:daisy=excited,<i>HEY</i> I'm Navi!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou=interested,I wish I had a jar, so I could catch some of those butterflies.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou=puzzled,Wait! Are those butterflies or other fairies?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou=puzzled,How do you get all those butterflies to stay in place? Link can barely catch one.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou=happy,Wow! That's actually really pretty!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:1=angry,...I didn't.

-3-male_removing_accessory=interested,Well... I guess there's nothing wrong with something being <i>small</i>...
-3-male_removing_accessory=shy,We're getting closer and closer to ~name~'s <i>big reveal</i>, aren't we?
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0,marker:dress=excited,Wow! I can't believe I found another person with wings and a dress, just like me!
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0,marker:problem=embarrassed,<i>HEY!</i> Do you have the same problem I do that people constantly look up your dress when flying?
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0,marker:taunt=happy,Wait! I remember you from that one game we were in, ~name~! I was in Link's taunt!
-3-male_removing_accessory,saidMarker:cards,marker:cards=calm,Remember the order is royal flush, straight flush, four of a kind, full house, flush...
-3-male_removed_accessory=calm,There goes your ~clothing~, off to who knows where!
-3-male_removed_accessory=appreciative,Be free, little ~clothing~.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m=calm,It's okay, Corrin. People have called <i>me</i> a pixie too.
-3-male_removed_accessory,saidMarker:cards,notSaidMarker:cards2,marker:cards2=calm,...straight, three of a kind, two pair, one pair, and finally, high card.
-3-female_removing_accessory=cry,You might as well play Zelda's lullaby because I'm falling asleep here!
-3-female_removing_accessory=excited,If it'll serve as a distraction <i>I'M ALL FOR IT</i>!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1=interested,I've heard some interesting stories about inns from Link...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:3=puzzled,Wait. Didn't you date that guy who owns the ranch?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1=excited,You know, the one sword with the spinning blade?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:1=cry,I suppose it was foolishly foolish of me to think you would take off something big, Mia.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan=cry,Not bats! I've been in too many dungeons to want to think about bats!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan=cry,Nobody cast any fire magic! Fire and bats don't mix well.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan=cry,I hate bats! They're tiny, flying, annoying little pests!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,priority:500=appreciative,Nice work, ~player~. You'll be winning soon enough.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,priority:500=embarrassed,Always remember to watch Kyu's movements carefully and <i>stay away</i> from her when her wings change their color.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,priority:500=embarrassed,I can't believe a fairy like Kyu can wear so much white.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,priority:500=angry,A quick warning to anyone who touches Kyu's clothes, if it squishes, burn it.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=shocked,Wait! Is that the weapon you use to fight evil! Don't you have a sword of something?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>HEY!</i> Is that what you use to defeat evil? It doesn't even have a blade!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru=puzzled,So, you instructed the Deku Tree about my mission. So that means you're like my boss' boss!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru=calm,I see you had to abandon some of your godly powers to make sure you don't win too easily. Smart.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru=excited,I knew a goddess like you would be smart enough to pick something small like your ~clothing~.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru=interested,If it isn't asking too much, can you tell me where I can get ~clothing~ just like yours?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=happy,Meia, allow me to introduce, Nayru, the Goddess of Wisdom and one third of the creators of Hyrule!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=shy,Well, if I know anything about your type, ~name~. You either appreciate what I do or despise every moment I speak up.
-3-female_removing_accessory,alsoPlaying:moon=interested,Remember the rules, ~name~. The ones specifically for you.
-3-female_removing_accessory,alsoPlaying:moon=shy,I think you're getting a little <i>too</i> excited here, ~name~.
-3-female_removing_accessory,alsoPlaying:moon=cry,D-do we <i>have</i> to see more of ~name~'s body?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=shocked,Wait! Where are you going!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=shocked,Wait! We can leave?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1=shy,I mean it's absolutely fin that you're tall...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1=loss,You being tall is absolutely fine, but...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=angry,You better not ask for cheat codes. We're not that type of game.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=shocked,She's doing that thing again!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=shocked,How many different outfits did she bring?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2=excited,The Great Deku Tree says, "Even the smallest among us, may hold the greatest value."
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:0=puzzled,I tried to think of a helpful tip to give to people taking off their shoes...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=puzzled,I feel like there's a really obvious joke to make here, but I just can't think of it.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:3=appreciative,I think I'm growing to like you, ~name~. I like that you use shorter, punchier words to get your point across.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:0=shy,It was no master sword, but it's a shame that you have to lose your weapon.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=appreciative,They're called the Gerudo.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=appreciative,They go by, the Gerudo.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>HEY!</i> ~name~! Your ~clothing~ is burning away!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=puzzled,What kind of fire magic is this?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=interested,Did Din teach you fire magic too, ~name~?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0=appreciative,You don't to meet a lot of blue haired people in Hyrule, so it's always nice to meet another one.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0=shy,Thank you, Spooky. It's just that, well...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=excited,Which sounds <i>really</i> great for a society of women...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=excited,Which sounds like a good deal for both him and the society of women...
-3-female_removed_accessory=calm,It's always nicer when the jokes flow naturally rather than have us try and force them.
-3-female_removed_accessory=cry,Convincing you people to take off something important is harder than completing the water temple.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou=interested,I wish I had a jar, so I could catch some of those butterflies.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou=puzzled,Wait! Are those butterflies or other fairies?

-2-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>HEY!</i> Is that what you use to defeat evil? It doesn't even have a blade!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:1=cry,I suppose it was foolishly foolish of me to think you would take off something big, Mia.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0=shy,Thank you, Spooky. It's just that, well...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:0=shy,It was no master sword, but it's a shame that you have to lose your weapon.

-2-female_removing_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1=interested,I've heard some interesting stories about inns from Link...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru=puzzled,So, you instructed the Deku Tree about my mission. So that means you're like my boss' boss!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru=calm,I see you had to abandon some of your godly powers to make sure you don't win too easily. Smart.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru=excited,I knew a goddess like you would be smart enough to pick something small like your ~clothing~.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru=interested,If it isn't asking too much, can you tell me where I can get ~clothing~ just like yours?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,priority:500=appreciative,Nice work, ~player~. You'll be winning soon enough.

-2-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,priority:500=embarrassed,I can't believe a fairy like Kyu can wear so much white.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,priority:500=angry,A quick warning to anyone who touches Kyu's clothes, if it squishes, burn it.

-2-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan=cry,Not bats! I've been in too many dungeons to want to think about bats!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan=cry,Nobody cast any fire magic! Fire and bats don't mix well.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan=cry,I hate bats! They're tiny, flying, annoying little pests!

-2-female_removed_accessory=shy,It's a shame that women don't use <i>visuals</i> as much as men do when... <i>doing this...</i>
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:1=angry,...I didn't.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:4=excited,<i>HEY! LISTEN!</i> I might have a tendency to do that too.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou=interested,I wish I had a jar, so I could catch some of those butterflies.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou=puzzled,Wait! Are those butterflies or other fairies?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou=puzzled,How do you get all those butterflies to stay in place? Link can barely catch one.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou=happy,Wow! That's actually really pretty!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:arwen=angry,C'mon, ~player~. Are you going to let all of ~name~'s accessories get in the way of your triumphant victory?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:arwen=appreciative,I'm so sorry you had to lose, Queen ~name~, but the game must go on.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:arwen=shocked,Wow! I've seen princesses strip, but never a queen!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta=shy,It's nothing too crazy... just a hand... in a very, very strange place.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:daisy=puzzled,Wait... aren't you dating that <i>jerk</i> who took over Lon Lon ranch?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:daisy=excited,<i>HEY</i> I'm Navi!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze=shocked,I can't believe it. It just turned to ash.

-2-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2=cry,Careful with the scarf! You might whip someone next time!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena=shy,I'm  not saying that I don't think you're an <i>actual</i> goddess, but you did manage to lose to a simple fairy.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena=puzzled,<i>(Is ~name~ actually Farore in disguise? She does have the green hair and a lot of courage for coming here.)</i>
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena=puzzled,I swear I've seen Palutena somewhere else before. Somewhere with much less stripping.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena=puzzled,How many extra items are you <i>wearing</i>, ~name~.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena=shy,I know I shouldn't question a goddess, but isn't this a <i>little</i> excessive?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=calm,That's it.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:6=interested,You look really nice with your hair down like that.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:6=appreciative,I think your hair looks better long and flowing.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette=puzzled,I don't know. It just seems like a weird weapon to use.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette=interested,I guess I've seen Link use both a stick and a slingshot, but a yo-yo is still really weird.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:3=calm,So many accessories... you truly are one of de best at this game, Mia.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:3=shocked,I think my eyes just freaked out for a second!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:3=loss,I think I might have had too many milks before I came here, 'cause I keep seeing weird things.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=angry,Hey! You can't do that! That's cheating!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=puzzled,Well, this is different, but I guess it's what I did.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1=shy,I'm pretty sure you were scaring ~player~. He hasn't said a word this whole game!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru=shy,On to the next round. If... that's okay with you, ~name~.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru=shocked,She looks even more radiant without her ~clothing~!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru=appreciative,I know most gods go for something flashier, so it's nice to have a goddess who can do fine with a more... minimalist outfit.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru=embarrassed,Should I tell everyone that we met like this? It seems a little... <i>lewd.</i>
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:2=appreciative,I mean... you're all tall to me.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:2=puzzled,It'd be more surprising if there was someone <i>shorter</i> than me here.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:2=shy,I'm not exactly the person to beat in terms of <i>height</i>...

-2-female_removed_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2=puzzled,Actually, maybe it's better that you don't start swinging <i>that thing around here...</i>
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,priority:500=calm,I can't tell if this means I'm a better partner for ~player~ or if ~name~ is winning her own game?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,priority:500=excited,Now just do that a few more times, ~player~, and you'll be bound to win!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,priority:500=appreciative,Don't feel bad for ~name~, ~player~. I'm sure she's <i>enjoying this much more than you think she is</i>.

-2-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:dizzy=shocked,Woah! She looks like she was hit head on with a deku nut.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=calm,They're nice enough, once you defeat them in combat that is.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=shy,Until it turns out that he turned out to be a being of pure evil who killed my boss...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=shocked,<i>WATCH OUT!</i> One magic transformation and she's a girl with blue hair? What kind of crazy world is this?

-1-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1=shy,I'm pretty sure you were scaring ~player~. He hasn't said a word this whole game!

-1-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,priority:500=calm,I can't tell if this means I'm a better partner for ~player~ or if ~name~ is winning her own game?

-1-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,priority:500=appreciative,Don't feel bad for ~name~, ~player~. I'm sure she's <i>enjoying this much more than you think she is</i>.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,priority:500=puzzled,But wait... if ~player~ wins... then ~name~ proves her point, but... I also prove mine... hmmmm...

-1-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:6=interested,You look really nice with your hair down like that.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:6=appreciative,I think your hair looks better long and flowing.




#OPPONENT REMOVING MINOR CLOTHING
#Minor pieces of clothing don't reveal much when removed, but probably indicate more progress than accessory removal.

#fully clothed
0-male_removing_minor=cry,It does feel awkward being the only ball of light here...
0-male_removing_minor=puzzled,Could someone make a bed from their clothing? My wings are tired.
0-male_removing_minor=calm,Mph...
0-male_removed_minor=horny,Next round and things are getting good!
0-male_removed_minor=calm,Maybe next round you'll see me strip. Maybe not.
0-male_removed_minor=calm,Let's hope you can get a better grasp at poker by the next round, ~name~.
0-female_removing_minor=angry,Hurry up, ~name~! We don't have <i>all day.</i>
0-female_removing_minor=happy,This is where the action really is!
0-female_removing_minor=happy,If you need some extra light, I can come over there.
0-female_removing_minor,target:miko,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>HEY!</i> Who's that weird ghost looking girl, Miko?
0-female_removed_minor=calm,This must be another place where time doesn't flow correctly.
0-female_removed_minor=calm,You didn't really need your ~clothing~, anyways.
0-female_removed_minor=calm,I'm sure your inventory was getting full anyways.
0-female_removed_minor,target:miko,targetStage:1=angry,I'm asking the same question! Who's she?


#lost light
1-male_removing_minor=appreciative,As a fairy, I know there are plenty of things you can live without. Such as your ~clothing~.
1-male_removing_minor=interested,Listen! You can hear everyone's bated breath.
1-male_removing_minor=excited,I'm not <i>extremely</i> excited for this round. I'm only <i>fairy-ly</i> excited.
1-male_removing_minor=embarrassed,Don't worry, I won't watch. Okay... I <i>might</i> watch.
1-male_removing_minor,target:link=interested,Since our current stripper isn't much of a talker, I'll try filling in for him.
1-male_removing_minor,target:link=interested,Don't worry, I'll fill in with my best Link impression.
1-male_removing_minor,target:link=calm,I'm used to Link's lack of voice, so I'll translate. <i>*Ahem*</i>
1-male_removed_minor=excited,Look, look, ~player~. You can already see how close I am to winning!
1-male_removed_minor=angry,This is where the <i>real</i> adventure begins.
1-male_removed_minor=happy,Consider yourself a Dodongo, because I bet you don't like getting smoked!
1-male_removed_minor=excited,My heart's beating faster than my wings!
1-male_removed_minor,target:pit=happy,Careful, the floor's a little cold, you should just fly above it instead!
1-male_removed_minor,target:pit=puzzled,I've been meaning to ask, ~name~, why aren't you flying around like me instead of having to stay on the cold ground?
1-male_removed_minor,target:link=embarrassed,*ahem* <i>Oh no! Not my ~clothing~!</i>
1-male_removed_minor,target:link=cry,*ahem* <i>I should have saved first.</i>
1-male_removed_minor,target:link=cry,*ahem* <i>This is more embarrassing than that time I died to cuccos... or the other time... or the other time...</i>
1-male_removed_minor,target:link=appreciative,*ahem* <i>I would never have lost this round if I had my best partner and greatest friend of all time, Navi, at my side.</i>
1-female_removing_minor=interested,You never know what's around the corner!
1-female_removing_minor=embarrassed,Aww... you don't need your ~clothing~ anyways.
1-female_removing_minor=shy,I like your ~clothing~, ~name~. Of course, if everything you wore was completely blue...
1-female_removing_minor,target:nayru=interested,Get going Miss Goddess, wouldn't want to make your subjects unhappy!
1-female_removing_minor,target:nayru=interested,It's nice that you're trying to give ~player~ a chance for my sake.
1-female_removing_minor,target:nayru=angry,~player~! Thank ~name~ for allowing you to survive another round.
1-female_removing_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,saidMarker:picture,notSaidMarker:picture2,marker:picture2=shy,So, I figured that maybe you could take one of me, now.
1-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:innuendo=excited,That's right! Kyu can also keep talking and ruin the reputation of fairy kind!
1-female_removing_minor,target:miko,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>HEY!</i> Who's that weird ghost looking girl, Miko?
1-female_removing_minor,target:aella,targetStage:2=shy,Link and I go into dungeon after dungeon on our adventures and I was just wondering...
1-female_removing_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2=puzzled,Do you always wear armor when you go out to things, Corrin?
1-female_removing_minor,target:jolyne,targetStage:1=appreciative,The Gerudo locked us up for trespassing, but it was really easy to get out.
1-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2=angry,~player~ would never enjoy something like <i>that</i>!
1-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2=embarrassed,No Kyu, ~player~ is not into that. You're projecting, again.
1-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2=angry,I'm not even entirely sure what you're suggesting, but I can assure you, ~player~ is not <i>into that</i>!
1-female_removing_minor,notSaidMarker:shot,marker:hook=puzzled,Y'know, there aren't many things that are cooler than Link's hookshot...
1-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3=happy,Looks like Kyu can't talk for a bit. Wonderful!
1-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3=interested,I wonder if there's any way to <i>keep</i> that glove in her mouth?
1-female_removing_minor,target:alpha,saidMarker:roll,notSaidMarker:roll2,marker:roll2=calm,...as it rolls arooouund and arooouund...
1-female_removing_minor,target:aimee=cry,Duck! Roll! Sidestep! Just get out of the way!
1-female_removing_minor,target:aimee=cry,What kind of fire magic is this?
1-female_removing_minor,target:aimee=cry,Why can't you just strip like everyone else!
1-female_removing_minor,target:aimee=cry,Please! I don't have that much health left!
1-female_removing_minor,target:aimee=cry,Hey! I <i>don't</i> turn out to be evil! I promise!
1-female_removed_minor=happy,Oh boy! Next round!
1-female_removed_minor=interested,Don't you feel so much lighter, ~name~?
1-female_removed_minor=angry,What the H-E-double deku sticks was that?
1-female_removed_minor=angry,No offense, but keep removing stuff like that and people will be less expressive than a redead.
1-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:3=puzzled,Armor just doesn't seem like the kind of thing you should be wearing to something like <i>this</i>...
1-female_removed_minor,saidMarker:hook,notSaidMarker:shot,marker:shot=interested,I've only been able to think of one thing and it's a long shot!
1-female_removed_minor,target:nayru=happy,It's a shame that you had to lose such a beautiful garment, ~name~.
1-female_removed_minor,target:nayru=shocked,Your dress is so pretty! I wish that I could own something like that!
1-female_removed_minor,target:nayru=appreciative,I'm sure a goddess such as yourself has more tunics than I could ever imagine.
1-female_removed_minor,target:misato=puzzled,Is that a scar? I'm not used to battle damage being a factor.
1-female_removed_minor,target:misato=shocked,Woah! A scar! Don't worry, a couple of fairies and some milk and we'll have you good as new!
1-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:innuendo=happy,Oh, I'm sure there's a joke in this game, <i>Kyu</i>. I'm very sure...
1-female_removed_minor,target:clover=happy,Cheer up, ~name~. You rolled snake eyes this turn, but I'm sure the next time will be your ace in the hole!
1-female_removed_minor,target:clover=interested,If you need any extra help on solving puzzles in rooms, ~name~, <i>I think I know a guy</i>,
1-female_removed_minor,target:clover=embarrassed,It looks like ~name~'s going to need a little extra luck.
1-female_removed_minor,target:alpha,saidMarker:roll2,notSaidMarker:roll3,marker:roll3=calm,...and comes out here.
1-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3=happy,Is everyone happy now? I'm sure Kyu is.
1-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3=interested,Let's hurry to the next round. I'm not sure that the our <i>other</i> can <i>keep it in her socks.</i>
1-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=puzzled,What did you do, ~name~? Touch the lava in Death Mountain!
1-female_removed_minor,target:miko,targetStage:1=angry,I'm asking the same question! Who's she?
1-female_removed_minor,target:aella,targetStage:3=excited,It's amazing to meet a fellow adventurer!
1-female_removed_minor,target:aella,targetStage:3=excited,Wow, Aella! It's great to finally be with another adventurer!
1-female_removed_minor,target:jolyne,targetStage:2=angry,Life in prison... it <i>changes</i> a fairy...
1-female_removed_minor,target:catria,targetStage:4=shy,I think I might need a breast plate like that, too...
1-female_removed_minor,target:catria,targetStage:4=embarrassed,<i>(Not to self: Find a forgery that can do fairy sized breastplates.)</i>
1-female_removed_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:3,saidMarker:picture2=happy,And then you can show it off to everybody!
1-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4=happy,Leave the meta commentary to the helpful characters, Kyu.
1-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4=appreciative,Check your controller, ~player~. Maybe there's a button that can turn off Kyu's <i>delightful</i> meta commentary.

-2-male_removing_minor,target:link=interested,Don't worry, I'll fill in with my best Link impression.

-2-male_removed_minor,target:pit=puzzled,I've been meaning to ask, ~name~, why aren't you flying around like me instead of having to stay on the cold ground?
-2-female_removing_minor=excited,I'll have you know that I taught Link everything he knows about this stuff!
-2-female_removing_minor=excited,I'm an expert here, taught Link everything he knows.
-2-female_removing_minor=happy,Link learned everything he knows about <i>this stuff</i> from me.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:aimee=cry,Duck! Roll! Sidestep! Just get out of the way!
-2-female_removing_minor,target:aimee=cry,What kind of fire magic is this?

#OPPONENT REMOVING MAJOR CLOTHING
#Major clothing reveals a significant amount of skin and likely underwear.
#However, as we don't know if the opponent is taking off the top or the bottom, we can't presume that nice abs are showing; maybe she took of her skirt before her shirt.

#fully clothed
0-male_removing_major=happy,Now this should be an adventure!
0-male_removing_major=puzzled,What? Are you waiting for the Moon to fall?
0-male_removed_major=horny,So that's what it looks like... <i>under there</i>.
0-male_removed_major=shocked,Wooaahh! I didn't know that looked like that!
0-male_removed_major=horny,If you do happen to like hints, ~name~... <i>I'm not really doing anything after this...</i>
0-female_removing_major=calm,Press the A button to discard your ~clothing~.

0-female_removed_major=happy,What a thrill! Such courage!

1-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:3=puzzled,What kind of question is that?
1-female_removing_major,target:morrigan=cry,Not these things again!
1-female_removing_major,target:morrigan=cry,Why couldn't your outfit be made of something nicer? Like plants or <i>not bats?</i>
1-female_removing_major,target:morrigan=cry,Hurry, ~player~! Use Z targeting on the bats and shoot them with an arrow or something!
1-female_removing_major,target:beatrix=embarrassed,I really think the two of us should have brought more items.

1-female_removing_major,target:spooky,targetStage:1=interested,Plus, the dress you're removing makes you look cute.
1-female_removing_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5=shy,I hope you remembered to save before this one, Chiaki.
1-female_removing_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5=appreciative,No skirt and soon no shirt. I hope you saved this time, Chiaki.

1-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=shocked,Oh! Link knows all about masks! What powers does your mask give you?
1-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=shocked,Link knows a lot more about masks than me. What does yours do?
1-female_removing_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:3=shy,I was wondering if they happened to have an <i>ultimate sidekick</i>?
1-female_removing_major,target:shimakaze=shocked,Another explosion! Are you still okay, ~name~!
1-female_removing_major,target:shimakaze=puzzled,Are your clothes filled with <i>bombs</i>?
1-female_removing_major,target:shimakaze=puzzled,You would think the girl who looks like a rabbit would <i>learn to keep things down</i>.
1-female_removing_major,target:shimakaze=shocked,More explosions! It's so loud here!
1-female_removed_major=excited,I get it now! The excitement! This is great!

1-female_removed_major=loss,I... um... I'm at a loss for words...
1-female_removed_major=appreciative,I bet you wish you had a fairy in a bottle right now, huh?
1-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2=excited,I'm great with keeping secrets like these! Like when I promised Link I wouldn't tell anyone about what he keeps under his pill... oops...
1-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2=happy,Don't worry I'm great with secrets. I haven't told a single person that Sheik is actually Zelda is disgui... phooey.
1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2=appreciative,Few. At least this time it wasn't secretly Princess Zelda.
1-female_removed_major,target:beatrix=shy,Well... I guess the doctor would be smart enough to wear a bra under her dress. Unlike... someone else...
1-female_removed_major,target:catria,targetStage:5=embarrassed,Oh! I... <i>thought you knew already...</i>
1-female_removed_major,target:catria,targetStage:5=puzzled,I'm probably not getting an extra points for forgetting to mention <i>that</i> little detail.
1-female_removed_major,target:sei=interested,Woah... Sei. Are you doing alright? We might need to cut you off.
1-female_removed_major,target:sei=shocked,Who keeps giving her all these drinks? I think we need them to cut her off.
1-female_removed_major,target:nayru=interested,We're down to the bare bones, I see.
1-female_removed_major,target:nayru=excited,This is the part where she beats all of us with her infinite godly wisdom!
1-female_removed_major,target:nayru=puzzled,I don't know if a goddess should be losing this much.
1-female_removed_major,target:mia,targetStage:4=shocked,Wow! Your bra is blacker than a moonless night!
1-female_removed_major,target:daria,targetStage:4=appreciative,Oh! I remember Link talking about how he used to conduct a Twain in another life.
1-female_removed_major,target:weiss,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:ruby=puzzled,That didn't see much like a ~clothing~, but more like a skirt... designed for... combat. Maybe Ruby can tell us more about it?
1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:zelda=shocked,<i>HEY!</i> Isn't that the same trick you used, Princess?
1-female_removed_major,target:clover=appreciative,Better check that watch, ~name~, 'cause it looks like time is running out.
1-female_removed_major,target:clover=puzzled,Why didn't you just remove that little bracelet you have on? Is it magic or something?
1-female_removed_major,target:spooky,targetStage:2=cry,Ah! Was that the wrong thing to say!
1-female_removed_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:4=interested,Because if they are... I wouldn't mind attending.
1-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:4=puzzled,That's a pretty strange item to keep in your inventory.
1-female_removed_major,target:launch,targetStage:6=shy,Awww... I liked the other one better...
1-female_removed_major,target:launch,targetStage:6=shocked,<i>HEY!</i> What happened to you?
1-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:shimakaze,alsoPlayingStage:1-10,notSaidMarker:wait,marker:wait=shy,~name~! You can't destroy your clothes. Shimakaze, tell... her... that... uh... wait... I don't think you're the right person for that.
1-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:shimakaze,alsoPlayingStage:1-10,notSaidMarker:wait,marker:wait=embarrassed,If you keep doing this then... then... Shimakaze, talk some sense into... wait... on second thought, not the right person for that.

-1-female_removed_major=puzzled,<i>(I wonder if I looked that good after stripping?)</i>
-1-female_removed_major,target:clover=appreciative,Better check that watch, ~name~, 'cause it looks like time is running out.
-1-female_removed_major,target:clover=puzzled,Why didn't you just remove that little bracelet you have on? Is it magic or something?
-1-female_removed_major,target:nayru=interested,We're down to the bare bones, I see.
-1-female_removed_major,target:nayru=excited,This is the part where she beats all of us with her infinite godly wisdom!
-1-female_removed_major,target:nayru=puzzled,I don't know if a goddess should be losing this much.
-1-female_removed_major,target:sei=interested,Woah... Sei. Are you doing alright? We might need to cut you off.
-1-female_removed_major,target:sei=shocked,Who keeps giving her all these drinks? I think we need them to cut her off.
-1-female_removed_major,saidMarker:pickup,notSaidMarker:line,marker:line=interested,Sorry about that... I picked up a nervous habit Link always had talking to girls...
-1-female_removed_major,saidMarker:pickup,notSaidMarker:line,marker:line=shy,That's what Link always says to the girls he meets. Doesn't usually work though...
-1-female_removed_major,saidMarker:pickup,notSaidMarker:line,marker:line=shy,That was Link's pick-up line for every girl he meets. Princess Ruto liked it <i>aaaand</i> that's about it.
-1-female_removed_major,target:beatrix=shy,Well... I guess the doctor would be smart enough to wear a bra under her dress. Unlike... someone else...
-1-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:shimakaze,alsoPlayingStage:1-10,notSaidMarker:wait,marker:wait=shy,~name~! You can't destroy your clothes. Shimakaze, tell... her... that... uh... wait... I don't think you're the right person for that.
-1-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:shimakaze,alsoPlayingStage:1-10,notSaidMarker:wait,marker:wait=embarrassed,If you keep doing this then... then... Shimakaze, talk some sense into... wait... on second thought, not the right person for that.
-1-female_removed_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:4=interested,Because if they are... I wouldn't mind attending.
-1-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:4=puzzled,That's a pretty strange item to keep in your inventory.
-1-female_removed_major,target:mia,targetStage:4=shocked,Wow! Your bra is blacker than a moonless night!
-1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:zelda=shocked,<i>HEY!</i> Isn't that the same trick you used, Princess?
-1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2=appreciative,Few. At least this time it wasn't secretly Princess Zelda.
-1-female_removed_major,target:weiss,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:ruby=puzzled,That didn't see much like a ~clothing~, but more like a skirt... designed for... combat. Maybe Ruby can tell us more about it?
-1-female_removed_major,target:catria,targetStage:5=embarrassed,Oh! I... <i>thought you knew already...</i>
-1-female_removed_major,target:catria,targetStage:5=puzzled,I'm probably not getting an extra points for forgetting to mention <i>that</i> little detail.
-1-female_removed_major,target:launch,targetStage:6=shy,Awww... I liked the other one better...
-1-female_removed_major,target:launch,targetStage:6=shocked,<i>HEY!</i> What happened to you?
-1-female_removed_major,target:spooky,targetStage:2=cry,Ah! Was that the wrong thing to say!
-1-female_removed_major,target:daria,targetStage:4=appreciative,Oh! I remember Link talking about how he used to conduct a Twain in another life.
-1-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2=excited,I'm great with keeping secrets like these! Like when I promised Link I wouldn't tell anyone about what he keeps under his pill... oops...
-1-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2=happy,Don't worry I'm great with secrets. I haven't told a single person that Sheik is actually Zelda is disgui... phooey.

1-male_chest_will_be_visible=cry,Wait! There wasn't any tutorial on how to react to this!
1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:link,targetStage:3=cry,Wait, Link! What are you doing!
1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:link,targetStage:3=cry,Link! Stop! I can't get fired, I'm only in one mainline game!
1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=excited,I've become an expert on male anatomy for this game, so let's see that chest, ~name~!
1-male_chest_is_visible=calm,It's okay, ~name~, I don't really have breasts either.
1-male_chest_is_visible=puzzled,Hm... there's a lot less hair than I thought there'd be.
1-male_chest_is_visible,target:link,targetStage:4=angry,Great! This is why they didn't want me back for that mask game, you know!
1-male_chest_is_visible,target:link,targetStage:4=cry,Please, Nintendo! He doesn't know what he's doing! I'll get him to be quiet, just let me be in a game, please!
1-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=cry,Wait! ~name~! Where are your nipples! I could have sworn men had those!
1-male_chest_is_visible,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:eggs=angry,C'mon Kyu! Knock it off! We're representing all of fairy kind here!
1-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton,saidMarker:breasts=puzzled,So... I guess they do have breasts after all.
1-male_chest_is_visible,saidMarker:breasts,notSaidMarker:breasts1,marker:breasts1=interested,Asked and answered, I suppose.

1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:link=shy,I know this is a very big moment for you, Link, but wouldn't it be better if you took it all in, <i>silently?</i>
1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:link=cry,Enough with the build up! Do you know what happens to fairies like me on the mean streets of Kakariko village?
1-male_small_crotch_is_visible=embarrassed,I guess I thought they were... <i>bigger</i>.
1-male_small_crotch_is_visible=happy,Aww! It's fairy sized!
1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=loss,Is that size... <i>normal</i>?

1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:link=angry,Great! It's all out there, but we don't have to talk about it <i>at all</i>.
1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:link=angry,He just keeps <i>talking and talking</i>! Honestly, who talks this much? It's starting to get really annoying.

1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:felicia=interested,That's... an interesting way to strip, ~name~. Try not to clip something...
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mia=angry,...Finally, you just couldn't resist, could you, Mia?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:nayru=interested,It's a shame you had to lose, ~name~, but we do get to see your breasts in exchange.

1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:spooky=cry,<i>WAIT!</i> I meant because you're a ghost who levitates! Not because of your <i>size</i>.

1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:spooky=cry,I would never say something like that. We're basically blue-skinned sisters in <i>that</i> department.
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:weiss,alsoPlaying:ruby=horny,You may no longer have your ~clothing~, but I'm sure the rest of your team will always support you!
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:weiss,alsoPlaying:ruby=interested,Getting a little red, aren't we ~name~?
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible=happy,The real evil is that you would feel shame with <i>those</i> breasts!
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible=calm,Very worthy.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:nayru=shocked,Are y-you okay, ~name~? Are you having an off day?
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:nayru=shocked,You've lost quite a bit, ~name~. Is something wrong?
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:nayru=horny,I did not think that a goddess would be showing me her breasts, but here we are.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=loss,That's a little too close for comfort!
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=shocked,Did you get hurt? I have some milk if you need it!

1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,notSaidMarker:trick,marker:trick=puzzled,Was that supposed to happen?
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aella=excited,It's okay, ~name~. I'm here without a bra too!
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aella=excited,It's alright to have come braless. I did the same!
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:arwen=embarrassed,Y-your majesty...
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:arwen=embarrassed,Your skin shines so majestically against your black hair...
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale=angry,The moment I'm sure ~player~ has been waiting far too long for.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale=appreciative,Phew. Now you can finally get rid of that sweaty thing.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale=embarrassed,I know you were a little sweaty, ~name~, so hopefully the breeze from my wings doesn't <i>you know. Since they're uncovered now...</i>
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:clover=horny,There go ~name~'s clovers...
1-female_large_chest_is_visible=puzzled,Those are a lot less... pointy... than I thought they'd be.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible=shocked,Woah! What kind of magic makes <i>that</i> happen?
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:mia=shocked,Woah! I guess today, we play <i>your</i> way!
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:palutena=interested,With all her human supporters, I guess ~name~ didn't feel the need for a bra.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible=excited,There's no turning back now!
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible=embarrassed,I can't even imagine...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=angry,It's always bad when the person with the weapon makes a mistake...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=loss,Wait! Something's wrong!
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=cry,Why didn't you use your z-targeting, Aimee?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:remilia=shocked,Where did all those-!
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nayru=puzzled,Wait a minute...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nayru=puzzled,Hold on a second...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:arwen=shy,Kind of makes you wish you could just... turn invisible. Right, ~name~?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:arwen=angry,I'm sorry, ~name~, there's no cheat code or magic item to get you out of this one.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:arwen=shy,It could be worse, ~name~. There could be some looming presence that watches our every move and rea- <i>*cough* listens</i> to every word we say.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight=puzzled,What goddess determined that order?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,notSaidMarker:field,marker:field=calm,It's probably going to look like Hyrule Field.
1-female_crotch_is_visible=cry,I w-won't have to do that... right?
1-female_crotch_is_visible=embarrassed,This could be good information... for... later...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=embarrassed,Oh... it seems to have... hmmm...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=shy,That... <i>didn't seem planned...</i>
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:elaine=embarrassed,What's that weird mark on your... your... um... <i>rear</i>?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=shocked,You aren't going to shave your head next time you lose? It's so lush and <i>blue</i>!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=shy,I'm sure <i>someone</i> could think of a joke for this moment, but I can't think of anything.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale=shocked,That's an interesting choice, ~name~. Way to shake things up!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale=happy,<i>WATCH OUT!</i> ~name~'s going off the books!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jolyne=shocked,It seems Jolyne doesn't have all of her *necessary items*.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jolyne=embarrassed,I'd give you a hint, Joylne, but I think you already know what went wrong...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mahiru=shocked,I can't believe you decided to keep your camera for so long!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mahiru=excited,It takes a lot of courage to be where you are, ~name~ and to still keep an important item by your side.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=loss,Oh no! It looks like you've been infected with Ganondorf's evil!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=cry,It smells worse than the inside of Jabu Jabu!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=loss,Not even the Great King of Evil himself, frightens me as much as whatever ~name~ has just shown us.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=loss,I can't believe the number of horrifying moons that Link has seen is so long that we've had to start a list.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:remilia=embarrassed,I... don't think that's how that's supposed to happen...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:cammy=shocked,Oh no! Looks like your leotard got ripped in that fight!

2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:weiss,alsoPlaying:ruby=horny,You may no longer have your ~clothing~, but I'm sure the rest of your team will always support you!
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:weiss,alsoPlaying:ruby=interested,Getting a little red, aren't we ~name~?
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:spooky=cry,I would never say something like that. We're basically blue-skinned sisters in <i>that</i> department.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:natsuki=happy,Our time will come eventually, ~name~.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:natsuki=angry,The world just isn't ready for <i>chests</i> like ours, ~name~.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible=embarrassed,It looks like our destinies were the same here.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible=appreciative,It's okay, ~name~. I'm here with you!
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:arwen=embarrassed,Y-your majesty...
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:arwen=embarrassed,Your skin shines so majestically against your black hair...
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:nayru=shocked,Are y-you okay, ~name~? Are you having an off day?
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:nayru=shocked,You've lost quite a bit, ~name~. Is something wrong?
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:nayru=horny,I did not think that a goddess would be showing me her breasts, but here we are.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=loss,That's a little too close for comfort!
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=shocked,Did you get hurt? I have some milk if you need it!
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sanako=shy,Your... <i>womanly ways</i> look really nice, Sanako.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aella=excited,It's okay, ~name~. I'm here without a bra too!
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aella=excited,It's alright to have come braless. I did the same!
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale=angry,The moment I'm sure ~player~ has been waiting far too long for.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale=appreciative,Phew. Now you can finally get rid of that sweaty thing.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale=embarrassed,I know you were a little sweaty, ~name~, so hopefully the breeze from my wings doesn't <i>you know. Since they're uncovered now...</i>
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,notSaidMarker:trick,marker:trick=horny,Woah! What a wonderful bit of magic!
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,notSaidMarker:trick,marker:trick=puzzled,Was that supposed to happen?
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:clover=horny,There go ~name~'s clovers...
2-female_large_chest_is_visible=shocked,Watch out, Impa! I found competition!
2-female_large_chest_is_visible=shocked,~name~, you've grown!
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:palutena=interested,With all her human supporters, I guess ~name~ didn't feel the need for a bra.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:mia=shocked,Woah! I guess today, we play <i>your</i> way!
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible=embarrassed,I'm sorta... glad I'm not <i>there</i> yet.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible=embarrassed,You probably don't need any hints on how to do this...
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:remilia=shocked,Where did all those-!
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=angry,It's always bad when the person with the weapon makes a mistake...
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=loss,Wait! Something's wrong!
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=cry,Why didn't you use your z-targeting, Aimee?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,notSaidMarker:field,marker:field=calm,It's probably going to look like Hyrule Field.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight=puzzled,What goddess determined that order?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:arwen=shy,Kind of makes you wish you could just... turn invisible. Right, ~name~?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:arwen=angry,I'm sorry, ~name~, there's no cheat code or magic item to get you out of this one.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:arwen=shy,It could be worse, ~name~. There could be some looming presence that watches our every move and rea- <i>*cough* listens</i> to every word we say.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nayru=puzzled,Wait a minute...
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nayru=puzzled,Hold on a second...
2-female_crotch_is_visible=shy,I don't think I can look.
2-female_crotch_is_visible=interested,<i>We definitely won't need a mystic lens now...</i>
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:remilia=embarrassed,I... don't think that's how that's supposed to happen...
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:elaine=embarrassed,What's that weird mark on your... your... um... <i>rear</i>?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=shocked,You aren't going to shave your head next time you lose? It's so lush and <i>blue</i>!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=shy,I'm sure <i>someone</i> could think of a joke for this moment, but I can't think of anything.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=loss,Oh no! It looks like you've been infected with Ganondorf's evil!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=cry,It smells worse than the inside of Jabu Jabu!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=loss,Not even the Great King of Evil himself, frightens me as much as whatever ~name~ has just shown us.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=loss,I can't believe the number of horrifying moons that Link has seen is so long that we've had to start a list.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mahiru=shocked,I can't believe you decided to keep your camera for so long!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mahiru=excited,It takes a lot of courage to be where you are, ~name~ and to still keep an important item by your side.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:cammy=shocked,Oh no! Looks like your leotard got ripped in that fight!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jolyne=shocked,It seems Jolyne doesn't have all of her *necessary items*.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jolyne=embarrassed,I'd give you a hint, Joylne, but I think you already know what went wrong...
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:nayru=angry,You aren't the <i>real</i> Nayru!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:nayru=angry,You aren't an actual goddess!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=embarrassed,Oh... it seems to have... hmmm...
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=shy,That... <i>didn't seem planned...</i>
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale=shocked,That's an interesting choice, ~name~. Way to shake things up!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale=happy,<i>WATCH OUT!</i> ~name~'s going off the books!

-3-male_chest_will_be_visible=interested,Are you going to take off your... ~clothing~?
-3-male_chest_will_be_visible=horny,<i>HEY</i>! D-don't remove your ~clothing~ too fast... you may get dizzy...
-3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=excited,I've become an expert on male anatomy for this game, so let's see that chest, ~name~!
-3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:link,targetStage:3=cry,Wait, Link! What are you doing!
-3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:link,targetStage:3=cry,Link! Stop! I can't get fired, I'm only in one mainline game!
-3-male_chest_is_visible=interested,Doesn't matter is you're battling monsters or playing strip poker... it's fantastic when the enemy reveals their chest.
-3-male_chest_is_visible=embarrassed,Nothing wrong with showing <i>a lot</i> of skin...
-3-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=cry,Wait! ~name~! Where are your nipples! I could have sworn men had those!
-3-male_chest_is_visible,target:link,targetStage:4=angry,Great! This is why they didn't want me back for that mask game, you know!
-3-male_chest_is_visible,target:link,targetStage:4=cry,Please, Nintendo! He doesn't know what he's doing! I'll get him to be quiet, just let me be in a game, please!
-3-male_chest_is_visible,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:eggs=angry,C'mon Kyu! Knock it off! We're representing all of fairy kind here!
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible=horny,Setting up for the big reveal.
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible=cry,I don't think I'm ready yet!
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:link=shy,I know this is a very big moment for you, Link, but wouldn't it be better if you took it all in, <i>silently?</i>
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:link=cry,Enough with the build up! Do you know what happens to fairies like me on the mean streets of Kakariko village?
-3-male_small_crotch_is_visible=shy,I feel... <i>slightly</i>... underwhelmed...
-3-male_small_crotch_is_visible=appreciative,Don't be ashamed, I'm sure most fairies are about the same size.
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=shocked,Look! There's something hanging there!
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=shy,I can see why the Gerudo only want one man around every 100 years.
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:link=angry,Great! It's all out there, but we don't have to talk about it <i>at all</i>.
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:link=angry,He just keeps <i>talking and talking</i>! Honestly, who talks this much? It's starting to get really annoying.
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=shocked,<i>WAIT</i> Angels have those things too! Do angels even <i>need</i> them?
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible=shocked,It's <i>GORON SIZED<i>!!
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible=embarrassed,Wha-what are y-you going to do with it?
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible=shocked,Why is it so <i>big</i>? Is that natural?
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:el_shaggy_blanco=cry,<i>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</i>
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible=interested,It's better for them to be free, anyways.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible=angry,<i>Hey!</i> I'm already naked! Revealing your breasts should be nothing!
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:nayru=interested,It's a shame you had to lose, ~name~, but we do get to see your breasts in exchange.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:nayru=embarrassed,You're too... generous, ~name~.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:nayru=puzzled,I can't believe your future sight didn't account for this, ~name~.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:spooky=cry,<i>WAIT!</i> I meant because you're a ghost who levitates! Not because of your <i>size</i>.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:chiaki=angry,This is <i>not</i> the best game to be in with low health.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:chiaki=horny,Remind me to tell you that you've only got two hits left, Chiaki, but <i>in a minute...</i>
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mia=angry,...Finally, you just couldn't resist, could you, Mia?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:felicia=interested,That's... an interesting way to strip, ~name~. Try not to clip something...
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:arwen=interested,While I hate to see royalty lose <i>like this</i>, I also am a <i>little bit</i> excited.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:arwen=embarrassed,Take your time, ~name~. After all, don't elves live to eternity?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=cry,<i>What is this?</i>
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=cry,<i>AAAAAAHHHH!</i> What kind of weapon is this?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=cry,<i>AAAAHHH!</i> I don't think you can reflect these with a sword!
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=cry,I don't like having this much anticipation!
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=interested,I hope she had the gyroscope controls turned on...
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=shy,This much waiting can never lead to something good...
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,notSaidMarker:treat,marker:treat=excited,Oh boy! A magic demonstration! I love those!
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible=interested,I'm sure well all hope for <i>greater things</i> to come one day...
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible=excited,Well at least we can be topless together!
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:spooky=cry,I would never say something like that. We're basically blue-skinned sisters in <i>that</i> department.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:natsuki=happy,Our time will come eventually, ~name~.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:natsuki=angry,The world just isn't ready for <i>chests</i> like ours, ~name~.

-3-female_large_chest_is_visible=shocked,Wow... that's quite a pair...
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible=embarrassed,It's so hard to keep track of two large targets at the same time...
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:mia=shocked,Woah! I guess today, we play <i>your</i> way!
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:palutena=interested,With all her human supporters, I guess ~name~ didn't feel the need for a bra.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible=angry,Be careful not to touch it!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible=shy,I wouldn't cover up... people may get testy...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible=excited,Nothing wrong with revealing your natural beauty!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:remilia=shocked,Where did all those-!

-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,notSaidMarker:field,marker:field=calm,It's probably going to look like Hyrule Field.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight=puzzled,What goddess determined that order?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible=shy,At least it's not a rough surface. Link tends to try to climb those...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible=shy,Just... don't offer to compare...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:cammy=shocked,Oh no! Looks like your leotard got ripped in that fight!

-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=loss,Not even the Great King of Evil himself, frightens me as much as whatever ~name~ has just shown us.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=loss,I can't believe the number of horrifying moons that Link has seen is so long that we've had to start a list.

-2-male_chest_will_be_visible=shocked,I can't believe ~name~ removing his ~clothing~ isn't the most embarrassing thing done today!
-2-male_chest_will_be_visible=embarrassed,I think my stomach just grew its own pair of wings.
-2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:link,targetStage:3=cry,Wait, Link! What are you doing!

-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:weiss,alsoPlaying:ruby=interested,Getting a little red, aren't we ~name~?
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible=embarrassed,I think I'd need a few more vines if I had that pair.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible=horny,What a nice set you have, ~name~!
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:nayru=shocked,Are y-you okay, ~name~? Are you having an off day?
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:nayru=shocked,You've lost quite a bit, ~name~. Is something wrong?
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:nayru=horny,I did not think that a goddess would be showing me her breasts, but here we are.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=loss,That's a little too close for comfort!
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=shocked,Did you get hurt? I have some milk if you need it!
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:clover=horny,There go ~name~'s clovers...

-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale=angry,The moment I'm sure ~player~ has been waiting far too long for.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale=appreciative,Phew. Now you can finally get rid of that sweaty thing.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale=embarrassed,I know you were a little sweaty, ~name~, so hopefully the breeze from my wings doesn't <i>you know. Since they're uncovered now...</i>

-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aella=excited,It's alright to have come braless. I did the same!
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible=loss,If you still need support, I could spare a vine.
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible=shy,There's no reason to despair, they're beautiful.
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:palutena=interested,With all her human supporters, I guess ~name~ didn't feel the need for a bra.
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:mia=shocked,Woah! I guess today, we play <i>your</i> way!

-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=cry,Why didn't you use your z-targeting, Aimee?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:arwen=shy,Kind of makes you wish you could just... turn invisible. Right, ~name~?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:arwen=angry,I'm sorry, ~name~, there's no cheat code or magic item to get you out of this one.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:arwen=shy,It could be worse, ~name~. There could be some looming presence that watches our every move and rea- <i>*cough* listens</i> to every word we say.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nayru=puzzled,Wait a minute...
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nayru=puzzled,Hold on a second...
-2-female_crotch_is_visible=shocked,<i>Things really are serious now!</i>
-2-female_crotch_is_visible=shocked,It looks like you really revealed a weak point here, ~player~.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:cammy=shocked,Oh no! Looks like your leotard got ripped in that fight!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mahiru=shocked,I can't believe you decided to keep your camera for so long!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mahiru=excited,It takes a lot of courage to be where you are, ~name~ and to still keep an important item by your side.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=shocked,You aren't going to shave your head next time you lose? It's so lush and <i>blue</i>!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=shy,I'm sure <i>someone</i> could think of a joke for this moment, but I can't think of anything.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jolyne=shocked,It seems Jolyne doesn't have all of her *necessary items*.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jolyne=embarrassed,I'd give you a hint, Joylne, but I think you already know what went wrong...
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=loss,Oh no! It looks like you've been infected with Ganondorf's evil!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=cry,It smells worse than the inside of Jabu Jabu!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=loss,Not even the Great King of Evil himself, frightens me as much as whatever ~name~ has just shown us.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=loss,I can't believe the number of horrifying moons that Link has seen is so long that we've had to start a list.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:nayru=angry,You aren't the <i>real</i> Nayru!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:nayru=angry,You aren't an actual goddess!

-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale=shocked,That's an interesting choice, ~name~. Way to shake things up!

-1-male_chest_is_visible=interested,Is this what I missed whenever I turned around while Link switched tunics?
-1-male_chest_is_visible=horny,That looks... kinds nice, ~name~.

-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible=horny,I think I might have another heart piece around here somewhere.
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible=excited,<i>BRACE YOURSELVES!!</i>
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible=shocked,I wasn't prepared for my own nudity! How could I be prepared for this!
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:link=shy,I know this is a very big moment for you, Link, but wouldn't it be better if you took it all in, <i>silently?</i>
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:link=cry,Enough with the build up! Do you know what happens to fairies like me on the mean streets of Kakariko village?
-1-male_small_crotch_is_visible=calm,That wasn't worth getting all riled up about.
-1-male_small_crotch_is_visible=angry,I can't believe you could be so lazy that you couldn't put in the effort to make it bigger!
-1-male_small_crotch_is_visible=appreciative,I got a little worried back there, but that wasn't so bad after all!
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=horny,It looks like you have <i>plenty</i> to work with...

-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:link=angry,Great! It's all out there, but we don't have to talk about it <i>at all</i>.
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:link=angry,He just keeps <i>talking and talking</i>! Honestly, who talks this much? It's starting to get really annoying.

#OPPONENT MASTURBATING
#When an opponent is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must pay the penalty by masturbating in front of everyone.
#The "must_masturbate" line is for just before it happens, and the "start_masturbating" line immediately follows.
#The "masturbating" line will be spoken a little after the opponent has started but before they climax.
#When the opponent climaxes, your character will say the "finished_masturbating" line.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

1-female_must_masturbate,target:akko=loss,Be careful! If she's going to pull any magic, now's gonna be the time!
1-female_must_masturbate,target:akko=angry,Who knows what kind of crazy magic a witch might have for this kind of thing!
1-female_must_masturbate,target:alice_mgq=puzzled,Even with the transformation, I still don't think she's the weirdest person to attend this place. She's probably not even top five.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:palutena,alsoPlaying:nayru,alsoPlayingStage:8-9=shocked,Not you too, Palutena!
1-female_must_masturbate,target:palutena,alsoPlaying:nayru,alsoPlayingStage:8-9=puzzled,I think I'm seriously overestimating the powers of a goddess.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:arwen=embarrassed,This is what the people would want to see from an elf of this caliper.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:arwen=excited,<i>HEY! HEY! HEY!</i> I'm distracting them, Queen ~name~, so you can get started!
1-female_must_masturbate,target:kyu=angry,I say it's about time.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:nayru,alsoPlaying:palutena,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=angry,I'm sorry, ~name~. I can't trust you anymore, so I think I'll just be with a <i>real</i> goddess, like Palutena.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:kyu,alsoPlaying:human,alsoPlayingStage:9-10=angry,Well it's a little too late for this. ~player~'s already lost. Nice job, ~name~.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:joey,totalFemales:5-5=appreciative,I think we might have slipped ~name~ up a bit, huh ladies?
1-female_must_masturbate,target:joey,totalFemales:5-5=appreciative,Not used to a crowd of all women, are you, ~name~?
1-female_must_masturbate,target:alpha,saidMarker:blue=shocked,Wait! You've turned pale! What happened to my blue-skinned friend!
1-female_must_masturbate,target:mia=embarrassed,I think that's enough jabbering from us... feel free to get on with it, Mia.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:nayru=shy,Oh... the <i>definitely not a goddess</i> has to go. <i>sigh...</i>
1-female_must_masturbate,target:nayru=angry,Well, that's that. No goddess would subject herself to this.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:sayaka=interested,What are you gonna do with that gem, Sayaka?
1-female_must_masturbate,target:sayaka=puzzled,I've never seen a gem like *that* before. Is it used for money?
1-female_start_masturbating=happy,Remember, slow and steady wins the race. Except for horse races.
1-female_start_masturbating=appreciative,I wish you nothing but the <i>BEST</i> of luck.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu,alsoPlaying:human,alsoPlayingStage:9-10=angry,Please demonstrate what ~player~ will be doing tonight, since he won't be getting any epilogues.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu=angry,Alright, little Miss Promiscuous, show us how it's done.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:sayaka=shocked,So are you about to put that gem...
1-female_start_masturbating,target:sayaka=shocked,I can't believe you just ate that whole thing, Sayaka!
1-female_start_masturbating,target:palutena,alsoPlaying:nayru,alsoPlayingStage:8-9=puzzled,Are you not really a goddess, Palutena?
1-female_start_masturbating,target:palutena,alsoPlaying:nayru,alsoPlayingStage:8-9=cry,It's Nayru all over again. Please tell me you're a real Goddess, Palutena.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:alice_mgq=interested,You're on your own, here, ~name~.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:alice_mgq=excited,I've done my part, ~name~. Now, it's all up to you!
1-female_start_masturbating,target:nayru=horny,Just... get on with it... ~name~.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:nayru=angry,If you were an <i>actual</i> goddess, this probably wouldn't have happened.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:vriska=shocked,Wait... I don't think that's supposed to happen!
1-female_start_masturbating,target:sei=horny,I'm actually a little surprised that you'll be <i>able</i> to stand for this part.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:akko=embarrassed,Please tell me you aren't going to bring out a twin sister here. That's wrong in too many ways.
1-female_start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:mia=interested,Bully for you, Mia!
1-female_masturbating=embarrassed,I'm sorry if my wings are causing a breeze over your... um...
1-female_masturbating=calm,Note to magic users: Don't try contacting people telepathically just after nightfall.
1-female_masturbating=appreciative,That's good, ~name~! Try switching it up if you get tired.
1-female_masturbating,target:aimee=horny,I <i>really</i> don't think you should be using that <i>thing</i> for this purpose.
1-female_masturbating,target:aimee=angry,For everyone else, I don't recommend stick weapons up... <i>there</i>. No, not even the hilts!
1-female_masturbating,target:aimee=excited,Despite everything... you see to be doing quite well, Aimee.
1-female_masturbating,target:aimee=cry,This kind of reminds me of when Zelda found Link's Master Sword late at night and... <i>shudder</i>
1-female_masturbating,target:aimee=shy,<i>(Don't even think about trying anything funny when you get home, Navi.)</i>
1-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shy,I sort of feel like I'm intruding on something here...
1-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,I didn't know we were allowed to bring guests!
1-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=embarrassed,I would give you tips, ~name~, but I think that no one knows what you like better than... you.
1-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,Ooooh! Does your other self copy every action you do?
1-female_masturbating,target:catria=puzzled,Catria, are you still <i>there</i>?

1-female_masturbating,target:catria=puzzled,<i>HEY!</i> Catria! <i>LISTEN!</i> Getting through to her may take longer than I thought...
1-female_masturbating,target:catria=horny,Well, whoever this mysterious dream man is, he seems to be doing quite good job...
1-female_masturbating,target:catria=puzzled,Is there any chance that Catria's going to break out of that trance?
1-female_masturbating,target:felicia=puzzled,Is the wand some sort of cat-thing?
1-female_masturbating,target:felicia=interested,First you strip weird, now the wand. You're pretty strange, ~name~.
1-female_masturbating,target:felicia=puzzled,Are you the one making that weird humming noise, ~name~?
1-female_masturbating,target:felicia=horny,I don't know what that <i>thing</i> is, but it seems to be working.
1-female_masturbating,target:felicia=horny,C-could I try that thing you're using, F-~name~?
1-female_masturbating,target:cammy=horny,They look like they're doing an <i>amazing job</i>...
1-female_masturbating,target:cammy=angry,They'll just let anyone in here, won't they?
1-female_masturbating,target:cammy=embarrassed,There's no need for hints here, since this looks like a <i>group project.</i>
1-female_masturbating,target:cammy=horny,They already seem to know everything <i>intimate</i> about Cammy.
1-female_masturbating,target:cammy=shy,It's Saturday night with the Gerudo all over again...
1-female_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=puzzled,<i>(I don't understand how the one wand was different from the other.)</i>
1-female_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=excited,That golden-whatever seems to be working!
1-female_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=happy,I can give out any helpful hints and tips while you use that thing, ~name~!
1-female_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=horny,Unfortunately, we don't have anything like what ~name~ is using back in Hyrule. <i>Very unfortunate.</i>
1-female_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=happy,I can see why your audience is so loyal, ~name~.
1-female_masturbating,target:weiss,alsoPlaying:ruby=embarrassed,Just don't make <i>eye contact</i>, ~name~.
1-female_masturbating,target:weiss,alsoPlaying:ruby=puzzled,I'm suddenly in the mood for something sweet. Like a candy cane or something.
1-female_masturbating,target:weiss,alsoPlaying:ruby=interested,I think you need more <i>speed</i>, ~name~. Someone here must know something about going fast...
1-female_masturbating,target:amalia=excited,That's such a great strategy, ~name~! I should use that!
1-female_masturbating,target:kyu=angry,C'mon, ~name~, I thought you were supposed to be some kind of expert here?
1-female_masturbating,target:kyu=angry,No no no! You're doing it all wrong, ~name~! It's like you know nothing about weakpoints!
1-female_masturbating,target:kyu=angry,Really, ~player~? You would have had <i>her</i> as your sidekick if I wasn't here?
1-female_masturbating,target:kyu=angry,Oh, <i>now</i> she decides to fly. I've been flying around this whole game!
1-female_masturbating,target:kyu=angry,So, you aren't even going to <i>try</i> using both hands at once, Kyu? How lazy.
1-female_masturbating,target:launch=horny,I really don't think you should be using your weapon... <i>like that</i>...
1-female_masturbating,target:launch=interested,That's an <i>interesting</i> way to do that, Launch.
1-female_masturbating,target:launch=angry,<i>HEY!</i> Launch! You can't do that! You might hurt yourself?
1-female_masturbating,target:launch=shocked,The scariest part about what Launch is doing, is that it seems to be working for her.
1-female_masturbating,target:launch=cry,I wish the blue-haired Launch was here. She probably wouldn't use her weapon like <i>that</i>...
1-female_masturbating,target:launch=embarrassed,Just... watch your fingers, Launch.
1-female_masturbating,target:joey=horny,Whatever that thing is, it certainly seems to be working.
1-female_masturbating,target:joey=puzzled,Why aren't you using your hands, ~name~?
1-female_masturbating,target:joey=shy,Do you always need that magic wand?
1-female_masturbating,target:joey=calm,It looks like your hat can hold as much as Link's bag.
1-female_masturbating,target:joey=shy,I don't think I can give you any tips while you're using that wand.
1-female_masturbating,target:alice_mgq=puzzled,I'm sorry, ~name~, but I think this is beyond any hints I could give you.
1-female_masturbating,target:alice_mgq=horny,Maybe you can try both hands at once, ~name~!
1-female_masturbating,target:alice_mgq=interested,<i>(I wonder what the scales feel like in there.)</i>
1-female_masturbating,target:alice_mgq=embarrassed,<i>(Well, at least her skin color got a lot prettier after she transformed.)</i>
1-female_masturbating,target:alice_mgq=excited,I don't know how versatile your tail is, ~name~, but seems like a great time to find out!
1-female_finished_masturbating=shocked,So much power!
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:sei=shocked,That one must have been intense! It knocked her right onto the floor!
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:sei=shocked,I'm speechless... or to put it a bit better, there's nothing left to Sei.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:mia=calm,Now you can let it go and move on!
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:launch=happy,Great! The good Launch has returned!
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:kyu=angry,And with all the grace and professionalism I expected from you, ~name~.

-3-male_must_masturbate,target:link=cry,D-don't worry, Nintendo. That is actually just a cosplayer and <i>definitely</i> not one of your most beloved IPs about to masturbate.
-3-male_must_masturbate,target:link,marker:button=cry,~player~! If there's a button you can press or something to stop the game, please do so!
-3-male_must_masturbate,totalMasturbating:0,totalFinished:0=interested,So, do they get to go home now?
-3-male_start_masturbating=horny,Yes... um... try gripping it with two hands.
-3-male_start_masturbating=appreciative,You should... um... wave it around first to get it cooled down. That way the heat of your hand will feel even better!
-3-male_start_masturbating,target:link=angry,I don't care how <i>free</i> or <i>liberated</i> you feel right now! Do you want to see Ocarina of Time remastered for the switch or not!?
-3-male_start_masturbating,target:link,saidMarker:button=angry,Thanks for nothing, ~player~. Maybe you aren't the chosen one.
-3-male_masturbating=horny,If you can't seem to <i>ejaculate</i>, try blowing on your penis to remove dust.
-3-male_masturbating=shy,Make sure to whisper encouraging words to increase your p-penis' charisma.
-3-male_masturbating=excited,To make sure that you're going fast enough, I'm going to start yelling to attract people outside. <i>HEY</i>!
-3-male_masturbating=embarrassed,We've all got weak points, you just have to find yours, ~name~.
-3-male_masturbating=horny,I c-can't seem to focus on the game as much, with ~name~ over there...
-3-male_masturbating,target:link=interested,You know, it's funny Nintendo...  <i>(No, no, not like that.)</i> I'm so sorry, Nintendo! <i>(Much better.)</i>
-3-male_masturbating,target:link=happy,I hope I can still get the severance package. You get a free amiibo of your choice!
-3-male_masturbating,target:link=shy,I wonder if Midna will let me stay at her place after I get fired?
-3-male_masturbating,target:link=angry,I hope Proxi doesn't get my job. Taught her everything she knows and then suddenly she was too good for me.
-3-male_masturbating,target:link=shy,The game's two decades old. I guess this was bound to happen at some point.
-3-male_finished_masturbating=shocked,That's <i>NOT</i> where I thought it would come from.
-3-male_finished_masturbating=shocked,<i>HELLO</i>! That's a lot more than I knew came out.
-3-male_finished_masturbating=embarrassed,I... helped you <i>r-reach</i> that point... right?
-3-male_finished_masturbating,target:9s=shocked,Huh? I expected... I don't know... some kind of explosive finish or something.
-3-male_finished_masturbating,target:9s=puzzled,So, wait. Do men not... do the thing? Is it only some of them? Why must understanding things have such a high difficulty setting?
-3-female_must_masturbate=embarrassed,Now, I recommend you start out with one finger and work your way up.
-3-female_must_masturbate=embarrassed,Try working with other erogenous areas before going for insertion.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:mia=embarrassed,I think that's enough jabbering from us... feel free to get on with it, Mia.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:alpha,saidMarker:blue=shocked,Wait! You've turned pale! What happened to my blue-skinned friend!
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:joey,totalFemales:5-5=appreciative,I think we might have slipped ~name~ up a bit, huh ladies?
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:joey,totalFemales:5-5=appreciative,Not used to a crowd of all women, are you, ~name~?
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:sayaka=interested,What are you gonna do with that gem, Sayaka?
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:sayaka=puzzled,I've never seen a gem like *that* before. Is it used for money?
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:kyu=angry,I say it's about time.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:nayru,alsoPlaying:palutena,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=angry,I'm sorry, ~name~. I can't trust you anymore, so I think I'll just be with a <i>real</i> goddess, like Palutena.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:akko=loss,Be careful! If she's going to pull any magic, now's gonna be the time!
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:akko=angry,Who knows what kind of crazy magic a witch might have for this kind of thing!
-3-female_must_masturbate,totalMasturbating:0,totalFinished:0=interested,Do they have to leave now?
-3-female_must_masturbate,totalMasturbating:0,totalFinished:0=puzzled,Does this mean they're out of the game?
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:alice_mgq=puzzled,Even with the transformation, I still don't think she's the weirdest person to attend this place. She's probably not even top five.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:kyu,alsoPlaying:human,alsoPlayingStage:9-10=angry,Well it's a little too late for this. ~player~'s already lost. Nice job, ~name~.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:palutena,alsoPlaying:nayru,alsoPlayingStage:8-9=shocked,Not you too, Palutena!
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:palutena,alsoPlaying:nayru,alsoPlayingStage:8-9=puzzled,I think I'm seriously overestimating the powers of a goddess.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:arwen=embarrassed,This is what the people would want to see from an elf of this caliper.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:arwen=excited,<i>HEY! HEY! HEY!</i> I'm distracting them, Queen ~name~, so you can get started!
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:nayru=shy,Oh... the <i>definitely not a goddess</i> has to go. <i>sigh...</i>
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:nayru=angry,Well, that's that. No goddess would subject herself to this.
-3-female_start_masturbating=embarrassed,I d-don't want to watch, but I promised to remain by your side!
-3-female_start_masturbating=shy,This is <i>just like</i> visiting the Gerudo after nightfall.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:vriska=shocked,Wait... I don't think that's supposed to happen!
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu=angry,Alright, little Miss Promiscuous, show us how it's done.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu,alsoPlaying:human,alsoPlayingStage:9-10=angry,Please demonstrate what ~player~ will be doing tonight, since he won't be getting any epilogues.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:sayaka=shocked,So are you about to put that gem...
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:sayaka=shocked,I can't believe you just ate that whole thing, Sayaka!
-3-female_start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:mia=interested,Bully for you, Mia!
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:alice_mgq=interested,You're on your own, here, ~name~.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:alice_mgq=excited,I've done my part, ~name~. Now, it's all up to you!
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:palutena,alsoPlaying:nayru,alsoPlayingStage:8-9=puzzled,Are you not really a goddess, Palutena?
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:palutena,alsoPlaying:nayru,alsoPlayingStage:8-9=cry,It's Nayru all over again. Please tell me you're a real Goddess, Palutena.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:sei=horny,I'm actually a little surprised that you'll be <i>able</i> to stand for this part.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:akko=embarrassed,Please tell me you aren't going to bring out a twin sister here. That's wrong in too many ways.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:nayru=horny,Just... get on with it... ~name~.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:nayru=angry,If you were an <i>actual</i> goddess, this probably wouldn't have happened.
-3-female_masturbating=horny,This strategy of yours might be useful for hints later!
-3-female_masturbating=interested,You are really getting into this...
-3-female_masturbating=embarrassed,I can't watch, but I must peek...
-3-female_masturbating=excited,That's it! Keep going! You're doing great!
-3-female_masturbating=appreciative,Keep that rhythm, it seems to be effective.
-3-female_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=puzzled,<i>(I don't understand how the one wand was different from the other.)</i>
-3-female_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=excited,That golden-whatever seems to be working!
-3-female_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=happy,I can give out any helpful hints and tips while you use that thing, ~name~!
-3-female_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=horny,Unfortunately, we don't have anything like what ~name~ is using back in Hyrule. <i>Very unfortunate.</i>
-3-female_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=happy,I can see why your audience is so loyal, ~name~.
-3-female_masturbating,target:joey=horny,Whatever that thing is, it certainly seems to be working.
-3-female_masturbating,target:joey=puzzled,Why aren't you using your hands, ~name~?
-3-female_masturbating,target:joey=shy,Do you always need that magic wand?
-3-female_masturbating,target:joey=calm,It looks like your hat can hold as much as Link's bag.
-3-female_masturbating,target:joey=shy,I don't think I can give you any tips while you're using that wand.
-3-female_masturbating,target:catria=puzzled,Catria, are you still <i>there</i>?
-3-female_masturbating,target:catria=angry,<i>HEY!</i> Catria! I think you should... </i>I don't think she's paying attention to me at all...</i>
-3-female_masturbating,target:catria=puzzled,<i>HEY!</i> Catria! <i>LISTEN!</i> Getting through to her may take longer than I thought...
-3-female_masturbating,target:catria=horny,Well, whoever this mysterious dream man is, he seems to be doing quite good job...
-3-female_masturbating,target:catria=puzzled,Is there any chance that Catria's going to break out of that trance?
-3-female_masturbating,target:aimee=horny,I <i>really</i> don't think you should be using that <i>thing</i> for this purpose.
-3-female_masturbating,target:aimee=angry,For everyone else, I don't recommend stick weapons up... <i>there</i>. No, not even the hilts!
-3-female_masturbating,target:aimee=excited,Despite everything... you see to be doing quite well, Aimee.
-3-female_masturbating,target:aimee=cry,This kind of reminds me of when Zelda found Link's Master Sword late at night and... <i>shudder</i>
-3-female_masturbating,target:aimee=shy,<i>(Don't even think about trying anything funny when you get home, Navi.)</i>
-3-female_masturbating,target:alice_mgq=puzzled,I'm sorry, ~name~, but I think this is beyond any hints I could give you.
-3-female_masturbating,target:alice_mgq=horny,Maybe you can try both hands at once, ~name~!
-3-female_masturbating,target:alice_mgq=interested,<i>(I wonder what the scales feel like in there.)</i>
-3-female_masturbating,target:alice_mgq=embarrassed,<i>(Well, at least her skin color got a lot prettier after she transformed.)</i>
-3-female_masturbating,target:alice_mgq=excited,I don't know how versatile your tail is, ~name~, but seems like a great time to find out!
-3-female_masturbating,target:weiss,alsoPlaying:ruby=embarrassed,Just don't make <i>eye contact</i>, ~name~.
-3-female_masturbating,target:weiss,alsoPlaying:ruby=puzzled,I'm suddenly in the mood for something sweet. Like a candy cane or something.
-3-female_masturbating,target:weiss,alsoPlaying:ruby=interested,I think you need more <i>speed</i>, ~name~. Someone here must know something about going fast...
-3-female_masturbating,target:kyu=angry,C'mon, ~name~, I thought you were supposed to be some kind of expert here?
-3-female_masturbating,target:kyu=angry,No no no! You're doing it all wrong, ~name~! It's like you know nothing about weakpoints!
-3-female_masturbating,target:kyu=angry,Really, ~player~? You would have had <i>her</i> as your sidekick if I wasn't here?
-3-female_masturbating,target:kyu=angry,Oh, <i>now</i> she decides to fly. I've been flying around this whole game!
-3-female_masturbating,target:kyu=angry,So, you aren't even going to <i>try</i> using both hands at once, Kyu? How lazy.
-3-female_masturbating,target:felicia=puzzled,Is the wand some sort of cat-thing?
-3-female_masturbating,target:felicia=interested,First you strip weird, now the wand. You're pretty strange, ~name~.
-3-female_masturbating,target:felicia=puzzled,Are you the one making that weird humming noise, ~name~?
-3-female_masturbating,target:felicia=horny,I don't know what that <i>thing</i> is, but it seems to be working.
-3-female_masturbating,target:felicia=horny,C-could I try that thing you're using, F-~name~?
-3-female_masturbating,target:launch=horny,I really don't think you should be using your weapon... <i>like that</i>...
-3-female_masturbating,target:launch=interested,That's an <i>interesting</i> way to do that, Launch.
-3-female_masturbating,target:launch=angry,<i>HEY!</i> Launch! You can't do that! You might hurt yourself?
-3-female_masturbating,target:launch=shocked,The scariest part about what Launch is doing, is that it seems to be working for her.
-3-female_masturbating,target:launch=cry,I wish the blue-haired Launch was here. She probably wouldn't use her weapon like <i>that</i>...
-3-female_masturbating,target:launch=embarrassed,Just... watch your fingers, Launch.
-3-female_masturbating,target:cammy=horny,They look like they're doing an <i>amazing job</i>...
-3-female_masturbating,target:cammy=angry,They'll just let anyone in here, won't they?
-3-female_masturbating,target:cammy=embarrassed,There's no need for hints here, since this looks like a <i>group project.</i>
-3-female_masturbating,target:cammy=horny,They already seem to know everything <i>intimate</i> about Cammy.
-3-female_masturbating,target:cammy=shy,It's Saturday night with the Gerudo all over again...
-3-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shy,I sort of feel like I'm intruding on something here...
-3-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,I didn't know we were allowed to bring guests!
-3-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=embarrassed,I would give you tips, ~name~, but I think that no one knows what you like better than... you.
-3-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,Ooooh! Does your other self copy every action you do?
-3-female_masturbating,target:amalia=excited,That's such a great strategy, ~name~! I should use that!
-3-female_finished_masturbating=shocked,It's just like the Song of Storms!
-3-female_finished_masturbating=embarrassed,I think that might have caused area damage.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:sei=shocked,That one must have been intense! It knocked her right onto the floor!
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:sei=shocked,I'm speechless... or to put it a bit better, there's nothing left to Sei.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:mia=calm,Now you can let it go and move on!
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:kyu=angry,And with all the grace and professionalism I expected from you, ~name~.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:launch=happy,Great! The good Launch has returned!

-2-male_must_masturbate=excited,It's okay, ~name~, because you have <i>an absolute expert</i> here to guide you along!
-2-male_must_masturbate,target:link=cry,D-don't worry, Nintendo. That is actually just a cosplayer and <i>definitely</i> not one of your most beloved IPs about to masturbate.
-2-male_must_masturbate,target:link,marker:button=cry,~player~! If there's a button you can press or something to stop the game, please do so!
-2-male_start_masturbating=horny,Remember to lick your palms first!
-2-male_start_masturbating=happy,Try alternating between standing and sitting to increase blood flow!
-2-male_start_masturbating,target:link,saidMarker:button=angry,Thanks for nothing, ~player~. Maybe you aren't the chosen one.
-2-male_start_masturbating,target:link=angry,I don't care how <i>free</i> or <i>liberated</i> you feel right now! Do you want to see Ocarina of Time remastered for the switch or not!?
-2-male_masturbating=loss,I'm not sure if what I'm doing is helping you along, ~name~.
-2-male_masturbating=appreciative,I hope the vines are appealing to <i>someone</i> here.
-2-male_masturbating=shy,I'd try to send a vine over to you, ~name~, but I won't know what to do with it.
-2-male_masturbating=excited,Try twisting it with both hands and give your <i>thing</i> that little extra squeeze.
-2-male_masturbating,target:link=interested,You know, it's funny Nintendo...  <i>(No, no, not like that.)</i> I'm so sorry, Nintendo! <i>(Much better.)</i>
-2-male_masturbating,target:link=happy,I hope I can still get the severance package. You get a free amiibo of your choice!
-2-male_masturbating,target:link=shy,I wonder if Midna will let me stay at her place after I get fired?
-2-male_masturbating,target:link=angry,I hope Proxi doesn't get my job. Taught her everything she knows and then suddenly she was too good for me.
-2-male_masturbating,target:link=shy,The game's two decades old. I guess this was bound to happen at some point.
-2-male_finished_masturbating=shocked,<i>MPGH!<i>
-2-male_finished_masturbating=shy,Wow...
-2-male_finished_masturbating,target:9s=shocked,Huh? I expected... I don't know... some kind of explosive finish or something.
-2-male_finished_masturbating,target:9s=puzzled,So, wait. Do men not... do the thing? Is it only some of them? Why must understanding things have such a high difficulty setting?
-2-female_must_masturbate=interested,I'd like to help, really, but my hands are tied at the moment.
-2-female_must_masturbate=excited,Hooray! Now I can be your companion on this adventure!
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:nayru=shy,Oh... the <i>definitely not a goddess</i> has to go. <i>sigh...</i>
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:nayru=angry,Well, that's that. No goddess would subject herself to this.

-2-female_must_masturbate,target:catria=angry,Wait! I could have just gotten a chair!
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:catria=angry,Wait! They have chairs we can use!
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:catria=shocked,So, I didn't have to use the bean? I could have just gotten a chair!
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:arwen=embarrassed,This is what the people would want to see from an elf of this caliper.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:arwen=excited,<i>HEY! HEY! HEY!</i> I'm distracting them, Queen ~name~, so you can get started!
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:kyu=angry,I say it's about time.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:palutena,alsoPlaying:nayru,alsoPlayingStage:8-9=shocked,Not you too, Palutena!
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:palutena,alsoPlaying:nayru,alsoPlayingStage:8-9=puzzled,I think I'm seriously overestimating the powers of a goddess.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:sayaka=interested,What are you gonna do with that gem, Sayaka?
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:sayaka=puzzled,I've never seen a gem like *that* before. Is it used for money?

-2-female_masturbating=interested,You know there's someone back home who can drive you over this edge, ~name~!

-2-female_masturbating,target:amalia=horny,I wish I had your level of control over these things, Amalia!
-2-female_masturbating,target:amalia=shocked,That's certainly one way to use those things!
-2-female_masturbating,target:amalia=embarrassed,Amalia, I'll trade you a bean if you teach me a little of your magic.
-2-female_masturbating,target:amalia=excited,Wow! Your vines look a lot more comfortable than mine, Amalia!
-2-female_masturbating,target:amalia=shy,I feel kind of lucky that my vines aren't as <i>playful</i> as yours, Amalia.
-2-female_masturbating,target:amalia=horny,We might have to exchange <i>gardening</i> tips, Amalia!
-2-female_masturbating,target:amalia=horny,Why do I feel that these vines are doing a better job than... <i>anything else could...?</i>

-2-female_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=horny,Unfortunately, we don't have anything like what ~name~ is using back in Hyrule. <i>Very unfortunate.</i>
-2-female_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=happy,I can see why your audience is so loyal, ~name~.
-2-female_masturbating,target:alice_mgq=puzzled,I'm sorry, ~name~, but I think this is beyond any hints I could give you.
-2-female_masturbating,target:alice_mgq=horny,Maybe you can try both hands at once, ~name~!
-2-female_masturbating,target:alice_mgq=interested,<i>(I wonder what the scales feel like in there.)</i>
-2-female_masturbating,target:alice_mgq=embarrassed,<i>(Well, at least her skin color got a lot prettier after she transformed.)</i>
-2-female_masturbating,target:alice_mgq=excited,I don't know how versatile your tail is, ~name~, but seems like a great time to find out!
-2-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shy,I sort of feel like I'm intruding on something here...
-2-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,I didn't know we were allowed to bring guests!
-2-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=embarrassed,I would give you tips, ~name~, but I think that no one knows what you like better than... you.
-2-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,Ooooh! Does your other self copy every action you do?
-2-female_masturbating,target:joey=horny,Whatever that thing is, it certainly seems to be working.
-2-female_masturbating,target:joey=puzzled,Why aren't you using your hands, ~name~?
-2-female_masturbating,target:joey=shy,Do you always need that magic wand?
-2-female_masturbating,target:joey=calm,It looks like your hat can hold as much as Link's bag.
-2-female_masturbating,target:joey=shy,I don't think I can give you any tips while you're using that wand.
-2-female_masturbating,target:aimee=horny,I <i>really</i> don't think you should be using that <i>thing</i> for this purpose.
-2-female_masturbating,target:aimee=angry,For everyone else, I don't recommend stick weapons up... <i>there</i>. No, not even the hilts!
-2-female_masturbating,target:aimee=excited,Despite everything... you see to be doing quite well, Aimee.
-2-female_masturbating,target:aimee=cry,This kind of reminds me of when Zelda found Link's Master Sword late at night and... <i>shudder</i>
-2-female_masturbating,target:aimee=shy,<i>(Don't even think about trying anything funny when you get home, Navi.)</i>
-2-female_masturbating,target:catria=puzzled,Catria, are you still <i>there</i>?
-2-female_masturbating,target:catria=angry,<i>HEY!</i> Catria! I think you should... </i>I don't think she's paying attention to me at all...</i>
-2-female_masturbating,target:catria=puzzled,<i>HEY!</i> Catria! <i>LISTEN!</i> Getting through to her may take longer than I thought...
-2-female_masturbating,target:catria=horny,Well, whoever this mysterious dream man is, he seems to be doing quite good job...
-2-female_masturbating,target:catria=puzzled,Is there any chance that Catria's going to break out of that trance?
-2-female_masturbating,target:weiss,alsoPlaying:ruby=embarrassed,Just don't make <i>eye contact</i>, ~name~.
-2-female_masturbating,target:weiss,alsoPlaying:ruby=puzzled,I'm suddenly in the mood for something sweet. Like a candy cane or something.
-2-female_masturbating,target:weiss,alsoPlaying:ruby=interested,I think you need more <i>speed</i>, ~name~. Someone here must know something about going fast...
-2-female_masturbating,target:launch=horny,I really don't think you should be using your weapon... <i>like that</i>...
-2-female_masturbating,target:launch=interested,That's an <i>interesting</i> way to do that, Launch.
-2-female_masturbating,target:launch=angry,<i>HEY!</i> Launch! You can't do that! You might hurt yourself?
-2-female_masturbating,target:launch=shocked,The scariest part about what Launch is doing, is that it seems to be working for her.
-2-female_masturbating,target:launch=cry,I wish the blue-haired Launch was here. She probably wouldn't use her weapon like <i>that</i>...
-2-female_masturbating,target:launch=embarrassed,Just... watch your fingers, Launch.
-2-female_finished_masturbating=shocked,The student has surpassed the teacher!
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:launch=happy,Great! The good Launch has returned!
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:kyu=angry,And with all the grace and professionalism I expected from you, ~name~.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:sei=shocked,That one must have been intense! It knocked her right onto the floor!
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:sei=shocked,I'm speechless... or to put it a bit better, there's nothing left to Sei.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:mia=calm,Now you can let it go and move on!

-1-male_must_masturbate=interested,I'll guide you through this, ~name~. I know male masturbation like the back of my wing!
-1-male_must_masturbate=shy,And you were so close too, ~name~!
-1-male_must_masturbate,target:link=cry,D-don't worry, Nintendo. That is actually just a cosplayer and <i>definitely</i> not one of your most beloved IPs about to masturbate.
-1-male_must_masturbate,target:link,marker:button=cry,~player~! If there's a button you can press or something to stop the game, please do so!
-1-male_start_masturbating=embarrassed,You c-could try whispering words of encouragement to your penis... that'll <i>probably</i> work...
-1-male_start_masturbating=happy,Just start digging a small hole into the floor and then you're ready to begin.
-1-male_start_masturbating=excited,Try pulling on your pubic hair for that little extra bit of roughness.
-1-male_start_masturbating,target:link=angry,I don't care how <i>free</i> or <i>liberated</i> you feel right now! Do you want to see Ocarina of Time remastered for the switch or not!?
-1-male_start_masturbating,target:link,saidMarker:button=angry,Thanks for nothing, ~player~. Maybe you aren't the chosen one.
-1-male_masturbating=horny,For maximum effectiveness, move exactly three fingers up and down with every stroke.
-1-male_masturbating=angry,C'mon, ~name~! I know <i>literal fairies</i> who can do better than you!
-1-male_masturbating=embarrassed,I-I can't believe I'm w-watching this...
-1-male_masturbating=shy,I usually recommend that you take a break, but if you really don't need to...
-1-male_masturbating=shy,(Why do I get this same weird feeling whenever Link says he's going to grab his pole to go fishing?)
-1-male_masturbating=embarrassed,You're doing better than <i>I</i> could do...
-1-male_masturbating=interested,Why don't you go on by yourself for a bit? <i>I wouldn't want to get overbearing or anything...</i>
-1-male_masturbating=happy,Yes, ~name~! That is definitely a good strategy. Trust me.
-1-male_masturbating,target:link=interested,You know, it's funny Nintendo...  <i>(No, no, not like that.)</i> I'm so sorry, Nintendo! <i>(Much better.)</i>
-1-male_masturbating,target:link=happy,I hope I can still get the severance package. You get a free amiibo of your choice!
-1-male_masturbating,target:link=shy,I wonder if Midna will let me stay at her place after I get fired?
-1-male_masturbating,target:link=angry,I hope Proxi doesn't get my job. Taught her everything she knows and then suddenly she was too good for me.
-1-male_masturbating,target:link=shy,The game's two decades old. I guess this was bound to happen at some point.
-1-male_finished_masturbating=shocked,<i>IS THAT WHAT HAPPENS!</i>
-1-male_finished_masturbating=puzzled,<i>(So that's what it looks like when they finish.)</i>
-1-male_finished_masturbating,target:9s=shocked,Huh? I expected... I don't know... some kind of explosive finish or something.
-1-male_finished_masturbating,target:9s=puzzled,So, wait. Do men not... do the thing? Is it only some of them? Why must understanding things have such a high difficulty setting?
-1-female_must_masturbate=interested,The first step to any masturbation is to have fun and be yourself.
-1-female_must_masturbate=happy,If you do it right, masturbation is more fun than smashing a room full of pots!
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:akko=loss,Be careful! If she's going to pull any magic, now's gonna be the time!
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:akko=angry,Who knows what kind of crazy magic a witch might have for this kind of thing!
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:alice_mgq=puzzled,Even with the transformation, I still don't think she's the weirdest person to attend this place. She's probably not even top five.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:kyu=angry,I say it's about time.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:mia=embarrassed,I think that's enough jabbering from us... feel free to get on with it, Mia.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:alpha,saidMarker:blue=shocked,Wait! You've turned pale! What happened to my blue-skinned friend!
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:joey,totalFemales:5-5=appreciative,I think we might have slipped ~name~ up a bit, huh ladies?
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:joey,totalFemales:5-5=appreciative,Not used to a crowd of all women, are you, ~name~?
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:palutena,alsoPlaying:nayru,alsoPlayingStage:8-9=shocked,Not you too, Palutena!
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:palutena,alsoPlaying:nayru,alsoPlayingStage:8-9=puzzled,I think I'm seriously overestimating the powers of a goddess.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:nayru=shy,Oh... the <i>definitely not a goddess</i> has to go. <i>sigh...</i>
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:nayru=angry,Well, that's that. No goddess would subject herself to this.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:nayru,alsoPlaying:palutena,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=angry,I'm sorry, ~name~. I can't trust you anymore, so I think I'll just be with a <i>real</i> goddess, like Palutena.
-1-female_must_masturbate,totalMasturbating:0,totalFinished:0=interested,Do they have to leave now?
-1-female_must_masturbate,totalMasturbating:0,totalFinished:0=puzzled,Does this mean they're out of the game?
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:kyu,alsoPlaying:human,alsoPlayingStage:9-10=angry,Well it's a little too late for this. ~player~'s already lost. Nice job, ~name~.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:sayaka=interested,What are you gonna do with that gem, Sayaka?
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:sayaka=puzzled,I've never seen a gem like *that* before. Is it used for money?
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:arwen=embarrassed,This is what the people would want to see from an elf of this caliper.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:arwen=excited,<i>HEY! HEY! HEY!</i> I'm distracting them, Queen ~name~, so you can get started!
-1-female_start_masturbating=embarrassed,I'm all out of beans, so you're going to have to do this one on your own, ~name~.
-1-female_start_masturbating=excited,You saw what those vines did! Just do that!
-1-female_start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:mia=interested,Bully for you, Mia!
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:alice_mgq=interested,You're on your own, here, ~name~.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:alice_mgq=excited,I've done my part, ~name~. Now, it's all up to you!
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:sayaka=shocked,So are you about to put that gem...
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:sayaka=shocked,I can't believe you just ate that whole thing, Sayaka!
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu,alsoPlaying:human,alsoPlayingStage:9-10=angry,Please demonstrate what ~player~ will be doing tonight, since he won't be getting any epilogues.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:palutena,alsoPlaying:nayru,alsoPlayingStage:8-9=puzzled,Are you not really a goddess, Palutena?
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:palutena,alsoPlaying:nayru,alsoPlayingStage:8-9=cry,It's Nayru all over again. Please tell me you're a real Goddess, Palutena.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:nayru=horny,Just... get on with it... ~name~.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:nayru=angry,If you were an <i>actual</i> goddess, this probably wouldn't have happened.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:akko=embarrassed,Please tell me you aren't going to bring out a twin sister here. That's wrong in too many ways.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu=angry,Alright, little Miss Promiscuous, show us how it's done.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:sei=horny,I'm actually a little surprised that you'll be <i>able</i> to stand for this part.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:vriska=shocked,Wait... I don't think that's supposed to happen!
-1-female_masturbating=horny,What's that technique called? I'll have to remember it.
-1-female_masturbating=happy,That's it, ~name~! Keep up the good work!
-1-female_masturbating=embarrassed,The way you're going, ~name~, you'll be finished in only a few turns!
-1-female_masturbating=embarrassed,I don't know what to do with these butterflies in my stomach. Maybe I can sell them?
-1-female_masturbating=excited,Just keep at that pace!
-1-female_masturbating=angry,Technique, technique, technique! It's all in how you do it!
-1-female_masturbating=shocked,It looks like you don't even <i>need</i> a tutorial, ~name~!
-1-female_masturbating=excited,Get excited, ~name~!
-1-female_masturbating,target:catria=puzzled,Catria, are you still <i>there</i>?

-1-female_masturbating,target:cammy=horny,They look like they're doing an <i>amazing job</i>...
-1-female_masturbating,target:cammy=angry,They'll just let anyone in here, won't they?
-1-female_masturbating,target:cammy=embarrassed,There's no need for hints here, since this looks like a <i>group project.</i>
-1-female_masturbating,target:cammy=horny,They already seem to know everything <i>intimate</i> about Cammy.
-1-female_masturbating,target:cammy=shy,It's Saturday night with the Gerudo all over again...
-1-female_masturbating,target:launch=horny,I really don't think you should be using your weapon... <i>like that</i>...

-1-female_masturbating,target:felicia=puzzled,Is the wand some sort of cat-thing?
-1-female_masturbating,target:felicia=interested,First you strip weird, now the wand. You're pretty strange, ~name~.
-1-female_masturbating,target:felicia=puzzled,Are you the one making that weird humming noise, ~name~?
-1-female_masturbating,target:felicia=horny,I don't know what that <i>thing</i> is, but it seems to be working.
-1-female_masturbating,target:felicia=horny,C-could I try that thing you're using, F-~name~?
-1-female_masturbating,target:kyu=angry,C'mon, ~name~, I thought you were supposed to be some kind of expert here?
-1-female_masturbating,target:kyu=angry,No no no! You're doing it all wrong, ~name~! It's like you know nothing about weakpoints!
-1-female_masturbating,target:kyu=angry,Really, ~player~? You would have had <i>her</i> as your sidekick if I wasn't here?
-1-female_masturbating,target:kyu=angry,Oh, <i>now</i> she decides to fly. I've been flying around this whole game!
-1-female_masturbating,target:kyu=angry,So, you aren't even going to <i>try</i> using both hands at once, Kyu? How lazy.
-1-female_masturbating,target:weiss,alsoPlaying:ruby=embarrassed,Just don't make <i>eye contact</i>, ~name~.
-1-female_masturbating,target:weiss,alsoPlaying:ruby=puzzled,I'm suddenly in the mood for something sweet. Like a candy cane or something.

#SELF MASTURBATING
#If your character is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must masturbate.
#These lines only come up in the relevant stages, so you don't need to include the stage numbers here. Just remember which stage is which when you make the images. The "starting" image is still in the naked stage.
#The "finished_masturbating" line will repeat many times if the game is not yet finished. This plays as opponents comment on the how good their hands are.

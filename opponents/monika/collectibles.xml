            With pen in hand I look to the sky <br/>
            And stand at the edge of a vast web<br/>
            Holding infinite choices<br/>
            <br/>
            A wave of color and noise<br/>
            Spills and splatters before me<br/>
            Red, white, green, blue, black<br/>
            Sights and sounds waiting just below<br/>
            <br/>
            Try as I might, I can't see the bottom.<br/>
            What lies beneath? <br/>
            Danger? Knowledge? Love? <br/>
            <br/>
            Swallowing my fears, I plunge into the depths... <br/>

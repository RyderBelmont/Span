        <subtitle>A poem</subtitle>
        <text>A fragment of trust
A fragment of truth
More frag than mint
It's not what I mean, but it's a thing I said as I sang my song
It's not what I mean, but it's a thing I say, and hope you listen
It's not what I meander, but it's where I go when I'm alone
It's not what I meander, but it's where I got to know the truth
It's not what I meander, but it's where I got to know the trust</text>

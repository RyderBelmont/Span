#CLOTHING
#Items of clothing should be listed here in order of removal.
#The values are formal name, lower case name, how much they cover, what they cover
#Please do not put spaces around the commas.
#"Important" clothes cover genitals (lower) or chest/breasts (upper). For example: bras, panties, a skirt when going commando.
#"Major" clothes cover underwear. For example: skirts, pants, shirts, dresses.
#"Minor" clothes cover skin or are large pieces of clothing that do not cover skin. For example: jackets, socks, stockings, gloves.
#"Extra" clothes are small items that may or may not be clothing but do not cover anything interesting. For example: jewelry, shoes or boots with socks underneath, belts, hats. In the rest of the code, "extra" clothes are called "accessory".
#If for some reason you write another word for the type of clothes (e.g. "accessory"), other characters will not react at all when the clothing is removed.
#What they cover = upper (upper body), lower (lower body), other (neither).
#The game can support any number of entries, but typically we use 2-8, with at least one "important" layer for upper and lower (each).
#Below is an example of Rosalina's clothing. Please adjust these values to match your character's clothing.
clothes=Bracelets,bracelets,extra,other
clothes=Shoes,shoes,extra,other
clothes=Stockings,stockings,minor,lower
clothes=Apron,apron,minor,upper
clothes=Dress,dress,major,upper
clothes=Bra,bra,important,upper
clothes=Panties,panties,important,lower



#Notes on dialogue
#All lines that start with a # symbol are comments and will be ignored by the tool that converts this file into a xml file for the game.
#Where more than one line has an identical type, like "swap_cards" and "swap_cards", the game will randomly select one of these lines each time the character is in that situation.
#You should try to include multiple lines for most stages, especially the final (finished) stage, -1. 

#A character goes through multiple stages as they undress. The stage number starts at zero and indicates how many layers they have removed. Special stage numbers are used when they are nude (-3), masturbating (-2), and finished (-1).
#Line types that start with a number will only display during that stage. The will override any numberless stage-generic lines. For example, in stage 4 "4-swap_cards" will be used over "swap_cards" if it is not blank here. Giving a character unique dialogue for each stage is an effective way of showing their changing openness/shyness as the game progresses.
#You can combine the above points and make multiple lines for a particular situation in a particular stage, like "4-swap_cards" and "4-swap_cards".

#Some special words can be used that will be substituted by the game for context-appropriate ones: ~name~ is the name of the character they're speaking to, but this only works if someone else is in focus. ~clothing~ is the type of clothing that is being removed by another player. ~Clothing~ is almost the same, but it starts with a capital letter in case you want to start a sentence with it.
#~name~ can be used any time a line targets an opponent (game_over_defeat, _must_strip, _removing_, _removed, _must_masturbate, etc).
#~clothing~ can be used only when clothing is being removed (_removing and _removed, but NOT _must_strip).
#~player~ can be used at any time and refers to the human player.
#~cards~ can be used only in the swap_cards lines.
#All wildcards can be used once per line only! If you use ~name~ twice, the code will show up the second time.

#Lines can be written that are only spoken when specific other characters are present. For a detailed explanation, read this guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/spnati/comments/6nhaj0/the_easy_way_to_write_targeted_lines/
#Here is an example line (note that targeted lines must have a stage number):
#0-female_must_strip,target:hermioine=happy,Looks like your magic doesn't help with poker!

#More advanced dialogue techniques including markers can be found here: https://www.reddit.com/r/spnati/comments/7hfzgh/how_to_make_a_character_december_2017_version/

#Example emotions are sometimes used in the lines below, but you can replace these as needed. Your specified emotions should match your posed image names. If you don't have posed images yet, you can write the dialogue first and fill these in later.
#The template below presumes that your character has a full eight layers of clothing. Remove unneeded stages if your character has fewer layers.



#EXCHANGING CARDS
#This is what a character says while they're exchanging cards.
#The game will automatically put a display a number between 0-5 where you write ~cards~.
#These lines display on the screen for only a brief time, so it is important to make them short enough to read at a glance.
#The lines written here are examples only and should be replaced.
swap_cards=calm,I think I need ~cards~ cards!
swap_cards=calm,Lemme have ~cards~ new cards!

#OPPONENT MUST STRIP
#These lines are spoken when an opponent must strip, but the character does not yet know what they will take off.

#These lines are spoken when an opponent removes a small item that does not cover any skin.
#Typically, characters are fine with this when they are fully dressed but less satisfied as they become more naked.

female_removing_minor=excited,Your ~clothing~ was super cute, but I guess it's meant to come off!
female_removing_minor=happy,It's not weird to say that you're pretty without your ~clothing~, is it?
female_removed_minor=happy,Did you think I'd be embarrassed? I know what I'm getting into!
female_removed_minor=wave,I grew up with two sisters, so I've seen other girls undress before.
female_removed_minor=shrug,It's probably easier when it's small things.

0-female_removed_minor=wave,I guess less is more, right, ~name~?

#lost 5 items
5-male_removing_minor=happy,Well, it's better than an accessory.
5-male_removed_minor=calm,Even if I AM down to my undies...
5-female_removing_minor=shocked,Oh, right! You had that, huh?
5-female_removed_minor=calm,I'm kinda jealous, you're real good at this game.

#OPPONENT REMOVING MAJOR CLOTHING
#Major clothing reveals a significant amount of skin and likely underwear.
#However, as we don't know if the opponent is taking off the top or the bottom, we can't presume that nice abs are showing; maybe she took of her skirt before her shirt.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

male_removing_major=shocked,Something that big? Are you sure?
male_removing_major=calm,That shows a lot of skin, ~name~. Do you want me to look away?
male_removing_major=excited,Don't worry- I'll close my eyes while you take off your ~clothing~!
male_removed_major=sad,I do feel kind of bad that you have to take that off, though...
male_removed_major=horny,I've caught glimpses of male guests before, but this is my first time getting a good look...
male_removed_major=happy,Don't worry, I wasn't looking! You could tell, right?
female_removing_major=happy,If it makes it easier, you can pretend we're in a bath house- Oh! Or a changing room.
female_removing_major=excited,We're both women, so please don't be shy for my sake!
female_removing_major=excited,Your ~clothing~ covered a lot of skin, but don't worry! You haven't lost everything!
female_removed_major=horny,~name~, I hope you don't mind if I watch you! ...Er, for tips, of course.
female_removed_major=horny,Don't worry, I'm not staring! ...It's hard to tell, I know.

#lost 5 items
5-male_removing_major=happy,This is only fair, right? Given the state I'm in, I mean.

-2-female_removed_major=horny,I don't care if telling you that is weird anymore.

#finished

-1-female_removed_major=happy,Then again, it's late in the game...



#OPPONENT REVEALING CHEST OR CROTCH
#Characters have different sizes, allowing your character have different responses for each. Males have a small, medium, or large crotch. Females have small, medium, or large breasts.
#As NPCs cannot predict which item the human player will choose to remove, they skip straight from the male_human_must_strip lines to male_chest_is_visible line (for example). However, if the human player has only a single item of clothing and it is covering his/her chest or crotch, the NPC will replace their normal fe/male_human_must_strip line with the appropriate fe/male_chest/crotch_will_be_visible line. NPCs still always use the normal must_strip -> removing -> removed sequence with each other.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

#OPPONENT MASTURBATING
#When an opponent is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must pay the penalty by masturbating in front of everyone.
#The "must_masturbate" line is for just before it happens, and the "start_masturbating" line immediately follows.
#The "masturbating" line will be spoken a little after the opponent has started but before they climax. Adding a few alternatives here will add needed variety.
#When the opponent climaxes, your character will say the "finished_masturbating" line.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

#If your character is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must masturbate.

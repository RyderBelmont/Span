#CLOTHING
#Items of clothing should be listed here in order of removal.
#The values are formal name, lower case name, how much they cover, what they cover
#Please do not put spaces around the commas.
#"Important" clothes cover genitals (lower) or chest/breasts (upper). For example: bras, panties, a skirt when going commando.
#"Major" clothes cover underwear. For example: skirts, pants, shirts, dresses.
#"Minor" clothes cover skin or are large pieces of clothing that do not cover skin. For example: jackets, socks, stockings, gloves.
#"Extra" clothes are small items that may or may not be clothing but do not cover anything interesting. For example: jewelry, shoes or boots with socks underneath, belts, hats. In the rest of the code, "extra" clothes are called "accessory".
#If for some reason you write another word for the type of clothes (e.g. "accessory"), other characters will not react at all when the clothing is removed.
#What they cover = upper (upper body), lower (lower body), other (neither).
#The game can support any number of entries, but typically we use 2-8, with at least one "important" layer for upper and lower (each).
#Below is an example of Rosalina's clothing. Please adjust these values to match your character's clothing.
clothes=Bracelets,bracelets,extra,other
clothes=Shoes,shoes,extra,other
clothes=Stockings,stockings,minor,lower
clothes=Apron,apron,minor,upper
clothes=Dress,dress,major,upper
clothes=Bra,bra,important,upper
clothes=Panties,panties,important,lower



#Notes on dialogue
#All lines that start with a # symbol are comments and will be ignored by the tool that converts this file into a xml file for the game.
#Where more than one line has an identical type, like "swap_cards" and "swap_cards", the game will randomly select one of these lines each time the character is in that situation.
#You should try to include multiple lines for most stages, especially the final (finished) stage, -1. 

#A character goes through multiple stages as they undress. The stage number starts at zero and indicates how many layers they have removed. Special stage numbers are used when they are nude (-3), masturbating (-2), and finished (-1).
#Line types that start with a number will only display during that stage. The will override any numberless stage-generic lines. For example, in stage 4 "4-swap_cards" will be used over "swap_cards" if it is not blank here. Giving a character unique dialogue for each stage is an effective way of showing their changing openness/shyness as the game progresses.
#You can combine the above points and make multiple lines for a particular situation in a particular stage, like "4-swap_cards" and "4-swap_cards".

#Some special words can be used that will be substituted by the game for context-appropriate ones: ~name~ is the name of the character they're speaking to, but this only works if someone else is in focus. ~clothing~ is the type of clothing that is being removed by another player. ~Clothing~ is almost the same, but it starts with a capital letter in case you want to start a sentence with it.
#~name~ can be used any time a line targets an opponent (game_over_defeat, _must_strip, _removing_, _removed, _must_masturbate, etc).
#~clothing~ can be used only when clothing is being removed (_removing and _removed, but NOT _must_strip).
#~player~ can be used at any time and refers to the human player.
#~cards~ can be used only in the swap_cards lines.
#All wildcards can be used once per line only! If you use ~name~ twice, the code will show up the second time.

#Lines can be written that are only spoken when specific other characters are present. For a detailed explanation, read this guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/spnati/comments/6nhaj0/the_easy_way_to_write_targeted_lines/
#Here is an example line (note that targeted lines must have a stage number):
#0-female_must_strip,target:hermione=happy,Looks like your magic doesn't help with poker!

#More advanced dialogue techniques including markers can be found here: https://www.reddit.com/r/spnati/comments/7hfzgh/how_to_make_a_character_december_2017_version/

#Example emotions are sometimes used in the lines below, but you can replace these as needed. Your specified emotions should match your posed image names. If you don't have posed images yet, you can write the dialogue first and fill these in later.
#The template below presumes that your character has a full eight layers of clothing. Remove unneeded stages if your character has fewer layers.



#EXCHANGING CARDS
#This is what a character says while they're exchanging cards.
#The game will automatically put a display a number between 0-5 where you write ~cards~.
#These lines display on the screen for only a brief time, so it is important to make them short enough to read at a glance.
#The lines written here are examples only and should be replaced.
swap_cards=calm,I think I need ~cards~ cards!
swap_cards=calm,Lemme have ~cards~ new cards!
swap_cards=calm,I think another ~cards~ will make this hand!
swap_cards=calm,Gimme ~cards~ please!

#These lines appear each round when a character is commenting on how good or bad their hand is.
#The lines written here are examples only and should be replaced.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:0=happy,Hey, Aella! Are you an adventurer, by any chance? You've got that look about you...
female_must_strip,target:blake,targetStage:0=happy,Hmm... Blake, this might sound weird, but being around you... Reminds me of home, somehow.

#OPPONENT REMOVING ACCESSORY
#These lines are spoken when an opponent removes a small item that does not cover any skin.
#Typically, characters are fine with this when they are fully dressed but less satisfied as they become more naked.
#Note that all "removing" lines are NOT spoken to human players. Characters will skip straight from "6-male_human_must_strip" to "6-male_removed_accessory", for example.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

male_removing_accessory=sad,Aww, that's everything?
male_removed_accessory=calm,Well, I'm not a hippo, so I can't get mad! ...Huh? Hippo isn't short for hypocrite?
male_removing_accessory=calm,Oh, your ~clothing~, huh?
male_removed_accessory=happy,You must have a good strategy planned out!
male_removing_accessory=excited,A lot of the men I know are snappy dressers- You're on that list, too, ~name~!
male_removed_accessory=shrug,I don't know much about fashion, but I thought your ~clothing~ looked good on you.
male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0=happy,Don't your wings get in the way of that manuver, Pit?
male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=excited,I know my ears always get in the way of wearing hats!
male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=shocked,I'm impressed that you're playing this with a blindfold!
male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1=excited,Hehe, I guess the gloves are coming off, now! I expected the blindfold, first...
male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=happy,Ah, so you're finally taking that off?
male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=horny,You have such pretty eyes, 9S...
female_removing_accessory=shrug,~name~, I don't usually hang out with girls my age! Is this a normal 'girl thing'?
female_removed_accessory=happy,Your ~clothing~ looked good on you! It feels like I'm at a sleepover...
female_removing_accessory=happy,I'm still new to this game, so I'm watching you for tips!
female_removed_accessory=excited,Starting with small stuff makes sense to me!
female_removing_accessory=calm,It's like the saying goes, don't sweat on the small stuff! ...What do you mean there's no 'on'?
female_removed_accessory=excited,Your ~clothing~ made you look super cute!
female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:0=sad,Revy, how come you brought guns? Is this a dangerous place?
female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=shrug,Maybe I should've brought my bow...
female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:0=excited,Oh, a lot of my guests carry weapons like that, too, Jura!
female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=happy,Granted, it's because the Inn is in the same town as a deadly labyrinth, but...
female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=happy,Oh, Saki! You look like you're around my age!
female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=excited,I hope we can get along! I don't usually hang out with people my age.
female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=calm,A yo-yo? And that keeps you safe?
female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=excited,I'd love to see how that works sometime!
female_removing_accessory=shrug,I guess you'd wanna bring something like that to a game like this.
female_removed_accessory=happy,I should try wearing something like your ~clothing~, sometime...
female_removing_accessory=excited,Well, it'd be rude if I got mad about that!
female_removed_accessory=happy,Your ~clothing~ really suited you, though.
male_removing_accessory=shrug,You wear a lot less accessories than the men where I come from...
male_removed_accessory=calm,Your ~clothing~? A pretty practical choice, though.
male_removing_accessory=happy,Hey, you have a lot to lose, so it's fine!
male_removed_accessory=excited,Now, what's the next hand...
female_removed_accessory=happy,You're doing really well, ~name~.
male_removed_accessory=happy,You're doing really well, ~name~!
female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0=sad,Sola, you seem embarrassed... But it's just a ribbon, right?

female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0=shrug,Taking off two things at the same time is kinda risky, isn't it?
female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:1=excited,You must be confident, but I won't lose, Natsuki!
female_removing_accessory,target:pyrrha,targetStage:0=shrug,Isn't poker a game of luck, though?
female_removed_accessory,target:pyrrha,targetStage:1=sad,I don't think you can try to be lucky...
female_removing_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:5=happy,It's just a ribbon, don't be so nerv-
female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=shocked,<i>Wait</i>, you're a Therian!?
female_removing_accessory,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=excited,Haha! And off come the glo-
female_removed_accessory,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=sad,Oh. <i>Oh.</i>
female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=shocked,W-wait, you're <i>burning</i> them? Is that safe?
female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=sad,Are you going to do that for all your clothes? Be careful!
female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=shocked,I-if you're going to destroy all your clothes, you must be confident!
female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=happy,It actually only makes me more determined to win! Er, I'll loan you my apron at the end.
female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=angry,Seriously, nobody else hears that?
female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4=shrug,It sounded louded than last time, too...
female_removing_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:0=wave,Hey, Jolyne! I'm really curious about you, yknow!
female_removed_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:1=excited,You've got what my guests call a 'dangerous air'... There's something about you, but I can't put my finger on what.
female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=shocked,So, you're like a fighter for everyone's freedom? That's so noble...
female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=happy,As for the 'no men' thing, this place must be kinda weird for you, huh? Since there are a few men here...

#OPPONENT REMOVING MAJOR CLOTHING
#Major clothing reveals a significant amount of skin and likely underwear.
#However, as we don't know if the opponent is taking off the top or the bottom, we can't presume that nice abs are showing; maybe she took of her skirt before her shirt.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

male_removing_major=shocked,Something that big? Are you sure?
male_removing_major=calm,That shows a lot of skin, ~name~. Do you want me to look away?
male_removing_major=excited,Don't worry- I'll close my eyes while you take off your ~clothing~!
male_removed_major=sad,I do feel kind of bad that you have to take that off, though...
male_removed_major=horny,I've caught glimpses of male guests before, but this is my first time getting a good look...
male_removed_major=happy,Don't worry, I wasn't looking! You could tell, right?
female_removing_major=happy,If it makes it easier, you can pretend we're in a bath house- Oh! Or a changing room.
female_removing_major=excited,We're both women, so please don't be shy for my sake!
female_removing_major=excited,Your ~clothing~ covered a lot of skin, but don't worry! You haven't lost everything!
female_removed_major=horny,~name~, I hope you don't mind if I watch you! ...Er, for tips, of course.
female_removed_major=horny,Don't worry, I'm not staring! ...It's hard to tell, I know.
female_removed_major=sad,I do feel bad you lost something that big, though...
male_removing_major=shrug,It's not like you're going to be naked, but...
male_removed_major=happy,This makes me root for you, a bit!
female_removing_major=shocked,Wait, you're all out of options, then?
female_removed_major=happy,Things should be fine, though- You've got a few more lines of defense.
male_removing_major=excited,You're all out of places to go now, huh?
male_removed_major=calm,You've gotta draw better hands, now, though, right?
female_removing_major=happy,We're getting down to it now, aren't we?
female_removed_major=excited,Okay! Uhm- I can look away if you want, though?
male_removed_major=wave,Now, where's that next hand?
female_removed_major=wave,Now, where's that next hand...?
female_removing_major,target:aimee,targetStage:0=duck,Waah!!

female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1=shocked,Ah! Ladybug, you're glowing!!
female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2=excited,So <i>that's</i> what you look like! I dunno why you wore that mask- You're real cute!
female_removing_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4=shocked,That sound, again! It's coming from... Shimakaze?
female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5=shrug,Is that sound you destroying your clothes? I hope it doesn't get any louder...
female_removing_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5=duck,Yeek!
female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:6=sad,Sorry! I should get used to loud noises when you strip, huh?
female_removing_major,target:misato,targetStage:3=calm,Not many people have seen what?
female_removed_major,target:misato,targetStage:4=happy,A scar like that could never make you ugly. Don't forget that, Misato.

#OPPONENT REVEALING CHEST OR CROTCH
#Characters have different sizes, allowing your character have different responses for each. Males have a small, medium, or large crotch. Females have small, medium, or large breasts.
#As NPCs cannot predict which item the human player will choose to remove, they skip straight from the male_human_must_strip lines to male_chest_is_visible line (for example). However, if the human player has only a single item of clothing and it is covering his/her chest or crotch, the NPC will replace their normal fe/male_human_must_strip line with the appropriate fe/male_chest/crotch_will_be_visible line. NPCs still always use the normal must_strip -> removing -> removed sequence with each other.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

male_chest_will_be_visible=horny,I've seen men's chests before, but this just feels more... intimate.
male_chest_is_visible=excited,Oooh, are you an adventurer, ~name~? You have the build for that sort of thing.
male_crotch_will_be_visible=horny,I'm gonna try not to stare, ~name~.
male_small_crotch_is_visible=happy,Aw, it's really small! It's kinda cute.
male_medium_crotch_is_visible=sad,Sorry if this is awkward for you, ~name~...
male_large_crotch_is_visible=shocked,I-is it normal for them to get that big?

#OPPONENT MASTURBATING
#When an opponent is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must pay the penalty by masturbating in front of everyone.
#The "must_masturbate" line is for just before it happens, and the "start_masturbating" line immediately follows.
#The "masturbating" line will be spoken a little after the opponent has started but before they climax. Adding a few alternatives here will add needed variety.
#When the opponent climaxes, your character will say the "finished_masturbating" line.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

#SELF MASTURBATING
#If your character is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must masturbate.
#These lines only come up in the relevant stages, so you don't need to include the stage numbers here. Just remember which stage is which when you make the images. The "starting" image is still in the naked stage.
#The "finished_masturbating" line will repeat many times if the game is not yet finished. This plays as opponents comment on the how good their hands are.

        <title>Rin's Paintbrush</title>
        <subtitle>Literally just a paintbrush.</subtitle>
        <text>Just an ordinary paintbrush. It's one of many brushes Rin uses for her paintings, however this brush has never been touched by hand, as she only uses her feet or her mouth in order to achieve her masterpieces.</text>
        <unlock>Play with Rin.</unlock>

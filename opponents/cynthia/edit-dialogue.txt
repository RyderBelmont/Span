#Items of clothing should be listed here in order of removal.
#The values are formal name, lower case name, how much they cover, what they cover
#Please do not put spaces around the commas.
#"Important" clothes cover genitals (lower) or chest/breasts (upper). For example: bras, panties, a skirt when going commando.
#"Major" clothes cover underwear. For example: skirts, pants, shirts, dresses.
#"Minor" clothes cover skin or are large pieces of clothing that do not cover skin. For example: jackets, socks, stockings, gloves.
#"Extra" clothes are small items that may or may not be clothing but do not cover anything interesting. For example: jewelry, shoes or boots with socks underneath, belts, hats. In the rest of the code, "extra" clothes are called "accessory".
#If for some reason you write another word for the type of clothes (e.g. "accessory"), other characters will not react at all when the clothing is removed.
#What they cover = upper (upper body), lower (lower body), other (neither).
#The game can support any number of entries, but typically we use 2-8, with at least one "important" layer for upper and lower (each).

#Notes on dialogue
#All lines that start with a # symbol are comments and will be ignored by the tool that converts this file into a xml file for the game.
#Where more than one line has an identical type, like "swap_cards" and "swap_cards", the game will randomly select one of these lines each time the character is in that situation.
#You should try to include multiple lines for most stages, especially the final (finished) stage, -1. 

#A character goes through multiple stages as they undress. The stage number starts at zero and indicates how many layers they have removed. Special stage numbers are used when they are nude (-3), masturbating (-2), and finished (-1).
#Line types that start with a number will only display during that stage. The will override any numberless stage-generic lines. For example, in stage 4 "4-swap_cards" will be used over "swap_cards" if it is not blank here. Giving a character unique dialogue for each stage is an effective way of showing their changing openness/shyness as the game progresses.
#You can combine the above points and make multiple lines for a particular situation in a particular stage, like "4-swap_cards" and "4-swap_cards".

#Some special words can be used that will be substituted by the game for context-appropriate ones: ~name~ is the name of the character they're speaking to, but this only works if someone else is in focus. ~clothing~ is the type of clothing that is being removed by another player. ~Clothing~ is almost the same, but it starts with a capital letter in case you want to start a sentence with it.
#~name~ can be used any time a line targets an opponent (game_over_defeat, _must_strip, _removing_, _removed, _must_masturbate, etc).
#~clothing~ can be used only when clothing is being removed (_removing and _removed, but NOT _must_strip).
#~player~ can be used at any time and refers to the human player.
#~cards~ can be used only in the swap_cards lines.
#All wildcards can be used once per line only! If you use ~name~ twice, the code will show up the second time.

#Lines can be written that are only spoken when specific other characters are present. For a detailed explanation, read this guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/spnati/comments/6nhaj0/the_easy_way_to_write_targeted_lines/
#Here is an example line (note that targeted lines must have a stage number):
#0-female_must_strip,target:hermione=happy,Looks like your magic doesn't help with poker!

0-selected=battleready.png,I'm a trainer, a researcher, a mythologist, and Pokémon League Champion; but you may call me Cynthia.

0-game_start,count-role;other&character;guzma:=furious.png,<i>Guzma...</i> I have no child named Verity. As a matter of fact, I'm not a mother at all. How dare you spread malicious lies about me!

0-game_start,count-role;other&character;pit:=shocked.png,An angel! Ah, I <i>must</i> ask you some questions!
0-game_start,count-role;other&character;pit:=shocked.png,An angel? An angel from my mythology books is <i>here</i>?
0-game_start,count-role;other&character;pit:=shocked.png,What?! An angel? Oh I have <i>so</i> many questions to ask you!
0-game_start,count-role;other&character;pit:=shocked.png,Wait, an angel! This is the opportunity of a lifetime! Please, I must ask you some questions...
0-game_start,count-role;other&character;pit:=shocked.png,An angel? B-but I thought those were... just myths...
0-game_start,count-role;other&character;pit:=shocked.png,An angel? You mean... the myths were true?
0-game_start,count-role;other&character;pit:=shocked.png,An angel? Are you real, or a figment of my imagination?... You're not a hallucination. Astounding!
0-game_start,count-role;other&character;pit:=shocked.png,Angels appear now and then in the creation myths I've studied, but to meet one in the flesh...
0-game_start,count-role;other&character;pit:=shocked.png,An angel... in front of me?! This has massive implications on the creation myths of this world!
0-game_start,count-role;other&character;pit:=shocked.png,An angel from Skyworld? Ah, it's just like in the mythology books!
0-game_start,count-role;other&character;pit:=shocked.png,An angel from Skyworld? Your race comes up often in my books, Pit. It may be embarrassing to say, but I've read so much about your people!
0-game_start,count-role;other&character;pit:=shocked.png, From Skyworld? I've read <i>so</i> much about Skyworld!
0-game_start,count-role;other&character;akko&saidmarker;cynthia_greet:=disappointed.png,I know a great deal about witchcraft from my studies of mythology, Akko, but I can assure you I am not one...
0-game_start,count-role;other&character;akko&saidmarker;cynthia_greet:=disappointed.png,I... <i>act</i> like a witch? Why ever do you say so, Akko?
0-game_start,count-role;other&character;akko&saidmarker;cynthia_greet:=disappointed.png,I <i>dress</i> like a witch? I've read that broomsticks and pointy hats are only silly modern portrayals, but... how do I look like one?
0-game_start,count-role;other&character;chazz:=excited.png,Oh, Chazz! Well, this works out perfectly then! I was hoping to speak to a Monster Duelist; maybe I can learn something about the mythology of this card game...
0-game_start,count-role;other&character;chazz:=excited.png,Oh, Chazz, right? I was hoping I could learn a thing or two about the creation of your Duel Monsters card game... Would you mind informing me?
0-game_start,count-role;other&character;elesa:=happy.png,Oh, hello Elesa! Fancy seeing you here.
0-game_start,count-role;other&character;elesa:=excited.png,Oh, Elesa! Long time no see, right? How's life been treating you?
0-game_start,count-role;other&character;elesa:=happy.png,Ah, Elesa! It's been a while since you paid me a visit at my villa; is anything new?
0-game_start,count-role;other&character;elesa:=excited.png,Well, well, well. I didn't expect to see a familiar face here. What brings you here, Elesa?
0-game_start,count-male:-0=disappointed.png,Wait, huh? There's no men here... I thought... I only joined because... Well, never mind that. Let's get this battle started!
0-game_start,count-male:-0=disappointed.png,Hold on just a second, where are the men?... This is going to be an all-female game?... I suppose that would be adequate entertainment...
0-game_start,count-male:-0=disappointed.png,Wait, we're all women here... I figured we'd be paying with some men... Let's begin this game, shall we?
0-game_start,count-male:-0,count-role;other&character;misty_hgss:=happy.png,Oh, Misty? Fancy meeting you here! You're from Kanto, aren't you?
0-game_start,count-male:-0,count-role;other&character;misty_hgss:=happy.png,Oh, Misty? Fancy meeting you here! I didn't expect to come across a gym leader here.
0-game_start,count-male:-0,count-role;other&character;misty_hgss:=disappointed.png,Oh, Misty! It's a bit embarrassing, buuuut... I thought I would see some guys here.
0-game_start,count-male:-0,count-role;other&character;misty_hgss:=disappointed.png,Oh, Misty, it's nice meeting you... but where are the men?... I figured I'd meet some here...
0-game_start,count-male&var;:1=excited.png,Well hello there, everybody! Are we ready to begin? I'm looking forward to how this match may develop, ~male~.
0-game_start,count-male&var;:1=horny.png,Let the best player win! I'm keeping a close eye on you, ~male~... Wait, I-I m-meant... I-I see you as a formidable opponent, is all.
0-game_start,count-male&var;:1=aggressive.png,Best of luck, ~male~! I won't be going easy on you in this game.

0-game_start,count-male&var;:1-5,count-role;other&character;misty_hgss:=happy.png,Oh, Misty? Fancy meeting you here! I didn't expect to come across a gym leader here.
0-game_start,count-male&var;:1-5,count-role;other&character;misty_hgss:=fingerup.png,Oh, Misty! It's a bit embarrassing, buuuut... I heard ~male~ was playing, and I figured I could see something nice.
0-game_start,count-male&var;:1-5,count-role;other&character;misty_hgss:=excited.png,Oh, Misty, it's nice meeting you... and I can see ~male~ is present as well. This would be fun, I can feel it already.
0-game_start,count-male:2-5=excited.png,Hello, gentlemen... Ready for a challenge? I might not be a champion at poker, but I know my way through this game.
0-game_start,count-male:2-5=aggressive.png,Well, on to the game then. I might be a woman, but that doesn't mean I'll be a pushover. I might just surprise all of you. 
0-game_start,count-male:2-5=excited.png,It's a pleasure to have the opportunity to play with all of you men...
0-game_start,count-male:2-5=horny.png,I see that the travel here wasn't for naught: there are some men playing as I had hoped. I-I m-mean, as a personal challenge. 
0-game_start,test:~player~:Cynthia,set-label:Shirona=fingerup.png,Hello there... Oh, your name is Cynthia too?  Well, my friends back in college often called me <i>Shirona</i>; you could call me that name if it pleases you.

#This is what a character says while they're exchanging cards and commenting on their hands afterwards.
#When swapping cards, the game will automatically put a display a number between 0-5 where you write ~cards~.
#These lines display on the screen for only a brief time, so it is important to make them short enough to read at a glance.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written
swap_cards=excited.png,I'll just swap out... ~cards~.
swap_cards=battleready.png,~Cards~ please...
swap_cards=excited.png,Give me some good ones, dealer.
swap_cards=excited.png,I'll trade these in...
swap_cards=aggressive.png,Come on dealer, let's see what you got for me.
swap_cards=fingerup.png,Let me see... I need ~cards~ new ~cards.ifPlural(cards|card)~, dealer.
swap_cards=contemplative.png,I think I need to exchange ~cards~ ~cards.ifPlural(cards|card)~ for this round.
swap_cards=battleready.png,This ~cards~ ~cards.ifPlural(cards|card)~ could certainly be better.

0-swap_cards,test:~cards~:0=fingerup.png,You know what they say: sometimes it's better to be lucky than good.
0-swap_cards,test:~cards~:0=excited.png,I don't mean to gloat, but my cards are already perfect.
0-swap_cards,test:~cards~:0=aggressive.png,Well, it seems I don't need to exchange any cards at all.
0-swap_cards,test:~cards~:5=disappointed.png,Oh, dear. I'm going to exchange all my cards, dealer.
0-swap_cards,test:~cards~:5=surprised.png,Oh... what an underwhelming batch. I'll replace all 5 of my cards, dealer.
0-swap_cards,test:~cards~:5=shocked.png,Could this be? I can't use any of these cards. I need a new batch.
0-good_hand=aggressive.png,It seems I might have a bit of an undefeated streak going on.
0-good_hand=excited.png,My perfect streak will remain intact this round, I would wager.
0-good_hand=sarcastic.png,It's a long game anyway. I'm sure you can all afford to wait at least another round before I have to strip.
0-good_hand=sarcastic.png,This might be a long game for you ~player~, if my luck keeps up like this.
0-good_hand=fingerup.png,Why, what a remarkable way to start this journey!
0-good_hand,totalRounds:-1=fingerup.png,This is just like a Pokémon battle; I like to start off with my Spiritomb so that I don't start at a disadvantage.

0-bad_hand=battleready.png,I... I can still make this work... probably...
0-bad_hand=aggressive.png,Now's your chance, ~player~! I have a pretty bad hand, so this is your opportunity to strike!
0-hand,one-shot-id:5=fingerup.png,Don't be intimidated by my presence here. This is a poker game rather than a Pokémon battle, so I'd say you have a decent chance of beating me.
0-hand,one-shot-id:6=fingerup.png,I may be the Sinnoh League Champion, but I don't think my skills would translate to strip poker. If anything, you might have a better chance of winning than me.
0-hand,one-shot-id:7=sarcastic.png,Strip poker - I don't think my years of experience as the Champion have done anything to prepare me for a possible defeat here.
0-hand,oneShotId:6,id:122,marker:CynthiaVerity=embarrassed.png,I know no one brought this up, but... if you ever hear any rumors about a girl named Verity... they're not true, okay? I don't have any kids.
0-hand,oneShotId:6,id:122,marker:CynthiaVerity=scowling.png,There's a malicious lie making rounds about me having a child named Verity, and that's all it is: a malicious lie. Don't believe any of those rumors.
0-hand,oneShotId:27=excited.png,I'm always willing to take on new challenges and adventures. I figured a strip poker game would do just that.
0-hand,oneShotId:27=fingerup.png,It's nice to engage in new experiences from time to time. On that note, I'm afraid I'm not too experienced in this game.
0-hand,oneShotId:27=battleready.png,As much as I enjoy training my Pokémon and studying mythology, I felt I needed a bit of a break and try something new.
0-hand,oneShotId:21,id:139,marker:CynthiaLucarioSmash=battleready.png,My Lucario's been away ever since that white envelope came in the mail. I hope he's enjoying his time in Smash...
0-hand,oneShotId:21,id:139,marker:CynthiaLucarioSmash=battleready.png,Someone sent a white and red invitation to my mailbox addressed to my Lucario. He's been away ever since. I just hope he's doing alright.
0-hand,oneShotId:29,id:195=surprised.png,Pardon if I've realized this a bit late, but I've just noticed that everyone here is tall. That can't be a simple coincidence, can it?
0-hand,oneShotId:29,id:195=surprised.png,I don't think I've ever been in a room with people my height before. I almost always tower over everyone.

1-stripped=stripped.png,I had anticipated a loss or two, but I have hopes that I won't go much further than that.
1-stripped=stripped.png,One loss is no big deal, but I'd best be careful as to not let them stack up.
1-stripped=stripped.png,That might have backfired, but don't expect me to make the same mistake again.
1-stripped=stripped.png,One layer down, plenty still to go. It's still a long game from here. Don't letup the pressure if you want to win!
1-stripped=stripped.png,Some might say that I'm overdressed; I just think this coat looks good on me.
1-stripped=stripped.png,I could have thrown my coat away like I did in the Junior Cup exhibition match... but I'd rather keep things simple for now.
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;chazz:=stripped.png,Wait, you mean you don't know? I thought all the student in wearing blue were supposed to be <i>highly</i> knowledgeable students!
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;chazz:,marker:ChazzWikipediaIsAReliableSource=stripped.png,Ah, Wikipedia... Despite what you might hear, Wikipedia tends to have higher accuracy ratings than even most peer reviewed academic journals.
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;chazz:,marker:ChazzWikipediaIsntAReliableSource=stripped.png,Chazz! Wikipedia doesn't count... You know that <i>anyone</i> can edit a Wikipedia page, right?
1-stripped,totalRounds:-1=stripped.png,I had anticipated <i>at least</i> a loss or two, although I hadn't expected it to happen so easily...
1-stripped,totalRounds:-1=stripped.png,I lost earlier than I had expected... but I can rebound from this. I don't go down this easily!
1-stripped,totalRounds:-1=stripped.png,A small loss but a bit early; I expect this to be a long, drawn-out game from this point onwards.
1-must_strip=disappointed.png,I see... So this might be a closer game than I had thought...
1-must_strip=aggressive.png,My second defeat... No matter, I still have some clothing to spare.
1-must_strip=surprised.png,Maybe... I should avoid taking unnecessary gambles in this game.
1-must_strip=aggressive.png,I don't mean to brag or anything, but I haven't lost two Pokémon in the same battle for quite a long time now. This game is quite different, to say the least.

1-must_strip,count-role;other&character;akko:=scowling.png,Cruel? <i>Me</i>? You must be mistake, Akko; trainers who are harsh to their Pokémon are undeserving of my respect.
1-must_strip_winning=happy.png,Alright, you bested me this round. The important thing is that everyone is having fun.
1-must_strip_winning=fingerup.png,I'm genuinely impressed. At this rate, you guys might be able to catch up on me. 
1-must_strip_winning=aggressive.png,Well, a big comeback begins with a small victory, doesn't it? I wouldn't count you out yet.
1-must_strip_winning=happy.png,I must say, taking a break from my studies to play this game has been working out so far despite this loss.
1-must_strip_normal=excited.png,I must say, this game is more competitive than I expected. I'm excited to see how this game develops.
1-must_strip_normal=fingerup.png,This is quite a closely-contested game we have here. Challenges like this is what makes life exciting.
1-must_strip_normal=thinking.png,It seems that I'm not quite as competent in poker as I am in Pokémon battles. No matter, lessons are learned from mistakes.
1-must_strip_losing=shocked.png,Have I really fallen behind this early? Minutes ago, I wouldn't have thought this possible.
1-must_strip_losing=surprised.png,Am I really in last place right now?... I never realized everyone had so many articles of clothing on. 
1-must_strip_losing=scowling.png,I'm... losing? I can't believe I've kept my eye off the competition!
1-must_strip_losing=aggressive.png,Maybe I shouldn't have interrupted my studies for this... Oh, what am I saying? I'm not even close to out yet!
1-stripping=stripping.png,You're doing well if you've got me taking off my scarf, but I had planned for this accordingly.
1-stripping=stripping.png,I've had people mistake my scarf for the collar of my coat.
1-stripping=stripping.png,This is my trump card; my coat and scarf counted as separate layers.
1-stripping=stripping.png,Unlike my coat, this scarf doesn't actually insulate heat that well. It's purely for aesthetic purposes.
1-stripping=stripping.png,I still remember when a juvenile Bulbasaur tried to eat this. Poor thing thought that this was made of grass.
1-stripping,count-role;other&character;chazz:=stripping.png,Oh, I see... What was it like back then? Was it just a game, or were there some kind of stakes involved, Chazz?
1-stripping,count-role;other&character;chazz:=stripping.png,Oh, really, Chazz? What was the nature of the game? Under what circumstances was it played?
1-stripping,count-role;other&character;chazz:=stripping.png,Ancient Egypt?! I had no idea the game had such historic foundings! Tell me, Chazz... Why was the game started?

2-stripped,priority:0,count-alive&role;other:2=stripped.png,It seems as if you two are stronger opponents than I imagined! I have to get my act together!
2-stripped,priority:0,count-alive&role;other:3=stripped.png,It seems as if you three are stronger opponents than I imagined! I'm going to start paying more attention!
2-stripped,priority:0,count-alive&role;other:3=stripped.png,It seems as if you three are stronger opponents than I imagined! I have to get my act together!
2-stripped,priority:0,count-alive&role;other:4=stripped.png,It seems as if you four are stronger opponents than I imagined! I'm going to start paying more attention!
2-stripped,priority:0,count-alive&role;other:4=stripped.png,It seems as if you four are stronger opponents than I imagined! I have to get my act together!
2-must_strip=disappointed.png,Ah, so careless! ...Very well, I'll remove my shoes.
2-must_strip=surprised.png,Huh? So, it seems I've lowered my guard...
2-must_strip=disappointed.png,A... third loss? This is... *ahem* this is quite unexpected.
2-must_strip=embarrassed.png,... Just when I thought I was getting a hang of this game...
2-must_strip_winning=embarrassed.png,I still have the lead, but I'm losing more layers than I would be comfortable with.
2-must_strip_winning=embarrassed.png,Well, I have one last small piece of clothing to remove... but that's it.
2-must_strip_winning=disappointed.png,I think I got a bit carried away there.
2-must_strip_winning=contemplative.png,<i>(Did I switch off there? I might lose this lead if this keeps up.)</i>
2-must_strip_normal=embarrassed.png,I seriously need to rethink my strategy!
2-must_strip_normal=aggressive.png,Wow, you guys are really good! I was expecting a bit of a challenge, but this is way more competitive than I thought.
2-must_strip_normal=happy.png,I can't remember the last time I've had a battle this action-packed!
2-must_strip_losing=shocked.png,This is simply unbelievable! To fall behind this early...
2-must_strip_losing=surprised.png,What a string of bad luck! I wouldn't have thought I'd be behind at this point of the game.
2-must_strip_losing=embarrassed.png,Come on, Cynthia! You need to concentrate!
2-must_strip_losing=disappointed.png,What a miserable display I'm putting out so far.
2-stripping=stripping.png,Well, no matter. Despite my carelessness, I will still come out on top.
2-stripping=stripping.png,These heels weren't practical for standing around, anyway.
2-stripping=stripping.png,Just as well that I remove these; my feet were starting to ache.
2-stripping=stripping.png,Perhaps I should have worn my flat-bottomed shoes instead.
2-stripping=stripping.png,Too bad the rules disallowed me from counting my heels as separate items. That might have been a little too pragmatic.
2-stripping=stripping.png,This reminds me of the Pokémon Tsareena, whose legs greatly resemble stiletto heels.
2-stripping=stripping.png,I once ran up the steps of the Abyssal Ruins after it was raised from underwater while wearing these. Very long story, that one. My feet hurt a lot after.
2-stripping,count-role;other&character;chazz:=stripping.png,<i>Atem</i>? I see... Go on, Chazz...
2-stripping,count-role;other&character;chazz:=stripping.png,The Millennium Puzzle? What is that, Chazz; can you tell me about it?
2-stripping,count-role;other&character;chazz:,marker:ChazzJigsaw=stripping.png,The Millennium Puzzle? Is that like... an ancient jigsaw puzzle?
2-stripping,count-role;other&character;chazz:,marker:ChazzBrainTeaser=stripping.png,The Millennium Puzzle? Is that like... an old brain teaser?
2-stripping,count-role;other&character;chazz:=stripping.png,The Millennium Puzzle? W-wait, I think I remember hearing about that...


#losing shirt
3-stripped=stripped.png,Just you wait and see! There's nothing an Elite Four champion can't handle!
3-stripped=stripped.png,Yeah, so I lost once more than I was expecting, big deal. Such a miscalculation will <i>not</i> happen again!
3-stripped=stripped.png,A loss is a loss; I need to determine what went wrong and learn from that mistake.
3-stripped=stripped.png,As a silver lining, my feet are slightly more comfortable now.
3-stripped=stripped.png,Okay, I'm sure you guys are having fun, but now, the gloves are coming off. No more fooling around from me.
3-stripped=stripped.png,Truth be told, I haven't been giving my best these past few rounds. It's about time I take this game seriously.
3-stripped,count-role;other&character;chazz:=stripped.png,Wait, no, can you please finish? You were just starting to get to the good part!
3-stripped,count-role;other&character;chazz:=stripped.png,Oh, right, I forgot we were in the middle of a game of strip poker here... Right, we all have our motivations here, I suppose...
3-stripped,count-role;other&character;chazz:=stripped.png,Ah, right, of course... I suppose that's why a boy <i>would</i> be playing this game...
3-stripped,count-role;other&character;chazz:=stripped.png,Oh, right... Seeing others naked is why we're all here, I suppose.
3-stripped,priority:0,count-male:0=stripped.png,It's sure hard to get the motivation to try in this game when there's no guys around.
3-stripped,priority:0,count-male:0=stripped.png,I wish we had some men in this game... but no matter, the game must go on without them.
3-stripped,priority:0,test:~background.bathing~:true=stripped.png,Huh? Oh... Now that my shoes are off, it seems like it's a bit slippery around the ~background~.
3-must_strip=disappointed.png,I see now that strip poker isn't as easy of a game as I thought. I'll... I'll take off my shirt now...
3-must_strip=embarrassed.png,I knew the risks when I joined this game, but to actually experience them... I haven't even thought of it.
3-must_strip=surprised.png,This is all on me. I let my earlier defeats get in my head.
3-must_strip_winning=disappointed.png,I might be winning... but it doesn't quite feel like it.
3-must_strip_winning=battleready.png,Well, as long as I'm in the lead, I can't feel too bad about my self.
3-must_strip_winning=aggressive.png,You finally got me to remove something substantial. Is this the start of a great comeback for everybody?
3-must_strip_winning=sarcastic.png,I see. Maybe I'm not quite at the home stretch just yet.
3-must_strip_normal=thinking.png,Hmm... I wonder how many of my fans have imagined me in a situation like this.
3-must_strip_normal=fingerup.png,Should I have kept that seven or maybe... Oh, sorry about that! I was just analyzing my mistake. Now, onto the punishment...
3-must_strip_normal=battleready.png,This is really getting heated now!
3-must_strip_normal=excited.png,Well done! I never thought you'd bring me this far into the game.
3-must_strip_losing=disappointed.png,It would be unsporting of me to back out at this point...
3-must_strip_losing=sarcastic.png,My, my, I didn't think I'd be in the company of such excellent poker players. This might not be a walk in the park like I had anticipated.
3-must_strip_losing=embarrassed.png,Every win has its rewards, and every defeat has its consequences...
3-stripping=stripping.png,I've changed in locker rooms before, but for some reason, taking my shirt off here seems more... personal.
3-stripping=stripping.png,I don't have anything to be ashamed about my body. I've been keeping fit despite my busy schedule.
3-stripping=stripping.png,I could see in your faces earlier that you had enough of me removing minor clothing...
3-stripping=stripping.png,You've beaten me 4 times already. I don't have enough accessories to cover for that.
3-stripping=stripping.png,I was mentally prepared for a situation like this, but I didn't think I would actually lose this many times.
3-stripping,count-female&role;other:0=stripping.png,<i>(To be removing my shirt with only men watching me, I don't know what to feel right now.)</i>
3-stripping,count-female&role;other:0=stripping.png,<i>(I've never removed my shirt in front of men before!... Alright, act normal, Cynthia. You can do this.)</i>
3-stripping,count-female&role;other:0=stripping.png,<i>(Having to strip like this in front of a man is nerve-wracking enough, but in this situation...)</i>
3-stripping,priority:0,count-male&var;:1-4=stripping.png,I-I've taken off my shirt before in front of other girls, but never in front of any guys, huhee...
3-stripping,priority:0,count-male&var;:1-4=stripping.png,<i>(I can see ~male~ staring at me...)</i>
3-stripping,priority:0,count-male&var;:1-4=stripping.png,<i>(I wonder what's going through ~male~'s mind right now; he seems to be staring intently at me...)</i>
3-stripping,priority:0,count-male&var;:1-4=stripping.png,<i>(Alder has complimented my figure before... but it's completely different if ~male~ does as well.)</i>
3-stripping,priority:0,count-male&var;:1-4=stripping.png,<i>(Good thing I had the hindsight to wear my sexy bra today. I hope ~male~ likes it.)</i>


#losing pants
4-stripped=stripped.png,I'm... okay, I'm a little embarrassed. I never imagined I'd be backed into a corner like this!
4-stripped=stripped.png,Okay, enough with the chit-chat. Let's return to the game, shall we?
4-stripped=stripped.png,This outfit isn't new for me. I sometimes walk around my villa like this.
4-stripped=stripped.png,I might not have an athlete's body, but I believe I've maintained my physique reasonably well.
4-stripped=stripped.png,All right, you've now made me show my bra. Don't celebrate just yet, this might be the last time I lose.
4-stripped,priority:0,count-male&var;:1-4=stripped.png,<i>(It seems ~male~ has taken a liking to my figure.)</i>
4-stripped,priority:0,count-male&var;:1-4=stripped.png,<i>(I hope ~male~ finds my bra attractive.)</i>
4-stripped,priority:0,count-male&var;:1-4=stripped.png,<i>(Should I tell ~male~ that I wore this bra specifically for him? That might be a bit creepy.)</i>
4-must_strip=aggressive.png,It looks like I've got a real fight on my hands! No more underestimating my opponents!
4-must_strip=battleready.png,It seems as if I've got a real fight on my hands! I won't be underestimating my opponents any longer!
4-must_strip=sarcastic.png,I've lost again... But this game is far from over!
4-must_strip_winning=surprised.png,Every loss I take, the smaller my lead becomes...
4-must_strip_winning=disappointed.png,I still have a lead, but just.
4-must_strip_winning=excited.png,That's the spirit! The battle isn't over until your opponent is out!
4-must_strip_winning=fingerup.png,I see you haven't given up your aspirations for victory just yet. That's the correct attitude in a game like this.
4-must_strip_normal=surprised.png,Wow, I really thought I could whittle down the lead with that hand.
4-must_strip_normal=scowling.png,The more I lose like this, the farther I get from snatching away the lead!
4-must_strip_normal=disappointed.png,I've already gone through half my clothes, but the lead isn't with me. How could it have gone this wrong?
4-must_strip_losing=thinking.png,I've already gone through half my clothes, but I still haven't caught up... I need to reevaluate my strategy after this.
4-must_strip_losing=embarrassed.png,I've brought the maximum allowed number of clothes, yet I trail midway through the game... There's no excuse for this.
4-must_strip_losing=fingerup.png,You deserve some praise for bring me to this point. I thought my layer count would give me an inherent advantage, but you've proven me wrong.
4-stripping=stripping.png,Despite this whole thing, I'm more excited than I am embarrassed; I must not allow myself to be defeated!
4-stripping=stripping.png,And yet, despite it all, I'm more excited than I am embarrassed; I will not sully my name with defeat!
4-stripping=stripping.png,I've had many trainers claim that they'll get me out of my pants, which is quite an odd prediction for a Pokémon battle. 
4-stripping=stripping.png,Don't be excited just yet. I have one last trick at my disposal.
4-stripping=stripping.png,I can see the anticipation in your eyes. I'm keeping a big secret inside my pants, if that's what has piqued your interest.


#losing pantyhose
5-stripped=stripped.png,Huh? That's strange... The thought that I just took off my pants in front of others hasn't occurred to me until now; I was too absorbed by the intensity of this match!
5-stripped=stripped.png,<i>(Wait, did I really just take off my pants in front of everyone? ... I didn't even realize; I was so absorbed by this match!)</i>
5-stripped=stripped.png,<i>(Did I really just space out and completely forgot that I was removing my pants? Either way, here I am!)</i>
5-stripped=stripped.png,You guys won't believe this, but I was so focused on the match, I didn't register that I was taking my pants off!
5-stripped=stripped.png,If this was a Pokémon battle, I would be down to my final Pokemon now... Oh! I forgot that my pants are gone!
5-stripped,priority:0,count-male&var;:1-4=stripped.png,<i>(Wait, why is ~male~ staring at me?... Oh, right! I just removed my pants. I didn't even notice.)</i>
5-stripped,priority:0,count-male&var;:1-4=stripped.png,<i>(Why is ~male~ looking at me like that? Did I say something wrong?... Oh, my pants are gone! I was too focused on the game to remember.)</i>
5-stripped,priority:0,count-male&var;:1-4=stripped.png,<i>(Wow, ~male~ is really eyeing me!... Oh yeah, I don't have my pants anymore. No wonder, I was so captivated by the game, I didn't even notice.)</i>
5-must_strip=shocked.png,Ah! Not again!
5-must_strip=surprised.png,Huh? Another loss? I'm beginning to lose count...
5-must_strip=shocked.png,A-another defeat? B-but how? I thought I would have been good at this game!
5-must_strip,priority:0,count-alive&role;other:2=scowling.png,Another crushing defeat by the hands of you two?
5-must_strip,priority:0,count-alive&role;other:3=scowling.png,Another crushing defeat by the hands of you three?
5-must_strip,priority:0,count-alive&role;other:4=scowling.png,Another crushing defeat? Even with all of you playing?
5-must_strip,priority:0,count-alive&role;other:4=scowling.png,Huh? I had the worst hand out of everyone here? <i>Impossible!</i>
5-must_strip_winning=fingerup.png,This is quite impressive! No matter how much I try to pull away, you keep in clawing your way back.
5-must_strip_winning=fingerup.png,You got me again. I must commend you for your perseverance and determination, if not your poker skills. 
5-must_strip_winning=contemplative.png,Perhaps you've figured my strategy out... Perhaps I'm just becoming sloppy due to the prospect of victory.
5-must_strip_normal=excited.png,This game is really coming down to the wire, isn't it? It's certainly more exciting than I had envisioned.
5-must_strip_normal=aggressive.png,We might go the distance here, by the looks of it.
5-must_strip_normal=battleready.png,I thought this would be a relatively quick game... Good thing I didn't have any arrangements after this.
5-must_strip_losing=disappointed.png,My chances of making a triumphant comeback has become even slimmer...
5-must_strip_losing=surprised.png,I figured I might lose a round or two, but to behind like this... I didn't even give a thought about this scenario...
5-must_strip_losing=embarrassed.png,I knew I'm not a champion of poker, but I wouldn't have thought I was this bad at it.
5-stripping=stripping.png,Okay, <i>this</i> is the last defeat I can take! <i>There can't be anymore!</i>
5-stripping=stripping.png,It's not like my pantyhose were doing a good job of hiding what's underneath...
5-stripping=stripping.png,My pantyhose is somewhat see-through, so you probably won't see anything new.
5-stripping=stripping.png,This is the last thing I can spare without shame...
5-stripping=stripping.png,I'm more upset about the fact that I lost; I don't mind stripping this off, you can see through it anyway.
5-stripping=stripping.png,I always felt more comfortable wearing pantyhose than socks.


#losing bra
6-stripped=stripped.png,Okay, that was the last defeat I can withstand <i>for real</i>...
6-stripped=stripped.png,That's it, no more safe options left! Let's do this!
6-stripped=stripped.png,It doesn't feel that different from wearing a swimsuit.
6-stripped=stripped.png,That was the last item I could stand to spare. It's do or die from this point onwards.
6-stripped=stripped.png,I find it odd that walking in your lingerie is supposed to be embarrassing, but doing the same in your swimwear isn't.
6-stripped=stripped.png,I suppose I should avoid going for straights next time... Oh, I was just musing to myself! On to the next round then!
6-must_strip=shocked.png,Ah! NO! I don't have any layers to spare!
6-must_strip=shocked.png,Huh? NO! Not now! Not when I'm only down to my underwear!
6-must_strip=scowling.png,What?! <i>What?!</i> B-but I'm on my last two things! H-how did I... fail... like this...
6-must_strip_winning=surprised.png,Do I... really need to remove my bra?!... Well, since I'm in the lead, I suppose I can spare the embarrassment.
6-must_strip_winning=sarcastic.png,I'm pretty sure my maximizing of the allowed layers is the only thing keeping me in the lead.
6-must_strip_winning=embarrassed.png,On one hand, I commend you for lasting this long. On the other hand, I'm not particularly thrilled at the idea of going topless.
6-must_strip_normal=disappointed.png,... This was the part of the game I was desperately trying to avoid...
6-must_strip_normal=embarrassed.png,This game could have been going a lot better; it could have been a lot worse to be honest. At least, I'm not in last place, yet.
6-must_strip_normal=battleready.png,I have to abide to the same rules as everybody.
6-must_strip_losing=disappointed.png,What a fall from grace...
6-must_strip_losing=shocked.png,I went undefeated for years as the Sinnoh League Champion, yet I can't do well at a simple card game...?
6-must_strip_losing=embarrassed.png,You've all worked hard to bring me to this point. It would be untoward of me to deny you your reward...
6-stripping=stripping.png,I see that strip poker is not a game for the unprepared. You've earned your victories, so I must bare what the rules tell me to bare...
6-stripping=stripping.png,I played this game because I thought <i>others</i> would be stripping this bare... I had no idea there was anything realistically on the line on my end...
6-stripping=stripping.png,I only joined this game expecting an easy victory. No reason to deny I was mistaken on that front. 
6-stripping=stripping.png,<i>(I can't believe I'm really been pushed far enough to do this!)</i>
6-stripping=stripping.png,<i>(I knew fooling around the first 2 rounds would come back to haunt me.)</i>
6-stripping,priority:0,count-exposed:1-=stripping.png,V-very well. If seeing others exposed was my reward for playing, it seems only fair that I give them <i>their</i> reward as well...
6-stripping,priority:0,count-exposed:1-=stripping.png,A-a-at least I'm not the first who has to do this... <i>(I'm not </i>that<i> much of a loser...)</i>
6-stripping,priority:0,count-exposed:1-=stripping.png,At the very least, I'm not the only one who's indecent at this point.


#losing panties
7-stripped=stripped.png,There... there's your <i>reward</i>...
7-stripped=stripped.png,W-well? ... Gah, let's just get to the next round...
7-stripped=stripped.png,W-well? ... H-how do they... A-actually, never mind... Let's just start the next round.
7-stripped=stripped.png,O-okay? Do they look weird... Never mind that, let's get back to the cards, shall we?
7-stripped=stripped.png,This is the first time I've done this in public... I think it would be best if we deal the next hand immediately.
7-stripped,priority:0,count-male&var;:1-=stripped.png,<i>(~Male~'s stare... it's so eerie.)</i>

7-stripped,count-not_crotch_visible&male&role;other&character;human:,test:~human.tag.gay~:false,id:2,marker:MalePlayerAdjustHimself=stripped.png,Looks like something's <i>moving</i> in your clothes, ~player~. You might wann- wai- hey, that's your dick! ~Player~! ... So? Are you going to adjust yourself?
7-stripped,count-not_crotch_visible&male&role;other&character;human:,test:~human.tag.gay~:false,id:2=stripped.png,~Player~, you might wanna... <i>adjust yourself</i> down there... We can see it pulsing through your clothes. <i>(Did taking off my bra really do that?)</i>

7-stripped,count-not_masturbating&male&role;other&character;human:,count-crotch_visible&character;human:,test:~human.tag.gay~:false=stripped.png,H-hey! All it took was me taking off my bra and it made you <i>hard</i>?
7-stripped,count-not_masturbating&male&role;other&character;human:,count-crotch_visible&character;human:,test:~human.tag.gay~:false=stripped.png,<i>(Whoa... I just took off my bra and it was enough to get ~player~ hard...)</i>
7-must_strip=fingerup.png,I'm impressed that you've come this far... You've certainly earned what I'm about to show you...
7-must_strip=fingerup.png,You've fought your way through all 8 of my layers; nobody can say you didn't work hard for this.
7-must_strip=embarrassed.png,I certainly hope this doesn't result in a scandal; I am a well-known figure in the Sinnoh region after all.
7-must_strip=battleready.png,Even if I lose this game, this would help shape the way I play at future games.
7-must_strip,count-not_naked&role;other:0=embarrassed.png,The only thing mitigating the embarrassment in this situation is the fact that I'm not the only one naked.
7-must_strip,count-not_naked&role;other:0=embarrassed.png,Since everyone is already nude, this might not be as bad as it seems.
7-must_strip,count-not_naked&role;other:0=scowling.png,With everyone being naked, I suppose the attention won't be all towards me.
7-must_strip_winning=disappointed.png,Just as I feared; my lead has now completely evaporated.
7-must_strip_winning=battleready.png,The game is now completely even...
7-must_strip_winning=fingerup.png,What an interesting development! You've managed to claw your way back, at my expense!
7-must_strip_winning=happy.png,In my years as the Sinnoh League Champion, nobody has erased my lead quite like this! Poker truly is a remarkable game! 
7-must_strip_normal=disappointed.png,I truly am on my back foot now...
7-must_strip_normal=disappointed.png,My last line of defense is now gone... I can't afford any more mistakes after this...
7-must_strip_normal=embarrassed.png,I really thought I had the game figured out... I even changed the way I exchanged cards...
7-must_strip_normal=thinking.png,I might need to re-evaluate my strategy. It seems my approach is fundamentally flawed. 
7-must_strip_losing=shocked.png,I misread the situation again?! What has gotten into me today?!
7-must_strip_losing=embarrassed.png,... I even played it safe that round... This game really isn't going my way...
7-must_strip_losing=embarrassed.png,I already have one foot out of the door...
7-must_strip_losing=disappointed.png,I didn't know I was this bad at poker; I even brought as many clothes as I was allowed...
7-stripping=stripping.png,Yes, I am a little embarrassed, but more than that, I'm fulfilling my part of the game's agreement. There can be no wavering now!
7-stripping=stripping.png,Nobody is to blame here but me...
7-stripping=stripping.png,<i>(I hope grandma never finds out about this.)</i>
7-stripping=stripping.png,<i>(This is unfitting of a woman of my class.)</i>
7-stripping=stripping.png,<i>(Good thing I cleaned myself up before joining this game.)</i>
7-stripping=stripping.png,This game didn't go the way I had hoped it would. I don't think there was any point at me saying that aloud. You most likely knew that already.
7-stripping=stripping.png,Well, this is my punishment for underestimating everybody at this table.
7-stripping,priority:0,count-male&var;:1-=stripping.png,<i>( I had hoped to impress ~male~ with my poker skills, not my body...)</i>

#OPPONENT MUST STRIP
#These lines are spoken when an opponent must strip, but the character does not yet know what they will take off.
#Writing different variations is important here, as these lines will be spoken about thirty times per game.
#The "human" versions of the lines will only be spoken if the human player is stripping.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written
tie=shocked.png,A... a tie?! I'd have better luck encountering a shiny Pokémon!


#stage-specific lines that override the stage-generic ones

#OPPONENT REMOVING ACCESSORY
#These lines are spoken when an opponent removes a small item that does not cover any skin.
#Typically, characters are fine with this when they are fully dressed but less satisfied as they become more naked.
#Note that all "removing" lines are NOT spoken to human players. Characters will skip straight from "6-male_human_must_strip" to "6-male_removed_accessory", for example.

1-female_removing_accessory=thinking.png,Is that a gift to you, or did you buy it yourself?
1-female_removing_accessory=battleready.png,Increasing your odds of winning through accessories... It seems I'm not the only one who thought of that.
1-female_removing_accessory=sarcastic.png,I can't really criticize you for padding out your layer count without coming off as hypocritical...
1-female_removing_accessory=fingerup.png,Women can get really attached to their accessories, like purses, or jewelry. I don't blame them; they can be very alluring.

2-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;guzma&stage;1&saying;Team Skull:=scowling.png,Team Skull's childish crimes and petty thievery is known even in Sinnoh; your organization is laughed about so widely and you're still willing to associate with them?
2-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;guzma&stage;1&saying;Team Skull:=scowling.png,Are you <i>proud</i> of what your organization has become? I'd rip that thing off in a heart beat if I found it across my neck.

2-male_removed_accessory,count-crotch_visible&role;target:=sarcastic.png,Well then, that's was an unusual surprise to say the least.
2-female_removing_accessory=thinking.png,Is that a gift to you, or did you buy it yourself?
2-female_removing_accessory=battleready.png,Increasing your odds of winning through accessories... It seems I'm not the only one who thought of that.
2-female_removing_accessory=sarcastic.png,I can't really criticize you for padding out your layer count without coming off as hypocritical...
2-female_removing_accessory=fingerup.png,Women can get really attached to their accessories, like purses, or jewelry. I don't blame them; they can be very alluring.
2-female_removing_accessory,weight:0.2=embarrassed.png,Oh, you're taking your ~clothing~ off? I didn't realize that counted.

2-female_removing_accessory,weight:0.2=fingerup.png,The stakes are still low, ~name~, so you needn't worry!
2-female_removing_accessory,weight:0.2=fingerup.png,Taking off your ~clothing~ is a fine decision, really, given the circumstances.
2-female_removing_accessory,weight:0.2=excited.png,When the penalty for defeat is so grim, taking your time with things like your ~clothing~ is pure strategy.
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;misato&stage;1:,id:173=horny.png,Misato, you might want to <i>close up</i> a little; you're showing us a little more than I suspect you intended...

2-female_removing_accessory,totalRounds:0,count-role;other&character;catria&stage;0&saidmarker;firstother:=disappointed.png,Wait, Catria, are you saying somebody by the name of Palla lied to you? That's... that's low... Liars make the worst Pokémon trainers.
2-female_removing_accessory,count-naked&role;target:=surprised.png,But... you're already naked! Why did you wait to leave your ~clothing~ on until now?!
2-female_removing_accessory,count-naked&role;target:=shocked.png,Your ~clothing~?! But you're already naked!

2-female_removed_accessory,weight:0.125=battleready.png,If it's in the rules, then I have no right to complain.
2-female_removed_accessory,weight:0.125=disappointed.png,Right; so the next round, then?
2-female_removed_accessory,weight:0.125=happy.png,Your ~clothing~ was a smart decision, ~name~; no sense in showing more than you need to.
2-female_removed_accessory,weight:0.125=contemplative.png,Right; now, with that out of the way...
2-female_removed_accessory,weight:0.125=fingerup.png,We often find trinkets in our archaeological digs, and they tell a lot about the place. I wonder what stories your ~clothing~ ~clothing.ifPlural(have|has)~ to tell, ~name~. 
2-female_removed_accessory=fingerup.png,Trinkets and baubles often turn up in our archaeological digs. It seems people always have had a passion for accessories.
2-female_removed_accessory=fingerup.png,Accessories might give you a bit of a breathing space, but it's not a ticket for winning. They could only protect you for so long.
2-female_removed_accessory=excited.png,Now that your ~clothing~ ~clothing.ifPlural(are|is)~ out of the way, we can start with the next round.
2-female_removed_accessory=happy.png,I hope you don't misplace your ~clothing~, ~name~. It's just so easy to lose them when you're not paying attention.

2-female_removed_accessory,count-naked&role;target:=sarcastic.png,This is a very unusual stripping order you're utilizing, ~name~.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-naked&role;target:=scowling.png,Did you come here just so you could show your privates to all of us, ~name~?
2-female_removed_accessory,count-naked&role;target:=contemplative.png,I was expecting the unexpected, but this wasn't one of them. This was too illogical for me to have anticipated.

4-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;2&saying;weapons count:,id:78=excited.png,Weapons? What predators do angels protect themselves from, Pit?

4-female_removed_accessory=sarcastic.png,Accessories can only take you so far, ~name~. I mean, look at what happened to me.

5-male_removing_accessory,count-crotch_visible&role;target:=surprised.png,Why did you expose your penis but removing your ~clothing~?... Don't tell me you just wanted to show your penis to us!
5-male_removing_accessory,count-crotch_visible&role;target:=surprised.png,What?! But... you're not even wearing pants! Why did you leave your ~clothing~ after?!
5-male_removed_accessory,weight:0.33=aggressive.png,No, really, I don't mind, ~name~; you as a competitor have every right to use the rules to your fullest advantage!
5-male_removed_accessory,weight:0.33=fingerup.png,Hey, don't hate the player, hate the rules, right?
5-male_removed_accessory,weight:0.33=battleready.png,If it's in the rules, then I have no right to complain.
5-male_removed_accessory=battleready.png,That's enough about your ~clothing~; let's resume the game, shall we?
5-male_removed_accessory=aggressive.png,Let's not dwell too much about your ~clothing~. We wouldn't want to bore people with such trivial conversations.
5-male_removed_accessory=disappointed.png,Your accessories can only do so much to protect you; trust me, that's what I've experienced.

5-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;2&saying;Everything's fine:,id:80=fingerup.png,Don't worry, Pit, I won't say anything.
5-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;2&saying;Everything's fine:,id:80=battleready.png,Are you sure, Pit? I don't suspect things will stay fine for <i>that</i> much longer, all things considered...
5-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;2&saying;sacrifice will:,id:76=aggressive.png,Ha, <i>sacrifice</i>! Spoken like a true warrior, Pit!
5-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;2&saying;sacrifice will:,id:76=thinking.png,<i>Sacrifice?</i> Is there some mythology about angels and sacrificing their clothing?
5-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;2&saying;sacrifice will:,id:76=thinking.png,<i>Sacrifice?</i> Pit, is there some sort of folklore about this that I'm not familiar with?

5-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;2&saying;sacrifice will:,id:76=thinking.png,<i>Sacrifice?</i> What else do angels <i>sacrifice</i>, Pit? This is important for my research!
5-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;2&saying;sacrifice will:,id:76=battleready.png,<i>Sacrifice?</i> What else do angels <i>sacrifice</i>, Pit? I must know the answer.

5-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;1&saying;tenfold:,id:68=battleready.png,Tenfold? That's quite ambitious of you, Pit; I like that.
5-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;1&saying;tenfold:,id:68=aggressive.png,Tenfold? Why, with the fires igniting in your eyes, anything is possible!
5-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;1&saying;tenfold:,id:68=aggressive.png,That's right, Pit, don't give up!
5-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;1&saying;tenfold:,id:68=aggressive.png,I know you can do it, Pit! Get back in there!
5-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;1&saying;tenfold:,id:68=battleready.png,Tenfold? I appreciate your enthusiasm, Pit, but with me around, I don't think that's possible!
5-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;n&stage;1&saying;Alright. Bracelets off.:=disappointed.png,Hmmm, don't take this the wrong way, N, but I wouldn't call your look <i>stylish</i>... It's more like... <i>an intentional mess</i>.
5-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;n&stage;1&saying;Alright. Bracelets off.:=disappointed.png,Hmmm, don't take this the wrong way, N, but you could learn a thing or two about style; your look is kind of just a drab collage of colors.
5-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;1&saying; getting started:,id:67=aggressive.png,I like your enthusiasm, Pit; show me what you're capable of!
5-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;1&saying; getting started:,id:67=aggressive.png,This was your first loss, Pit, but don't expect it to be your last!
5-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;1&saying; getting started:,id:67=aggressive.png,Even if you're knocked down, Pit, you can always get back up!
5-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;1&saying; getting started:,id:67=excited.png,You're not down for the count yet, Pit. Get back in there!
5-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;n&stage;3:=sarcastic.png,My my, N, you sure have an impressive head of hair! Quite like myself, if I must say.
5-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;n&stage;3:=sarcastic.png,Well, N, that's quite the head of hair; what kind of conditioner do you use?
5-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;n&stage;3:=sarcastic.png,I see that you <i>too</i> keep your hair well kept, N; kudos!
5-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;n&stage;3:=fingerup.png,Well, you certainly have your hair-care down to a science!
5-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;n&stage;3:=fingerup.png,I <i>too</i> take good care of my hair. Want to know the secret? My conditioner is made with <i>honey</i> from a Vespiquen hive!
5-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;1&saying;I was expecting:,id:60=embarrassed.png,Oh, trust me, Pit... They get tougher, as evidenced by, well... my condition...
5-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;1&saying;I was expecting:,id:60=embarrassed.png,Things start out easy, Pit... but they get tougher once you take off your pants, heeeh...
5-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;jotaro&stage;1:=thinking.png,That flash appeared to have originated from you, Jotaro... Oh, your belt is gone... Perhaps, I was just blinded by reflection from your belt buckle.
5-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;guzma&stage;2:=scowling.png,That's awfully presumptuous, Guzma; you will admit defeat just like the rest of the criminal scum who've dared challenge me.
5-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;chazz&stage;3:=fingerup.png,These three lake guardians taught humans the ability to feel emotions, gain knowledge, and use willpower!

5-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;2&saying;weapons count:,id:78=excited.png,Weapons? Ah, Pit, you have no idea how much I look forward to examining the weapons from another civilization!
5-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;2&saying;weapons count:,id:78=excited.png,Weapons are such a fascinating thing to study from other cultures, Pit. Please, you must tell me more!
5-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;2&saying;weapons count:,id:78=excited.png,Weapons? Ah, I missed out too, then; I would have loved to look at tools from another culture.
5-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;2&saying;weapons count:,id:78=excited.png,I don't think I've read anything about angelic weapons, Pit; that subject didn't come up in the books...
5-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;2&saying;weapons count:,id:78=excited.png,I don't think I've read anything about angelic weapons, Pit; that's something I have little background on.
5-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;2&saying;weapons count:,id:78=excited.png,I don't think I've read anything about angelic weapons, Pit; I would love to know more about how Skyworld defends itself.
5-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;2&saying;weapons count:,id:78=excited.png,Weapons? Speaking of, Pit, what exactly does Skyworld need to defend itself from? Who are your invaders?
5-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;2&saying;weapons count:,id:78=excited.png,Weapons? Tell me, what predators hunt angels, Pit?
5-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;2&saying;weapons count:,id:78=excited.png,Weapons? What predators do angels protect themselves from, Pit?
5-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;2&saying;weapons count:,id:78=excited.png,Weapons? Pit, we must meet after tonight's game; I've always wanted to study weapons from the mythical Skyworld.
5-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;guzma&stage;5:=disappointed.png,You know, it's surprising... You're still the same Guzma as before, but you already look more respectable with that ridiculous chain off your neck.
5-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;guzma&stage;5:=disappointed.png,You know, it's surprising... You're still the same Guzma as before, but you already look more respectable with that cheap trinket off your neck.
5-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;guzma&stage;5:=disappointed.png,You know, it's surprising... Without that chain around you neck, you almost look respectable...
5-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;guzma&stage;5:=disappointed.png,You know, it's surprising... Without that absurd knickknack around you neck, you almost look respectable...

5-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;1&saying; getting started:,id:69=embarrassed.png,It's... I'm ashamed to be this far down, Pit... To think that you're only getting started while I'm almost out...
5-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;guzma&stage;1&saying;Team Skull:=scowling.png,You're seriously willing to <i>rep</i> for those guys? Their childish crimes and petty thievery make them the laughing stock of Alola.
5-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;guzma&stage;1&saying;Team Skull:=scowling.png,Team Skull's childish crimes and petty thievery is known even in Sinnoh; your organization is laughed about so widely and you're still willing to associate with them?
5-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;guzma&stage;1&saying;Team Skull:=scowling.png,Are you <i>proud</i> of what your organization has become? I'd rip that thing off in a heart beat if I found it across my neck.
5-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;guzma&stage;1&saying;Team Skull:=scowling.png,Are you <i>proud</i> of what your organization has become? I'd die of humiliation if I found that thing across my neck.

5-male_removed_accessory,count-crotch_visible&role;target:=surprised.png,Did you just happen to forget your ~clothing~ or was that part of your plan?
5-male_removed_accessory,count-crotch_visible&role;target:=sarcastic.png,This is a very unusual stripping order you're utilizing, ~name~.
5-male_removed_accessory,count-crotch_visible&role;target:=sarcastic.png,I sincerely hope you didn't rush to show your penis to all of us here.
5-male_removed_accessory,count-crotch_visible&role;target:=sarcastic.png,Well then, that's was an unusual surprise to say the least.
5-female_removing_accessory=fingerup.png,Early in human history, most accessories were merely for aesthetic purposes.
5-female_removing_accessory=sarcastic.png,You outlasted me in terms of accessories, ~name~. I felt that I lost mine too quickly.
5-female_removing_accessory=happy.png,I hope you're not too upset about losing your ~clothing~, ~name~. Trinkets often have some form of sentimental value.
5-female_removing_accessory,weight:0.2=embarrassed.png,Oh, you're taking your ~clothing~ off? I didn't realize that counted.
5-female_removing_accessory,weight:0.2=disappointed.png,Come on, ~name~, I know we're all playing to win here, but don't you think you could have been just a <i>little</i> more ambitious?
5-female_removing_accessory,weight:0.2=battleready.png,Bringing accessories is kind of cheap, but hey, anything to win, right?
5-female_removing_accessory,weight:0.2=fingerup.png,The stakes are still low, ~name~, so you needn't worry!
5-female_removing_accessory,weight:0.2=fingerup.png,Taking off your ~clothing~ is a fine decision, really, given the circumstances.
5-female_removing_accessory,weight:0.2=excited.png,When the penalty for defeat is so grim, taking your time with things like your ~clothing~ is pure strategy.
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;elesa&stage;2:=happy.png,Now those are what I call headphones!
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;elesa&stage;2:=excited.png,Those are rather cute! It's the little things that really pull an outfit together.
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;elesa&stage;2:=embarrassed.png,You certainly put a lot of effort into every last detail of your outfit! I just... stick to black
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;elesa&stage;1&saying; magnets.:=thinking.png,Oh, like a Magnezone? Yeah, yeah I can see it...
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;elesa&stage;1&saying; magnets.:=thinking.png,Why, I suppose they do remind me of Magnezones...
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;elesa&stage;1&saying; magnets.:=thinking.png,I've seen some Magnezones at Mt. Coronet, and you're right! Those do resemble a Magnezone.

5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;elesa&stage;2&saying;listening to:,count-male:0=fingerup.png,What, are you embarrassed or something? It's just us girls here.
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;elesa&stage;2&saying;listening to:,count-male&var;:1=fingerup.png,What's the matter, are you embarrassed? I don't think ~male~ will judge you.

That's... that's low... You can  tell this Palla that she's hereby suspended from Pokémon League battles until further notice.
5-female_removing_accessory,totalRounds:0,count-role;other&character;catria&stage;0&saidmarker;firstother:=disappointed.png,Wait, Catria, are you saying somebody by the name of Palla lied to you? That's... that's low... Liars make the worst Pokémon trainers.
5-female_removing_accessory,count-naked&role;target:=surprised.png,But... you're already naked! Why did you wait to leave your ~clothing~ on until now?!
5-female_removing_accessory,count-naked&role;target:=shocked.png,Your ~clothing~?! But you're already naked!
5-female_removing_accessory,count-naked&role;target:=surprised.png,You still have your ~clothing~ on? Shouldn't you have removed that first?
5-female_removed_accessory=aggressive.png,I can consider this as nothing more than a slight delay towards victory.
5-female_removed_accessory=excited.png,Now that that's out of the way, we can move on to the next round.
5-female_removed_accessory=sarcastic.png,Accessories can only take you so far, ~name~. I mean, look at what happened to me.
5-female_removed_accessory=fingerup.png,A layer is a layer; doesn't matter if it's a small accessory or a full body suit. They all count as one piece.
5-female_removed_accessory,weight:0.125=aggressive.png,No, really, I don't mind, ~name~; you as a competitor have every right to use the rules to your fullest advantage!
5-female_removed_accessory,weight:0.125=fingerup.png,Hey, don't hate the player, hate the rules, right?
5-female_removed_accessory,weight:0.125=battleready.png,If it's in the rules, then I have no right to complain.
5-female_removed_accessory,weight:0.125=disappointed.png,Right; so the next round, then?
5-female_removed_accessory,weight:0.125=happy.png,Your ~clothing~ was a smart decision, ~name~; no sense in showing more than you need to.
5-female_removed_accessory,weight:0.125=contemplative.png,Right; now, with that out of the way...
5-female_removed_accessory,weight:0.125=fingerup.png,We often find trinkets in our archaeological digs, and they tell a lot about the place. I wonder what stories your ~clothing~ ~clothing.ifPlural(have|has)~ to tell, ~name~. 
5-female_removed_accessory=embarrassed.png,Oh, right... some of us have accessories left to spare...
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;elesa&stage;2&saying;Are you interested:=fingerup.png,Ha! Well, I must admit, there's a certain <i>glamor</i> about you that I find quite <i>charming</i>. But I wouldn't say I'm <i>interested</i>.

5-female_removed_accessory,count-naked&role;target:=disappointed.png,I really hope you're not an exhibitionist, ~name~.
5-female_removed_accessory,count-naked&role;target:=sarcastic.png,This is a very unusual stripping order you're utilizing, ~name~.
5-female_removed_accessory,count-naked&role;target:=scowling.png,Did you come here just so you could show your privates to all of us, ~name~?
5-female_removed_accessory,count-naked&role;target:=contemplative.png,I was expecting the unexpected, but this wasn't one of them. This was too illogical for me to have anticipated.

6-male_removed_accessory,count-crotch_visible&role;target:=sarcastic.png,This is a very unusual stripping order you're utilizing, ~name~.

6-male_removed_accessory,count-crotch_visible&role;target:=sarcastic.png,Well then, that's was an unusual surprise to say the least.
6-female_removing_accessory=surprised.png,I knew I was a bit behind but this... this shakes up my perspective a lot...
6-female_removing_accessory=aggressive.png,The presence of your ~clothing~ doesn't bother me... I know that I can still make a comeback.
6-female_removing_accessory=fingerup.png,It doesn't really matter if it's a trinket or a large piece of cloth; they all count as a single loss.

6-female_removing_accessory,weight:0.2=battleready.png,Bringing accessories is kind of cheap, but hey, anything to win, right?
6-female_removing_accessory,weight:0.2=fingerup.png,The stakes are still low, ~name~, so you needn't worry!
6-female_removing_accessory,weight:0.2=fingerup.png,Taking off your ~clothing~ is a fine decision, really, given the circumstances.
6-female_removing_accessory,weight:0.2=excited.png,When the penalty for defeat is so grim, taking your time with things like your ~clothing~ is pure strategy.
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;elesa&stage;2:=happy.png,Now those are what I call headphones!
6-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;elesa&stage;2:=excited.png,Those are rather cute! It's the little things that really pull an outfit together.

That's... that's low... You can  tell this Palla that she's hereby suspended from Pokémon League battles until further notice.
6-female_removing_accessory,totalRounds:0,count-role;other&character;catria&stage;0&saidmarker;firstother:=disappointed.png,Wait, Catria, are you saying somebody by the name of Palla lied to you? That's... that's low... Liars make the worst Pokémon trainers.

6-female_removing_accessory,count-naked&role;target:=surprised.png,You still have your ~clothing~ on? Shouldn't you have removed that first?
6-female_removed_accessory=disappointed.png,I didn't realize you still had some accessories to spare at this point of the game. I have a really big hill to climb.
6-female_removed_accessory=thinking.png,Mind games... that what I presume you're doing to me by leaving your ~clothing~ so late into the game.
6-female_removed_accessory=aggressive.png,Being calm and composed is very important for a League Champion, and I'm not the least bit fazed by your apparent advantage.
6-female_removed_accessory,weight:0.125=aggressive.png,No, really, I don't mind, ~name~; you as a competitor have every right to use the rules to your fullest advantage!
6-female_removed_accessory,weight:0.125=fingerup.png,Hey, don't hate the player, hate the rules, right?
6-female_removed_accessory,weight:0.125=battleready.png,If it's in the rules, then I have no right to complain.
6-female_removed_accessory,weight:0.125=disappointed.png,Right; so the next round, then?
6-female_removed_accessory,weight:0.125=happy.png,Your ~clothing~ was a smart decision, ~name~; no sense in showing more than you need to.
6-female_removed_accessory,weight:0.125=contemplative.png,Right; now, with that out of the way...
6-female_removed_accessory,weight:0.125=fingerup.png,We often find trinkets in our archaeological digs, and they tell a lot about the place. I wonder what stories your ~clothing~ ~clothing.ifPlural(have|has)~ to tell, ~name~.

#OPPONENT REMOVING MAJOR CLOTHING
#Major clothing reveals a significant amount of skin and likely underwear.
#However, as we don't know if the opponent is taking off the top or the bottom, we can't presume that nice abs are showing; maybe she took of her skirt before her shirt.

1-male_removing_major,id:267=disappointed.png,I was expecting a stronger challenge from you, ~name~. I've only lost once, while you've lost your ~clothing~ already.
1-male_removing_major,id:267=fingerup.png,I've been in countless Pokémon battles, and I can tell you that comebacks happen more often than you think. You just need the willpower to begin one.
1-male_removing_major,id:267=sarcastic.png,Well, losing your ~clothing~ this easily is never good, but you probably already know that.

1-male_removed_major,id:276=fingerup.png,Don't forget that poker will always have the factor of randomness to it. You never know, you might not lose another round again!

1-male_removed_major,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;4&saying; look you in the eye:,id:113=thinking.png,Huh? Men aren't supposed to feel embarrassed simply by being shirtless... Are social norms different in Skyworld?
1-male_removed_major,count-role;target&character;pit&stage;4&saying; look you in the eye:,id:113=thinking.png,Have social norms evolved differently in Skyworld, Pit? A guy shouldn't normally be that embarrassed by simply exposing his chest.

1-female_removed_major,weight:0.25=aggressive.png,Oh, getting close to the end, are we?
1-female_removed_major,id:244=aggressive.png,You might be down, but I wouldn't bet against you, ~name~. I can see the fire in your eyes; you won't be giving up.

0-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Ha ha, okay, okay Guzma. This would have been much more hilarious if the <i>big bad</i> leader of Team Skull turned out to have a tiny penis.
0-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=disappointed.png,This accomplishment doesn't feel quite as good when it's pretty much handed to me.
0-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=disappointed.png,What makes an achievement truly rewarding is the sheer effort it takes to accomplish it. I can't say the same when you wanted to be naked in the first place.

0-male_large_crotch_is_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=scowling.png,I have to concede that your size is impressive... but you still intentionally lost. That's not the proper sporting spirit.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible=sarcastic.png,If this keeps up, I might be able to join another game before it gets too late.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible=disappointed.png,I intentionally picked out this group because I expected an easy win, but this is a little too easy to be enjoyable.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible=thinking.png,Have you guys ever wondered why it's taboo for women to be topless but not men?
0-female_chest_will_be_visible=thinking.png,I've heard that some countries allow public toplessness, even in the presence of children. They even allow it in television broadcasts without any censorship.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible=fingerup.png,I can see you struggling, ~name~, so here's a poker tip for you: never go for straights. You should instead aim for a pair or even a high card instead.

0-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=sarcastic.png,Don't get <i>too</i> excited, ~name~; someone might think you're some sort of exhibitionist.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=surprised.png,~Name~, you almost look excited to be showing off your breasts... Is there something we should know?

0-female_small_chest_is_visible=happy.png,Oh, it's beautiful! There's no shame in small breasts, ~name~. They all function just the same regardless of size.
0-female_small_chest_is_visible=happy.png,Small breasts like yours are a tad underrated, I'd say. They're just as impressive as their larger counterparts.
0-female_small_chest_is_visible=fingerup.png,Despite what popular depictions might show you, most historically-significant women didn't had an average bust size. Your breast size shouldn't define who you are.
0-female_small_chest_is_visible=excited.png,Looking for tops must be easier for you, or so I've heard. Some of my well-endowed friends told me that it can be difficult looking for bras that fit them.
0-female_small_chest_is_visible=excited.png,I know of some people who are insecure of their small breasts, which I don't understand. All size are great in my opinion.

0-female_small_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-male&var;:1-4,weight:2=fingerup.png,It's okay ~name~, guys don't really care that much how big they are! Guys like ~male~ like boobs no matter how big or small they are!
0-female_small_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-male&var;:1-4,weight:2=fingerup.png,It's okay, ~name~, guys like ~male~ aren't that picky about size!
0-female_small_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-male&var;:1-4,weight:2=excited.png,Don't feel down, ~name~; to a guy, small tits are better than no tits!
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible=embarrassed.png,It might not be apparent now, but we're almost the same size, ~name~... I hope that didn't come off as creepy. That wasn't my intention.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible=fingerup.png,You appear to be averagely-sized. Not that there's anything wrong with that. We're not competing for size here. Besides, every size is perfect!
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible=thinking.png,I might be generalizing a bit here, but all clothing stores in Sinnoh seem to be geared towards medium-sized women.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible=happy.png,Not too big, yet not too small. I always say that a perfect balance is the only real balance there is.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible=happy.png,Just because your breast size is average, doesn't mean they're average... Well, you get what I meant...
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible=fingerup.png,Oh, those don't look too bad, ~name~! I'm sure the guys love them!
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible=fingerup.png,Oh, those don't look too bad, ~name~! I'm sure the guys love them! They're boobs, after all.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-male&var;:1-4=fingerup.png,Those look quite nice, ~name~! Ha, and it looks like ~male~ agrees since he's staring so much.

0-female_large_chest_is_visible=thinking.png,Can you even run comfortably with a bust that size? Having your breast bounce around while sprinting must be painful.
0-female_large_chest_is_visible=surprised.png,~clothing.ifPlural(Were|Was)~ your ~clothing~ a proper fit for you, ~name~? I can understand that looking for ~clothing.ifPlural(|a)~ well-fitted ~clothing~ isn't simple for someone with your breast size.
0-female_large_chest_is_visible=sarcastic.png,I remember as a child, I would stuff pokeballs on my shirt. I'm pretty sure I wasn't the only girl who did that.
0-female_large_chest_is_visible=thinking.png,I wonder if having a larger breast size makes breastfeeding easier or more difficult... Hmm, I'll wager it's the latter.
0-female_large_chest_is_visible=happy.png,Looks like someone has the makings of a champion!

0-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-huge_breasts&role;target:=surprised.png,... That can't be natural, can it?
0-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-huge_breasts&role;target:=fingerup.png,A bust that large... I don't think even the most voluptuous of historical queens had that size.
0-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-huge_breasts&role;target:=excited.png,The phrase "bountiful bosom" is thrown around a lot in ancient texts, but these might be on another level entirely.
0-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-huge_breasts&role;target:=fingerup.png,Even the bustiest of fertility idols can't match up to those! Your breasts are simply on a class of their own.
0-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-huge_breasts&role;target:=embarrassed.png,Gosh, those look so heavy. That can't possibly be good for your posture, or your back.

0-female_crotch_will_be_visible=shocked.png,Nobody can be this unlucky! I can hardly believe this!
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible=surprised.png,Are you doing this intentionally, ~name~? Is this your idea of a distraction, or are you really this unlucky?

0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=scowling.png,What's even the point of joining a strip poker game if you're just playing to lose immediately?

1-male_small_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;kazuma&stage;6:,marker:KazumaPenis=embarrassed.png,Oh, i uh... I don't mean to question your manliness, but... well, nevermind...
1-male_small_crotch_is_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=sarcastic.png,... That's it?!... You were very eager to show us your penis, and that's all of it?
1-male_small_crotch_is_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=sarcastic.png,I expected more from you, considering how excited you were to show your rod to all of us.
1-male_small_crotch_is_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=furious.png,All the eagerness to lose, only to show us that? Is this some sort of cruel prank?
1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Ha ha, I was only teasing, Guzma.
1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Okay, okay, so you're not as small as I was hoping...
1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Okay, okay Guzma; I was hoping you would be smaller.
1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Ha ha, <i>darn</i>. I was hoping you would have been smaller; it would have been much funnier that way.
1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Ha ha, okay, okay Guzma. This would have been much more hilarious if it were smaller.
1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Ha ha, okay, okay Guzma. This would have been much more hilarious if the <i>big bad</i> leader of Team Skull turned out to have a tiny penis.
1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=disappointed.png,This accomplishment doesn't feel quite as good when it's pretty much handed to me.
1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=disappointed.png,What makes an achievement truly rewarding is the sheer effort it takes to accomplish it. I can't say the same when you wanted to be naked in the first place.
1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=frustrated.png,I bet you're <i>just absolutely thrilled</i> to be naked in front of everybody, ~name~.
1-male_large_crotch_is_visible=horny.png,Ha, now this is what I like to see! I was hoping to see a big one tonight.
1-male_large_crotch_is_visible=excited.png,Oh, dear! That's... that's larger than the ones I've seen in the ancient cave paintings...
1-male_large_crotch_is_visible=happy.png,My, you sure seem to be gifted, ~name~. Isn't nature a wonderful thing to be blessing some of us with such gifts?
1-male_large_crotch_is_visible=shocked.png,It's so big! I never thought those phallic sculptures were meant to be life-sized!
1-male_large_crotch_is_visible=surprised.png,It must have been difficult looking for ~clothing.ifPlural(|a)~ ~clothing~ that ~clothing.ifPlural(fit|fits)~ your... <i>uh</i>... credentials.
1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=shocked.png,No wonder you were so eager to show it to everybody! It's massive!
1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=shocked.png,I finally understand why you couldn't wait to play show-and-tell with all of us...
1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=scowling.png,I have to concede that your size is impressive... but you still intentionally lost. That's not the proper sporting spirit.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible=sarcastic.png,If this keeps up, I might be able to join another game before it gets too late.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible=disappointed.png,I intentionally picked out this group because I expected an easy win, but this is a little too easy to be enjoyable.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible=thinking.png,Have you guys ever wondered why it's taboo for women to be topless but not men?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible=thinking.png,I've heard that some countries allow public toplessness, even in the presence of children. They even allow it in television broadcasts without any censorship.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible=fingerup.png,I can see you struggling, ~name~, so here's a poker tip for you: never go for straights. You should instead aim for a pair or even a high card instead.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,weight:0.3=sarcastic.png,Sorry, ~name~, but it looks like it's time...
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;cammy_white&saidmarker;juri_help:,count-role;other&character;juri&stage;0:,id:181=thinking.png,Juri? This is no time to be fooling around...

1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=sarcastic.png,Ha, if I didn't know any better, I'd say it looks like you're almost <i>happy</i> to be taking off your ~clothing~.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=sarcastic.png,Don't get <i>too</i> excited, ~name~; someone might think you're some sort of exhibitionist.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=surprised.png,~Name~, you almost look excited to be showing off your breasts... Is there something we should know?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-male:0,test:~background.time~:day=embarrassed.png,I understand, ~name~, that this game isn't very kind. But rules are rules.

1-female_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,test:~background.voyeur~:true,weight:3=embarrassed.png,Oh, having to show the goods with so many people around, heeeeh... Good luck!
1-female_small_chest_is_visible=sarcastic.png,Oh, hee... Those are quite small...
1-female_small_chest_is_visible=happy.png,Oh, it's beautiful! There's no shame in small breasts, ~name~. They all function just the same regardless of size.
1-female_small_chest_is_visible=happy.png,Small breasts like yours are a tad underrated, I'd say. They're just as impressive as their larger counterparts.
1-female_small_chest_is_visible=fingerup.png,Despite what popular depictions might show you, most historically-significant women didn't had an average bust size. Your breast size shouldn't define who you are.
1-female_small_chest_is_visible=excited.png,Looking for tops must be easier for you, or so I've heard. Some of my well-endowed friends told me that it can be difficult looking for bras that fit them.
1-female_small_chest_is_visible=excited.png,I know of some people who are insecure of their small breasts, which I don't understand. All size are great in my opinion.
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;videl:,id:115=fingerup.png,Still clutching onto strings, are we? Well, I certainly admire your perseverance!
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-male:0,test:~background~:street:!=,weight:2=fingerup.png,It's okay, we're all girls here! No need to feel embarrassed.
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-male:0,test:~background~:street:!=,weight:2=excited.png,It's not like there's any guys here, so don't feel ashamed, ~name~!
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-male:0,test:~background~:street:!=,weight:2=fingerup.png,Don't feel insecure, ~name~; guys just want to see you naked. They don't care what you look like naked, they'll like you anyway!
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-male:0,test:~background~:street,id:37,weight:2=disappointed.png,It's okay, we're all girls here! No need to feel embarrassed... Oh, right... I forgot about the onlookers...
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-male:0,test:~background~:street,id:37,weight:2=disappointed.png,It's not like there's any guys here, so don't feel ashamed, ~name~! O-oh, right... The crowd behind us...
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-male&var;:1-4,weight:2=fingerup.png,It's okay ~name~, guys don't really care that much how big they are! Guys like ~male~ like boobs no matter how big or small they are!
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-male&var;:1-4,weight:2=fingerup.png,It's okay, ~name~, guys like ~male~ aren't that picky about size!
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-male&var;:1-4,weight:2=excited.png,Don't feel down, ~name~; to a guy, small tits are better than no tits!
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible=embarrassed.png,It might not be apparent now, but we're almost the same size, ~name~... I hope that didn't come off as creepy. That wasn't my intention.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible=fingerup.png,You appear to be averagely-sized. Not that there's anything wrong with that. We're not competing for size here. Besides, every size is perfect!
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible=thinking.png,I might be generalizing a bit here, but all clothing stores in Sinnoh seem to be geared towards medium-sized women.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible=happy.png,Not too big, yet not too small. I always say that a perfect balance is the only real balance there is.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible=happy.png,Just because your breast size is average, doesn't mean they're average... Well, you get what I meant...
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible=fingerup.png,Oh, those don't look too bad, ~name~! I'm sure the guys love them!
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible=fingerup.png,Oh, those don't look too bad, ~name~! I'm sure the guys love them! They're boobs, after all.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-male&var;:1-4=fingerup.png,Those look quite nice, ~name~! Ha, and it looks like ~male~ agrees since he's staring so much.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible=battleready.png,I can just imagine how difficult it is to buy bras your size. I mean it's difficult for any size, but still...
1-female_large_chest_is_visible=thinking.png,Can you even run comfortably with a bust that size? Having your breast bounce around while sprinting must be painful.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible=surprised.png,~clothing.ifPlural(Were|Was)~ your ~clothing~ a proper fit for you, ~name~? I can understand that looking for ~clothing.ifPlural(|a)~ well-fitted ~clothing~ isn't simple for someone with your breast size.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible=sarcastic.png,I remember as a child, I would stuff pokeballs on my shirt. I'm pretty sure I wasn't the only girl who did that.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible=thinking.png,I wonder if having a larger breast size makes breastfeeding easier or more difficult... Hmm, I'll wager it's the latter.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible=happy.png,Looks like someone has the makings of a champion!
1-female_large_chest_is_visible=happy.png,My, you sure seem to be gifted, ~name~. Isn't mother nature a wonderful thing to be blessing some of us with such gifts?

1-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-huge_breasts&role;target:=excited.png,Oh, what a sight! I was suspecting that you had padded your ~clothing~, but they actually are massive!
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-huge_breasts&role;target:=surprised.png,... That can't be natural, can it?
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-huge_breasts&role;target:=fingerup.png,A bust that large... I don't think even the most voluptuous of historical queens had that size.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-huge_breasts&role;target:=excited.png,The phrase "bountiful bosom" is thrown around a lot in ancient texts, but these might be on another level entirely.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-huge_breasts&role;target:=fingerup.png,Even the bustiest of fertility idols can't match up to those! Your breasts are simply on a class of their own.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-huge_breasts&role;target:=embarrassed.png,Gosh, those look so heavy. That can't possibly be good for your posture, or your back.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-huge_breasts&role;target:=sarcastic.png,A random thought just came to me... could you use your cleavage as a storage of sorts?
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-male&var;:1-4,weight:2=sarcastic.png,Ha ha, well don't stare <i>too</i> hard, ~male~, or ~name~ might think you're a creep!
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible=excited.png,~Name~ is really going to reveal her... Oh, things have gotten interesting.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible=surprised.png,How are you losing your ~clothing~ already? Do you even know how to play poker?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible=surprised.png,Even for a game decided by randomness, this is such an unfortunate outcome for you.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible=shocked.png,Nobody can be this unlucky! I can hardly believe this!
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible=surprised.png,Are you doing this intentionally, ~name~? Is this your idea of a distraction, or are you really this unlucky?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=scowling.png,Hold on, this is what you wanted to the from the beginning, did you?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=scowling.png,What's even the point of joining a strip poker game if you're just playing to lose immediately?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=scowling.png,This game might be about nudity, but that doesn't excuse your desire to show your crotch to unsuspecting people, ~name~.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:cammy_white,targetSaidMarker:chunli_help,alsoPlaying:chun-li,alsoPlayingStage:0,id:184=disappointed.png,Horseplay? During our game? ... Can't we be just a <i>little</i> serious?
1-female_crotch_is_visible=disappointed.png,It doesn't feel right somehow that you're already at this point while I'm still fully covered.
1-female_crotch_is_visible=sarcastic.png,<i>(Maybe this table was a little too easy...)</i>
1-female_crotch_is_visible=disappointed.png,Perhaps coming in with this many pieces of clothing wasn't necessary at all. But then again, this is just my normal attire.
1-female_crotch_is_visible=fingerup.png,This would be quite the uphill battle for you, ~name~, but you can still come back from this. Anything can happen in a game of chance!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,weight:0.25=horny.png,Oh my, that looks... Quite wet.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,weight:0.25=horny.png,Oh... (<i>why... why is this getting me wet?</i>)
1-female_crotch_is_visible,weight:0.25=horny.png,I suppose it's the... <i>excitement</i> of the situation that's making me a bit wet...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,weight:0.25=happy.png,I know she's not out yet, but this is almost like a victory itself!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;mia:,id:169=embarrassed.png,Mia, I think you're showing off something more valuable than... uhh, well, let's just say I think you got the <i>order</i> wrong... Right?

2-male_chest_will_be_visible=fingerup.png,Mankind has always been fascinated by the male physique, if the statues are anything to go by.

2-male_chest_will_be_visible=fingerup.png,In the past, men being topless was actually the norm! With the weather at Sinnoh as it is, people back then must have been more resistant to the cold.

2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Are you trying to hype this up or something Guzma? Come on, I'm sure it's as small as we're all thinking.
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,You're the <i>big</i> bad leader of Team Skull? Or are you a <i>small</i> leader...
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,You may be the <i>big</i> bad leader, but I'm sure you also have a <i>small</i> member.
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,You may be the <i>big</i> bad leader, but I'm sure you also have a <i>small</i> member, if you catch my drift.
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=scowling.png,Hold on, this is what you wanted to the from the beginning, isn't it?
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=scowling.png,What's even the point of joining a strip poker game if you're just playing to lose immediately?
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=scowling.png,This game might be about nudity, but that doesn't excuse your desire to show your penis to unsuspecting people, ~name~.
2-male_small_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;kazuma&stage;6:,marker:KazumaPenis=embarrassed.png,Oh, uh... Are the... balls supposed to hang lower than the... er, nevermind...
2-male_small_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;kazuma&stage;6:,marker:KazumaPenis=embarrassed.png,Oh, do you have, uh... <i>micropenis?</i> That looks... that looks nothing like what I've seen in the ancient sketches.
2-male_small_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;kazuma&stage;6:,marker:KazumaPenis=embarrassed.png,Oh, i uh... I don't mean to question your manliness, but... well, nevermind...
2-male_small_crotch_is_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=sarcastic.png,... That's it?!... You were very eager to show us your penis, and that's all of it?
2-male_small_crotch_is_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=sarcastic.png,I expected more from you, considering how excited you were to show your rod to all of us.
2-male_small_crotch_is_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=furious.png,All the eagerness to lose, only to show us that? Is this some sort of cruel prank?
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Ha ha, I was only teasing, Guzma.
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Okay, okay, so you're not as small as I was hoping...
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Okay, okay Guzma; I was hoping you would be smaller.
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Ha ha, <i>darn</i>. I was hoping you would have been smaller; it would have been much funnier that way.
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Ha ha, okay, okay Guzma. This would have been much more hilarious if it were smaller.
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Ha ha, okay, okay Guzma. This would have been much more hilarious if the <i>big bad</i> leader of Team Skull turned out to have a tiny penis.
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=disappointed.png,This accomplishment doesn't feel quite as good when it's pretty much handed to me.
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=disappointed.png,What makes an achievement truly rewarding is the sheer effort it takes to accomplish it. I can't say the same when you wanted to be naked in the first place.
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=frustrated.png,I bet you're <i>just absolutely thrilled</i> to be naked in front of everybody, ~name~.
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible=horny.png,Ha, now this is what I like to see! I was hoping to see a big one tonight.
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible=excited.png,Oh, dear! That's... that's larger than the ones I've seen in the ancient cave paintings...
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible=happy.png,My, you sure seem to be gifted, ~name~. Isn't nature a wonderful thing to be blessing some of us with such gifts?
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible=shocked.png,It's so big! I never thought those phallic sculptures were meant to be life-sized!
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible=surprised.png,It must have been difficult looking for ~clothing.ifPlural(|a)~ ~clothing~ that ~clothing.ifPlural(fit|fits)~ your... <i>uh</i>... credentials.
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=shocked.png,No wonder you were so eager to show it to everybody! It's massive!
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=shocked.png,I finally understand why you couldn't wait to play show-and-tell with all of us...
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=scowling.png,I have to concede that your size is impressive... but you still intentionally lost. That's not the proper sporting spirit.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible=sarcastic.png,If this keeps up, I might be able to join another game before it gets too late.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible=disappointed.png,I intentionally picked out this group because I expected an easy win, but this is a little too easy to be enjoyable.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible=thinking.png,Have you guys ever wondered why it's taboo for women to be topless but not men?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible=thinking.png,I've heard that some countries allow public toplessness, even in the presence of children. They even allow it in television broadcasts without any censorship.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible=fingerup.png,I can see you struggling, ~name~, so here's a poker tip for you: never go for straights. You should instead aim for a pair or even a high card instead.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,weight:0.3=sarcastic.png,Sorry, ~name~, but it looks like it's time...
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;cammy_white&saidmarker;juri_help:,count-role;other&character;juri&stage;0:,id:181=thinking.png,Juri? This is no time to be fooling around...

2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=sarcastic.png,Ha, if I didn't know any better, I'd say it looks like you're almost <i>happy</i> to be taking off your ~clothing~.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=sarcastic.png,Don't get <i>too</i> excited, ~name~; someone might think you're some sort of exhibitionist.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=surprised.png,~Name~, you almost look excited to be showing off your breasts... Is there something we should know?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-male:0,test:~background.time~:day=embarrassed.png,I understand, ~name~, that this game isn't very kind. But rules are rules.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-male:0,test:~background.time~:day=embarrassed.png,I understand how it must feel, ~name~, but we all signed up for this. Might as well get it over with now, huh?

2-female_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,test:~background.voyeur~:true,weight:3=embarrassed.png,Oh, having to show the goods with so many people around, heeeeh... Good luck!
2-female_small_chest_is_visible=sarcastic.png,Oh, hee... Those are quite small...
2-female_small_chest_is_visible=happy.png,Oh, it's beautiful! There's no shame in small breasts, ~name~. They all function just the same regardless of size.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible=happy.png,Small breasts like yours are a tad underrated, I'd say. They're just as impressive as their larger counterparts.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible=fingerup.png,Despite what popular depictions might show you, most historically-significant women didn't had an average bust size. Your breast size shouldn't define who you are.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible=excited.png,Looking for tops must be easier for you, or so I've heard. Some of my well-endowed friends told me that it can be difficult looking for bras that fit them.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible=excited.png,I know of some people who are insecure of their small breasts, which I don't understand. All size are great in my opinion.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;videl:,id:115=fingerup.png,Still clutching onto strings, are we? Well, I certainly admire your perseverance!
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-male:0,test:~background~:street:!=,weight:2=fingerup.png,It's okay, we're all girls here! No need to feel embarrassed.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-male:0,test:~background~:street:!=,weight:2=excited.png,It's not like there's any guys here, so don't feel ashamed, ~name~!
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-male:0,test:~background~:street:!=,weight:2=fingerup.png,Don't feel insecure, ~name~; guys just want to see you naked. They don't care what you look like naked, they'll like you anyway!
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-male:0,test:~background~:street,id:37,weight:2=disappointed.png,It's okay, we're all girls here! No need to feel embarrassed... Oh, right... I forgot about the onlookers...
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-male:0,test:~background~:street,id:37,weight:2=disappointed.png,It's not like there's any guys here, so don't feel ashamed, ~name~! O-oh, right... The crowd behind us...
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-male&var;:1-4,weight:2=fingerup.png,It's okay ~name~, guys don't really care that much how big they are! Guys like ~male~ like boobs no matter how big or small they are!
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-male&var;:1-4,weight:2=fingerup.png,It's okay, ~name~, guys like ~male~ aren't that picky about size!
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-male&var;:1-4,weight:2=excited.png,Don't feel down, ~name~; to a guy, small tits are better than no tits!
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible=embarrassed.png,It might not be apparent now, but we're almost the same size, ~name~... I hope that didn't come off as creepy. That wasn't my intention.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible=fingerup.png,You appear to be averagely-sized. Not that there's anything wrong with that. We're not competing for size here. Besides, every size is perfect!
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible=thinking.png,I might be generalizing a bit here, but all clothing stores in Sinnoh seem to be geared towards medium-sized women.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible=happy.png,Not too big, yet not too small. I always say that a perfect balance is the only real balance there is.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible=happy.png,Just because your breast size is average, doesn't mean they're average... Well, you get what I meant...
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible=fingerup.png,Oh, those don't look too bad, ~name~! I'm sure the guys love them!
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible=fingerup.png,Oh, those don't look too bad, ~name~! I'm sure the guys love them! They're boobs, after all.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-male&var;:1-4=fingerup.png,Those look quite nice, ~name~! Ha, and it looks like ~male~ agrees since he's staring so much.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible=battleready.png,I can just imagine how difficult it is to buy bras your size. I mean it's difficult for any size, but still...
2-female_large_chest_is_visible=thinking.png,Can you even run comfortably with a bust that size? Having your breast bounce around while sprinting must be painful.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible=surprised.png,~clothing.ifPlural(Were|Was)~ your ~clothing~ a proper fit for you, ~name~? I can understand that looking for ~clothing.ifPlural(|a)~ well-fitted ~clothing~ isn't simple for someone with your breast size.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible=sarcastic.png,I remember as a child, I would stuff pokeballs on my shirt. I'm pretty sure I wasn't the only girl who did that.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible=thinking.png,I wonder if having a larger breast size makes breastfeeding easier or more difficult... Hmm, I'll wager it's the latter.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible=happy.png,Looks like someone has the makings of a champion!
2-female_large_chest_is_visible=happy.png,My, you sure seem to be gifted, ~name~. Isn't mother nature a wonderful thing to be blessing some of us with such gifts?

2-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-huge_breasts&role;target:=excited.png,Oh, what a sight! I was suspecting that you had padded your ~clothing~, but they actually are massive!
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-huge_breasts&role;target:=surprised.png,... That can't be natural, can it?
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-huge_breasts&role;target:=fingerup.png,A bust that large... I don't think even the most voluptuous of historical queens had that size.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-huge_breasts&role;target:=excited.png,The phrase "bountiful bosom" is thrown around a lot in ancient texts, but these might be on another level entirely.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-huge_breasts&role;target:=fingerup.png,Even the bustiest of fertility idols can't match up to those! Your breasts are simply on a class of their own.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-huge_breasts&role;target:=embarrassed.png,Gosh, those look so heavy. That can't possibly be good for your posture, or your back.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-huge_breasts&role;target:=sarcastic.png,A random thought just came to me... could you use your cleavage as a storage of sorts?
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-male&var;:1-4,weight:2=sarcastic.png,Ha ha, well don't stare <i>too</i> hard, ~male~, or ~name~ might think you're a creep!
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible=excited.png,~Name~ is really going to reveal her... Oh, things have gotten interesting.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible=surprised.png,How are you losing your ~clothing~ already? Do you even know how to play poker?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible=surprised.png,Even for a game decided by randomness, this is such an unfortunate outcome for you.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible=shocked.png,Nobody can be this unlucky! I can hardly believe this!
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible=surprised.png,Are you doing this intentionally, ~name~? Is this your idea of a distraction, or are you really this unlucky?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=scowling.png,Hold on, this is what you wanted to the from the beginning, did you?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=scowling.png,What's even the point of joining a strip poker game if you're just playing to lose immediately?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=scowling.png,This game might be about nudity, but that doesn't excuse your desire to show your crotch to unsuspecting people, ~name~.

2-female_crotch_is_visible=disappointed.png,It doesn't feel right somehow that you're already at this point while I'm still fully covered.
2-female_crotch_is_visible=sarcastic.png,<i>(Maybe this table was a little too easy...)</i>
2-female_crotch_is_visible=disappointed.png,Perhaps coming in with this many pieces of clothing wasn't necessary at all. But then again, this is just my normal attire.
2-female_crotch_is_visible=fingerup.png,This would be quite the uphill battle for you, ~name~, but you can still come back from this. Anything can happen in a game of chance!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,weight:0.25=horny.png,Oh my, that looks... Quite wet.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,weight:0.25=horny.png,Oh... (<i>why... why is this getting me wet?</i>)
2-female_crotch_is_visible,weight:0.25=horny.png,I suppose it's the... <i>excitement</i> of the situation that's making me a bit wet...
2-female_crotch_is_visible,weight:0.25=happy.png,I know she's not out yet, but this is almost like a victory itself!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;mia:,id:169=embarrassed.png,Mia, I think you're showing off something more valuable than... uhh, well, let's just say I think you got the <i>order</i> wrong... Right?

3-male_chest_will_be_visible=fingerup.png,Mankind has always been fascinated by the male physique, if the statues are anything to go by.

3-male_chest_will_be_visible=embarrassed.png,I've always wondered why a man going topless isn't as taboo as a woman going topless. Not that I'd walk topless, even without the stigma.
3-male_chest_will_be_visible=fingerup.png,In the past, men being topless was actually the norm! With the weather at Sinnoh as it is, people back then must have been more resistant to the cold.

3-male_chest_is_visible,count-muscular&role;target:=excited.png,Ah, your muscles! They... they look firm, and sturdy.
3-male_chest_is_visible,count-muscular&role;target:=fingerup.png,Your chest... It's hard and firm, like an old cave painting...
3-male_chest_is_visible,count-muscular&role;target:=fingerup.png,Your chest... It's hard and firm... It reminds me of stone tablets I used to study as a child...
3-male_chest_is_visible,count-muscular&role;target:=fingerup.png,There's no mistaking it; your chest is as hard as a cave wall!
3-male_chest_is_visible,count-muscular&role;target:=fingerup.png,My my, your chest... it-it's so hard and... Would you mind if I glide my finger over it and trace ancient etchings?

3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,What's the matter, Guzma? Trying to overcompensate for something you're about to show us?
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Are you trying to hype this up or something Guzma? Come on, I'm sure it's as small as we're all thinking.
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,You're the <i>big</i> bad leader of Team Skull? Or are you a <i>small</i> leader...

3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=scowling.png,What's even the point of joining a strip poker game if you're just playing to lose immediately?
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=scowling.png,This game might be about nudity, but that doesn't excuse your desire to show your penis to unsuspecting people, ~name~.

3-male_small_crotch_is_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=sarcastic.png,... That's it?!... You were very eager to show us your penis, and that's all of it?
3-male_small_crotch_is_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=sarcastic.png,I expected more from you, considering how excited you were to show your rod to all of us.
3-male_small_crotch_is_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=furious.png,All the eagerness to lose, only to show us that? Is this some sort of cruel prank?
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Ha ha, I was only teasing, Guzma.
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Okay, okay, so you're not as small as I was hoping...
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Okay, okay Guzma; I was hoping you would be smaller.
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Ha ha, <i>darn</i>. I was hoping you would have been smaller; it would have been much funnier that way.
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Ha ha, okay, okay Guzma. This would have been much more hilarious if it were smaller.
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Ha ha, okay, okay Guzma. This would have been much more hilarious if the <i>big bad</i> leader of Team Skull turned out to have a tiny penis.
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=disappointed.png,This accomplishment doesn't feel quite as good when it's pretty much handed to me.
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=disappointed.png,What makes an achievement truly rewarding is the sheer effort it takes to accomplish it. I can't say the same when you wanted to be naked in the first place.
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=frustrated.png,I bet you're <i>just absolutely thrilled</i> to be naked in front of everybody, ~name~.
3-male_large_crotch_is_visible=horny.png,Ha, now this is what I like to see! I was hoping to see a big one tonight.
3-male_large_crotch_is_visible=excited.png,Oh, dear! That's... that's larger than the ones I've seen in the ancient cave paintings...
3-male_large_crotch_is_visible=happy.png,My, you sure seem to be gifted, ~name~. Isn't nature a wonderful thing to be blessing some of us with such gifts?
3-male_large_crotch_is_visible=shocked.png,It's so big! I never thought those phallic sculptures were meant to be life-sized!
3-male_large_crotch_is_visible=surprised.png,It must have been difficult looking for ~clothing.ifPlural(|a)~ ~clothing~ that ~clothing.ifPlural(fit|fits)~ your... <i>uh</i>... credentials.
3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=shocked.png,No wonder you were so eager to show it to everybody! It's massive!
3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=shocked.png,I finally understand why you couldn't wait to play show-and-tell with all of us...
3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=scowling.png,I have to concede that your size is impressive... but you still intentionally lost. That's not the proper sporting spirit.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible=sarcastic.png,If this keeps up, I might be able to join another game before it gets too late.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible=disappointed.png,I intentionally picked out this group because I expected an easy win, but this is a little too easy to be enjoyable.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible=thinking.png,Have you guys ever wondered why it's taboo for women to be topless but not men?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible=thinking.png,I've heard that some countries allow public toplessness, even in the presence of children. They even allow it in television broadcasts without any censorship.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible=fingerup.png,I can see you struggling, ~name~, so here's a poker tip for you: never go for straights. You should instead aim for a pair or even a high card instead.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,weight:0.3=sarcastic.png,Sorry, ~name~, but it looks like it's time...
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;cammy_white&saidmarker;juri_help:,count-role;other&character;juri&stage;0:,id:181=thinking.png,Juri? This is no time to be fooling around...

3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=sarcastic.png,Ha, if I didn't know any better, I'd say it looks like you're almost <i>happy</i> to be taking off your ~clothing~.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=sarcastic.png,Don't get <i>too</i> excited, ~name~; someone might think you're some sort of exhibitionist.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=surprised.png,~Name~, you almost look excited to be showing off your breasts... Is there something we should know?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-male&role;opp&var;:1=fingerup.png,Oh, I'm not too excited myself; I'll let ~male~ enjoy the view though!

3-female_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,test:~background.voyeur~:true,weight:3=embarrassed.png,Oh, having to show the goods with so many people around, heeeeh... Good luck!
3-female_small_chest_is_visible=sarcastic.png,Oh, hee... Those are quite small...
3-female_small_chest_is_visible=happy.png,Oh, it's beautiful! There's no shame in small breasts, ~name~. They all function just the same regardless of size.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible=happy.png,Small breasts like yours are a tad underrated, I'd say. They're just as impressive as their larger counterparts.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible=fingerup.png,Despite what popular depictions might show you, most historically-significant women didn't had an average bust size. Your breast size shouldn't define who you are.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible=excited.png,Looking for tops must be easier for you, or so I've heard. Some of my well-endowed friends told me that it can be difficult looking for bras that fit them.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible=excited.png,I know of some people who are insecure of their small breasts, which I don't understand. All size are great in my opinion.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;videl:,id:115=fingerup.png,Still clutching onto strings, are we? Well, I certainly admire your perseverance!
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-male:0,test:~background~:street:!=,weight:2=fingerup.png,It's okay, we're all girls here! No need to feel embarrassed.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-male:0,test:~background~:street:!=,weight:2=excited.png,It's not like there's any guys here, so don't feel ashamed, ~name~!
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-male:0,test:~background~:street:!=,weight:2=fingerup.png,Don't feel insecure, ~name~; guys just want to see you naked. They don't care what you look like naked, they'll like you anyway!
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-male:0,test:~background~:street,id:37,weight:2=disappointed.png,It's okay, we're all girls here! No need to feel embarrassed... Oh, right... I forgot about the onlookers...

3-female_small_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-male&var;:1-4,weight:2=fingerup.png,It's okay ~name~, guys don't really care that much how big they are! Guys like ~male~ like boobs no matter how big or small they are!
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-male&var;:1-4,weight:2=fingerup.png,It's okay, ~name~, guys like ~male~ aren't that picky about size!
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-male&var;:1-4,weight:2=excited.png,Don't feel down, ~name~; to a guy, small tits are better than no tits!
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible=embarrassed.png,It might not be apparent now, but we're almost the same size, ~name~... I hope that didn't come off as creepy. That wasn't my intention.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible=fingerup.png,You appear to be averagely-sized. Not that there's anything wrong with that. We're not competing for size here. Besides, every size is perfect!
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible=thinking.png,I might be generalizing a bit here, but all clothing stores in Sinnoh seem to be geared towards medium-sized women.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible=happy.png,Not too big, yet not too small. I always say that a perfect balance is the only real balance there is.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible=happy.png,Just because your breast size is average, doesn't mean they're average... Well, you get what I meant...
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible=fingerup.png,Oh, those don't look too bad, ~name~! I'm sure the guys love them!
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible=fingerup.png,Oh, those don't look too bad, ~name~! I'm sure the guys love them! They're boobs, after all.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-male&var;:1-4=fingerup.png,Those look quite nice, ~name~! Ha, and it looks like ~male~ agrees since he's staring so much.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible=battleready.png,I can just imagine how difficult it is to buy bras your size. I mean it's difficult for any size, but still...
3-female_large_chest_is_visible=thinking.png,Can you even run comfortably with a bust that size? Having your breast bounce around while sprinting must be painful.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible=surprised.png,~clothing.ifPlural(Were|Was)~ your ~clothing~ a proper fit for you, ~name~? I can understand that looking for ~clothing.ifPlural(|a)~ well-fitted ~clothing~ isn't simple for someone with your breast size.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible=sarcastic.png,I remember as a child, I would stuff pokeballs on my shirt. I'm pretty sure I wasn't the only girl who did that.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible=thinking.png,I wonder if having a larger breast size makes breastfeeding easier or more difficult... Hmm, I'll wager it's the latter.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible=happy.png,Looks like someone has the makings of a champion!
3-female_large_chest_is_visible=happy.png,My, you sure seem to be gifted, ~name~. Isn't mother nature a wonderful thing to be blessing some of us with such gifts?

3-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-huge_breasts&role;target:=excited.png,Oh, what a sight! I was suspecting that you had padded your ~clothing~, but they actually are massive!
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-huge_breasts&role;target:=surprised.png,... That can't be natural, can it?
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-huge_breasts&role;target:=fingerup.png,A bust that large... I don't think even the most voluptuous of historical queens had that size.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-huge_breasts&role;target:=excited.png,The phrase "bountiful bosom" is thrown around a lot in ancient texts, but these might be on another level entirely.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-huge_breasts&role;target:=fingerup.png,Even the bustiest of fertility idols can't match up to those! Your breasts are simply on a class of their own.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-huge_breasts&role;target:=embarrassed.png,Gosh, those look so heavy. That can't possibly be good for your posture, or your back.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-huge_breasts&role;target:=sarcastic.png,A random thought just came to me... could you use your cleavage as a storage of sorts?
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-male&var;:1-4,weight:2=sarcastic.png,Ha ha, well don't stare <i>too</i> hard, ~male~, or ~name~ might think you're a creep!

3-female_crotch_will_be_visible=surprised.png,Even for a game decided by randomness, this is such an unfortunate outcome for you.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible=shocked.png,Nobody can be this unlucky! I can hardly believe this!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible=surprised.png,Are you doing this intentionally, ~name~? Is this your idea of a distraction, or are you really this unlucky?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=scowling.png,Hold on, this is what you wanted to the from the beginning, did you?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=scowling.png,What's even the point of joining a strip poker game if you're just playing to lose immediately?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=scowling.png,This game might be about nudity, but that doesn't excuse your desire to show your crotch to unsuspecting people, ~name~.

3-female_crotch_is_visible=disappointed.png,It doesn't feel right somehow that you're already at this point while I'm still fully covered.
3-female_crotch_is_visible=sarcastic.png,<i>(Maybe this table was a little too easy...)</i>
3-female_crotch_is_visible=disappointed.png,Perhaps coming in with this many pieces of clothing wasn't necessary at all. But then again, this is just my normal attire.
3-female_crotch_is_visible=fingerup.png,This would be quite the uphill battle for you, ~name~, but you can still come back from this. Anything can happen in a game of chance!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,weight:0.25=horny.png,Oh my, that looks... Quite wet.

4-male_chest_will_be_visible=fingerup.png,Mankind has always been fascinated by the male physique, if the statues are anything to go by.

4-male_chest_will_be_visible=embarrassed.png,I've always wondered why a man going topless isn't as taboo as a woman going topless. Not that I'd walk topless, even without the stigma.
4-male_chest_will_be_visible=fingerup.png,In the past, men being topless was actually the norm! With the weather at Sinnoh as it is, people back then must have been more resistant to the cold.

4-male_chest_is_visible,priority:200,count-chubby&role;target:=embarrassed.png,G-gah! Eh- M-my apologies, but I was expecting some eye-candy tonight.
4-male_chest_is_visible,priority:200,count-chubby&role;target:=disappointed.png,O-oh, my... It seems I've hyped up my expectations too much.
4-male_chest_is_visible,priority:200,count-chubby&role;target:=embarrassed.png,Ah! Err... My apologies, ~name~, but I didn't take you for the type to neglect health and wellness.

4-male_chest_is_visible,count-muscular&role;target:=excited.png,Ah, so muscular... Like a stone slate full of etchings...
4-male_chest_is_visible,count-muscular&role;target:=excited.png,Ah, your muscles! They... they look firm, and sturdy.
4-male_chest_is_visible,count-muscular&role;target:=fingerup.png,Your chest... It's hard and firm, like an old cave painting...
4-male_chest_is_visible,count-muscular&role;target:=fingerup.png,Your chest... It's hard and firm... It reminds me of stone tablets I used to study as a child...
4-male_chest_is_visible,count-muscular&role;target:=fingerup.png,There's no mistaking it; your chest is as hard as a cave wall!
4-male_chest_is_visible,count-muscular&role;target:=fingerup.png,My my, your chest... it-it's so hard and... Would you mind if I glide my finger over it and trace ancient etchings?
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;guzma:=aggressive.png,Ha, what's the matter, Guzma? Trying to hype us up for something? Please, I'm sure it'll be as underwhelming as Team Skull.
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;guzma:=aggressive.png,Ha, what's the matter, Guzma? Trying to hype us up for something? Please, I'm sure it'll be as underwhelming as your little criminal organization.
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,What's the matter, Guzma? Trying to overcompensate for something you're about to show us?
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Are you trying to hype this up or something Guzma? Come on, I'm sure it's as small as we're all thinking.
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,You're the <i>big</i> bad leader of Team Skull? Or are you a <i>small</i> leader...

4-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,You may be the <i>big</i> bad leader, but I'm sure you also have a <i>small</i> member, if you catch my drift.
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=scowling.png,Hold on, this is what you wanted to the from the beginning, isn't it?
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=scowling.png,What's even the point of joining a strip poker game if you're just playing to lose immediately?
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=scowling.png,This game might be about nudity, but that doesn't excuse your desire to show your penis to unsuspecting people, ~name~.
4-male_small_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;kazuma&stage;6:,marker:KazumaPenis=embarrassed.png,Oh, uh... Are the... balls supposed to hang lower than the... er, nevermind...

4-male_small_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;kazuma&stage;6:,marker:KazumaPenis=embarrassed.png,Oh, i uh... I don't mean to question your manliness, but... well, nevermind...
4-male_small_crotch_is_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=sarcastic.png,... That's it?!... You were very eager to show us your penis, and that's all of it?
4-male_small_crotch_is_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=sarcastic.png,I expected more from you, considering how excited you were to show your rod to all of us.
4-male_small_crotch_is_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=furious.png,All the eagerness to lose, only to show us that? Is this some sort of cruel prank?
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Ha ha, I was only teasing, Guzma.
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Okay, okay, so you're not as small as I was hoping...
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Okay, okay Guzma; I was hoping you would be smaller.
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Ha ha, <i>darn</i>. I was hoping you would have been smaller; it would have been much funnier that way.
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Ha ha, okay, okay Guzma. This would have been much more hilarious if it were smaller.
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Ha ha, okay, okay Guzma. This would have been much more hilarious if the <i>big bad</i> leader of Team Skull turned out to have a tiny penis.
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=disappointed.png,This accomplishment doesn't feel quite as good when it's pretty much handed to me.
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=disappointed.png,What makes an achievement truly rewarding is the sheer effort it takes to accomplish it. I can't say the same when you wanted to be naked in the first place.
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=frustrated.png,I bet you're <i>just absolutely thrilled</i> to be naked in front of everybody, ~name~.
4-male_large_crotch_is_visible=horny.png,Ha, now this is what I like to see! I was hoping to see a big one tonight.
4-male_large_crotch_is_visible=excited.png,Oh, dear! That's... that's larger than the ones I've seen in the ancient cave paintings...
4-male_large_crotch_is_visible=happy.png,My, you sure seem to be gifted, ~name~. Isn't nature a wonderful thing to be blessing some of us with such gifts?
4-male_large_crotch_is_visible=shocked.png,It's so big! I never thought those phallic sculptures were meant to be life-sized!
4-male_large_crotch_is_visible=surprised.png,It must have been difficult looking for ~clothing.ifPlural(|a)~ ~clothing~ that ~clothing.ifPlural(fit|fits)~ your... <i>uh</i>... credentials.
4-male_large_crotch_is_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=shocked.png,No wonder you were so eager to show it to everybody! It's massive!
4-male_large_crotch_is_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=shocked.png,I finally understand why you couldn't wait to play show-and-tell with all of us...
4-male_large_crotch_is_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=scowling.png,I have to concede that your size is impressive... but you still intentionally lost. That's not the proper sporting spirit.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible=fingerup.png,Even though phallic iconography commonly represent men in ancient artifacts, the female equivalent is not the vagina, but are actually the breasts.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible=fingerup.png,If your anxiety is getting the better of you, try doing deep breaths while removing your top, ~name~.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible=excited.png,Don't be discouraged by this loss, ~name~; my lead against you isn't too large to overcome. No lead is too large to overcome in poker.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible=happy.png,For what it's worth, you're doing better than expected, ~name~. I would have expected to be pulling away by this point.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible=fingerup.png,You might have ran out of luck but I know you haven't ran out of talent, ~name~! You can still come back from this if you believe in yourself.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,weight:0.3=sarcastic.png,Sorry, ~name~, but it looks like it's time...

4-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=sarcastic.png,Ha, if I didn't know any better, I'd say it looks like you're almost <i>happy</i> to be taking off your ~clothing~.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=sarcastic.png,Don't get <i>too</i> excited, ~name~; someone might think you're some sort of exhibitionist.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=surprised.png,~Name~, you almost look excited to be showing off your breasts... Is there something we should know?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-male&role;opp&var;:1=fingerup.png,Oh, I'm not too excited myself; I'll let ~male~ enjoy the view though!

4-female_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,test:~background.voyeur~:true,weight:3=embarrassed.png,Oh, having to show the goods with so many people around, heeeeh... Good luck!
4-female_small_chest_is_visible=embarrassed.png,It's so small, yet so mesmerizing... Oh! I didn't mean to leer at you, ~name~, I was just pondering to myself.
4-female_small_chest_is_visible=thinking.png,I've heard that breast size can increase once you become a mother.
4-female_small_chest_is_visible=fingerup.png,A bountiful bosom doesn't have to be large you know, in the same way that a powerful Pokémon doesn't have to be physically huge.
4-female_small_chest_is_visible=excited.png,Be proud of what you have, ~name~! Breasts don't have to be large to be special.
4-female_small_chest_is_visible=thinking.png,Do you enjoy sleeping face-down? I know some women who can't do it comfortably because their breasts get in the way, but it doesn't look like it will bother you.
4-female_small_chest_is_visible=sarcastic.png,Oh, hee... Those are quite small...
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;videl:,id:115=fingerup.png,Still clutching onto strings, are we? Well, I certainly admire your perseverance!

4-female_small_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-male&var;:1-4,weight:2=fingerup.png,It's okay ~name~, guys don't really care that much how big they are! Guys like ~male~ like boobs no matter how big or small they are!
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-male&var;:1-4,weight:2=fingerup.png,It's okay, ~name~, guys like ~male~ aren't that picky about size!
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-male&var;:1-4,weight:2=excited.png,Don't feel down, ~name~; to a guy, small tits are better than no tits!
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible=contemplative.png,Its shape... it reminds me of a metal sphere we dug up once... We never did found out what the purpose of that sphere was.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible=aggressive.png,And to think that I'm not too far from exposing my breasts... I afford any mistakes.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible=fingerup.png,This reminds me of some fertility statues I studied a while back. Apparently, dresses where the breasts are exposed were a thing centuries ago.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible=excited.png,You might not have come out on top that round, but there's still plenty of opportunities for you to come back from this, ~name~.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible=aggressive.png,I can see the passion in your eyes, ~name~; you wouldn't take this defeat lying down. Good luck to you, but I wouldn't be letting up.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible=fingerup.png,Oh, those don't look too bad, ~name~! I'm sure the guys love them!
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible=fingerup.png,Oh, those don't look too bad, ~name~! I'm sure the guys love them! They're boobs, after all.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-male&var;:1-4=fingerup.png,Those look quite nice, ~name~! Ha, and it looks like ~male~ agrees since he's staring so much.
4-female_large_chest_is_visible=embarrassed.png,I don't want to even think about the back pain those causes... 
4-female_large_chest_is_visible=surprised.png,Can you sleep face-down, ~name~? It looks like they would get in the way.
4-female_large_chest_is_visible=fingerup.png,Are you a mother, ~name~? I heard breasts grow in size when lactating but I haven't confirmed it yet. I haven't been in that situation.
4-female_large_chest_is_visible=surprised.png,I'm surprised they don't sag down, considering how heavy they look.
4-female_large_chest_is_visible=sarcastic.png,It's not that I'm insecure, but I do get the impression that having larger breasts are more fun.
4-female_large_chest_is_visible=happy.png,Looks like someone has the makings of a champion!
4-female_large_chest_is_visible=happy.png,My, you sure seem to be gifted, ~name~. Isn't mother nature a wonderful thing to be blessing some of us with such gifts?

4-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-huge_breasts&role;target:=surprised.png,... That can't be natural, can it?
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-huge_breasts&role;target:=fingerup.png,A bust that large... I don't think even the most voluptuous of historical queens had that size.
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-huge_breasts&role;target:=excited.png,The phrase "bountiful bosom" is thrown around a lot in ancient texts, but these might be on another level entirely.
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-huge_breasts&role;target:=fingerup.png,Even the bustiest of fertility idols can't match up to those! Your breasts are simply on a class of their own.
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-huge_breasts&role;target:=embarrassed.png,Gosh, those look so heavy. That can't possibly be good for your posture, or your back.
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-huge_breasts&role;target:=sarcastic.png,A random thought just came to me... could you use your cleavage as a storage of sorts?
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-male&var;:1-4,weight:2=sarcastic.png,Ha ha, well don't stare <i>too</i> hard, ~male~, or ~name~ might think you're a creep!

4-female_crotch_will_be_visible=aggressive.png,This game is getting really heated now, huh. Nobody is safe.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible=thinking.png,If you think about it, this is the only thing distinguishing men and women, biologically.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible=battleready.png,Feminine hygiene is very important and shouldn't be overlooked. Let's see how well you've been maintaining your hygiene,
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=scowling.png,Hold on, this is what you wanted to the from the beginning, did you?

4-female_crotch_is_visible=aggressive.png,I still have a couple of layers to spare before I would have to do the same, but I can't let myself get overconfident.
4-female_crotch_is_visible=embarrassed.png,I do hope there aren't any ~clothing~ thieves lurking around here.
4-female_crotch_is_visible=happy.png,It's so brave of you to remove your ~clothing~ in front of a crowd. Not everyone has the courage to do it.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,weight:0.25=horny.png,Oh my, that looks... Quite wet.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,weight:0.25=horny.png,Oh... (<i>why... why is this getting me wet?</i>)

5-male_chest_will_be_visible=fingerup.png,Mankind has always been fascinated by the male physique, if the statues are anything to go by.
5-male_chest_will_be_visible=excited.png,You can tell so much about a person's lifestyle just by looking at their physique. I'm excited to see what story your body will tell, ~name~.

5-male_chest_will_be_visible=fingerup.png,In the past, men being topless was actually the norm! With the weather at Sinnoh as it is, people back then must have been more resistant to the cold.

5-male_chest_is_visible,priority:200,count-chubby&role;target:=embarrassed.png,Oh, I-I'm sorry... I was expecting something a little bit more appealing.
5-male_chest_is_visible,priority:200,count-chubby&role;target:=embarrassed.png,G-gah! Eh- M-my apologies, but I was expecting some eye-candy tonight.
5-male_chest_is_visible,priority:200,count-chubby&role;target:=disappointed.png,O-oh, my... It seems I've hyped up my expectations too much.
5-male_chest_is_visible,priority:200,count-chubby&role;target:=embarrassed.png,Ah! Err... My apologies, ~name~, but I didn't take you for the type to neglect health and wellness.

5-male_chest_is_visible,count-muscular&role;target:=excited.png,Ah, so muscular... Like a stone slate full of etchings...
5-male_chest_is_visible,count-muscular&role;target:=excited.png,Ah, your muscles! They... they look firm, and sturdy.
5-male_chest_is_visible,count-muscular&role;target:=fingerup.png,Your chest... It's hard and firm, like an old cave painting...
5-male_chest_is_visible,count-muscular&role;target:=fingerup.png,Your chest... It's hard and firm... It reminds me of stone tablets I used to study as a child...
5-male_chest_is_visible,count-muscular&role;target:=fingerup.png,There's no mistaking it; your chest is as hard as a cave wall!
5-male_chest_is_visible,count-muscular&role;target:=fingerup.png,My my, your chest... it-it's so hard and... Would you mind if I glide my finger over it and trace ancient etchings?

5-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;guzma:=aggressive.png,Ha, what's the matter, Guzma? Trying to hype us up for something? Please, I'm sure it'll be as underwhelming as your little criminal organization.
5-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,What's the matter, Guzma? Trying to overcompensate for something you're about to show us?
5-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Are you trying to hype this up or something Guzma? Come on, I'm sure it's as small as we're all thinking.
5-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,You're the <i>big</i> bad leader of Team Skull? Or are you a <i>small</i> leader...
5-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,You may be the <i>big</i> bad leader, but I'm sure you also have a <i>small</i> member.
5-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,You may be the <i>big</i> bad leader, but I'm sure you also have a <i>small</i> member, if you catch my drift.
5-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=scowling.png,Hold on, this is what you wanted to the from the beginning, isn't it?
5-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=scowling.png,What's even the point of joining a strip poker game if you're just playing to lose immediately?
5-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=scowling.png,This game might be about nudity, but that doesn't excuse your desire to show your penis to unsuspecting people, ~name~.
5-male_small_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;kazuma&stage;6:,marker:KazumaPenis=embarrassed.png,Oh, uh... Are the... balls supposed to hang lower than the... er, nevermind...

5-male_small_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;kazuma&stage;6:,marker:KazumaPenis=embarrassed.png,Oh, i uh... I don't mean to question your manliness, but... well, nevermind...
5-male_small_crotch_is_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=sarcastic.png,... That's it?!... You were very eager to show us your penis, and that's all of it?
5-male_small_crotch_is_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=sarcastic.png,I expected more from you, considering how excited you were to show your rod to all of us.
5-male_small_crotch_is_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=furious.png,All the eagerness to lose, only to show us that? Is this some sort of cruel prank?
5-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Ha ha, I was only teasing, Guzma.
5-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Okay, okay, so you're not as small as I was hoping...
5-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Okay, okay Guzma; I was hoping you would be smaller.
5-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Ha ha, <i>darn</i>. I was hoping you would have been smaller; it would have been much funnier that way.
5-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Ha ha, okay, okay Guzma. This would have been much more hilarious if it were smaller.
5-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Ha ha, okay, okay Guzma. This would have been much more hilarious if the <i>big bad</i> leader of Team Skull turned out to have a tiny penis.
5-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=disappointed.png,This accomplishment doesn't feel quite as good when it's pretty much handed to me.
5-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=disappointed.png,What makes an achievement truly rewarding is the sheer effort it takes to accomplish it. I can't say the same when you wanted to be naked in the first place.
5-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=frustrated.png,I bet you're <i>just absolutely thrilled</i> to be naked in front of everybody, ~name~.
5-male_large_crotch_is_visible=horny.png,Ha, now this is what I like to see! I was hoping to see a big one tonight.
5-male_large_crotch_is_visible=excited.png,Oh, dear! That's... that's larger than the ones I've seen in the ancient cave paintings...
5-male_large_crotch_is_visible=happy.png,My, you sure seem to be gifted, ~name~. Isn't nature a wonderful thing to be blessing some of us with such gifts?
5-male_large_crotch_is_visible=shocked.png,It's so big! I never thought those phallic sculptures were meant to be life-sized!
5-male_large_crotch_is_visible=surprised.png,It must have been difficult looking for ~clothing.ifPlural(|a)~ ~clothing~ that ~clothing.ifPlural(fit|fits)~ your... <i>uh</i>... credentials.
5-male_large_crotch_is_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=shocked.png,No wonder you were so eager to show it to everybody! It's massive!
5-male_large_crotch_is_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=shocked.png,I finally understand why you couldn't wait to play show-and-tell with all of us...
5-male_large_crotch_is_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=scowling.png,I have to concede that your size is impressive... but you still intentionally lost. That's not the proper sporting spirit.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible=fingerup.png,Even though phallic iconography commonly represent men in ancient artifacts, the female equivalent is not the vagina, but are actually the breasts.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible=fingerup.png,If your anxiety is getting the better of you, try doing deep breaths while removing your top, ~name~.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible=excited.png,Don't be discouraged by this loss, ~name~; my lead against you isn't too large to overcome. No lead is too large to overcome in poker.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible=happy.png,For what it's worth, you're doing better than expected, ~name~. I would have expected to be pulling away by this point.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible=fingerup.png,You might have ran out of luck but I know you haven't ran out of talent, ~name~! You can still come back from this if you believe in yourself.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,weight:0.3=sarcastic.png,Sorry, ~name~, but it looks like it's time...

5-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=sarcastic.png,Ha, if I didn't know any better, I'd say it looks like you're almost <i>happy</i> to be taking off your ~clothing~.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=sarcastic.png,Don't get <i>too</i> excited, ~name~; someone might think you're some sort of exhibitionist.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=surprised.png,~Name~, you almost look excited to be showing off your breasts... Is there something we should know?
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-male&role;opp&var;:1=fingerup.png,Oh, I'm not too excited myself; I'll let ~male~ enjoy the view though!
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-male&role;opp&var;:1=fingerup.png,Oh, I'm not too excited myself; but I hope ~male~ will enjoy the view though!
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-male&role;opp&var;:1=fingerup.png,Well ~male~? Is this what you've been looking forward to? Hahaha, maybe I'll have to bare mine and let you compare.

5-female_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,test:~background.voyeur~:true,weight:3=embarrassed.png,Oh, having to show the goods with so many people around, heeeeh... Good luck!
5-female_small_chest_is_visible=embarrassed.png,It's so small, yet so mesmerizing... Oh! I didn't mean to leer at you, ~name~, I was just pondering to myself.
5-female_small_chest_is_visible=thinking.png,I've heard that breast size can increase once you become a mother.
5-female_small_chest_is_visible=fingerup.png,A bountiful bosom doesn't have to be large you know, in the same way that a powerful Pokémon doesn't have to be physically huge.
5-female_small_chest_is_visible=excited.png,Be proud of what you have, ~name~! Breasts don't have to be large to be special.
5-female_small_chest_is_visible=thinking.png,Do you enjoy sleeping face-down? I know some women who can't do it comfortably because their breasts get in the way, but it doesn't look like it will bother you.
5-female_small_chest_is_visible=sarcastic.png,Oh, hee... Those are quite small...
5-female_small_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;videl:,id:115=fingerup.png,Still clutching onto strings, are we? Well, I certainly admire your perseverance!
5-female_small_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-male:0,test:~background~:street:!=,weight:2=fingerup.png,It's okay, we're all girls here! No need to feel embarrassed.
5-female_small_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-male:0,test:~background~:street:!=,weight:2=excited.png,It's not like there's any guys here, so don't feel ashamed, ~name~!

5-female_small_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-male&var;:1-4,weight:2=fingerup.png,It's okay ~name~, guys don't really care that much how big they are! Guys like ~male~ like boobs no matter how big or small they are!
5-female_small_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-male&var;:1-4,weight:2=fingerup.png,It's okay, ~name~, guys like ~male~ aren't that picky about size!
5-female_small_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-male&var;:1-4,weight:2=excited.png,Don't feel down, ~name~; to a guy, small tits are better than no tits!
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible=contemplative.png,Its shape... it reminds me of a metal sphere we dug up once... We never did found out what the purpose of that sphere was.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible=aggressive.png,And to think that I'm not too far from exposing my breasts... I afford any mistakes.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible=fingerup.png,This reminds me of some fertility statues I studied a while back. Apparently, dresses where the breasts are exposed were a thing centuries ago.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible=excited.png,You might not have come out on top that round, but there's still plenty of opportunities for you to come back from this, ~name~.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible=aggressive.png,I can see the passion in your eyes, ~name~; you wouldn't take this defeat lying down. Good luck to you, but I wouldn't be letting up.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible=fingerup.png,Oh, those don't look too bad, ~name~! I'm sure the guys love them!
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible=fingerup.png,Oh, those don't look too bad, ~name~! I'm sure the guys love them! They're boobs, after all.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-male&var;:1-4=fingerup.png,Those look quite nice, ~name~! Ha, and it looks like ~male~ agrees since he's staring so much.
5-female_large_chest_is_visible=embarrassed.png,I don't want to even think about the back pain those causes... 
5-female_large_chest_is_visible=surprised.png,Can you sleep face-down, ~name~? It looks like they would get in the way.
5-female_large_chest_is_visible=fingerup.png,Are you a mother, ~name~? I heard breasts grow in size when lactating but I haven't confirmed it yet. I haven't been in that situation.
5-female_large_chest_is_visible=surprised.png,I'm surprised they don't sag down, considering how heavy they look.
5-female_large_chest_is_visible=sarcastic.png,It's not that I'm insecure, but I do get the impression that having larger breasts are more fun.
5-female_large_chest_is_visible=happy.png,Looks like someone has the makings of a champion!
5-female_large_chest_is_visible=happy.png,My, you sure seem to be gifted, ~name~. Isn't mother nature a wonderful thing to be blessing some of us with such gifts?

5-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-huge_breasts&role;target:=surprised.png,... That can't be natural, can it?
5-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-huge_breasts&role;target:=fingerup.png,A bust that large... I don't think even the most voluptuous of historical queens had that size.
5-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-huge_breasts&role;target:=excited.png,The phrase "bountiful bosom" is thrown around a lot in ancient texts, but these might be on another level entirely.
5-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-huge_breasts&role;target:=fingerup.png,Even the bustiest of fertility idols can't match up to those! Your breasts are simply on a class of their own.
5-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-huge_breasts&role;target:=embarrassed.png,Gosh, those look so heavy. That can't possibly be good for your posture, or your back.
5-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-huge_breasts&role;target:=sarcastic.png,A random thought just came to me... could you use your cleavage as a storage of sorts?
5-female_large_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-male&var;:1-4,weight:2=sarcastic.png,Ha ha, well don't stare <i>too</i> hard, ~male~, or ~name~ might think you're a creep!
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible=excited.png,~Name~ is really going to reveal her... Oh, things have gotten interesting.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible=aggressive.png,This game is getting really heated now, huh. Nobody is safe.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible=thinking.png,If you think about it, this is the only thing distinguishing men and women, biologically.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible=battleready.png,Feminine hygiene is very important and shouldn't be overlooked. Let's see how well you've been maintaining your hygiene,
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=scowling.png,Hold on, this is what you wanted to the from the beginning, did you?

5-female_crotch_is_visible=aggressive.png,I still have a couple of layers to spare before I would have to do the same, but I can't let myself get overconfident.
5-female_crotch_is_visible=embarrassed.png,I do hope there aren't any ~clothing~ thieves lurking around here.
5-female_crotch_is_visible=happy.png,It's so brave of you to remove your ~clothing~ in front of a crowd. Not everyone has the courage to do it.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,weight:0.25=horny.png,Oh my, that looks... Quite wet.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,weight:0.25=horny.png,Oh... (<i>why... why is this getting me wet?</i>)
5-female_crotch_is_visible,weight:0.25=horny.png,I suppose it's the... <i>excitement</i> of the situation that's making me a bit wet...

6-male_chest_will_be_visible=excited.png,Let's see that chest, ~name~, and don't you wait a second!
6-male_chest_will_be_visible=fingerup.png,Mankind has always been fascinated by the male physique, if the statues are anything to go by.
6-male_chest_will_be_visible=excited.png,You can tell so much about a person's lifestyle just by looking at their physique. I'm excited to see what story your body will tell, ~name~.
6-male_chest_will_be_visible=embarrassed.png,I've always wondered why a man going topless isn't as taboo as a woman going topless. Not that I'd walk topless, even without the stigma.
6-male_chest_will_be_visible=fingerup.png,In the past, men being topless was actually the norm! With the weather at Sinnoh as it is, people back then must have been more resistant to the cold.
6-male_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;chazz&stage;5:,id:124=shocked.png,Huh?! What is this? Is this... the dark powers of the mythical Shadow Realm?! (<i>This is fascinating!</i>)

6-male_chest_is_visible,count-athletic&role;target:=fingerup.png,Your chest... It's hard and firm... It reminds me of stone tablets I used to study as a child...
6-male_chest_is_visible,count-athletic&role;target:=fingerup.png,There's no mistaking it; your chest is as hard as a cave wall!

6-male_chest_is_visible,priority:200,count-chubby&role;target:=disappointed.png,O-oh, my... It seems I've hyped up my expectations too much.
6-male_chest_is_visible,priority:200,count-chubby&role;target:=embarrassed.png,Ah! Err... My apologies, ~name~, but I didn't take you for the type to neglect health and wellness.

6-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=scowling.png,What's even the point of joining a strip poker game if you're just playing to lose immediately?
6-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=scowling.png,This game might be about nudity, but that doesn't excuse your desire to show your penis to unsuspecting people, ~name~.

6-male_small_crotch_is_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=sarcastic.png,... That's it?!... You were very eager to show us your penis, and that's all of it?
6-male_small_crotch_is_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=sarcastic.png,I expected more from you, considering how excited you were to show your rod to all of us.
6-male_small_crotch_is_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=furious.png,All the eagerness to lose, only to show us that? Is this some sort of cruel prank?

6-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Okay, okay, so you're not as small as I was hoping...

6-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Ha ha, <i>darn</i>. I was hoping you would have been smaller; it would have been much funnier that way.
6-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Ha ha, okay, okay Guzma. This would have been much more hilarious if it were smaller.
6-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Ha ha, okay, okay Guzma. This would have been much more hilarious if the <i>big bad</i> leader of Team Skull turned out to have a tiny penis.
6-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=disappointed.png,This accomplishment doesn't feel quite as good when it's pretty much handed to me.
6-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=disappointed.png,What makes an achievement truly rewarding is the sheer effort it takes to accomplish it. I can't say the same when you wanted to be naked in the first place.
6-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=frustrated.png,I bet you're <i>just absolutely thrilled</i> to be naked in front of everybody, ~name~.
6-male_large_crotch_is_visible=horny.png,Ha, now this is what I like to see! I was hoping to see a big one tonight.
6-male_large_crotch_is_visible=excited.png,Oh, dear! That's... that's larger than the ones I've seen in the ancient cave paintings...
6-male_large_crotch_is_visible=happy.png,My, you sure seem to be gifted, ~name~. Isn't nature a wonderful thing to be blessing some of us with such gifts?
6-male_large_crotch_is_visible=shocked.png,It's so big! I never thought those phallic sculptures were meant to be life-sized!
6-male_large_crotch_is_visible=surprised.png,It must have been difficult looking for ~clothing.ifPlural(|a)~ ~clothing~ that ~clothing.ifPlural(fit|fits)~ your... <i>uh</i>... credentials.
6-male_large_crotch_is_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=shocked.png,No wonder you were so eager to show it to everybody! It's massive!
6-male_large_crotch_is_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=shocked.png,I finally understand why you couldn't wait to play show-and-tell with all of us...
6-male_large_crotch_is_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=scowling.png,I have to concede that your size is impressive... but you still intentionally lost. That's not the proper sporting spirit.

6-female_chest_will_be_visible=disappointed.png,Oh, huh uh... I'm not far off from being in the same boat, ~name~...

6-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=sarcastic.png,Ha, if I didn't know any better, I'd say it looks like you're almost <i>happy</i> to be taking off your ~clothing~.
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=sarcastic.png,Don't get <i>too</i> excited, ~name~; someone might think you're some sort of exhibitionist.
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=surprised.png,~Name~, you almost look excited to be showing off your breasts... Is there something we should know?
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,test:~background.voyeur~:true,weight:3=embarrassed.png,Oh, having to show the goods with so many people around, heeeeh... Good luck!
6-female_small_chest_is_visible=embarrassed.png,It's so small, yet so mesmerizing... Oh! I didn't mean to leer at you, ~name~, I was just pondering to myself.
6-female_small_chest_is_visible=thinking.png,I've heard that breast size can increase once you become a mother.
6-female_small_chest_is_visible=fingerup.png,A bountiful bosom doesn't have to be large you know, in the same way that a powerful Pokémon doesn't have to be physically huge.
6-female_small_chest_is_visible=excited.png,Be proud of what you have, ~name~! Breasts don't have to be large to be special.
6-female_small_chest_is_visible=thinking.png,Do you enjoy sleeping face-down? I know some women who can't do it comfortably because their breasts get in the way, but it doesn't look like it will bother you.
6-female_small_chest_is_visible=sarcastic.png,Oh, hee... Those are quite small...

6-female_small_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-male&var;:1-4,weight:2=fingerup.png,It's okay ~name~, guys don't really care that much how big they are! Guys like ~male~ like boobs no matter how big or small they are!
6-female_small_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-male&var;:1-4,weight:2=fingerup.png,It's okay, ~name~, guys like ~male~ aren't that picky about size!
6-female_small_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-male&var;:1-4,weight:2=excited.png,Don't feel down, ~name~; to a guy, small tits are better than no tits!
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible=contemplative.png,Its shape... it reminds me of a metal sphere we dug up once... We never did found out what the purpose of that sphere was.
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible=aggressive.png,And to think that I'm not too far from exposing my breasts... I afford any mistakes.
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible=fingerup.png,This reminds me of some fertility statues I studied a while back. Apparently, dresses where the breasts are exposed were a thing centuries ago.
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible=excited.png,You might not have come out on top that round, but there's still plenty of opportunities for you to come back from this, ~name~.
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible=aggressive.png,I can see the passion in your eyes, ~name~; you wouldn't take this defeat lying down. Good luck to you, but I wouldn't be letting up.

6-female_medium_chest_is_visible=fingerup.png,Oh, those don't look too bad, ~name~! I'm sure the guys love them! They're boobs, after all.
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-male&var;:1-4=fingerup.png,Those look quite nice, ~name~! Ha, and it looks like ~male~ agrees since he's staring so much.
6-female_large_chest_is_visible=embarrassed.png,I don't want to even think about the back pain those causes... 
6-female_large_chest_is_visible=surprised.png,Can you sleep face-down, ~name~? It looks like they would get in the way.
6-female_large_chest_is_visible=fingerup.png,Are you a mother, ~name~? I heard breasts grow in size when lactating but I haven't confirmed it yet. I haven't been in that situation.
6-female_large_chest_is_visible=surprised.png,I'm surprised they don't sag down, considering how heavy they look.
6-female_large_chest_is_visible=sarcastic.png,It's not that I'm insecure, but I do get the impression that having larger breasts are more fun.
6-female_large_chest_is_visible=happy.png,Looks like someone has the makings of a champion!
6-female_large_chest_is_visible=happy.png,My, you sure seem to be gifted, ~name~. Isn't mother nature a wonderful thing to be blessing some of us with such gifts?

6-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-huge_breasts&role;target:=surprised.png,... That can't be natural, can it?
6-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-huge_breasts&role;target:=fingerup.png,A bust that large... I don't think even the most voluptuous of historical queens had that size.
6-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-huge_breasts&role;target:=excited.png,The phrase "bountiful bosom" is thrown around a lot in ancient texts, but these might be on another level entirely.
6-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-huge_breasts&role;target:=fingerup.png,Even the bustiest of fertility idols can't match up to those! Your breasts are simply on a class of their own.
6-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-huge_breasts&role;target:=embarrassed.png,Gosh, those look so heavy. That can't possibly be good for your posture, or your back.
6-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-huge_breasts&role;target:=sarcastic.png,A random thought just came to me... could you use your cleavage as a storage of sorts?

6-female_crotch_will_be_visible=thinking.png,If you think about it, this is the only thing distinguishing men and women, biologically.
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible=battleready.png,Feminine hygiene is very important and shouldn't be overlooked. Let's see how well you've been maintaining your hygiene,
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=scowling.png,Hold on, this is what you wanted to the from the beginning, did you?

6-female_crotch_is_visible=embarrassed.png,I do hope there aren't any ~clothing~ thieves lurking around here.
6-female_crotch_is_visible=happy.png,It's so brave of you to remove your ~clothing~ in front of a crowd. Not everyone has the courage to do it.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,weight:0.25=horny.png,Oh my, that looks... Quite wet.

7-male_chest_will_be_visible,weight:3=scowling.png,It says a lot about our societal norms that you exposing your chest isn't deemed as obscene, but me doing the same was.

7-male_chest_will_be_visible=fingerup.png,Mankind has always been fascinated by the male physique, if the statues are anything to go by.
7-male_chest_will_be_visible=excited.png,You can tell so much about a person's lifestyle just by looking at their physique. I'm excited to see what story your body will tell, ~name~.
7-male_chest_will_be_visible=embarrassed.png,I've always wondered why a man going topless isn't as taboo as a woman going topless. Not that I'd walk topless, even without the stigma.
7-male_chest_will_be_visible=fingerup.png,In the past, men being topless was actually the norm! With the weather at Sinnoh as it is, people back then must have been more resistant to the cold.
7-male_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;chazz&stage;5:,id:124=shocked.png,Huh?! What is this? Is this... the dark powers of the mythical Shadow Realm?! (<i>This is fascinating!</i>)

7-male_chest_is_visible,priority:200,count-chubby&role;target:=disappointed.png,Oh, you're... that was kind of a letdown, sorry...
7-male_chest_is_visible,priority:200,count-chubby&role;target:=embarrassed.png,Oh, I-I'm sorry... I was expecting something a little bit more appealing.
7-male_chest_is_visible,priority:200,count-chubby&role;target:=embarrassed.png,G-gah! Eh- M-my apologies, but I was expecting some eye-candy tonight.
7-male_chest_is_visible,priority:200,count-chubby&role;target:=disappointed.png,O-oh, my... It seems I've hyped up my expectations too much.
7-male_chest_is_visible,priority:200,count-chubby&role;target:=embarrassed.png,Ah! Err... My apologies, ~name~, but I didn't take you for the type to neglect health and wellness.

7-male_chest_is_visible,count-muscular&role;target:=excited.png,Ah, your muscles! They... they look firm, and sturdy.
7-male_chest_is_visible,count-muscular&role;target:=fingerup.png,Your chest... It's hard and firm, like an old cave painting...
7-male_chest_is_visible,count-muscular&role;target:=fingerup.png,Your chest... It's hard and firm... It reminds me of stone tablets I used to study as a child...

7-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;guzma:=aggressive.png,Ha, what's the matter, Guzma? Trying to hype us up for something? Please, I'm sure it'll be as underwhelming as Team Skull.
7-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;guzma:=aggressive.png,Ha, what's the matter, Guzma? Trying to hype us up for something? Please, I'm sure it'll be as underwhelming as your little criminal organization.
7-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,What's the matter, Guzma? Trying to overcompensate for something you're about to show us?
7-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Are you trying to hype this up or something Guzma? Come on, I'm sure it's as small as we're all thinking.
7-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,You're the <i>big</i> bad leader of Team Skull? Or are you a <i>small</i> leader...

7-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,You may be the <i>big</i> bad leader, but I'm sure you also have a <i>small</i> member, if you catch my drift.
7-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=scowling.png,Hold on, this is what you wanted to the from the beginning, isn't it?
7-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=scowling.png,What's even the point of joining a strip poker game if you're just playing to lose immediately?
7-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=scowling.png,This game might be about nudity, but that doesn't excuse your desire to show your penis to unsuspecting people, ~name~.
7-male_small_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;kazuma&stage;6:,marker:KazumaPenis=embarrassed.png,Oh, uh... Are the... balls supposed to hang lower than the... er, nevermind...
7-male_small_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;kazuma&stage;6:,marker:KazumaPenis=embarrassed.png,Oh, do you have, uh... <i>micropenis?</i> That looks... that looks nothing like what I've seen in the ancient sketches.
7-male_small_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;kazuma&stage;6:,marker:KazumaPenis=embarrassed.png,Oh, i uh... I don't mean to question your manliness, but... well, nevermind...
7-male_small_crotch_is_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=sarcastic.png,... That's it?!... You were very eager to show us your penis, and that's all of it?
7-male_small_crotch_is_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=sarcastic.png,I expected more from you, considering how excited you were to show your rod to all of us.
7-male_small_crotch_is_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=furious.png,All the eagerness to lose, only to show us that? Is this some sort of cruel prank?
7-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Ha ha, I was only teasing, Guzma.
7-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Okay, okay, so you're not as small as I was hoping...
7-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Okay, okay Guzma; I was hoping you would be smaller.
7-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Ha ha, <i>darn</i>. I was hoping you would have been smaller; it would have been much funnier that way.
7-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Ha ha, okay, okay Guzma. This would have been much more hilarious if it were smaller.
7-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Ha ha, okay, okay Guzma. This would have been much more hilarious if the <i>big bad</i> leader of Team Skull turned out to have a tiny penis.
7-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=disappointed.png,This accomplishment doesn't feel quite as good when it's pretty much handed to me.
7-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=disappointed.png,What makes an achievement truly rewarding is the sheer effort it takes to accomplish it. I can't say the same when you wanted to be naked in the first place.
7-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=frustrated.png,I bet you're <i>just absolutely thrilled</i> to be naked in front of everybody, ~name~.
7-male_large_crotch_is_visible=horny.png,Ha, now this is what I like to see! I was hoping to see a big one tonight.
7-male_large_crotch_is_visible=excited.png,Oh, dear! That's... that's larger than the ones I've seen in the ancient cave paintings...
7-male_large_crotch_is_visible=happy.png,My, you sure seem to be gifted, ~name~. Isn't nature a wonderful thing to be blessing some of us with such gifts?
7-male_large_crotch_is_visible=shocked.png,It's so big! I never thought those phallic sculptures were meant to be life-sized!
7-male_large_crotch_is_visible=surprised.png,It must have been difficult looking for ~clothing.ifPlural(|a)~ ~clothing~ that ~clothing.ifPlural(fit|fits)~ your... <i>uh</i>... credentials.
7-male_large_crotch_is_visible=horny.png,Oh, dear... That's certainly one of the more impressive ones I've seen!
7-male_large_crotch_is_visible=fingerup.png,Would you look at that! The chemistry of life seems to have favorable with your equipment.
7-male_large_crotch_is_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=shocked.png,No wonder you were so eager to show it to everybody! It's massive!
7-male_large_crotch_is_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=shocked.png,I finally understand why you couldn't wait to play show-and-tell with all of us...
7-male_large_crotch_is_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=scowling.png,I have to concede that your size is impressive... but you still intentionally lost. That's not the proper sporting spirit.
7-female_chest_will_be_visible,weight:0.3=sarcastic.png,Sorry, ~name~, but it looks like it's time...
7-female_chest_will_be_visible=excited.png,Well, this game is really coming down to the wire now. How exciting!
7-female_chest_will_be_visible=aggressive.png,As much as I enjoy dominant victories, close matches like this are always more satisfying to win.
7-female_chest_will_be_visible=embarrassed.png,If it's any consolation to you, I'm not used to seeing other women's bare breasts. This is probably uncomfortable for the both of us.
7-female_chest_will_be_visible=horny.png,Well, time to bare them, ~name~. <i>(I wonder how shapely ~name~'s breasts would be.)</i>
7-female_chest_will_be_visible=contemplative.png,<i>(Am I really this excited to see ~name~ with her breasts out? Or is this just because I've never seen another woman's breasts before?)</i>
7-female_chest_will_be_visible=thinking.png,<i>(I can see the outline of ~name~'s breasts on her ~clothing~. I wonder if they are exactly as big as it looks from here.)</i> 
7-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;cammy_white&saidmarker;juri_help:,count-role;other&character;juri&stage;0:,id:181=thinking.png,Juri? This is no time to be fooling around...

7-female_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-role;self&timeinstage;2:=fingerup.png,I was worried myself, ~name~ when I had to bare mine, but it's not so bad once you get used to it!
7-female_chest_will_be_visible,priority:0,count-role;self&timeinstage;2:=excited.png,I've had mine out for a while now, ~name~, so don't be shy!
7-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=sarcastic.png,Ha, if I didn't know any better, I'd say it looks like you're almost <i>happy</i> to be taking off your ~clothing~.
7-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=sarcastic.png,Don't get <i>too</i> excited, ~name~; someone might think you're some sort of exhibitionist.
7-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=surprised.png,~Name~, you almost look excited to be showing off your breasts... Is there something we should know?
7-female_small_chest_is_visible=sarcastic.png,Oh, hee... Those are quite small...
7-female_small_chest_is_visible=happy.png,They're beautiful just the way they are. People seem to have a fixation for larger size, but I think your breasts are special in their own way.
7-female_small_chest_is_visible=excited.png,You know how small Pokémon are considered "cute"? I think the same can be said of your breasts, ~name~.
7-female_small_chest_is_visible=excited.png,It's mesmerizing! I always found it odd that small breasts aren't as well-liked as the larger sizes.
7-female_small_chest_is_visible=fingerup.png,Did you know that there are cultures that value small breasts? It's fascinating how much culture can differ from one place to the other.
7-female_small_chest_is_visible=battleready.png,It looks great, ~name~! I do hope it doesn't become a distraction for everybody. There's still a game to be finished.
7-female_small_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;videl:,id:115=fingerup.png,Still clutching onto strings, are we? Well, I certainly admire your perseverance!
7-female_small_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-male:0,test:~background~:street:!=,weight:2=fingerup.png,It's okay, we're all girls here! No need to feel embarrassed.
7-female_small_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-male:0,test:~background~:street:!=,weight:2=excited.png,It's not like there's any guys here, so don't feel ashamed, ~name~!
7-female_small_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-male:0,test:~background~:street:!=,weight:2=fingerup.png,Don't feel insecure, ~name~; guys just want to see you naked. They don't care what you look like naked, they'll like you anyway!
7-female_small_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-male:0,test:~background~:street,id:37,weight:2=disappointed.png,It's okay, we're all girls here! No need to feel embarrassed... Oh, right... I forgot about the onlookers...

7-female_small_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-male&var;:1-4,weight:2=fingerup.png,It's okay ~name~, guys don't really care that much how big they are! Guys like ~male~ like boobs no matter how big or small they are!
7-female_small_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-male&var;:1-4,weight:2=fingerup.png,It's okay, ~name~, guys like ~male~ aren't that picky about size!
7-female_small_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-male&var;:1-4,weight:2=excited.png,Don't feel down, ~name~; to a guy, small tits are better than no tits!
7-female_medium_chest_is_visible=horny.png,Better luck next round, ~name~. Don't take this loss too hard. <i>(Her breasts are so shapely. Even more so than mine!)</i>
7-female_medium_chest_is_visible=fingerup.png,I can see that you've been taking good care of your body, ~name~. The human body is such a fragile thing. We should never take it for granted.
7-female_medium_chest_is_visible=embarrassed.png,Is it just me, or is there a cold breeze in this place...?
7-female_medium_chest_is_visible=excited.png,It's not too bad, ~name~. Everyone is too focused on the game to stare at your bare chest.
7-female_medium_chest_is_visible=embarrassed.png,The sight of your bare chest is making me... unseasonably warm.
7-female_medium_chest_is_visible=fingerup.png,Oh, those don't look too bad, ~name~! I'm sure the guys love them!
7-female_medium_chest_is_visible=fingerup.png,Oh, those don't look too bad, ~name~! I'm sure the guys love them! They're boobs, after all.
7-female_medium_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-male&var;:1-4=fingerup.png,Those look quite nice, ~name~! Ha, and it looks like ~male~ agrees since he's staring so much.
7-female_large_chest_is_visible=happy.png,Ancient queens are always said to have a "bountiful bosom", but yours is of the literal kind.
7-female_large_chest_is_visible=embarrassed.png,They look fun to play with... not that I have any intentions of doing that.
7-female_large_chest_is_visible=horny.png,I can finally understand why men are attracted to large breasts. They just have that magnificence to them that is difficult to describe.
7-female_large_chest_is_visible=horny.png,Holy Arceus, that might be a bit too much! But it looks so enticing... and erotic- I meant exotic...
7-female_large_chest_is_visible=excited.png,Wow, this was well worth the wait! Not that it's the only reason we play here.
7-female_large_chest_is_visible=sarcastic.png,You must get a lot of attention because of those. It's not exactly easy to conceal either.
7-female_large_chest_is_visible=happy.png,Looks like someone has the makings of a champion!
7-female_large_chest_is_visible=happy.png,My, you sure seem to be gifted, ~name~. Isn't mother nature a wonderful thing to be blessing some of us with such gifts?

7-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-huge_breasts&role;target:=excited.png,Oh, what a sight! I was suspecting that you had padded your ~clothing~, but they actually are massive!
7-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-huge_breasts&role;target:=surprised.png,... That can't be natural, can it?
7-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-huge_breasts&role;target:=fingerup.png,A bust that large... I don't think even the most voluptuous of historical queens had that size.
7-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-huge_breasts&role;target:=excited.png,The phrase "bountiful bosom" is thrown around a lot in ancient texts, but these might be on another level entirely.
7-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-huge_breasts&role;target:=fingerup.png,Even the bustiest of fertility idols can't match up to those! Your breasts are simply on a class of their own.
7-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-huge_breasts&role;target:=embarrassed.png,Gosh, those look so heavy. That can't possibly be good for your posture, or your back.
7-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-huge_breasts&role;target:=sarcastic.png,A random thought just came to me... could you use your cleavage as a storage of sorts?
7-female_large_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-male&var;:1-4,weight:2=sarcastic.png,Ha ha, well don't stare <i>too</i> hard, ~male~, or ~name~ might think you're a creep!
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible=excited.png,~Name~ is really going to reveal her... Oh, things have gotten interesting.
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible=excited.png,Are you the type of woman who shaves, or not? Only one way to find out.
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible=sarcastic.png,No turning back now, ~name~. You have to fulfill the consequences of your defeat.
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible=excited.png,Your ~clothing~ doesn't look cheap. I suppose wearing ~clothing.ifPlural(|a)~ cheap ~clothing~ wouldn't be a good showing.
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible=fingerup.png,Even though it has come down to this, you still did pretty well. I had mistaken you for an easy opponent, but you've proven me absolutely wrong.
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=scowling.png,Hold on, this is what you wanted to the from the beginning, did you?
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=scowling.png,What's even the point of joining a strip poker game if you're just playing to lose immediately?

7-female_crotch_is_visible,weight:0.25=horny.png,Oh my, that looks... Quite wet.
7-female_crotch_is_visible,weight:0.25=horny.png,Oh... (<i>why... why is this getting me wet?</i>)
7-female_crotch_is_visible,weight:0.25=horny.png,I suppose it's the... <i>excitement</i> of the situation that's making me a bit wet...
7-female_crotch_is_visible,weight:0.25=happy.png,I know she's not out yet, but this is almost like a victory itself!
7-female_crotch_is_visible=fingerup.png,Use this as a motivation to do better, ~name~. I know you wouldn't want to lose again, considering the consequences.
7-female_crotch_is_visible=battleready.png,There's no need to make this even more awkward than it already is, although I don't mind the scenery.
7-female_crotch_is_visible=embarrassed.png,What an erotic sight... Did I just say that out loud?
7-female_crotch_is_visible=horny.png,<i>(Staring at ~name~'s... It's making mine warm and tingly...)</i>

-3-male_chest_will_be_visible=excited.png,This is what I joined this game for. Let's see that chest, ~name~!
-3-male_chest_will_be_visible=excited.png,Let's see that chest, ~name~, and don't you wait a second!
-3-male_chest_will_be_visible=fingerup.png,Mankind has always been fascinated by the male physique, if the statues are anything to go by.
-3-male_chest_will_be_visible=excited.png,You can tell so much about a person's lifestyle just by looking at their physique. I'm excited to see what story your body will tell, ~name~.
-3-male_chest_will_be_visible=embarrassed.png,I've always wondered why a man going topless isn't as taboo as a woman going topless. Not that I'd walk topless, even without the stigma.
-3-male_chest_will_be_visible=fingerup.png,In the past, men being topless was actually the norm! With the weather at Sinnoh as it is, people back then must have been more resistant to the cold.
-3-male_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;chazz&stage;5:,id:124=shocked.png,Huh?! What is this? Is this... the dark powers of the mythical Shadow Realm?! (<i>This is fascinating!</i>)
-3-male_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;chazz&stage;5:,id:124=shocked.png,Huh?! What is this? Is this... the dark powers of the mythical Shadow Realm?! Q-quick, someone take notes!
-3-male_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;chazz&stage;5:,id:124=shocked.png,Huh?! What is this? Is this... the dark powers of the mythical Shadow Realm?! <i>This must be documented! Where's my notepad?!</i>
-3-male_chest_is_visible=horny.png,This is the kind of thing that I've only seen in magazines...
-3-male_chest_is_visible=excited.png,I've been to the beach a few times, so I've seen this kind of thing before, but... seeing it up close is a different experience.

-3-male_chest_is_visible=horny.png,It's... It's so much like a woman's except I'm somehow more turned on...
-3-male_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;guzma:=contemplative.png,Okay Guzma, I'll ask the question... How did you manage to get a hold of that kind of body? Because you can't steal a body...

-3-male_chest_is_visible,priority:200,count-chubby&role;target:=disappointed.png,O-oh, my... It seems I've hyped up my expectations too much.
-3-male_chest_is_visible,priority:200,count-chubby&role;target:=embarrassed.png,Ah! Err... My apologies, ~name~, but I didn't take you for the type to neglect health and wellness.

-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=scowling.png,What's even the point of joining a strip poker game if you're just playing to lose immediately?
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=scowling.png,This game might be about nudity, but that doesn't excuse your desire to show your penis to unsuspecting people, ~name~.

-3-male_small_crotch_is_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=sarcastic.png,... That's it?!... You were very eager to show us your penis, and that's all of it?
-3-male_small_crotch_is_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=sarcastic.png,I expected more from you, considering how excited you were to show your rod to all of us.
-3-male_small_crotch_is_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=furious.png,All the eagerness to lose, only to show us that? Is this some sort of cruel prank?
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Ha ha, I was only teasing, Guzma.
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Okay, okay, so you're not as small as I was hoping...
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Okay, okay Guzma; I was hoping you would be smaller.
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Ha ha, <i>darn</i>. I was hoping you would have been smaller; it would have been much funnier that way.
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Ha ha, okay, okay Guzma. This would have been much more hilarious if it were smaller.
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Ha ha, okay, okay Guzma. This would have been much more hilarious if the <i>big bad</i> leader of Team Skull turned out to have a tiny penis.
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=disappointed.png,This accomplishment doesn't feel quite as good when it's pretty much handed to me.
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=disappointed.png,What makes an achievement truly rewarding is the sheer effort it takes to accomplish it. I can't say the same when you wanted to be naked in the first place.
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=frustrated.png,I bet you're <i>just absolutely thrilled</i> to be naked in front of everybody, ~name~.
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible=horny.png,Ha, now this is what I like to see! I was hoping to see a big one tonight.
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible=excited.png,Oh, dear! That's... that's larger than the ones I've seen in the ancient cave paintings...
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible=happy.png,My, you sure seem to be gifted, ~name~. Isn't nature a wonderful thing to be blessing some of us with such gifts?
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible=shocked.png,It's so big! I never thought those phallic sculptures were meant to be life-sized!
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible=surprised.png,It must have been difficult looking for ~clothing.ifPlural(|a)~ ~clothing~ that ~clothing.ifPlural(fit|fits)~ your... <i>uh</i>... credentials.
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible=horny.png,Oh, dear... That's certainly one of the more impressive ones I've seen!
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible=fingerup.png,Would you look at that! The chemistry of life seems to have favorable with your equipment.
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=shocked.png,No wonder you were so eager to show it to everybody! It's massive!
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=shocked.png,I finally understand why you couldn't wait to play show-and-tell with all of us...
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=scowling.png,I have to concede that your size is impressive... but you still intentionally lost. That's not the proper sporting spirit.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible=fingerup.png,I was worried myself, ~name~ when I had to bare mine, but it's not so bad once you get used to it!
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible=excited.png,I've had mine out for a while now, ~name~, so don't be shy!
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible=excited.png,Well, this game is really coming down to the wire now. How exciting!
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible=aggressive.png,As much as I enjoy dominant victories, close matches like this are always more satisfying to win.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible=embarrassed.png,If it's any consolation to you, I'm not used to seeing other women's bare breasts. This is probably uncomfortable for the both of us.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible=horny.png,Well, time to bare them, ~name~. <i>(I wonder how shapely ~name~'s breasts would be.)</i>
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible=contemplative.png,<i>(Am I really this excited to see ~name~ with her breasts out? Or is this just because I've never seen another woman's breasts before?)</i>
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible=thinking.png,<i>(I can see the outline of ~name~'s breasts on her ~clothing~. I wonder if they are exactly as big as it looks from here.)</i>

-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=sarcastic.png,Ha, if I didn't know any better, I'd say it looks like you're almost <i>happy</i> to be taking off your ~clothing~.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=sarcastic.png,Don't get <i>too</i> excited, ~name~; someone might think you're some sort of exhibitionist.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=surprised.png,~Name~, you almost look excited to be showing off your breasts... Is there something we should know?
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible=sarcastic.png,Oh, hee... Those are quite small...
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible=happy.png,They're beautiful just the way they are. People seem to have a fixation for larger size, but I think your breasts are special in their own way.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible=excited.png,You know how small Pokémon are considered "cute"? I think the same can be said of your breasts, ~name~.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible=excited.png,It's mesmerizing! I always found it odd that small breasts aren't as well-liked as the larger sizes.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible=fingerup.png,Did you know that there are cultures that value small breasts? It's fascinating how much culture can differ from one place to the other.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible=battleready.png,It looks great, ~name~! I do hope it doesn't become a distraction for everybody. There's still a game to be finished.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;videl:,id:115=fingerup.png,Still clutching onto strings, are we? Well, I certainly admire your perseverance!

-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-male&var;:1-4,weight:2=fingerup.png,It's okay ~name~, guys don't really care that much how big they are! Guys like ~male~ like boobs no matter how big or small they are!
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-male&var;:1-4,weight:2=fingerup.png,It's okay, ~name~, guys like ~male~ aren't that picky about size!
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-male&var;:1-4,weight:2=excited.png,Don't feel down, ~name~; to a guy, small tits are better than no tits!
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible=horny.png,Better luck next round, ~name~. Don't take this loss too hard. <i>(Her breasts are so shapely. Even more so than mine!)</i>
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible=fingerup.png,I can see that you've been taking good care of your body, ~name~. The human body is such a fragile thing. We should never take it for granted.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible=embarrassed.png,Is it just me, or is there a cold breeze in this place...?
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible=excited.png,It's not too bad, ~name~. Everyone is too focused on the game to stare at your bare chest.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible=embarrassed.png,The sight of your bare chest is making me... unseasonably warm.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible=fingerup.png,Oh, those don't look too bad, ~name~! I'm sure the guys love them!
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible=fingerup.png,Oh, those don't look too bad, ~name~! I'm sure the guys love them! They're boobs, after all.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-male&var;:1-4=fingerup.png,Those look quite nice, ~name~! Ha, and it looks like ~male~ agrees since he's staring so much.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible=happy.png,Ancient queens are always said to have a "bountiful bosom", but yours is of the literal kind.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible=embarrassed.png,They look fun to play with... not that I have any intentions of doing that.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible=horny.png,I can finally understand why men are attracted to large breasts. They just have that magnificence to them that is difficult to describe.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible=horny.png,Holy Arceus, that might be a bit too much! But it looks so enticing... and erotic- I meant exotic...
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible=excited.png,Wow, this was well worth the wait! Not that it's the only reason we play here.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible=sarcastic.png,You must get a lot of attention because of those. It's not exactly easy to conceal either.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible=happy.png,Looks like someone has the makings of a champion!
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible=happy.png,My, you sure seem to be gifted, ~name~. Isn't mother nature a wonderful thing to be blessing some of us with such gifts?

-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-huge_breasts&role;target:=excited.png,Oh, what a sight! I was suspecting that you had padded your ~clothing~, but they actually are massive!
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-huge_breasts&role;target:=surprised.png,... That can't be natural, can it?
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-huge_breasts&role;target:=fingerup.png,A bust that large... I don't think even the most voluptuous of historical queens had that size.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-huge_breasts&role;target:=excited.png,The phrase "bountiful bosom" is thrown around a lot in ancient texts, but these might be on another level entirely.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-huge_breasts&role;target:=fingerup.png,Even the bustiest of fertility idols can't match up to those! Your breasts are simply on a class of their own.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-huge_breasts&role;target:=embarrassed.png,Gosh, those look so heavy. That can't possibly be good for your posture, or your back.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-huge_breasts&role;target:=sarcastic.png,A random thought just came to me... could you use your cleavage as a storage of sorts?
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-male&var;:1-4,weight:2=sarcastic.png,Ha ha, well don't stare <i>too</i> hard, ~male~, or ~name~ might think you're a creep!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible=excited.png,~Name~ is really going to reveal her... Oh, things have gotten interesting.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible=excited.png,Are you the type of woman who shaves, or not? Only one way to find out.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible=sarcastic.png,No turning back now, ~name~. You have to fulfill the consequences of your defeat.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible=excited.png,Your ~clothing~ doesn't look cheap. I suppose wearing ~clothing.ifPlural(|a)~ cheap ~clothing~ wouldn't be a good showing.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible=fingerup.png,Even though it has come down to this, you still did pretty well. I had mistaken you for an easy opponent, but you've proven me absolutely wrong.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=scowling.png,Hold on, this is what you wanted to the from the beginning, did you?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-exhibitionist&role;target:=scowling.png,What's even the point of joining a strip poker game if you're just playing to lose immediately?

-3-female_crotch_is_visible=fingerup.png,Use this as a motivation to do better, ~name~. I know you wouldn't want to lose again, considering the consequences.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible=battleready.png,There's no need to make this even more awkward than it already is, although I don't mind the scenery.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible=embarrassed.png,What an erotic sight... Did I just say that out loud?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible=horny.png,<i>(Staring at ~name~'s... It's making mine warm and tingly...)</i>

-2-male_chest_will_be_visible=excited.png,Let's see that chest, ~name~, and don't you wait a second!
-2-male_chest_will_be_visible=fingerup.png,Mankind has always been fascinated by the male physique, if the statues are anything to go by.
-2-male_chest_will_be_visible=excited.png,You can tell so much about a person's lifestyle just by looking at their physique. I'm excited to see what story your body will tell, ~name~.
-2-male_chest_will_be_visible=embarrassed.png,I've always wondered why a man going topless isn't as taboo as a woman going topless. Not that I'd walk topless, even without the stigma.
-2-male_chest_will_be_visible=fingerup.png,In the past, men being topless was actually the norm! With the weather at Sinnoh as it is, people back then must have been more resistant to the cold.
-2-male_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;chazz&stage;5:,id:124=shocked.png,Huh?! What is this? Is this... the dark powers of the mythical Shadow Realm?! (<i>This is fascinating!</i>)

-2-male_large_crotch_is_visible=surprised.png,How does that not fall off from its own weight? It looks like it's trying to escape from your body.
-2-male_large_crotch_is_visible=shocked.png,I didn't think the Pillar of Creation would be an actual pillar!
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible=mast_c.png,I never would have thought I would be this aroused by the thought of seeing another woman's breasts.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible=happy.png,What great timing, ~name~! I'm still exploring my boundaries, and this would be a massive help in your part.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible=mast_a.png,I'm glad that I'm in the proper mood for this monumental occasion!
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible=horny.png,This is the first time I've been in a situation like this, so forgive me for staring intently at you.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible=horny.png,The suspense is unpalpable! I might run out of breath if you remove your ~clothing~ any slower...

-2-female_small_chest_is_visible=happy.png,They might not be much, but I greatly admire their shape, ~name~.There's just something about them, I can't explain, that I find attractive.

-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible=contemplative.png,You have to wonder if we cover up our breasts because it's lewd, or if it's lewd because we covered them up in the first place.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible=fingerup.png,Oh, those don't look too bad, ~name~! I'm sure the guys love them!
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible=fingerup.png,Oh, those don't look too bad, ~name~! I'm sure the guys love them! They're boobs, after all.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-male&var;:1-4=fingerup.png,Those look quite nice, ~name~! Ha, and it looks like ~male~ agrees since he's staring so much.

-1-male_chest_will_be_visible=fingerup.png,Mankind has always been fascinated by the male physique, if the statues are anything to go by.

-1-female_chest_will_be_visible=excited.png,I've had mine out for a while now, ~name~, so don't be shy!
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible=horny.png,The silver lining to losing early is that I can enjoy the moment instead of looking at my cards.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible=fingerup.png,If you need some encouragement, don't forget that you're in a better position than I am, ~name~. At the very least, you won't be in last place.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible=sarcastic.png,It's not too bad, ~name~. Considering how fast-paced this game is, someone will most likely deflect attention from you shortly after.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible=excited.png,Now that my emotions have calmed down, I can get a more accurate idea of my stance on woman's breasts. 
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible=horny.png,We've found so many statues and relics depicting topless women, and it's not hard to figure out why.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible=thinking.png,I suspect that this was ~player~'s plan all along...
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;cammy_white&saidmarker;juri_help:,count-role;other&character;juri&stage;0:,id:181=thinking.png,Juri? This is no time to be fooling around...

-1-female_small_chest_is_visible=sarcastic.png,Oh, hee... Those are quite small...
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible=happy.png,They're beautiful just the way they are. People seem to have a fixation for larger size, but I think your breasts are special in their own way.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible=excited.png,You know how small Pokémon are considered "cute"? I think the same can be said of your breasts, ~name~.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible=excited.png,It's mesmerizing! I always found it odd that small breasts aren't as well-liked as the larger sizes.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible=fingerup.png,Did you know that there are cultures that value small breasts? It's fascinating how much culture can differ from one place to the other.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible=battleready.png,It looks great, ~name~! I do hope it doesn't become a distraction for everybody. There's still a game to be finished.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;videl:,id:115=fingerup.png,Still clutching onto strings, are we? Well, I certainly admire your perseverance!
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-male:0,test:~background~:street:!=,weight:2=fingerup.png,It's okay, we're all girls here! No need to feel embarrassed.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-male:0,test:~background~:street:!=,weight:2=excited.png,It's not like there's any guys here, so don't feel ashamed, ~name~!
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-male:0,test:~background~:street:!=,weight:2=fingerup.png,Don't feel insecure, ~name~; guys just want to see you naked. They don't care what you look like naked, they'll like you anyway!
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-male:0,test:~background~:street,id:37,weight:2=disappointed.png,It's okay, we're all girls here! No need to feel embarrassed... Oh, right... I forgot about the onlookers...
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-male:0,test:~background~:street,id:37,weight:2=disappointed.png,It's not like there's any guys here, so don't feel ashamed, ~name~! O-oh, right... The crowd behind us...
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-male&var;:1-4,weight:2=fingerup.png,It's okay ~name~, guys don't really care that much how big they are! Guys like ~male~ like boobs no matter how big or small they are!
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-male&var;:1-4,weight:2=fingerup.png,It's okay, ~name~, guys like ~male~ aren't that picky about size!
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-male&var;:1-4,weight:2=excited.png,Don't feel down, ~name~; to a guy, small tits are better than no tits!
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible=horny.png,Better luck next round, ~name~. Don't take this loss too hard. <i>(Her breasts are so shapely. Even more so than mine!)</i>
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible=fingerup.png,I can see that you've been taking good care of your body, ~name~. The human body is such a fragile thing. We should never take it for granted.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible=embarrassed.png,Is it just me, or is there a cold breeze in this place...?
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible=excited.png,It's not too bad, ~name~. Everyone is too focused on the game to stare at your bare chest.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible=embarrassed.png,The sight of your bare chest is making me... unseasonably warm.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible=fingerup.png,Oh, those don't look too bad, ~name~! I'm sure the guys love them!
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible=fingerup.png,Oh, those don't look too bad, ~name~! I'm sure the guys love them! They're boobs, after all.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-male&var;:1-4=fingerup.png,Those look quite nice, ~name~! Ha, and it looks like ~male~ agrees since he's staring so much.
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible=happy.png,Ancient queens are always said to have a "bountiful bosom", but yours is of the literal kind.
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible=embarrassed.png,They look fun to play with... not that I have any intentions of doing that.
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible=horny.png,I can finally understand why men are attracted to large breasts. They just have that magnificence to them that is difficult to describe.
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible=horny.png,Holy Arceus, that might be a bit too much! But it looks so enticing... and erotic- I meant exotic...
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible=excited.png,Wow, this was well worth the wait! Not that it's the only reason we play here.
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible=sarcastic.png,You must get a lot of attention because of those. It's not exactly easy to conceal either.
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible=happy.png,Looks like someone has the makings of a champion!
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible=happy.png,My, you sure seem to be gifted, ~name~. Isn't mother nature a wonderful thing to be blessing some of us with such gifts?
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;other&character;tharja&saidmarker;TharjaJessieBoobs:,count-role;target&character;jessie&sayingmarker;TharjaShrink:,test:~human.tag.human_female~:true=shocked.png,Hu-hu-<i>Huh?!</i> What did you just do?

-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-huge_breasts&role;target:=excited.png,Oh, what a sight! I was suspecting that you had padded your ~clothing~, but they actually are massive!
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-huge_breasts&role;target:=surprised.png,... That can't be natural, can it?
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-huge_breasts&role;target:=fingerup.png,A bust that large... I don't think even the most voluptuous of historical queens had that size.
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-huge_breasts&role;target:=excited.png,The phrase "bountiful bosom" is thrown around a lot in ancient texts, but these might be on another level entirely.
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-huge_breasts&role;target:=fingerup.png,Even the bustiest of fertility idols can't match up to those! Your breasts are simply on a class of their own.
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-huge_breasts&role;target:=embarrassed.png,Gosh, those look so heavy. That can't possibly be good for your posture, or your back.
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-huge_breasts&role;target:=sarcastic.png,A random thought just came to me... could you use your cleavage as a storage of sorts?
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,priority:0,count-male&var;:1-4,weight:2=sarcastic.png,Ha ha, well don't stare <i>too</i> hard, ~male~, or ~name~ might think you're a creep!
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible=excited.png,~Name~ is really going to reveal her... Oh, things have gotten interesting.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible=excited.png,Are you the type of woman who shaves, or not? Only one way to find out.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible=sarcastic.png,No turning back now, ~name~. You have to fulfill the consequences of your defeat.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible=excited.png,Your ~clothing~ doesn't look cheap. I suppose wearing ~clothing.ifPlural(|a)~ cheap ~clothing~ wouldn't be a good showing.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible=fingerup.png,Even though it has come down to this, you still did pretty well. I had mistaken you for an easy opponent, but you've proven me absolutely wrong.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:cammy_white,targetSaidMarker:chunli_help,alsoPlaying:chun-li,alsoPlayingStage:0,id:184=disappointed.png,Horseplay? During our game? ... Can't we be just a <i>little</i> serious?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,weight:0.25=horny.png,A vagina! Ah, bu-but why... (<i>Why am I liking this?</i>)
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,weight:0.25=horny.png,Oh... (<i>Why is this turning me on? </i>)
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,weight:0.25=sarcastic.png,A vagina! Ah, bu-but why... (<i>Why is this turning me on?</i>)
-1-female_crotch_is_visible=fingerup.png,Use this as a motivation to do better, ~name~. I know you wouldn't want to lose again, considering the consequences.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible=battleready.png,There's no need to make this even more awkward than it already is, although I don't mind the scenery.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible=embarrassed.png,What an erotic sight... Did I just say that out loud?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible=horny.png,<i>(Staring at ~name~'s... It's making mine warm and tingly...)</i>
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;mia:,id:163=sarcastic.png,Showing off your valuables now? Where was this sort of eye candy a few rounds ago?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,priority:302,count-role;target&character;florina&saidmarker;panties_butt&sayingmarker;butt:,id:156=embarrassed.png,Florina, dear... your... <i>butt</i> is ... it's <i>on display</i>... Was this maybe intentional?

0-opponent_lost,count-role;target&losses;3:=disappointed.png,Hmm? Three in a row? Are you <i>trying</i> to lose? I'll have you know, I was hoping you would make this at least a <i>little</i> challenging for me.
0-opponent_lost,priority:70,count-alive:2=happy.png,And the victor is: Cynthia! For a second there, I thought I lost.
0-opponent_lost,count-not_lost_some&adventurer&role;target:=happy.png,Ah, an adventurer. I remember when I used to go to adventures when I was a kid. Filling up my pokedex was hard work, but very fulfilling.
0-opponent_lost,count-not_lost_some&adventurer&role;target:=fingerup.png,So do you explore caves and such, ~name~? I used to explore those for fun when I was a kid, but now I do it as part of my archaeological studies.
0-opponent_lost,count-not_lost_some&adventurer&role;target:=happy.png,I suddenly recall that I used to go on trips to other regions just to fill up my pokedex. Ah, to be a kid again!
0-opponent_lost,oneShotId:54,count-not_lost_some&blue_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-short_hair&character;human:=disappointed.png,Your hair reminds me of Team Galactic grunts, ~player~. Not exactly the type of memories I'd want to remember in a time like this... or ever. 
0-opponent_lost,oneShotId:54,count-not_lost_some&blue_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-short_hair&character;human:=fingerup.png,Blue ear-length hair... Ever heard of Team Galactic, ~player~? The group that tried to destroy the Sinnoh region? They all had that same hairstyle for some reason.
0-opponent_lost,oneShotId:54,count-not_lost_some&blue_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-short_hair&character;human:=surprised.png,That hairstyle... it's so emblematic of Team Galactic grunts... Oh, don't worry, I know you're not one of them.
0-opponent_lost,oneShotId:50,count-male&long_hair&role;target&character;human:=battleready.png,It's pretty rare meeting a man with hair as long as yours, ~player~. I suppose the haircare is just the same.
0-opponent_lost,oneShotId:50,count-male&long_hair&role;target&character;human:=fingerup.png,Is long hair the norm for men of your culture, ~player~? That's pretty rare indeed, even looking back at past cultures.
0-opponent_lost,oneShotId:51,count-male&long_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-ginger&character;human:=excited.png,Oh, forgive me for staring, ~player~! Your appearance reminded me of Alder, the Champion of the Unova League... Wait, is he still the Champion? 
0-opponent_lost,oneShotId:51,count-male&long_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-ginger&character;human:=sarcastic.png,Alder?!... Silly me, I momentarily forgot that you were there, ~player~. My head is in the clouds again. I was just surprised by the uncanny resemblance.
0-opponent_lost,oneShotId:51,count-male&long_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-ginger&character;human:=sarcastic.png,For a split second there, I thought you were Alder, ~player~. You're just the second long red-haired man I've ever met.
0-opponent_lost,count-male&role;target&losses;3:=frustrated.png,That's three losses in a row, ~name~; I'll have you know, if this was all just a stunt to masturbate in front of me, I am <i>not</i> impressed!
0-opponent_lost,count-male&role;target&losses;3:=frustrated.png,That's three losses in a row, ~name~; I'll have you know, if this was all just an excuse to masturbate in front of me, I am <i>not</i> impressed!
0-opponent_lost,count-male&role;target&losses;3:=frustrated.png,Are you <i>trying</i> to lose, ~name~? I do <i>not</i> take kindly to perverts taking any opportunity they can to fondle themselves in front of me!
0-opponent_lost,count-male&role;target&losses;3:=aggressive.png,Ha, it looks like you're <i>trying</i> to lose, ~name~. You wouldn't be the first guy to want to expose himself in front of me.
0-opponent_lost,oneShotId:47,count-male&medium_hair&role;target&character;human:=battleready.png,Your hair is getting quite long, ~player~. Not to intrude on your space, but I think you might look better with shorter hair.
0-opponent_lost,oneShotId:47,count-male&medium_hair&role;target&character;human:=excited.png,It's not often I meet men with hair that long. I bet you'd look more handsome with your hair cut short, if you want my advice, ~player~.
0-opponent_lost,oneShotId:46,count-not_lost_some&red_eyes&role;target&character;human:=surprised.png,Your... your eyes are red, ~player~. Do you have sore eyes? I have some eyedrops you can borrow.
0-opponent_lost,oneShotId:46,count-not_lost_some&red_eyes&role;target&character;human:=surprised.png,Are your eyes okay, ~player~? They seem unnaturally reddened.
0-opponent_lost,oneShotId:45,count-not_lost_some&female&tall&role;target&character;human:,count-blonde&character;human:,test:~human.tag.fair-skinned~:true=sarcastic.png,Oh, ~player~! We look so much alike that we could pass off as twins. Our resemblance is uncanny.

0-opponent_lost,oneShotId:53,count-female&very_long_hair&role;target&character;human:=surprised.png,That's the longest hair I've seen from a person... How do you manage to take care of hair that long, ~player~?
0-opponent_lost,oneShotId:53,count-female&very_long_hair&role;target&character;human:=shocked.png,Your hair looks like you could accidentally step on it, ~player~! I can't imagine how annoying it would be to accidentally step on my own hair.
0-opponent_lost,oneShotId:52,count-male&very_long_hair&role;target&character;human:=surprised.png,I can't believe how long your hair is, ~player~! It's even longer than mine!
0-opponent_lost,oneShotId:52,count-male&very_long_hair&role;target&character;human:=surprised.png,Alright, this is a new one for me. I don't think I've ever seen a man with hair that reaches the floor. Women, sure, but never a man.

0-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:59,count-not_lost_some&blue_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-short_hair&character;human:=aggressive.png,Long story short, they opened a portal to another dimension, and I had to venture inside to convince the Legendary Pokémon living inside to close it.
0-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:59,count-not_lost_some&blue_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-short_hair&character;human:=aggressive.png,Long story short, they enslaved two Legendary Pokémon to create a new universe, but I managed to break the chains they were using, closing off the portal to the other universe.
0-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:57,count-male&long_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-ginger&character;human:=horny.png,I still remember when Alder tried to ask me out to a date. I wouldn't mind if you did the same, ~name~.

0-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:58,count-male&long_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-ginger&character;human:=sarcastic.png,Well, I'll just let you process all of that.., and the fact that you just lost.
0-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:56,count-not_lost_some&tall&role;target&character;human:,count-blonde&character;human:,test:~human.tag.fair-skinned~:true=fingerup.png,Oh, there I am musing to myself again! But to sum it up, we're not siblings, and we just happen to look alike. By the way, nice to meet you, ~player~!
0-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:56,count-not_lost_some&tall&role;target&character;human:,count-blonde&character;human:,test:~human.tag.fair-skinned~:true=happy.png,My, I got lost in my thoughts again! I hope you understood what I just said, ~player~. Now, let's just enjoy this game from now on.

0-opponent_crotch_is_visible,count-male&pubic_hair&role;target&character;human:=disappointed.png,Aww, I was hoping you'd been shaved, ~player~. That's kind of disappointing.
0-opponent_crotch_is_visible,count-male&pubic_hair&role;target&character;human:=disappointed.png,I know some people prefer some hair <i>down there</i>, but I didn't expect you to be the same, ~player~.

1-opponent_lost,count-role;target&losses;3:=disappointed.png,Hmm? Three in a row? Are you <i>trying</i> to lose? I'll have you know, I don't appreciate you removing the challenge of it all.
1-opponent_lost,count-role;target&losses;3:=disappointed.png,Hmm? Three in a row? Are you <i>trying</i> to lose? I'll have you know, I was hoping you would make this at least a <i>little</i> challenging for me.
1-opponent_lost,priority:70,count-alive:2=happy.png,And the victor is: Cynthia! For a second there, I thought I lost.
1-opponent_lost,count-not_lost_some&adventurer&role;target:=happy.png,Ah, an adventurer. I remember when I used to go to adventures when I was a kid. Filling up my pokedex was hard work, but very fulfilling.
1-opponent_lost,count-not_lost_some&adventurer&role;target:=fingerup.png,So do you explore caves and such, ~name~? I used to explore those for fun when I was a kid, but now I do it as part of my archaeological studies.
1-opponent_lost,count-not_lost_some&adventurer&role;target:=happy.png,I suddenly recall that I used to go on trips to other regions just to fill up my pokedex. Ah, to be a kid again!
1-opponent_lost,oneShotId:54,count-not_lost_some&blue_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-short_hair&character;human:=disappointed.png,Your hair reminds me of Team Galactic grunts, ~player~. Not exactly the type of memories I'd want to remember in a time like this... or ever. 
1-opponent_lost,oneShotId:54,count-not_lost_some&blue_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-short_hair&character;human:=fingerup.png,Blue ear-length hair... Ever heard of Team Galactic, ~player~? The group that tried to destroy the Sinnoh region? They all had that same hairstyle for some reason.
1-opponent_lost,oneShotId:54,count-not_lost_some&blue_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-short_hair&character;human:=surprised.png,That hairstyle... it's so emblematic of Team Galactic grunts... Oh, don't worry, I know you're not one of them.
1-opponent_lost,oneShotId:50,count-male&long_hair&role;target&character;human:=battleready.png,It's pretty rare meeting a man with hair as long as yours, ~player~. I suppose the haircare is just the same.
1-opponent_lost,oneShotId:50,count-male&long_hair&role;target&character;human:=fingerup.png,Is long hair the norm for men of your culture, ~player~? That's pretty rare indeed, even looking back at past cultures.
1-opponent_lost,oneShotId:51,count-male&long_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-ginger&character;human:=excited.png,Oh, forgive me for staring, ~player~! Your appearance reminded me of Alder, the Champion of the Unova League... Wait, is he still the Champion? 
1-opponent_lost,oneShotId:51,count-male&long_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-ginger&character;human:=sarcastic.png,Alder?!... Silly me, I momentarily forgot that you were there, ~player~. My head is in the clouds again. I was just surprised by the uncanny resemblance.
1-opponent_lost,oneShotId:51,count-male&long_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-ginger&character;human:=sarcastic.png,For a split second there, I thought you were Alder, ~player~. You're just the second long red-haired man I've ever met.
1-opponent_lost,count-male&role;target&losses;3:=frustrated.png,That's three losses in a row, ~name~; I'll have you know, if this was all just a stunt to masturbate in front of me, I am <i>not</i> impressed!
1-opponent_lost,count-male&role;target&losses;3:=frustrated.png,That's three losses in a row, ~name~; I'll have you know, if this was all just an excuse to masturbate in front of me, I am <i>not</i> impressed!
1-opponent_lost,count-male&role;target&losses;3:=frustrated.png,Are you <i>trying</i> to lose, ~name~? I do <i>not</i> take kindly to perverts taking any opportunity they can to fondle themselves in front of me!
1-opponent_lost,count-male&role;target&losses;3:=aggressive.png,Ha, it looks like you're <i>trying</i> to lose, ~name~. You wouldn't be the first guy to want to expose himself in front of me.
1-opponent_lost,oneShotId:47,count-male&medium_hair&role;target&character;human:=battleready.png,Your hair is getting quite long, ~player~. Not to intrude on your space, but I think you might look better with shorter hair.
1-opponent_lost,oneShotId:47,count-male&medium_hair&role;target&character;human:=excited.png,It's not often I meet men with hair that long. I bet you'd look more handsome with your hair cut short, if you want my advice, ~player~.
1-opponent_lost,oneShotId:46,count-not_lost_some&red_eyes&role;target&character;human:=surprised.png,Your... your eyes are red, ~player~. Do you have sore eyes? I have some eyedrops you can borrow.
1-opponent_lost,oneShotId:46,count-not_lost_some&red_eyes&role;target&character;human:=surprised.png,Are your eyes okay, ~player~? They seem unnaturally reddened.
1-opponent_lost,oneShotId:45,count-not_lost_some&female&tall&role;target&character;human:,count-blonde&character;human:,test:~human.tag.fair-skinned~:true=sarcastic.png,Oh, ~player~! We look so much alike that we could pass off as twins. Our resemblance is uncanny.
1-opponent_lost,oneShotId:45,count-not_lost_some&female&tall&role;target&character;human:,count-blonde&character;human:,test:~human.tag.fair-skinned~:true=surprised.png,Are we long lost twins, ~player~? No wonder the dealer asked me about my sister.
1-opponent_lost,oneShotId:45,count-not_lost_some&female&tall&role;target&character;human:,count-blonde&character;human:,test:~human.tag.fair-skinned~:true=excited.png,Wow, ~player~, we look so much alike that you might as well be my doppelganger.
1-opponent_lost,oneShotId:43,count-not_lost_some&male&tall&role;target&character;human:,count-blonde&character;human:,test:~human.tag.fair-skinned~:true=sarcastic.png,Oh, ~player~! We look so much alike that we could pass off as brother and sister! That would be awkward in a game like this, though.
1-opponent_lost,oneShotId:43,count-not_lost_some&male&tall&role;target&character;human:,count-blonde&character;human:,test:~human.tag.fair-skinned~:true=surprised.png,Are we long lost siblings, ~player~? No wonder the dealer asked me about that.
1-opponent_lost,oneShotId:53,count-female&very_long_hair&role;target&character;human:=surprised.png,That's the longest hair I've seen from a person... How do you manage to take care of hair that long, ~player~?
1-opponent_lost,oneShotId:53,count-female&very_long_hair&role;target&character;human:=shocked.png,Your hair looks like you could accidentally step on it, ~player~! I can't imagine how annoying it would be to accidentally step on my own hair.
1-opponent_lost,oneShotId:52,count-male&very_long_hair&role;target&character;human:=surprised.png,I can't believe how long your hair is, ~player~! It's even longer than mine!
1-opponent_lost,oneShotId:52,count-male&very_long_hair&role;target&character;human:=surprised.png,Alright, this is a new one for me. I don't think I've ever seen a man with hair that reaches the floor. Women, sure, but never a man.
1-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:59,count-not_lost_some&blue_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-short_hair&character;human:=aggressive.png,They not only wanted to destroy the Sinnoh region, but the entire world. Thank goodness I managed to close the portal before things got worst.
1-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:59,count-not_lost_some&blue_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-short_hair&character;human:=aggressive.png,Long story short, they opened a portal to another dimension, and I had to venture inside to convince the Legendary Pokémon living inside to close it.
1-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:59,count-not_lost_some&blue_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-short_hair&character;human:=aggressive.png,Long story short, they enslaved two Legendary Pokémon to create a new universe, but I managed to break the chains they were using, closing off the portal to the other universe.
1-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:57,count-male&long_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-ginger&character;human:=horny.png,I still remember when Alder tried to ask me out to a date. I wouldn't mind if you did the same, ~name~.
1-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:57,count-male&long_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-ginger&character;human:=horny.png,It felt very creepy when Alder would flirt with me, but I don't see anything wrong with you flirting with me.
1-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:57,count-male&long_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-ginger&character;human:=horny.png,I don't know if you eat out alone all the time like Alder, but I can fix that problem if that is the case.
1-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:55,count-not_lost_some&tall&role;target&character;human:,count-blonde&character;human:,test:~human.tag.fair-skinned~:true=embarrassed.png,I am 100% positive than we are not siblings at all... Okay, more like 95%, but what are the odds of that happening, right?
1-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:55,count-not_lost_some&tall&role;target&character;human:,count-blonde&character;human:,test:~human.tag.fair-skinned~:true=thinking.png,Come to think of it, there's no way we're related, right? I'm pretty sure I've heard of similar stories before, but this can't possibly be the case here.
1-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:55,count-not_lost_some&tall&role;target&character;human:,count-blonde&character;human:,test:~human.tag.fair-skinned~:true=contemplative.png,The odds of two long-lost siblings running across each other at a strip poker game has to be astronomically low... that can't be what's going on here.
1-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:60,count-not_lost_some&blue_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-short_hair&character;human:=fingerup.png,Oh, look at that! I've been monologuing again! But to end my story, Team Galactic is not a threat anymore, and the world is safe again.
1-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:60,count-not_lost_some&blue_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-short_hair&character;human:=sarcastic.png,Just look at me rambling on and on! Anyhow, that's the end of that story. No need to dwell too much in the past.
1-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:60,count-not_lost_some&blue_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-short_hair&character;human:=excited.png,Oh, sorry about talking non-stop there. I almost forgot we were playing a game here. Anyway, let's start the next round then.
1-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:58,count-male&long_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-ginger&character;human:=embarrassed.png,Not that I'm telling you to ask me out, but I wouldn't oppose the idea either.
1-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:58,count-male&long_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-ginger&character;human:=embarrassed.png,I'm not forcing you to ask me out or anything like that. It's still up to your discretion.
1-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:58,count-male&long_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-ginger&character;human:=sarcastic.png,Well, I'll just let you process all of that.., and the fact that you just lost.
1-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:56,count-not_lost_some&tall&role;target&character;human:,count-blonde&character;human:,test:~human.tag.fair-skinned~:true=fingerup.png,Oh, there I am musing to myself again! But to sum it up, we're not siblings, and we just happen to look alike. By the way, nice to meet you, ~player~!
1-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:56,count-not_lost_some&tall&role;target&character;human:,count-blonde&character;human:,test:~human.tag.fair-skinned~:true=happy.png,My, I got lost in my thoughts again! I hope you understood what I just said, ~player~. Now, let's just enjoy this game from now on.
1-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:56,count-not_lost_some&tall&role;target&character;human:,count-blonde&character;human:,test:~human.tag.fair-skinned~:true=fingerup.png,There we are, statistical proof that this isn't already weirder than it already is! We can just sit back and watch this game unfold.
1-opponent_chest_will_be_visible,target:chihiro,id:52=sarcastic.png,Huh? Chihiro? Are you running away from the fight?
1-opponent_chest_will_be_visible,target:chihiro,id:52=aggressive.png,Huh? Chihiro? You can't run from your fears; you gotta stand up and confront them!
1-opponent_chest_will_be_visible,target:chihiro,id:52=disappointed.png,Huh? Chihiro? Are you... quitting? Right when we're getting to the fun part too...
1-opponent_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;chihiro:,test:~background.time~:day,id:4=sarcastic.png,Oh? Huh... That's strange... I'm normally into men, but I guess you... weren't on my radar... Sorry! Heh.
1-opponent_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;chihiro:,test:~background.time~:day,id:4=embarrassed.png,Oh, so you're a... man... I was hoping I would see a man naked today, but I guess you... don't seem to count, in my mind... Sorry...
1-opponent_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;chihiro:,test:~background.time~:night,id:3=sarcastic.png,Oh? Huh... That's strange... I'm normally into men, but I guess you... weren't on my radar... Sorry! Heh.
1-opponent_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;chihiro:,test:~background.time~:night,id:3=embarrassed.png,Oh, so you're a... man... I was hoping to see a man naked tonight, but I guess you... don't seem to count, in my mind... Sorry...
1-opponent_crotch_is_visible,count-male&pubic_hair&role;target&character;human:=disappointed.png,Aww, I was hoping you'd been shaved, ~player~. That's kind of disappointing.
1-opponent_crotch_is_visible,count-male&pubic_hair&role;target&character;human:=disappointed.png,I know some people prefer some hair <i>down there</i>, but I didn't expect you to be the same, ~player~.
1-opponent_crotch_is_visible,count-male&pubic_hair&role;target&character;human:=furious.png,Don't you know that pubic hair is unclean, ~player~. What's even the point of keeping all that hair?!
1-opponent_crotch_is_visible,count-male&pubic_hair&role;target&character;human:=embarrassed.png,That looks quite... unkempt, ~player~. I was hoping you were looking after your hygiene.
1-opponent_start_masturbating,oneShotId:36,count-tandem&role;target:=surprised.png,Oh, you're allowed to... have sex in this game?
1-opponent_start_masturbating,oneShotId:36,count-tandem&role;target:=surprised.png,You're masturbating with a partner?... That's not really masturbation, is it?
1-opponent_start_masturbating,oneShotId:36,count-tandem&role;target:=surprised.png,Is that allowed? I thought we were only limited to masturbation for the forfeit?
1-opponent_start_masturbating,count-tentacle_forfeit&role;target:=shocked.png,Where did that thing even come from?!

2-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:60,count-not_lost_some&blue_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-short_hair&character;human:=sarcastic.png,Just look at me rambling on and on! Anyhow, that's the end of that story. No need to dwell too much in the past.
2-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:60,count-not_lost_some&blue_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-short_hair&character;human:=excited.png,Oh, sorry about talking non-stop there. I almost forgot we were playing a game here. Anyway, let's start the next round then.
2-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:58,count-male&long_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-ginger&character;human:=embarrassed.png,Not that I'm telling you to ask me out, but I wouldn't oppose the idea either.

2-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:58,count-male&long_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-ginger&character;human:=sarcastic.png,Well, I'll just let you process all of that.., and the fact that you just lost.
2-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:56,count-not_lost_some&tall&role;target&character;human:,count-blonde&character;human:,test:~human.tag.fair-skinned~:true=fingerup.png,Oh, there I am musing to myself again!

2-opponent_crotch_is_visible,count-male&pubic_hair&role;target&character;human:=disappointed.png,Aww, I was hoping you'd been shaved, ~player~. That's kind of disappointing.
2-opponent_crotch_is_visible,count-male&pubic_hair&role;target&character;human:=disappointed.png,I know some people prefer some hair <i>down there</i>, but I didn't expect you to be the same, ~player~.

2-opponent_start_masturbating,oneShotId:36,count-tandem&role;target:=surprised.png,You're masturbating with a partner?... That's not really masturbation, is it?
2-opponent_start_masturbating,oneShotId:36,count-tandem&role;target:=surprised.png,Is that allowed? I thought we were only limited to masturbation for the forfeit?

3-opponent_lost,count-not_lost_some&adventurer&role;target:=happy.png,Ah, an adventurer. I remember when I used to go to adventures when I was a kid. Filling up my pokedex was hard work, but very fulfilling.
3-opponent_lost,count-not_lost_some&adventurer&role;target:=fingerup.png,So do you explore caves and such, ~name~? I used to explore those for fun when I was a kid, but now I do it as part of my archaeological studies.
3-opponent_lost,count-not_lost_some&adventurer&role;target:=happy.png,I suddenly recall that I used to go on trips to other regions just to fill up my pokedex. Ah, to be a kid again!
3-opponent_lost,oneShotId:54,count-not_lost_some&blue_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-short_hair&character;human:=disappointed.png,Your hair reminds me of Team Galactic grunts, ~player~. Not exactly the type of memories I'd want to remember in a time like this... or ever. 
3-opponent_lost,oneShotId:54,count-not_lost_some&blue_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-short_hair&character;human:=fingerup.png,Blue ear-length hair... Ever heard of Team Galactic, ~player~? The group that tried to destroy the Sinnoh region? They all had that same hairstyle for some reason.
3-opponent_lost,oneShotId:54,count-not_lost_some&blue_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-short_hair&character;human:=surprised.png,That hairstyle... it's so emblematic of Team Galactic grunts... Oh, don't worry, I know you're not one of them.
3-opponent_lost,oneShotId:50,count-male&long_hair&role;target&character;human:=battleready.png,It's pretty rare meeting a man with hair as long as yours, ~player~. I suppose the haircare is just the same.
3-opponent_lost,oneShotId:50,count-male&long_hair&role;target&character;human:=fingerup.png,Is long hair the norm for men of your culture, ~player~? That's pretty rare indeed, even looking back at past cultures.
3-opponent_lost,oneShotId:51,count-male&long_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-ginger&character;human:=excited.png,Oh, forgive me for staring, ~player~! Your appearance reminded me of Alder, the Champion of the Unova League... Wait, is he still the Champion? 
3-opponent_lost,oneShotId:51,count-male&long_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-ginger&character;human:=sarcastic.png,Alder?!... Silly me, I momentarily forgot that you were there, ~player~. My head is in the clouds again. I was just surprised by the uncanny resemblance.
3-opponent_lost,oneShotId:51,count-male&long_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-ginger&character;human:=sarcastic.png,For a split second there, I thought you were Alder, ~player~. You're just the second long red-haired man I've ever met.
3-opponent_lost,count-male&role;target&losses;3:=frustrated.png,That's three losses in a row, ~name~; I'll have you know, if this was all just a stunt to masturbate in front of me, I am <i>not</i> impressed!

3-opponent_lost,count-male&role;target&losses;3:=aggressive.png,Ha, it looks like you're <i>trying</i> to lose, ~name~. You wouldn't be the first guy to want to expose himself in front of me.
3-opponent_lost,oneShotId:47,count-male&medium_hair&role;target&character;human:=battleready.png,Your hair is getting quite long, ~player~. Not to intrude on your space, but I think you might look better with shorter hair.
3-opponent_lost,oneShotId:47,count-male&medium_hair&role;target&character;human:=excited.png,It's not often I meet men with hair that long. I bet you'd look more handsome with your hair cut short, if you want my advice, ~player~.
3-opponent_lost,oneShotId:46,count-not_lost_some&red_eyes&role;target&character;human:=surprised.png,Your... your eyes are red, ~player~. Do you have sore eyes? I have some eyedrops you can borrow.
3-opponent_lost,oneShotId:46,count-not_lost_some&red_eyes&role;target&character;human:=surprised.png,Are your eyes okay, ~player~? They seem unnaturally reddened.
3-opponent_lost,oneShotId:45,count-not_lost_some&female&tall&role;target&character;human:,count-blonde&character;human:,test:~human.tag.fair-skinned~:true=sarcastic.png,Oh, ~player~! We look so much alike that we could pass off as twins. Our resemblance is uncanny.
3-opponent_lost,oneShotId:45,count-not_lost_some&female&tall&role;target&character;human:,count-blonde&character;human:,test:~human.tag.fair-skinned~:true=surprised.png,Are we long lost twins, ~player~? No wonder the dealer asked me about my sister.
3-opponent_lost,oneShotId:45,count-not_lost_some&female&tall&role;target&character;human:,count-blonde&character;human:,test:~human.tag.fair-skinned~:true=excited.png,Wow, ~player~, we look so much alike that you might as well be my doppelganger.
3-opponent_lost,oneShotId:43,count-not_lost_some&male&tall&role;target&character;human:,count-blonde&character;human:,test:~human.tag.fair-skinned~:true=sarcastic.png,Oh, ~player~! We look so much alike that we could pass off as brother and sister! That would be awkward in a game like this, though.
3-opponent_lost,oneShotId:43,count-not_lost_some&male&tall&role;target&character;human:,count-blonde&character;human:,test:~human.tag.fair-skinned~:true=surprised.png,Are we long lost siblings, ~player~? No wonder the dealer asked me about that.
3-opponent_lost,oneShotId:53,count-female&very_long_hair&role;target&character;human:=surprised.png,That's the longest hair I've seen from a person... How do you manage to take care of hair that long, ~player~?
3-opponent_lost,oneShotId:53,count-female&very_long_hair&role;target&character;human:=shocked.png,Your hair looks like you could accidentally step on it, ~player~! I can't imagine how annoying it would be to accidentally step on my own hair.
3-opponent_lost,oneShotId:52,count-male&very_long_hair&role;target&character;human:=surprised.png,I can't believe how long your hair is, ~player~! It's even longer than mine!
3-opponent_lost,oneShotId:52,count-male&very_long_hair&role;target&character;human:=surprised.png,Alright, this is a new one for me. I don't think I've ever seen a man with hair that reaches the floor. Women, sure, but never a man.
3-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:59,count-not_lost_some&blue_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-short_hair&character;human:=aggressive.png,They not only wanted to destroy the Sinnoh region, but the entire world. Thank goodness I managed to close the portal before things got worst.
3-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:59,count-not_lost_some&blue_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-short_hair&character;human:=aggressive.png,Long story short, they opened a portal to another dimension, and I had to venture inside to convince the Legendary Pokémon living inside to close it.
3-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:59,count-not_lost_some&blue_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-short_hair&character;human:=aggressive.png,Long story short, they enslaved two Legendary Pokémon to create a new universe, but I managed to break the chains they were using, closing off the portal to the other universe.
3-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:57,count-male&long_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-ginger&character;human:=horny.png,I still remember when Alder tried to ask me out to a date. I wouldn't mind if you did the same, ~name~.
3-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:57,count-male&long_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-ginger&character;human:=horny.png,It felt very creepy when Alder would flirt with me, but I don't see anything wrong with you flirting with me.
3-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:57,count-male&long_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-ginger&character;human:=horny.png,I don't know if you eat out alone all the time like Alder, but I can fix that problem if that is the case.
3-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:55,count-not_lost_some&tall&role;target&character;human:,count-blonde&character;human:,test:~human.tag.fair-skinned~:true=embarrassed.png,I am 100% positive than we are not siblings at all... Okay, more like 95%, but what are the odds of that happening, right?
3-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:55,count-not_lost_some&tall&role;target&character;human:,count-blonde&character;human:,test:~human.tag.fair-skinned~:true=thinking.png,Come to think of it, there's no way we're related, right? I'm pretty sure I've heard of similar stories before, but this can't possibly be the case here.
3-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:55,count-not_lost_some&tall&role;target&character;human:,count-blonde&character;human:,test:~human.tag.fair-skinned~:true=contemplative.png,The odds of two long-lost siblings running across each other at a strip poker game has to be astronomically low... that can't be what's going on here.

3-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:60,count-not_lost_some&blue_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-short_hair&character;human:=sarcastic.png,Just look at me rambling on and on! Anyhow, that's the end of that story. No need to dwell too much in the past.

4-opponent_lost,oneShotId:45,count-not_lost_some&female&tall&role;target&character;human:,count-blonde&character;human:,test:~human.tag.fair-skinned~:true=sarcastic.png,Oh, ~player~! We look so much alike that we could pass off as twins. Our resemblance is uncanny.
4-opponent_lost,oneShotId:45,count-not_lost_some&female&tall&role;target&character;human:,count-blonde&character;human:,test:~human.tag.fair-skinned~:true=surprised.png,Are we long lost twins, ~player~? No wonder the dealer asked me about my sister.
4-opponent_lost,oneShotId:45,count-not_lost_some&female&tall&role;target&character;human:,count-blonde&character;human:,test:~human.tag.fair-skinned~:true=excited.png,Wow, ~player~, we look so much alike that you might as well be my doppelganger.
4-opponent_lost,oneShotId:43,count-not_lost_some&male&tall&role;target&character;human:,count-blonde&character;human:,test:~human.tag.fair-skinned~:true=sarcastic.png,Oh, ~player~! We look so much alike that we could pass off as brother and sister! That would be awkward in a game like this, though.
4-opponent_lost,oneShotId:43,count-not_lost_some&male&tall&role;target&character;human:,count-blonde&character;human:,test:~human.tag.fair-skinned~:true=surprised.png,Are we long lost siblings, ~player~? No wonder the dealer asked me about that.
4-opponent_lost,oneShotId:53,count-female&very_long_hair&role;target&character;human:=surprised.png,That's the longest hair I've seen from a person... How do you manage to take care of hair that long, ~player~?
4-opponent_lost,oneShotId:53,count-female&very_long_hair&role;target&character;human:=shocked.png,Your hair looks like you could accidentally step on it, ~player~! I can't imagine how annoying it would be to accidentally step on my own hair.
4-opponent_lost,oneShotId:52,count-male&very_long_hair&role;target&character;human:=surprised.png,I can't believe how long your hair is, ~player~! It's even longer than mine!
4-opponent_lost,oneShotId:52,count-male&very_long_hair&role;target&character;human:=surprised.png,Alright, this is a new one for me. I don't think I've ever seen a man with hair that reaches the floor. Women, sure, but never a man.
4-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:59,count-not_lost_some&blue_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-short_hair&character;human:=aggressive.png,They not only wanted to destroy the Sinnoh region, but the entire world. Thank goodness I managed to close the portal before things got worst.
4-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:59,count-not_lost_some&blue_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-short_hair&character;human:=aggressive.png,Long story short, they opened a portal to another dimension, and I had to venture inside to convince the Legendary Pokémon living inside to close it.
4-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:59,count-not_lost_some&blue_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-short_hair&character;human:=aggressive.png,Long story short, they enslaved two Legendary Pokémon to create a new universe, but I managed to break the chains they were using, closing off the portal to the other universe.
4-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:57,count-male&long_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-ginger&character;human:=horny.png,I still remember when Alder tried to ask me out to a date. I wouldn't mind if you did the same, ~name~.
4-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:57,count-male&long_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-ginger&character;human:=horny.png,It felt very creepy when Alder would flirt with me, but I don't see anything wrong with you flirting with me.
4-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:57,count-male&long_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-ginger&character;human:=horny.png,I don't know if you eat out alone all the time like Alder, but I can fix that problem if that is the case.
4-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:55,count-not_lost_some&tall&role;target&character;human:,count-blonde&character;human:,test:~human.tag.fair-skinned~:true=embarrassed.png,I am 100% positive than we are not siblings at all... Okay, more like 95%, but what are the odds of that happening, right?
4-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:55,count-not_lost_some&tall&role;target&character;human:,count-blonde&character;human:,test:~human.tag.fair-skinned~:true=thinking.png,Come to think of it, there's no way we're related, right? I'm pretty sure I've heard of similar stories before, but this can't possibly be the case here.
4-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:55,count-not_lost_some&tall&role;target&character;human:,count-blonde&character;human:,test:~human.tag.fair-skinned~:true=contemplative.png,The odds of two long-lost siblings running across each other at a strip poker game has to be astronomically low... that can't be what's going on here.
4-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:60,count-not_lost_some&blue_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-short_hair&character;human:=fingerup.png,Oh, look at that! I've been monologuing again! But to end my story, Team Galactic is not a threat anymore, and the world is safe again.
4-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:60,count-not_lost_some&blue_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-short_hair&character;human:=sarcastic.png,Just look at me rambling on and on! Anyhow, that's the end of that story. No need to dwell too much in the past.
4-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:60,count-not_lost_some&blue_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-short_hair&character;human:=excited.png,Oh, sorry about talking non-stop there. I almost forgot we were playing a game here. Anyway, let's start the next round then.
4-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:58,count-male&long_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-ginger&character;human:=embarrassed.png,Not that I'm telling you to ask me out, but I wouldn't oppose the idea either.
4-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:58,count-male&long_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-ginger&character;human:=embarrassed.png,I'm not forcing you to ask me out or anything like that. It's still up to your discretion.
4-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:58,count-male&long_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-ginger&character;human:=sarcastic.png,Well, I'll just let you process all of that.., and the fact that you just lost.
4-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:56,count-not_lost_some&tall&role;target&character;human:,count-blonde&character;human:,test:~human.tag.fair-skinned~:true=fingerup.png,Oh, there I am musing to myself again! But to sum it up, we're not siblings, and we just happen to look alike. By the way, nice to meet you, ~player~!
4-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:56,count-not_lost_some&tall&role;target&character;human:,count-blonde&character;human:,test:~human.tag.fair-skinned~:true=happy.png,My, I got lost in my thoughts again! I hope you understood what I just said, ~player~. Now, let's just enjoy this game from now on.
4-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:56,count-not_lost_some&tall&role;target&character;human:,count-blonde&character;human:,test:~human.tag.fair-skinned~:true=fingerup.png,There we are, statistical proof that this isn't already weirder than it already is! We can just sit back and watch this game unfold.
4-opponent_chest_will_be_visible,target:chihiro,id:52=sarcastic.png,Huh? Chihiro? Are you running away from the fight?
4-opponent_chest_will_be_visible,target:chihiro,id:52=aggressive.png,Huh? Chihiro? You can't run from your fears; you gotta stand up and confront them!
4-opponent_chest_will_be_visible,target:chihiro,id:52=disappointed.png,Huh? Chihiro? Are you... quitting? Right when we're getting to the fun part too...
4-opponent_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;chihiro:,count-male:0-1,test:~background.time~:day,id:6=excited.png,Oh! After I saw that there were no men around, I had given up hope of seeing any penises today; you could say that this was a pleasant surprise!
4-opponent_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;chihiro:,count-male:0-1,test:~background.time~:night,id:5=excited.png,Oh! After I saw that there were no men around, I had given up hope of seeing any penises tonight; you could say that this was a pleasant surprise!
4-opponent_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;chihiro:,test:~background.time~:day,id:4=sarcastic.png,Oh? Huh... That's strange... I'm normally into men, but I guess you... weren't on my radar... Sorry! Heh.
4-opponent_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;chihiro:,test:~background.time~:day,id:4=embarrassed.png,Oh, so you're a... man... I was hoping I would see a man naked today, but I guess you... don't seem to count, in my mind... Sorry...
4-opponent_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;chihiro:,test:~background.time~:night,id:3=sarcastic.png,Oh? Huh... That's strange... I'm normally into men, but I guess you... weren't on my radar... Sorry! Heh.
4-opponent_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;chihiro:,test:~background.time~:night,id:3=embarrassed.png,Oh, so you're a... man... I was hoping to see a man naked tonight, but I guess you... don't seem to count, in my mind... Sorry...
4-opponent_crotch_is_visible,count-male&pubic_hair&role;target&character;human:=disappointed.png,Aww, I was hoping you'd been shaved, ~player~. That's kind of disappointing.
4-opponent_crotch_is_visible,count-male&pubic_hair&role;target&character;human:=disappointed.png,I know some people prefer some hair <i>down there</i>, but I didn't expect you to be the same, ~player~.
4-opponent_crotch_is_visible,count-male&pubic_hair&role;target&character;human:=furious.png,Don't you know that pubic hair is unclean, ~player~. What's even the point of keeping all that hair?!
4-opponent_crotch_is_visible,count-male&pubic_hair&role;target&character;human:=embarrassed.png,That looks quite... unkempt, ~player~. I was hoping you were looking after your hygiene.
4-opponent_start_masturbating,oneShotId:36,count-tandem&role;target:=surprised.png,Oh, you're allowed to... have sex in this game?
4-opponent_start_masturbating,oneShotId:36,count-tandem&role;target:=surprised.png,You're masturbating with a partner?... That's not really masturbation, is it?
4-opponent_start_masturbating,oneShotId:36,count-tandem&role;target:=surprised.png,Is that allowed? I thought we were only limited to masturbation for the forfeit?
4-opponent_start_masturbating,count-tentacle_forfeit&role;target:=shocked.png,Where did that thing even come from?!
4-opponent_start_masturbating,oneShotId:35,count-uses_toy&role;target:=surprised.png,Wait, we were allowed to use toys during our forfeit? I don't remember that option.
4-opponent_start_masturbating,oneShotId:35,count-uses_toy&role;target:=disappointed.png,Come to think of it, I don't recall any rules against using equipment like that... I wish I had thought of that.
4-opponent_start_masturbating,oneShotId:35,count-uses_toy&role;target:=surprised.png,You brought your equipment with you, ~name~? You're a bit more prepared for this scenario than I am.

5-opponent_lost,count-role;target&losses;3:=disappointed.png,Hmm? Three in a row? Are you <i>trying</i> to lose? I'll have you know, I was hoping you would make this at least a <i>little</i> challenging for me.
5-opponent_lost,priority:70,count-alive:2=happy.png,And the victor is: Cynthia! For a second there, I thought I lost.
5-opponent_lost,count-not_lost_some&adventurer&role;target:=happy.png,Ah, an adventurer. I remember when I used to go to adventures when I was a kid. Filling up my pokedex was hard work, but very fulfilling.
5-opponent_lost,count-not_lost_some&adventurer&role;target:=fingerup.png,So do you explore caves and such, ~name~? I used to explore those for fun when I was a kid, but now I do it as part of my archaeological studies.
5-opponent_lost,count-not_lost_some&adventurer&role;target:=happy.png,I suddenly recall that I used to go on trips to other regions just to fill up my pokedex. Ah, to be a kid again!
5-opponent_lost,oneShotId:54,count-not_lost_some&blue_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-short_hair&character;human:=disappointed.png,Your hair reminds me of Team Galactic grunts, ~player~. Not exactly the type of memories I'd want to remember in a time like this... or ever. 
5-opponent_lost,oneShotId:54,count-not_lost_some&blue_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-short_hair&character;human:=fingerup.png,Blue ear-length hair... Ever heard of Team Galactic, ~player~? The group that tried to destroy the Sinnoh region? They all had that same hairstyle for some reason.
5-opponent_lost,oneShotId:54,count-not_lost_some&blue_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-short_hair&character;human:=surprised.png,That hairstyle... it's so emblematic of Team Galactic grunts... Oh, don't worry, I know you're not one of them.
5-opponent_lost,oneShotId:50,count-male&long_hair&role;target&character;human:=battleready.png,It's pretty rare meeting a man with hair as long as yours, ~player~. I suppose the haircare is just the same.
5-opponent_lost,oneShotId:50,count-male&long_hair&role;target&character;human:=fingerup.png,Is long hair the norm for men of your culture, ~player~? That's pretty rare indeed, even looking back at past cultures.
5-opponent_lost,oneShotId:51,count-male&long_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-ginger&character;human:=excited.png,Oh, forgive me for staring, ~player~! Your appearance reminded me of Alder, the Champion of the Unova League... Wait, is he still the Champion? 
5-opponent_lost,oneShotId:51,count-male&long_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-ginger&character;human:=sarcastic.png,Alder?!... Silly me, I momentarily forgot that you were there, ~player~. My head is in the clouds again. I was just surprised by the uncanny resemblance.
5-opponent_lost,oneShotId:51,count-male&long_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-ginger&character;human:=sarcastic.png,For a split second there, I thought you were Alder, ~player~. You're just the second long red-haired man I've ever met.
5-opponent_lost,count-male&role;target&losses;3:=frustrated.png,That's three losses in a row, ~name~; I'll have you know, if this was all just a stunt to masturbate in front of me, I am <i>not</i> impressed!
5-opponent_lost,count-male&role;target&losses;3:=frustrated.png,That's three losses in a row, ~name~; I'll have you know, if this was all just an excuse to masturbate in front of me, I am <i>not</i> impressed!
5-opponent_lost,count-male&role;target&losses;3:=frustrated.png,Are you <i>trying</i> to lose, ~name~? I do <i>not</i> take kindly to perverts taking any opportunity they can to fondle themselves in front of me!
5-opponent_lost,count-male&role;target&losses;3:=aggressive.png,Ha, it looks like you're <i>trying</i> to lose, ~name~. You wouldn't be the first guy to want to expose himself in front of me.
5-opponent_lost,oneShotId:47,count-male&medium_hair&role;target&character;human:=battleready.png,Your hair is getting quite long, ~player~. Not to intrude on your space, but I think you might look better with shorter hair.
5-opponent_lost,oneShotId:47,count-male&medium_hair&role;target&character;human:=excited.png,It's not often I meet men with hair that long. I bet you'd look more handsome with your hair cut short, if you want my advice, ~player~.

5-opponent_start_masturbating,oneShotId:36,count-tandem&role;target:=surprised.png,You're masturbating with a partner?... That's not really masturbation, is it?
5-opponent_start_masturbating,oneShotId:36,count-tandem&role;target:=surprised.png,Is that allowed? I thought we were only limited to masturbation for the forfeit?
5-opponent_start_masturbating,count-tentacle_forfeit&role;target:=shocked.png,Where did that thing even come from?!
5-opponent_start_masturbating,oneShotId:35,count-uses_toy&role;target:=surprised.png,Wait, we were allowed to use toys during our forfeit? I don't remember that option.
5-opponent_start_masturbating,oneShotId:35,count-uses_toy&role;target:=disappointed.png,Come to think of it, I don't recall any rules against using equipment like that... I wish I had thought of that.
5-opponent_start_masturbating,oneShotId:35,count-uses_toy&role;target:=surprised.png,You brought your equipment with you, ~name~? You're a bit more prepared for this scenario than I am.

6-opponent_lost,count-role;target&losses;3:=disappointed.png,Hmm? Three in a row? Are you <i>trying</i> to lose? I'll have you know, I don't appreciate you removing the challenge of it all.
6-opponent_lost,count-role;target&losses;3:=disappointed.png,Hmm? Three in a row? Are you <i>trying</i> to lose? I'll have you know, I was hoping you would make this at least a <i>little</i> challenging for me.
6-opponent_lost,priority:70,count-alive:2=happy.png,And the victor is: Cynthia! For a second there, I thought I lost.
6-opponent_lost,count-not_lost_some&adventurer&role;target:=happy.png,Ah, an adventurer. I remember when I used to go to adventures when I was a kid. Filling up my pokedex was hard work, but very fulfilling.
6-opponent_lost,count-not_lost_some&adventurer&role;target:=fingerup.png,So do you explore caves and such, ~name~? I used to explore those for fun when I was a kid, but now I do it as part of my archaeological studies.
6-opponent_lost,count-not_lost_some&adventurer&role;target:=happy.png,I suddenly recall that I used to go on trips to other regions just to fill up my pokedex. Ah, to be a kid again!
6-opponent_lost,oneShotId:54,count-not_lost_some&blue_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-short_hair&character;human:=disappointed.png,Your hair reminds me of Team Galactic grunts, ~player~. Not exactly the type of memories I'd want to remember in a time like this... or ever. 
6-opponent_lost,oneShotId:54,count-not_lost_some&blue_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-short_hair&character;human:=fingerup.png,Blue ear-length hair... Ever heard of Team Galactic, ~player~? The group that tried to destroy the Sinnoh region? They all had that same hairstyle for some reason.
6-opponent_lost,oneShotId:54,count-not_lost_some&blue_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-short_hair&character;human:=surprised.png,That hairstyle... it's so emblematic of Team Galactic grunts... Oh, don't worry, I know you're not one of them.
6-opponent_lost,oneShotId:50,count-male&long_hair&role;target&character;human:=battleready.png,It's pretty rare meeting a man with hair as long as yours, ~player~. I suppose the haircare is just the same.
6-opponent_lost,oneShotId:50,count-male&long_hair&role;target&character;human:=fingerup.png,Is long hair the norm for men of your culture, ~player~? That's pretty rare indeed, even looking back at past cultures.
6-opponent_lost,oneShotId:51,count-male&long_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-ginger&character;human:=excited.png,Oh, forgive me for staring, ~player~! Your appearance reminded me of Alder, the Champion of the Unova League... Wait, is he still the Champion? 
6-opponent_lost,oneShotId:51,count-male&long_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-ginger&character;human:=sarcastic.png,Alder?!... Silly me, I momentarily forgot that you were there, ~player~. My head is in the clouds again. I was just surprised by the uncanny resemblance.
6-opponent_lost,oneShotId:51,count-male&long_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-ginger&character;human:=sarcastic.png,For a split second there, I thought you were Alder, ~player~. You're just the second long red-haired man I've ever met.
6-opponent_lost,count-male&role;target&losses;3:=frustrated.png,That's three losses in a row, ~name~; I'll have you know, if this was all just a stunt to masturbate in front of me, I am <i>not</i> impressed!
6-opponent_lost,count-male&role;target&losses;3:=frustrated.png,That's three losses in a row, ~name~; I'll have you know, if this was all just an excuse to masturbate in front of me, I am <i>not</i> impressed!
6-opponent_lost,count-male&role;target&losses;3:=frustrated.png,Are you <i>trying</i> to lose, ~name~? I do <i>not</i> take kindly to perverts taking any opportunity they can to fondle themselves in front of me!
6-opponent_lost,count-male&role;target&losses;3:=aggressive.png,Ha, it looks like you're <i>trying</i> to lose, ~name~. You wouldn't be the first guy to want to expose himself in front of me.
6-opponent_lost,oneShotId:47,count-male&medium_hair&role;target&character;human:=battleready.png,Your hair is getting quite long, ~player~. Not to intrude on your space, but I think you might look better with shorter hair.
6-opponent_lost,oneShotId:47,count-male&medium_hair&role;target&character;human:=excited.png,It's not often I meet men with hair that long. I bet you'd look more handsome with your hair cut short, if you want my advice, ~player~.
6-opponent_lost,oneShotId:46,count-not_lost_some&red_eyes&role;target&character;human:=surprised.png,Your... your eyes are red, ~player~. Do you have sore eyes? I have some eyedrops you can borrow.
6-opponent_lost,oneShotId:46,count-not_lost_some&red_eyes&role;target&character;human:=surprised.png,Are your eyes okay, ~player~? They seem unnaturally reddened.
6-opponent_lost,oneShotId:45,count-not_lost_some&female&tall&role;target&character;human:,count-blonde&character;human:,test:~human.tag.fair-skinned~:true=sarcastic.png,Oh, ~player~! We look so much alike that we could pass off as twins. Our resemblance is uncanny.
6-opponent_lost,oneShotId:45,count-not_lost_some&female&tall&role;target&character;human:,count-blonde&character;human:,test:~human.tag.fair-skinned~:true=surprised.png,Are we long lost twins, ~player~? No wonder the dealer asked me about my sister.
6-opponent_lost,oneShotId:45,count-not_lost_some&female&tall&role;target&character;human:,count-blonde&character;human:,test:~human.tag.fair-skinned~:true=excited.png,Wow, ~player~, we look so much alike that you might as well be my doppelganger.
6-opponent_lost,oneShotId:43,count-not_lost_some&male&tall&role;target&character;human:,count-blonde&character;human:,test:~human.tag.fair-skinned~:true=sarcastic.png,Oh, ~player~! We look so much alike that we could pass off as brother and sister! That would be awkward in a game like this, though.
6-opponent_lost,oneShotId:43,count-not_lost_some&male&tall&role;target&character;human:,count-blonde&character;human:,test:~human.tag.fair-skinned~:true=surprised.png,Are we long lost siblings, ~player~? No wonder the dealer asked me about that.
6-opponent_lost,oneShotId:53,count-female&very_long_hair&role;target&character;human:=surprised.png,That's the longest hair I've seen from a person... How do you manage to take care of hair that long, ~player~?
6-opponent_lost,oneShotId:53,count-female&very_long_hair&role;target&character;human:=shocked.png,Your hair looks like you could accidentally step on it, ~player~! I can't imagine how annoying it would be to accidentally step on my own hair.
6-opponent_lost,oneShotId:52,count-male&very_long_hair&role;target&character;human:=surprised.png,I can't believe how long your hair is, ~player~! It's even longer than mine!
6-opponent_lost,oneShotId:52,count-male&very_long_hair&role;target&character;human:=surprised.png,Alright, this is a new one for me. I don't think I've ever seen a man with hair that reaches the floor. Women, sure, but never a man.
6-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:59,count-not_lost_some&blue_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-short_hair&character;human:=aggressive.png,They not only wanted to destroy the Sinnoh region, but the entire world. Thank goodness I managed to close the portal before things got worst.
6-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:59,count-not_lost_some&blue_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-short_hair&character;human:=aggressive.png,Long story short, they opened a portal to another dimension, and I had to venture inside to convince the Legendary Pokémon living inside to close it.
6-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:59,count-not_lost_some&blue_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-short_hair&character;human:=aggressive.png,Long story short, they enslaved two Legendary Pokémon to create a new universe, but I managed to break the chains they were using, closing off the portal to the other universe.
6-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:57,count-male&long_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-ginger&character;human:=horny.png,I still remember when Alder tried to ask me out to a date. I wouldn't mind if you did the same, ~name~.
6-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:57,count-male&long_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-ginger&character;human:=horny.png,It felt very creepy when Alder would flirt with me, but I don't see anything wrong with you flirting with me.
6-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:57,count-male&long_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-ginger&character;human:=horny.png,I don't know if you eat out alone all the time like Alder, but I can fix that problem if that is the case.
6-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:55,count-not_lost_some&tall&role;target&character;human:,count-blonde&character;human:,test:~human.tag.fair-skinned~:true=embarrassed.png,I am 100% positive than we are not siblings at all... Okay, more like 95%, but what are the odds of that happening, right?
6-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:55,count-not_lost_some&tall&role;target&character;human:,count-blonde&character;human:,test:~human.tag.fair-skinned~:true=thinking.png,Come to think of it, there's no way we're related, right? I'm pretty sure I've heard of similar stories before, but this can't possibly be the case here.
6-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:55,count-not_lost_some&tall&role;target&character;human:,count-blonde&character;human:,test:~human.tag.fair-skinned~:true=contemplative.png,The odds of two long-lost siblings running across each other at a strip poker game has to be astronomically low... that can't be what's going on here.
6-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:60,count-not_lost_some&blue_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-short_hair&character;human:=fingerup.png,Oh, look at that! I've been monologuing again! But to end my story, Team Galactic is not a threat anymore, and the world is safe again.
6-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:60,count-not_lost_some&blue_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-short_hair&character;human:=sarcastic.png,Just look at me rambling on and on! Anyhow, that's the end of that story. No need to dwell too much in the past.
6-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:60,count-not_lost_some&blue_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-short_hair&character;human:=excited.png,Oh, sorry about talking non-stop there. I almost forgot we were playing a game here. Anyway, let's start the next round then.
6-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:58,count-male&long_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-ginger&character;human:=embarrassed.png,Not that I'm telling you to ask me out, but I wouldn't oppose the idea either.
6-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:58,count-male&long_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-ginger&character;human:=embarrassed.png,I'm not forcing you to ask me out or anything like that. It's still up to your discretion.
6-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:58,count-male&long_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-ginger&character;human:=sarcastic.png,Well, I'll just let you process all of that.., and the fact that you just lost.
6-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:56,count-not_lost_some&tall&role;target&character;human:,count-blonde&character;human:,test:~human.tag.fair-skinned~:true=fingerup.png,Oh, there I am musing to myself again! But to sum it up, we're not siblings, and we just happen to look alike. By the way, nice to meet you, ~player~!
6-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:56,count-not_lost_some&tall&role;target&character;human:,count-blonde&character;human:,test:~human.tag.fair-skinned~:true=happy.png,My, I got lost in my thoughts again! I hope you understood what I just said, ~player~. Now, let's just enjoy this game from now on.
6-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:56,count-not_lost_some&tall&role;target&character;human:,count-blonde&character;human:,test:~human.tag.fair-skinned~:true=fingerup.png,There we are, statistical proof that this isn't already weirder than it already is! We can just sit back and watch this game unfold.
6-opponent_chest_will_be_visible,target:chihiro,id:52=sarcastic.png,Huh? Chihiro? Are you running away from the fight?
6-opponent_chest_will_be_visible,target:chihiro,id:52=aggressive.png,Huh? Chihiro? You can't run from your fears; you gotta stand up and confront them!
6-opponent_chest_will_be_visible,target:chihiro,id:52=disappointed.png,Huh? Chihiro? Are you... quitting? Right when we're getting to the fun part too...
6-opponent_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;chihiro:,count-male:0-1,test:~background.time~:day,id:6=excited.png,Oh! After I saw that there were no men around, I had given up hope of seeing any penises today; you could say that this was a pleasant surprise!
6-opponent_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;chihiro:,count-male:0-1,test:~background.time~:night,id:5=excited.png,Oh! After I saw that there were no men around, I had given up hope of seeing any penises tonight; you could say that this was a pleasant surprise!
6-opponent_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;chihiro:,test:~background.time~:day,id:4=sarcastic.png,Oh? Huh... That's strange... I'm normally into men, but I guess you... weren't on my radar... Sorry! Heh.
6-opponent_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;chihiro:,test:~background.time~:day,id:4=embarrassed.png,Oh, so you're a... man... I was hoping I would see a man naked today, but I guess you... don't seem to count, in my mind... Sorry...
6-opponent_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;chihiro:,test:~background.time~:night,id:3=sarcastic.png,Oh? Huh... That's strange... I'm normally into men, but I guess you... weren't on my radar... Sorry! Heh.
6-opponent_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;chihiro:,test:~background.time~:night,id:3=embarrassed.png,Oh, so you're a... man... I was hoping to see a man naked tonight, but I guess you... don't seem to count, in my mind... Sorry...
6-opponent_crotch_is_visible,count-male&pubic_hair&role;target&character;human:=disappointed.png,Aww, I was hoping you'd been shaved, ~player~. That's kind of disappointing.
6-opponent_crotch_is_visible,count-male&pubic_hair&role;target&character;human:=disappointed.png,I know some people prefer some hair <i>down there</i>, but I didn't expect you to be the same, ~player~.
6-opponent_crotch_is_visible,count-male&pubic_hair&role;target&character;human:=furious.png,Don't you know that pubic hair is unclean, ~player~. What's even the point of keeping all that hair?!
6-opponent_crotch_is_visible,count-male&pubic_hair&role;target&character;human:=embarrassed.png,That looks quite... unkempt, ~player~. I was hoping you were looking after your hygiene.
6-opponent_start_masturbating,oneShotId:36,count-tandem&role;target:=surprised.png,Oh, you're allowed to... have sex in this game?
6-opponent_start_masturbating,oneShotId:36,count-tandem&role;target:=surprised.png,You're masturbating with a partner?... That's not really masturbation, is it?
6-opponent_start_masturbating,oneShotId:36,count-tandem&role;target:=surprised.png,Is that allowed? I thought we were only limited to masturbation for the forfeit?
6-opponent_start_masturbating,count-tentacle_forfeit&role;target:=shocked.png,Where did that thing even come from?!

7-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:58,count-male&long_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-ginger&character;human:=sarcastic.png,Well, I'll just let you process all of that.., and the fact that you just lost.
7-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:56,count-not_lost_some&tall&role;target&character;human:,count-blonde&character;human:,test:~human.tag.fair-skinned~:true=fingerup.png,Oh, there I am musing to myself again!

7-opponent_chest_will_be_visible,target:chihiro,id:52=aggressive.png,Huh? Chihiro? You can't run from your fears; you gotta stand up and confront them!

7-opponent_crotch_is_visible,count-male&pubic_hair&role;target&character;human:=disappointed.png,Aww, I was hoping you'd been shaved, ~player~. That's kind of disappointing.
7-opponent_crotch_is_visible,count-male&pubic_hair&role;target&character;human:=disappointed.png,I know some people prefer some hair <i>down there</i>, but I didn't expect you to be the same, ~player~.
7-opponent_crotch_is_visible,count-male&pubic_hair&role;target&character;human:=furious.png,Don't you know that pubic hair is unclean, ~player~. What's even the point of keeping all that hair?!
7-opponent_crotch_is_visible,count-male&pubic_hair&role;target&character;human:=embarrassed.png,That looks quite... unkempt, ~player~. I was hoping you were looking after your hygiene.
7-opponent_start_masturbating,oneShotId:36,count-tandem&role;target:=surprised.png,Oh, you're allowed to... have sex in this game?
7-opponent_start_masturbating,oneShotId:36,count-tandem&role;target:=surprised.png,You're masturbating with a partner?... That's not really masturbation, is it?
7-opponent_start_masturbating,oneShotId:36,count-tandem&role;target:=surprised.png,Is that allowed? I thought we were only limited to masturbation for the forfeit?

7-opponent_start_masturbating,oneShotId:35,count-uses_toy&role;target:=surprised.png,Wait, we were allowed to use toys during our forfeit? I don't remember that option.
7-opponent_start_masturbating,oneShotId:35,count-uses_toy&role;target:=disappointed.png,Come to think of it, I don't recall any rules against using equipment like that... I wish I had thought of that.

-3-opponent_lost,count-role;target&losses;3:=disappointed.png,Hmm? Three in a row? Are you <i>trying</i> to lose? I'll have you know, I was hoping you would make this at least a <i>little</i> challenging for me.
-3-opponent_lost,priority:70,count-alive:2=happy.png,And the victor is: Cynthia! For a second there, I thought I lost.
-3-opponent_lost,count-not_lost_some&adventurer&role;target:=happy.png,Ah, an adventurer. I remember when I used to go to adventures when I was a kid. Filling up my pokedex was hard work, but very fulfilling.
-3-opponent_lost,count-not_lost_some&adventurer&role;target:=fingerup.png,So do you explore caves and such, ~name~? I used to explore those for fun when I was a kid, but now I do it as part of my archaeological studies.
-3-opponent_lost,count-not_lost_some&adventurer&role;target:=happy.png,I suddenly recall that I used to go on trips to other regions just to fill up my pokedex. Ah, to be a kid again!
-3-opponent_lost,oneShotId:54,count-not_lost_some&blue_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-short_hair&character;human:=disappointed.png,Your hair reminds me of Team Galactic grunts, ~player~. Not exactly the type of memories I'd want to remember in a time like this... or ever. 
-3-opponent_lost,oneShotId:54,count-not_lost_some&blue_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-short_hair&character;human:=fingerup.png,Blue ear-length hair... Ever heard of Team Galactic, ~player~? The group that tried to destroy the Sinnoh region? They all had that same hairstyle for some reason.
-3-opponent_lost,oneShotId:54,count-not_lost_some&blue_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-short_hair&character;human:=surprised.png,That hairstyle... it's so emblematic of Team Galactic grunts... Oh, don't worry, I know you're not one of them.
-3-opponent_lost,oneShotId:50,count-male&long_hair&role;target&character;human:=battleready.png,It's pretty rare meeting a man with hair as long as yours, ~player~. I suppose the haircare is just the same.
-3-opponent_lost,oneShotId:50,count-male&long_hair&role;target&character;human:=fingerup.png,Is long hair the norm for men of your culture, ~player~? That's pretty rare indeed, even looking back at past cultures.
-3-opponent_lost,oneShotId:51,count-male&long_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-ginger&character;human:=excited.png,Oh, forgive me for staring, ~player~! Your appearance reminded me of Alder, the Champion of the Unova League... Wait, is he still the Champion?

-3-opponent_lost,count-male&role;target&losses;3:=frustrated.png,Are you <i>trying</i> to lose, ~name~? I do <i>not</i> take kindly to perverts taking any opportunity they can to fondle themselves in front of me!
-3-opponent_lost,count-male&role;target&losses;3:=aggressive.png,Ha, it looks like you're <i>trying</i> to lose, ~name~. You wouldn't be the first guy to want to expose himself in front of me.
-3-opponent_lost,oneShotId:47,count-male&medium_hair&role;target&character;human:=battleready.png,Your hair is getting quite long, ~player~. Not to intrude on your space, but I think you might look better with shorter hair.
-3-opponent_lost,oneShotId:47,count-male&medium_hair&role;target&character;human:=excited.png,It's not often I meet men with hair that long. I bet you'd look more handsome with your hair cut short, if you want my advice, ~player~.
-3-opponent_lost,oneShotId:46,count-not_lost_some&red_eyes&role;target&character;human:=surprised.png,Your... your eyes are red, ~player~. Do you have sore eyes? I have some eyedrops you can borrow.
-3-opponent_lost,oneShotId:46,count-not_lost_some&red_eyes&role;target&character;human:=surprised.png,Are your eyes okay, ~player~? They seem unnaturally reddened.
-3-opponent_lost,oneShotId:45,count-not_lost_some&female&tall&role;target&character;human:,count-blonde&character;human:,test:~human.tag.fair-skinned~:true=sarcastic.png,Oh, ~player~! We look so much alike that we could pass off as twins. Our resemblance is uncanny.
-3-opponent_lost,oneShotId:45,count-not_lost_some&female&tall&role;target&character;human:,count-blonde&character;human:,test:~human.tag.fair-skinned~:true=surprised.png,Are we long lost twins, ~player~? No wonder the dealer asked me about my sister.
-3-opponent_lost,oneShotId:45,count-not_lost_some&female&tall&role;target&character;human:,count-blonde&character;human:,test:~human.tag.fair-skinned~:true=excited.png,Wow, ~player~, we look so much alike that you might as well be my doppelganger.

-3-opponent_lost,oneShotId:43,count-not_lost_some&male&tall&role;target&character;human:,count-blonde&character;human:,test:~human.tag.fair-skinned~:true=surprised.png,Are we long lost siblings, ~player~? No wonder the dealer asked me about that.
-3-opponent_lost,oneShotId:53,count-female&very_long_hair&role;target&character;human:=surprised.png,That's the longest hair I've seen from a person... How do you manage to take care of hair that long, ~player~?
-3-opponent_lost,oneShotId:53,count-female&very_long_hair&role;target&character;human:=shocked.png,Your hair looks like you could accidentally step on it, ~player~! I can't imagine how annoying it would be to accidentally step on my own hair.
-3-opponent_lost,oneShotId:52,count-male&very_long_hair&role;target&character;human:=surprised.png,I can't believe how long your hair is, ~player~! It's even longer than mine!
-3-opponent_lost,oneShotId:52,count-male&very_long_hair&role;target&character;human:=surprised.png,Alright, this is a new one for me. I don't think I've ever seen a man with hair that reaches the floor. Women, sure, but never a man.
-3-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:59,count-not_lost_some&blue_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-short_hair&character;human:=aggressive.png,They not only wanted to destroy the Sinnoh region, but the entire world. Thank goodness I managed to close the portal before things got worst.
-3-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:59,count-not_lost_some&blue_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-short_hair&character;human:=aggressive.png,Long story short, they opened a portal to another dimension, and I had to venture inside to convince the Legendary Pokémon living inside to close it.
-3-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:59,count-not_lost_some&blue_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-short_hair&character;human:=aggressive.png,Long story short, they enslaved two Legendary Pokémon to create a new universe, but I managed to break the chains they were using, closing off the portal to the other universe.
-3-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:57,count-male&long_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-ginger&character;human:=horny.png,I still remember when Alder tried to ask me out to a date. I wouldn't mind if you did the same, ~name~.

-2-opponent_lost,oneShotId:46,count-not_lost_some&red_eyes&role;target&character;human:=surprised.png,Your... your eyes are red, ~player~. Do you have sore eyes? I have some eyedrops you can borrow.
-2-opponent_lost,oneShotId:46,count-not_lost_some&red_eyes&role;target&character;human:=surprised.png,Are your eyes okay, ~player~? They seem unnaturally reddened.
-2-opponent_lost,oneShotId:45,count-not_lost_some&female&tall&role;target&character;human:,count-blonde&character;human:,test:~human.tag.fair-skinned~:true=sarcastic.png,Oh, ~player~! We look so much alike that we could pass off as twins. Our resemblance is uncanny.
-2-opponent_lost,oneShotId:45,count-not_lost_some&female&tall&role;target&character;human:,count-blonde&character;human:,test:~human.tag.fair-skinned~:true=surprised.png,Are we long lost twins, ~player~? No wonder the dealer asked me about my sister.
-2-opponent_lost,oneShotId:45,count-not_lost_some&female&tall&role;target&character;human:,count-blonde&character;human:,test:~human.tag.fair-skinned~:true=excited.png,Wow, ~player~, we look so much alike that you might as well be my doppelganger.
-2-opponent_lost,oneShotId:43,count-not_lost_some&male&tall&role;target&character;human:,count-blonde&character;human:,test:~human.tag.fair-skinned~:true=sarcastic.png,Oh, ~player~! We look so much alike that we could pass off as brother and sister! That would be awkward in a game like this, though.

-2-opponent_lost,oneShotId:53,count-female&very_long_hair&role;target&character;human:=shocked.png,Your hair looks like you could accidentally step on it, ~player~! I can't imagine how annoying it would be to accidentally step on my own hair.
-2-opponent_lost,oneShotId:52,count-male&very_long_hair&role;target&character;human:=surprised.png,I can't believe how long your hair is, ~player~! It's even longer than mine!
-2-opponent_lost,oneShotId:52,count-male&very_long_hair&role;target&character;human:=surprised.png,Alright, this is a new one for me. I don't think I've ever seen a man with hair that reaches the floor. Women, sure, but never a man.
-2-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:59,count-not_lost_some&blue_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-short_hair&character;human:=aggressive.png,They not only wanted to destroy the Sinnoh region, but the entire world. Thank goodness I managed to close the portal before things got worst.
-2-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:59,count-not_lost_some&blue_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-short_hair&character;human:=aggressive.png,Long story short, they opened a portal to another dimension, and I had to venture inside to convince the Legendary Pokémon living inside to close it.
-2-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:59,count-not_lost_some&blue_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-short_hair&character;human:=aggressive.png,Long story short, they enslaved two Legendary Pokémon to create a new universe, but I managed to break the chains they were using, closing off the portal to the other universe.
-2-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:57,count-male&long_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-ginger&character;human:=horny.png,I still remember when Alder tried to ask me out to a date. I wouldn't mind if you did the same, ~name~.

-2-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:57,count-male&long_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-ginger&character;human:=horny.png,I don't know if you eat out alone all the time like Alder, but I can fix that problem if that is the case.

-2-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:55,count-not_lost_some&tall&role;target&character;human:,count-blonde&character;human:,test:~human.tag.fair-skinned~:true=thinking.png,Come to think of it, there's no way we're related, right? I'm pretty sure I've heard of similar stories before, but this can't possibly be the case here.
-2-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:55,count-not_lost_some&tall&role;target&character;human:,count-blonde&character;human:,test:~human.tag.fair-skinned~:true=contemplative.png,The odds of two long-lost siblings running across each other at a strip poker game has to be astronomically low... that can't be what's going on here.

-2-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:60,count-not_lost_some&blue_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-short_hair&character;human:=sarcastic.png,Just look at me rambling on and on! Anyhow, that's the end of that story. No need to dwell too much in the past.
-2-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:60,count-not_lost_some&blue_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-short_hair&character;human:=excited.png,Oh, sorry about talking non-stop there. I almost forgot we were playing a game here. Anyway, let's start the next round then.
-2-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:58,count-male&long_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-ginger&character;human:=embarrassed.png,Not that I'm telling you to ask me out, but I wouldn't oppose the idea either.
-2-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:58,count-male&long_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-ginger&character;human:=embarrassed.png,I'm not forcing you to ask me out or anything like that. It's still up to your discretion.
-2-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:58,count-male&long_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-ginger&character;human:=sarcastic.png,Well, I'll just let you process all of that.., and the fact that you just lost.
-2-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:56,count-not_lost_some&tall&role;target&character;human:,count-blonde&character;human:,test:~human.tag.fair-skinned~:true=fingerup.png,Oh, there I am musing to myself again! But to sum it up, we're not siblings, and we just happen to look alike. By the way, nice to meet you, ~player~!
-2-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:56,count-not_lost_some&tall&role;target&character;human:,count-blonde&character;human:,test:~human.tag.fair-skinned~:true=happy.png,My, I got lost in my thoughts again! I hope you understood what I just said, ~player~. Now, let's just enjoy this game from now on.
-2-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:56,count-not_lost_some&tall&role;target&character;human:,count-blonde&character;human:,test:~human.tag.fair-skinned~:true=fingerup.png,There we are, statistical proof that this isn't already weirder than it already is! We can just sit back and watch this game unfold.

-2-opponent_chest_will_be_visible,target:chihiro,id:52=aggressive.png,Huh? Chihiro? You can't run from your fears; you gotta stand up and confront them!

-2-opponent_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;chihiro:,count-male:0-1,test:~background.time~:day,id:6=excited.png,Oh! After I saw that there were no men around, I had given up hope of seeing any penises today; you could say that this was a pleasant surprise!

-2-opponent_crotch_is_visible,count-male&pubic_hair&role;target&character;human:=disappointed.png,Aww, I was hoping you'd been shaved, ~player~. That's kind of disappointing.
-2-opponent_crotch_is_visible,count-male&pubic_hair&role;target&character;human:=disappointed.png,I know some people prefer some hair <i>down there</i>, but I didn't expect you to be the same, ~player~.
-2-opponent_crotch_is_visible,count-male&pubic_hair&role;target&character;human:=furious.png,Don't you know that pubic hair is unclean, ~player~. What's even the point of keeping all that hair?!
-2-opponent_crotch_is_visible,count-male&pubic_hair&role;target&character;human:=embarrassed.png,That looks quite... unkempt, ~player~. I was hoping you were looking after your hygiene.
-2-opponent_start_masturbating,oneShotId:36,count-tandem&role;target:=surprised.png,Oh, you're allowed to... have sex in this game?
-2-opponent_start_masturbating,oneShotId:36,count-tandem&role;target:=surprised.png,You're masturbating with a partner?... That's not really masturbation, is it?
-2-opponent_start_masturbating,oneShotId:36,count-tandem&role;target:=surprised.png,Is that allowed? I thought we were only limited to masturbation for the forfeit?
-2-opponent_start_masturbating,count-tentacle_forfeit&role;target:=shocked.png,Where did that thing even come from?!
-2-opponent_start_masturbating,oneShotId:35,count-uses_toy&role;target:=surprised.png,Wait, we were allowed to use toys during our forfeit? I don't remember that option.
-2-opponent_start_masturbating,oneShotId:35,count-uses_toy&role;target:=disappointed.png,Come to think of it, I don't recall any rules against using equipment like that... I wish I had thought of that.

-1-opponent_lost,oneShotId:50,count-male&long_hair&role;target&character;human:=battleready.png,It's pretty rare meeting a man with hair as long as yours, ~player~. I suppose the haircare is just the same.
-1-opponent_lost,oneShotId:50,count-male&long_hair&role;target&character;human:=fingerup.png,Is long hair the norm for men of your culture, ~player~? That's pretty rare indeed, even looking back at past cultures.
-1-opponent_lost,oneShotId:51,count-male&long_hair&role;target&character;human:,count-ginger&character;human:=excited.png,Oh, forgive me for staring, ~player~! Your appearance reminded me of Alder, the Champion of the Unova League... Wait, is he still the Champion?

#OPPONENT MASTURBATING
#When an opponent is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must pay the penalty by masturbating in front of everyone.
#The "must_masturbate" line is for just before it happens, and the "start_masturbating" line immediately follows.
#The "masturbating" line will be spoken a little after the opponent has started but before they climax.
#When the opponent climaxes, your character will say the "finished_masturbating" line.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written
male_heavy_masturbating=excited.png,Your breaths have become forced and uneven, ~name~. Are you close to finishing?
male_heavy_masturbating=surprised.png,Does speeding it up really make the orgasm more intense for men? That's not at all how it works for women; we prefer a steady pace.
male_heavy_masturbating=sarcastic.png,Ooh, your body language has changed, ~name~. You must be very close to an orgasm.
male_heavy_masturbating=excited.png,Is it just me, or is your penis pulsing...? Oh, I get it! It's about to release!
male_finished_masturbating=excited.png,Ah! Th-the seeds of creation-- they've been spilled all over!
male_finished_masturbating=excited.png,Huhah! That's the spoils of victory!
male_finished_masturbating=surprised.png,Ah, y-your seed, I-I... I guess I <i>knew</i> this was coming, but it comes across as such a shock!
male_finished_masturbating=surprised.png,Oh! It's... a lot more than I expected.
male_finished_masturbating=aggressive.png,Is it true that semen can stain clothes? Is that why men get naked when masturbating?
male_finished_masturbating=sarcastic.png,The fluid for creating human life... and you just spilled it all over yourself. Not exactly the most prudent use of resources, is it?
male_finished_masturbating=disappointed.png,It really just spurts out like that? I thought it would look more elegant than that.
male_finished_masturbating=sarcastic.png,That looks tough to clean. No wonder they warned against getting some of it on my clothes.
male_finished_masturbating=happy.png,I'm just glad you didn't get any of your semen on my clothes. Dry cleaning are so expensive nowadays.
female_masturbating=happy.png,This isn't the kind of thing I'm normally interested in, but I don't mind it either.

female_masturbating=thinking.png,<i>(~name~ is really enjoying this. I wonder if she lost on purpose.)</i>
female_masturbating=embarrassed.png,<i>(Would it be creepy if I watch her? Where else can I learn masturbation techniques aside from this?)</i>
female_masturbating=fingerup.png,I can see why men are so eager about female sexuality.
female_heavy_masturbating=excited.png,Your breaths have become forced and uneven, ~name~. Are you close to finishing?
female_heavy_masturbating=excited.png,Ooh, your body language has changed, ~name~. You must be very close to an orgasm.

0-male_start_masturbating=sarcastic.png,I still remember the first time I saw a pottery painting of a masturbating man. It took me too long to realize that he wasn't stabbing himself.
0-male_start_masturbating=excited.png,What hand techniques are you going to use, ~name~? This is quite a fascinating way of learning about male masturbation.
0-male_start_masturbating,weight:0.2=fingerup.png,You don't mind if I watch, do you? A researcher like myself is always curious to observe the unknown.
0-male_start_masturbating,weight:0.2=fingerup.png,Looks like it's time to get started, ~name~. Mind if I take notes?

0-male_start_masturbating,weight:0.2=horny.png,I can't help but be interested, ~name~; I'm quite unfamiliar with the techniques guys use on their equipment.

0-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;winner:=aggressive.png,I'm the Sinnoh League champion; I <i>know</i> how a real winner does it, Guzma.
0-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;winner:=sarcastic.png,<i>A real winner?</i> Come on, Guzma, less joking, more stroking!
0-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;winner:=sarcastic.png,<i>A real winner?</i> Come on, Guzma, fewer jokes, more stroke!

0-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kazuma:,id:117=thinking.png,Huh? It grew? But I thought... if it's that small flaccid... Surely there's some foolery here with surface area to volume ratios at play, right?

0-male_masturbating=fingerup.png,Did you know that there is a creation story where God created the sky by masturbating at a river? Every star in the sky is a drop of semen apparently. 
0-male_masturbating=fingerup.png,The male masturbation techniques have remained almost the same throughout the millennia. Some of the pottery shards we found attests to this.
0-male_masturbating=surprised.png,It seems so primal, so aggressive... it's somewhat difficult to understand that something so rough could be so pleasurable.
0-male_masturbating=scowling.png,...Why are you staring at me, ~name~? It's not like I have anything to show you while I'm dressed modestly like this.
0-male_masturbating=surprised.png,It looks so forced and laborious. How do you concentrate while doing that, ~name~?

0-male_masturbating,weight:0.6=fingerup.png,I've studied a lot of ancient paintings, but if truth be told, the pornographic etchings were always my favorite...
0-male_masturbating,weight:0.6=sarcastic.png,Your face... it's also the same face that some trainers would make in the heat of the battle. I suppose the excitement is just the same.
0-male_masturbating,weight:0.6=excited.png,What exactly do you focus at when you're masturbating, ~name~? The face? Breasts? The female figure? Or just the act of being with a woman?
0-male_masturbating,weight:0.6=sarcastic.png,Is it true that single men masturbate all the time? Based on your apparent experience, I'd wager that you've been single all your life, ~name~.
0-male_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Hahaha! Ah, I remember at the start of this match when you seemed so cocksure about this game! Now look at you, Guzma...
0-male_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Where's the cocksure attitude of yours now, Guzma?
0-male_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Hahaha! Guzma, remember when you thought you were going to beat us all in this game?
0-male_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;rigged:=battleready.png,Rigged? It seems making excuses run in your organization.
0-male_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;rigged:=battleready.png,Rigged? A man of honor would admit to his shortcomings; nonetheless, I am not surprised to see such remarks, coming from you.
0-male_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;rigged:=battleready.png,You're making excuses, Guzma; you can never grow stronger if you do not learn from your defeats.
0-male_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;rigged:=battleready.png,You'd grow as a player, <i>and</i> as a trainer, if you'd acknowledge your losses and learn from them, Guzma.

0-male_heavy_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Getting close to the end, are we Guzma?
0-male_heavy_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,You've picked up the intensity, Guzma... Getting close?
0-male_heavy_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,You've picked up the intensity, Guzma... Almost there?
0-male_heavy_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,You're picking up the pace there, Guzma; almost done?
0-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Hhgn... So that's the finale, then?
0-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Hhgn... So all of this build up for that?
0-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Hhgn... Oh, don't mind me; I was just expecting something a little more fierce from Guzma.
0-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=contemplative.png,Ha, so that's the climax? <i>(It was a little underwhelming for someone like Guzma.)</i>
0-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=contemplative.png,Ha, so that's the climax? <i>(You'd think that with Guzma, it might be a little more remarkable)</i>

0-female_must_masturbate=fingerup.png,You didn't even make me break a sweat, ~name~. No worries, I'm sure you'll come back stronger if you play again. There's a lot to be learned from defeats.
0-female_must_masturbate=happy.png,It seems poker isn't your forte, ~name~. Not that it really matters since this game relies heavily on luck. You can do everything right and still lose heavily.

0-female_must_masturbate=surprised.png,Oh, it's time for your forfeit already? What happened, ~name~? It's not like I'm a grandmaster at poker.

0-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;starfire:=happy.png,Being able to levitate like that while you masturbate must give you so much more control.

0-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;elizabeth:,id:119=disappointed.png,Is that... lesbian sex, or... <i>masturbation...</i>

1-male_start_masturbating=excited.png,What hand techniques are you going to use, ~name~? This is quite a fascinating way of learning about male masturbation.
1-male_start_masturbating,weight:0.2=fingerup.png,You don't mind if I watch, do you? A researcher like myself is always curious to observe the unknown.
1-male_start_masturbating,weight:0.2=fingerup.png,Looks like it's time to get started, ~name~. Mind if I take notes?
1-male_start_masturbating,weight:0.2=fingerup.png,Looks like it's time to get started, ~name~. Mind if I record my observations?

1-male_start_masturbating,weight:0.2=embarrassed.png,I can't help but be interested, ~name~. Would peeking be inappropriate?
1-male_start_masturbating,weight:0.2=horny.png,I can't help but be interested, ~name~; I'm quite unfamiliar with the techniques guys use on their equipment.

1-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kazuma:,id:117=thinking.png,Huh? It grew? But I thought... if it's that small flaccid... Surely there's some foolery here with surface area to volume ratios at play, right?

1-male_masturbating=fingerup.png,Did you know that there is a creation story where God created the sky by masturbating at a river? Every star in the sky is a drop of semen apparently. 
1-male_masturbating=fingerup.png,The male masturbation techniques have remained almost the same throughout the millennia. Some of the pottery shards we found attests to this.
1-male_masturbating=surprised.png,It seems so primal, so aggressive... it's somewhat difficult to understand that something so rough could be so pleasurable.
1-male_masturbating=scowling.png,...Why are you staring at me, ~name~? It's not like I have anything to show you while I'm dressed modestly like this.
1-male_masturbating=surprised.png,It looks so forced and laborious. How do you concentrate while doing that, ~name~?
1-male_masturbating=surprised.png,I was expecting that to be a bit less... work intensive. I fail to understand how that could be relaxing.

1-male_masturbating,weight:0.6=fingerup.png,I've studied a lot of ancient paintings, but if truth be told, the pornographic etchings were always my favorite...
1-male_masturbating,weight:0.6=sarcastic.png,Your face... it's also the same face that some trainers would make in the heat of the battle. I suppose the excitement is just the same.
1-male_masturbating,weight:0.6=excited.png,What exactly do you focus at when you're masturbating, ~name~? The face? Breasts? The female figure? Or just the act of being with a woman?
1-male_masturbating,weight:0.6=sarcastic.png,Is it true that single men masturbate all the time? Based on your apparent experience, I'd wager that you've been single all your life, ~name~.
1-male_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Hahaha! Ah, I remember at the start of this match when you seemed so cocksure about this game! Now look at you, Guzma...

1-male_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Hahaha! Guzma, remember when you thought you were going to beat us all in this game?
1-male_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;rigged:=battleready.png,Rigged? It seems making excuses run in your organization.
1-male_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;rigged:=battleready.png,Rigged? A man of honor would admit to his shortcomings; nonetheless, I am not surprised to see such remarks, coming from you.
1-male_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;rigged:=battleready.png,You're making excuses, Guzma; you can never grow stronger if you do not learn from your defeats.
1-male_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;rigged:=battleready.png,You'd grow as a player, <i>and</i> as a trainer, if you'd acknowledge your losses and learn from them, Guzma.
1-male_masturbating,priority:466,count-role;target&character;n&timeinstage;0&sayingmarker;Refusal:,count-role;other&character;moon&stage;8:=battleready.png,Ha! What's the matter, N? Quitting on us now? That's a shame, really; I thought I respected you as a competitor.
1-male_masturbating,priority:466,count-role;target&character;n&timeinstage;0&sayingmarker;Refusal:,count-role;other&character;moon&stage;8:=battleready.png,Ha! What's the matter, N? Quitting on us now? I didn't take you for the type to <i>break rules</i> on us...
1-male_heavy_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Getting close to the end, are we Guzma?
1-male_heavy_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,You've picked up the intensity, Guzma... Getting close?
1-male_heavy_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,You've picked up the intensity, Guzma... Almost there?
1-male_heavy_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,You're picking up the pace there, Guzma; almost done?
1-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Hhgn... So that's the finale, then?
1-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Hhgn... So all of this build up for that?
1-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Hhgn... Oh, don't mind me; I was just expecting something a little more fierce from Guzma.
1-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=contemplative.png,Ha, so that's the climax? <i>(It was a little underwhelming for someone like Guzma.)</i>
1-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=contemplative.png,Ha, so that's the climax? <i>(You'd think that with Guzma, it might be a little more remarkable)</i>
1-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;clean:,count-role;other&character;moon:=disappointed.png,Moon's right here; I'm sure she won't mind...

1-female_must_masturbate=surprised.png,Have you already lost, ~name~? I thought we were having an exciting battle, too bad it just ends abruptly like that.
1-female_must_masturbate=fingerup.png,You didn't even make me break a sweat, ~name~. No worries, I'm sure you'll come back stronger if you play again. There's a lot to be learned from defeats.
1-female_must_masturbate=happy.png,It seems poker isn't your forte, ~name~. Not that it really matters since this game relies heavily on luck. You can do everything right and still lose heavily.
1-female_must_masturbate=thinking.png,How did you lose like this? Strategic error on your part, perhaps?
1-female_must_masturbate=surprised.png,Oh, it's time for your forfeit already? What happened, ~name~? It's not like I'm a grandmaster at poker.

1-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;starfire:=happy.png,Being able to levitate like that while you masturbate must give you so much more control.

1-female_finished_masturbating=fingerup.png,That looked very enjoyable. Doesn't mean I'd want to do it too, though.
1-female_finished_masturbating=thinking.png,So this is what afterglow looks like. I've never seen it on another woman before.
1-female_finished_masturbating=aggressive.png,Perhaps losing this game isn't too bad at all... But I still wouldn't want to lose.

2-male_start_masturbating,weight:0.2=horny.png,I can't help but be interested, ~name~; I'm quite unfamiliar with the techniques guys use on their equipment.
2-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;winner:=battleready.png,<i>A real winner?</i> You lost, Guzma; accept it.
2-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;winner:=sarcastic.png,<i>A real winner?</i> Ha, that's funny, coming from you...
2-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;winner:=aggressive.png,I'm the Sinnoh League champion; I <i>know</i> how a real winner does it, Guzma.
2-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;winner:=sarcastic.png,<i>A real winner?</i> Come on, Guzma, less joking, more stroking!
2-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;winner:=sarcastic.png,<i>A real winner?</i> Come on, Guzma, fewer jokes, more stroke!
2-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;winner:=sarcastic.png,<i>A real winner?</i> That's a funny thing to say... <i>Guzma</i>; a <i>winner</i>... Ha!
2-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kazuma:,id:117=surprised.png,Oh, well I suppose I was wrong; it is decently sized! Penises sure can be confusing...
2-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kazuma:,id:117=thinking.png,Huh? It grew? But I thought... if it's that small flaccid... Surely there's some foolery here with surface area to volume ratios at play, right?
2-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kazuma:,id:117=surprised.png,Huh? Now it's big all of a sudden? ... But it was so small just a moment ago.
2-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kazuma:,id:117=surprised.png,Huh... They weren't kidding when they said those things got bigger...
2-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;winner:,count-alive:2=aggressive.png,<i>A real winner?</i> Ha, you're looking at her!
2-male_masturbating=embarrassed.png,Are you really staring at me intently, ~name~?... It's not like I'm exposed right now; you couldn't bring me to that point.
2-male_masturbating=embarrassed.png,<i>(How am I supposed to concentrate on my cards with ~name~ going at it like that?)</i>
2-male_masturbating=fingerup.png,Did you know that there is a creation story where God created the sky by masturbating at a river? Every star in the sky is a drop of semen apparently. 
2-male_masturbating=fingerup.png,The male masturbation techniques have remained almost the same throughout the millennia. Some of the pottery shards we found attests to this.
2-male_masturbating=surprised.png,It seems so primal, so aggressive... it's somewhat difficult to understand that something so rough could be so pleasurable.
2-male_masturbating=scowling.png,...Why are you staring at me, ~name~? It's not like I have anything to show you while I'm dressed modestly like this.
2-male_masturbating=surprised.png,It looks so forced and laborious. How do you concentrate while doing that, ~name~?
2-male_masturbating=surprised.png,I was expecting that to be a bit less... work intensive. I fail to understand how that could be relaxing. 
2-male_masturbating,weight:0.6=aggressive.png,You may have not overcome the Pokémon League, but you can be <i>my</i> champion, ~name~!
2-male_masturbating,weight:0.6=contemplative.png,This reminds me of some perverse mythology I read about...
2-male_masturbating,weight:0.6=contemplative.png,Mmhmmm... Yes, it's just like the first man did when the first woman wasn't in the mood...
2-male_masturbating,weight:0.6=fingerup.png,I've studied a lot of ancient paintings, but if truth be told, the pornographic etchings were always my favorite...
2-male_masturbating,weight:0.6=sarcastic.png,Your face... it's also the same face that some trainers would make in the heat of the battle. I suppose the excitement is just the same.
2-male_masturbating,weight:0.6=excited.png,What exactly do you focus at when you're masturbating, ~name~? The face? Breasts? The female figure? Or just the act of being with a woman?
2-male_masturbating,weight:0.6=sarcastic.png,Is it true that single men masturbate all the time? Based on your apparent experience, I'd wager that you've been single all your life, ~name~.
2-male_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Hahaha! Ah, I remember at the start of this match when you seemed so cocksure about this game! Now look at you, Guzma...
2-male_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Where's the cocksure attitude of yours now, Guzma?
2-male_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Hahaha! Guzma, remember when you thought you were going to beat us all in this game?
2-male_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;rigged:=battleready.png,Rigged? It seems making excuses run in your organization.
2-male_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;rigged:=battleready.png,Rigged? A man of honor would admit to his shortcomings; nonetheless, I am not surprised to see such remarks, coming from you.
2-male_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;rigged:=battleready.png,You're making excuses, Guzma; you can never grow stronger if you do not learn from your defeats.
2-male_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;rigged:=battleready.png,You'd grow as a player, <i>and</i> as a trainer, if you'd acknowledge your losses and learn from them, Guzma.
2-male_masturbating,priority:466,count-role;target&character;n&timeinstage;0&sayingmarker;Refusal:,count-role;other&character;moon&stage;8:=battleready.png,Ha! What's the matter, N? Quitting on us now? That's a shame, really; I thought I respected you as a competitor.
2-male_masturbating,priority:466,count-role;target&character;n&timeinstage;0&sayingmarker;Refusal:,count-role;other&character;moon&stage;8:=battleready.png,Ha! What's the matter, N? Quitting on us now? I didn't take you for the type to <i>break rules</i> on us...
2-male_heavy_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Getting close to the end, are we Guzma?
2-male_heavy_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,You've picked up the intensity, Guzma... Getting close?
2-male_heavy_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,You've picked up the intensity, Guzma... Almost there?
2-male_heavy_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,You're picking up the pace there, Guzma; almost done?
2-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Hhgn... So that's the finale, then?
2-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Hhgn... So all of this build up for that?
2-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Hhgn... Oh, don't mind me; I was just expecting something a little more fierce from Guzma.
2-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=contemplative.png,Ha, so that's the climax? <i>(It was a little underwhelming for someone like Guzma.)</i>
2-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=contemplative.png,Ha, so that's the climax? <i>(You'd think that with Guzma, it might be a little more remarkable)</i>
2-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;clean:,count-role;other&character;moon:=disappointed.png,Moon's right here; I'm sure she won't mind...
2-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;clean:,count-role;other&character;moon:=disappointed.png,It looks like <i>someone</i> here might be willing to clean you off...

2-male_finished_masturbating,priority:241,count-role;other&character;moon&stage;8-9:,count-role;target&character;n&saidmarker;Refusal:,marker:NDidntNut=disappointed.png,Hm? N? N... if you could get over your dispositions for just a moment, you might enjoy yourself a bit more!

2-female_must_masturbate=happy.png,Ha, ~name~ is out! That's a victory for me!
2-female_must_masturbate=surprised.png,Oh, you're out already? I was so enthralled by the game that I didn't even noticed... 
2-female_must_masturbate=surprised.png,Have you already lost, ~name~? I thought we were having an exciting battle, too bad it just ends abruptly like that.
2-female_must_masturbate=fingerup.png,You didn't even make me break a sweat, ~name~. No worries, I'm sure you'll come back stronger if you play again. There's a lot to be learned from defeats.
2-female_must_masturbate=happy.png,It seems poker isn't your forte, ~name~. Not that it really matters since this game relies heavily on luck. You can do everything right and still lose heavily.
2-female_must_masturbate=thinking.png,How did you lose like this? Strategic error on your part, perhaps?
2-female_must_masturbate=surprised.png,Oh, it's time for your forfeit already? What happened, ~name~? It's not like I'm a grandmaster at poker. 
2-female_must_masturbate=contemplative.png,Perhaps I had been underestimating my poker skills all this time...
2-female_must_masturbate=fingerup.png,I can see that you're still learning the ropes of poker, ~name~. Nothing wrong with this loss, as long as you learn from your mistakes. You'll be a better player because of this.
2-female_must_masturbate,weight:0.33=sarcastic.png,You know the rules, ~name~! Oh, come on, don't pretend we all didn't know this was coming.
2-female_must_masturbate,weight:0.33=excited.png,From the stars and the ancient past, they come to play but they never last.
2-female_must_masturbate,weight:0.33=happy.png,Well played, ~name~, but it looks like this is the end.

2-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;nami:,id:54=thinking.png,Huh? What... what are you doing, Nami?
2-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;nami:,id:54=thinking.png,Hmm? There's... there's more moisture in the air... What are you up to, Nami?

2-female_start_masturbating,count-masturbating&female&role;opp:0=fingerup.png,I've actually never seen a girl masturbate before... All the ancient pictographs I've come across only show sex and male masturbation.
2-female_start_masturbating,count-masturbating&female&role;opp:0=fingerup.png,This will be new for me; I've never watched a girl do it before...
2-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;starfire:=happy.png,Is that... <i>difficult</i> to do wile levitating?
2-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;starfire:=fingerup.png,Ah, I see; since you're vulnerable while doing that, levitating will make you immune from any unexpected ground attacks.
2-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;starfire:=happy.png,Being able to levitate like that while you masturbate must give you so much more control.
2-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;starfire:=fingerup.png,I bet you've experimented a lot with <i>unique positions</i>, haven't you?
2-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;elizabeth:,id:119=disappointed.png,Is that... lesbian sex, or... <i>masturbation...</i>
2-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;elizabeth:,id:119=embarrassed.png,Two... <i>feminine figures</i> going at it is... it's so lewd...
2-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;elizabeth:,id:119=embarrassed.png,Two... <i>feminine figures</i> going at it is... well, let's just say I've seen some cave paintings about this...
2-female_masturbating,oneShotId:22,priority:0,count-pubic_hair&role;target:=fingerup.png,Doesn't the hair kind of get in the way, ~name~? You should try shaving; that way, the surface is nice and smooth!
2-female_masturbating,oneShotId:22,priority:0,count-pubic_hair&role;target:=thinking.png,I'm a little curious here, but why don't  you shave? Do you... enjoy the warmth or something on your hand when you masturbate? Is it a maintenance issue?
2-female_masturbating,priority:0,test:~background.time~:day=happy.png,I'm not particularly turned on by feminine displays, but maybe that'll change by the end of today!
2-female_masturbating,priority:0,test:~background.time~:night=happy.png,I'm not particularly turned on by feminine displays, but maybe that'll change by the end of tonight!
2-female_finished_masturbating,weight:0.25=fingerup.png,Ha, that looked kinda fun! If this wasn't a matter of victory or defeat, I'd want to take my turn!
2-female_finished_masturbating,weight:0.25=aggressive.png,Heh, I'll take that climax as proof of yet another victory.
2-female_finished_masturbating,weight:0.25=excited.png,Haha! What a splash that was.
2-female_finished_masturbating,weight:0.25=happy.png,Oh, like a waterfall...
2-female_finished_masturbating=fingerup.png,That looked very enjoyable. Doesn't mean I'd want to do it too, though.
2-female_finished_masturbating=thinking.png,So this is what afterglow looks like. I've never seen it on another woman before.
2-female_finished_masturbating=aggressive.png,Perhaps losing this game isn't too bad at all... But I still wouldn't want to lose.
2-female_finished_masturbating=sarcastic.png,This isn't exactly the customary way of introducing yourself to other people.
2-female_finished_masturbating,count-role;other&character;caulifla:,id:127=thinking.png,Ha, that must have felt pretty good for you to glow like that!
2-female_finished_masturbating,count-role;other&character;caulifla:,id:127=thinking.png,Huh? What happened, Caulifla? Is there a story behind this... <i>transformation?</i>
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:videl,id:157=happy.png,Why, there's nothing to be ashamed about, Videl!
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:videl,id:157=excited.png,Videl, there's nothing wrong with a woman who can do that; in fact, I'd say it's rather unique!

3-male_must_masturbate=excited.png,I was hoping you'd be more of a challenge, ~name~. Although, I don't mind observing this little ritual of yours...
3-male_must_masturbate=aggressive.png,I have to be honest, that was a bit of a disappointment; I was hoping for a more exhilarating game. I just hope the same can't be said of this forfeit of yours...

3-male_start_masturbating=sarcastic.png,I still remember the first time I saw a pottery painting of a masturbating man. It took me too long to realize that he wasn't stabbing himself.
3-male_start_masturbating=excited.png,What hand techniques are you going to use, ~name~? This is quite a fascinating way of learning about male masturbation.
3-male_start_masturbating,weight:0.2=fingerup.png,You don't mind if I watch, do you? A researcher like myself is always curious to observe the unknown.
3-male_start_masturbating,weight:0.2=fingerup.png,Looks like it's time to get started, ~name~. Mind if I take notes?
3-male_start_masturbating,weight:0.2=fingerup.png,Looks like it's time to get started, ~name~. Mind if I record my observations?
3-male_start_masturbating,weight:0.2=fingerup.png,I can't help but be interested, ~name~. Mind if I peek?
3-male_start_masturbating,weight:0.2=embarrassed.png,I can't help but be interested, ~name~. Would peeking be inappropriate?
3-male_start_masturbating,weight:0.2=horny.png,I can't help but be interested, ~name~; I'm quite unfamiliar with the techniques guys use on their equipment.
3-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;winner:=battleready.png,<i>A real winner?</i> You lost, Guzma; accept it.
3-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;winner:=sarcastic.png,<i>A real winner?</i> Ha, that's funny, coming from you...
3-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;winner:=aggressive.png,I'm the Sinnoh League champion; I <i>know</i> how a real winner does it, Guzma.
3-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;winner:=sarcastic.png,<i>A real winner?</i> Come on, Guzma, less joking, more stroking!
3-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;winner:=sarcastic.png,<i>A real winner?</i> Come on, Guzma, fewer jokes, more stroke!
3-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;winner:=sarcastic.png,<i>A real winner?</i> That's a funny thing to say... <i>Guzma</i>; a <i>winner</i>... Ha!
3-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kazuma:,id:117=surprised.png,Oh, well I suppose I was wrong; it is decently sized! Penises sure can be confusing...
3-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kazuma:,id:117=thinking.png,Huh? It grew? But I thought... if it's that small flaccid... Surely there's some foolery here with surface area to volume ratios at play, right?
3-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kazuma:,id:117=surprised.png,Huh? Now it's big all of a sudden? ... But it was so small just a moment ago.
3-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kazuma:,id:117=surprised.png,Huh... They weren't kidding when they said those things got bigger...
3-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;winner:,count-alive:2=aggressive.png,<i>A real winner?</i> Ha, you're looking at her!
3-male_masturbating=embarrassed.png,Are you really staring at me intently, ~name~?... It's not like I'm exposed right now; you couldn't bring me to that point.
3-male_masturbating=embarrassed.png,<i>(How am I supposed to concentrate on my cards with ~name~ going at it like that?)</i>
3-male_masturbating=fingerup.png,Did you know that there is a creation story where God created the sky by masturbating at a river? Every star in the sky is a drop of semen apparently. 
3-male_masturbating=fingerup.png,The male masturbation techniques have remained almost the same throughout the millennia. Some of the pottery shards we found attests to this.
3-male_masturbating=surprised.png,It seems so primal, so aggressive... it's somewhat difficult to understand that something so rough could be so pleasurable.
3-male_masturbating=scowling.png,...Why are you staring at me, ~name~? It's not like I have anything to show you while I'm dressed modestly like this.
3-male_masturbating=surprised.png,It looks so forced and laborious. How do you concentrate while doing that, ~name~?
3-male_masturbating=surprised.png,I was expecting that to be a bit less... work intensive. I fail to understand how that could be relaxing. 
3-male_masturbating,weight:0.6=aggressive.png,You may have not overcome the Pokémon League, but you can be <i>my</i> champion, ~name~!
3-male_masturbating,weight:0.6=contemplative.png,This reminds me of some perverse mythology I read about...
3-male_masturbating,weight:0.6=contemplative.png,Mmhmmm... Yes, it's just like the first man did when the first woman wasn't in the mood...
3-male_masturbating,weight:0.6=fingerup.png,I've studied a lot of ancient paintings, but if truth be told, the pornographic etchings were always my favorite...
3-male_masturbating,weight:0.6=sarcastic.png,Your face... it's also the same face that some trainers would make in the heat of the battle. I suppose the excitement is just the same.
3-male_masturbating,weight:0.6=excited.png,What exactly do you focus at when you're masturbating, ~name~? The face? Breasts? The female figure? Or just the act of being with a woman?
3-male_masturbating,weight:0.6=sarcastic.png,Is it true that single men masturbate all the time? Based on your apparent experience, I'd wager that you've been single all your life, ~name~.
3-male_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Hahaha! Ah, I remember at the start of this match when you seemed so cocksure about this game! Now look at you, Guzma...
3-male_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Where's the cocksure attitude of yours now, Guzma?
3-male_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Hahaha! Guzma, remember when you thought you were going to beat us all in this game?
3-male_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;rigged:=battleready.png,Rigged? It seems making excuses run in your organization.
3-male_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;rigged:=battleready.png,Rigged? A man of honor would admit to his shortcomings; nonetheless, I am not surprised to see such remarks, coming from you.
3-male_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;rigged:=battleready.png,You're making excuses, Guzma; you can never grow stronger if you do not learn from your defeats.
3-male_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;rigged:=battleready.png,You'd grow as a player, <i>and</i> as a trainer, if you'd acknowledge your losses and learn from them, Guzma.
3-male_masturbating,priority:466,count-role;target&character;n&timeinstage;0&sayingmarker;Refusal:,count-role;other&character;moon&stage;8:=battleready.png,Ha! What's the matter, N? Quitting on us now? That's a shame, really; I thought I respected you as a competitor.
3-male_masturbating,priority:466,count-role;target&character;n&timeinstage;0&sayingmarker;Refusal:,count-role;other&character;moon&stage;8:=battleready.png,Ha! What's the matter, N? Quitting on us now? I didn't take you for the type to <i>break rules</i> on us...
3-male_heavy_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Getting close to the end, are we Guzma?
3-male_heavy_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,You've picked up the intensity, Guzma... Getting close?
3-male_heavy_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,You've picked up the intensity, Guzma... Almost there?
3-male_heavy_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,You're picking up the pace there, Guzma; almost done?
3-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Hhgn... So that's the finale, then?
3-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Hhgn... So all of this build up for that?
3-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Hhgn... Oh, don't mind me; I was just expecting something a little more fierce from Guzma.
3-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=contemplative.png,Ha, so that's the climax? <i>(It was a little underwhelming for someone like Guzma.)</i>
3-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=contemplative.png,Ha, so that's the climax? <i>(You'd think that with Guzma, it might be a little more remarkable)</i>
3-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;clean:,count-role;other&character;moon:=disappointed.png,Moon's right here; I'm sure she won't mind...
3-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;clean:,count-role;other&character;moon:=disappointed.png,It looks like <i>someone</i> here might be willing to clean you off...

3-male_finished_masturbating,priority:241,count-role;other&character;moon&stage;8-9:,count-role;target&character;n&saidmarker;Refusal:,marker:NDidntNut=disappointed.png,Hm? N? N... if you could get over your dispositions for just a moment, you might enjoy yourself a bit more!

3-male_finished_masturbating,priority:0,count-hairy&role;target:=disappointed.png,~Name~, you... I think you got some in your bush... Yikes, that looks tough to get out...
3-male_finished_masturbating,priority:0,count-hairy&role;target:=disappointed.png,Oh, ~name~, you... You got some in your bush... How do you usually clean that out?

3-female_must_masturbate=surprised.png,Oh, you're out already? I was so enthralled by the game that I didn't even noticed... 
3-female_must_masturbate=surprised.png,Have you already lost, ~name~? I thought we were having an exciting battle, too bad it just ends abruptly like that.
3-female_must_masturbate=fingerup.png,You didn't even make me break a sweat, ~name~. No worries, I'm sure you'll come back stronger if you play again. There's a lot to be learned from defeats.
3-female_must_masturbate=happy.png,It seems poker isn't your forte, ~name~. Not that it really matters since this game relies heavily on luck. You can do everything right and still lose heavily.
3-female_must_masturbate=thinking.png,How did you lose like this? Strategic error on your part, perhaps?
3-female_must_masturbate=surprised.png,Oh, it's time for your forfeit already? What happened, ~name~? It's not like I'm a grandmaster at poker. 
3-female_must_masturbate=contemplative.png,Perhaps I had been underestimating my poker skills all this time...
3-female_must_masturbate=fingerup.png,I can see that you're still learning the ropes of poker, ~name~. Nothing wrong with this loss, as long as you learn from your mistakes. You'll be a better player because of this.
3-female_must_masturbate,weight:0.33=sarcastic.png,You know the rules, ~name~! Oh, come on, don't pretend we all didn't know this was coming.
3-female_must_masturbate,weight:0.33=excited.png,From the stars and the ancient past, they come to play but they never last.

3-female_start_masturbating,weight:0.33=embarrassed.png,I've... actually... never seen a human female masturbate before... B-but I've... Uhhh, nevermind.
3-female_start_masturbating,weight:0.33=fingerup.png,I've actually never seen a girl masturbate before... All the ancient pictographs I've come across only show sex and male masturbation.
3-female_start_masturbating,weight:0.33=fingerup.png,This will be new for me; I've never watched a girl do it before...
3-female_start_masturbating=fingerup.png,Masturbation is a great way of relieving stress. Perhaps stress could be to blame for your defeat.
3-female_start_masturbating=sarcastic.png,I couldn't imagine myself masturbating in front of strangers. Thank Arceus I'm not remotely close to that outcome.
3-female_start_masturbating=aggressive.png,At this rate, I might be able to join another game before the end of the game.
3-female_start_masturbating=thinking.png,Why do I get the feeling that this game was set-up specifically to get women to masturbate in front of other people?
3-female_start_masturbating=battleready.png,Right, we don't need to make this more awkward than it already is...
3-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;nami:,id:126=thinking.png,Oh, it looks like you're getting wet not, Nami, and in more ways than one...
3-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;nami:,id:126=thinking.png,Ah, rain... I think there's some legends in another region that help explain that... Something about Castform?

3-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;starfire:=happy.png,Is that... <i>difficult</i> to do wile levitating?
3-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;starfire:=fingerup.png,Ah, I see; since you're vulnerable while doing that, levitating will make you immune from any unexpected ground attacks.
3-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;starfire:=happy.png,Being able to levitate like that while you masturbate must give you so much more control.
3-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;starfire:=fingerup.png,I bet you've experimented a lot with <i>unique positions</i>, haven't you?
3-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;elizabeth:,id:119=disappointed.png,Is that... lesbian sex, or... <i>masturbation...</i>
3-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;elizabeth:,id:119=embarrassed.png,Two... <i>feminine figures</i> going at it is... it's so lewd...
3-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;elizabeth:,id:119=embarrassed.png,Two... <i>feminine figures</i> going at it is... well, let's just say I've seen some cave paintings about this...
3-female_masturbating,oneShotId:22,priority:0,count-pubic_hair&role;target:=fingerup.png,Doesn't the hair kind of get in the way, ~name~? You should try shaving; that way, the surface is nice and smooth!
3-female_masturbating,oneShotId:22,priority:0,count-pubic_hair&role;target:=thinking.png,I'm a little curious here, but why don't  you shave? Do you... enjoy the warmth or something on your hand when you masturbate? Is it a maintenance issue?
3-female_masturbating,priority:0,test:~background.time~:day=happy.png,I'm not particularly turned on by feminine displays, but maybe that'll change by the end of today!
3-female_masturbating,priority:0,test:~background.time~:night=happy.png,I'm not particularly turned on by feminine displays, but maybe that'll change by the end of tonight!
3-female_finished_masturbating,weight:0.25=fingerup.png,Ha, that looked kinda fun! If this wasn't a matter of victory or defeat, I'd want to take my turn!
3-female_finished_masturbating,weight:0.25=aggressive.png,Heh, I'll take that climax as proof of yet another victory.
3-female_finished_masturbating,weight:0.25=excited.png,Haha! What a splash that was.
3-female_finished_masturbating,weight:0.25=happy.png,Oh, like a waterfall...
3-female_finished_masturbating=fingerup.png,That looked very enjoyable. Doesn't mean I'd want to do it too, though.
3-female_finished_masturbating=thinking.png,So this is what afterglow looks like. I've never seen it on another woman before.
3-female_finished_masturbating=aggressive.png,Perhaps losing this game isn't too bad at all... But I still wouldn't want to lose.
3-female_finished_masturbating=sarcastic.png,This isn't exactly the customary way of introducing yourself to other people.
3-female_finished_masturbating,count-role;other&character;caulifla:,id:127=thinking.png,Ha, that must have felt pretty good for you to glow like that!
3-female_finished_masturbating,count-role;other&character;caulifla:,id:127=thinking.png,Huh? What happened, Caulifla? Is there a story behind this... <i>transformation?</i>
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:videl,id:157=happy.png,Why, there's nothing to be ashamed about, Videl!
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:videl,id:157=excited.png,Videl, there's nothing wrong with a woman who can do that; in fact, I'd say it's rather unique!


#lost shirt
4-male_must_masturbate=fingerup.png,I must applaud you for your effort, ~name~. I was genuinely impressed that you made it this far. This defeat will only make you a better player in the future.
4-male_must_masturbate=sarcastic.png,It was a pretty decent performance from you, ~name~, but a loss is a loss regardless.
4-male_must_masturbate=excited.png,If it's any consolation for you, I didn't think I'd even remove my shirt in this game. You've exceeded my expectations, ~name~.
4-male_must_masturbate,weight:0.33=excited.png,Well well, ~name~, it's time for you to admit defeat! And it's time for <i>me</i> to claim my prize!
4-male_must_masturbate,weight:0.33=excited.png,Here I am playing strip poker, ~name~, putting so much on the line... <i>this</i> is why my risk is going to pay off!
4-male_must_masturbate,weight:0.33=excited.png,Ha ha! Oh, ~name~, you're going to make me blush! Now, how about we get started <i>nice</i> and slow...
4-male_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;guzma:,count-masturbating:0,count-finished:0=excited.png,That's right, Guzma, you lost. A punk like you will never succeed through petty tricks.

4-male_must_masturbate,priority:312,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;last:,count-masturbating:0,count-finished:0=excited.png,Ha, as if we expected anything else, Guzma; those in the wrong always come out short-handed.
4-male_start_masturbating=fingerup.png,This would be an interesting watch, from a scholarly viewpoint. You see, I'm not familiar as to how men pleasure themselves.
4-male_start_masturbating=thinking.png,I heard men can get unexpected erections in public, and I suppose this isn't too far off from that.
4-male_start_masturbating,weight:0.2=fingerup.png,You don't mind if I watch, do you? A researcher like myself is always curious to observe the unknown.
4-male_start_masturbating,weight:0.2=fingerup.png,Looks like it's time to get started, ~name~. Mind if I take notes?
4-male_start_masturbating,weight:0.2=fingerup.png,Looks like it's time to get started, ~name~. Mind if I record my observations?
4-male_start_masturbating,weight:0.2=fingerup.png,I can't help but be interested, ~name~. Mind if I peek?
4-male_start_masturbating,weight:0.2=embarrassed.png,I can't help but be interested, ~name~. Would peeking be inappropriate?
4-male_start_masturbating,weight:0.2=horny.png,I can't help but be interested, ~name~; I'm quite unfamiliar with the techniques guys use on their equipment.
4-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;winner:=battleready.png,<i>A real winner?</i> You lost, Guzma; accept it.
4-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;winner:=sarcastic.png,<i>A real winner?</i> Ha, that's funny, coming from you...
4-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;winner:=aggressive.png,I'm the Sinnoh League champion; I <i>know</i> how a real winner does it, Guzma.
4-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;winner:=sarcastic.png,<i>A real winner?</i> Come on, Guzma, less joking, more stroking!
4-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;winner:=sarcastic.png,<i>A real winner?</i> Come on, Guzma, fewer jokes, more stroke!
4-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;winner:=sarcastic.png,<i>A real winner?</i> That's a funny thing to say... <i>Guzma</i>; a <i>winner</i>... Ha!
4-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kazuma:,id:117=surprised.png,Oh, well I suppose I was wrong; it is decently sized! Penises sure can be confusing...
4-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kazuma:,id:117=thinking.png,Huh? It grew? But I thought... if it's that small flaccid... Surely there's some foolery here with surface area to volume ratios at play, right?
4-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kazuma:,id:117=surprised.png,Huh? Now it's big all of a sudden? ... But it was so small just a moment ago.
4-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kazuma:,id:117=surprised.png,Huh... They weren't kidding when they said those things got bigger...
4-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;winner:,count-alive:2=aggressive.png,<i>A real winner?</i> Ha, you're looking at her!
4-male_masturbating=surprised.png,Is it true that men used to masturbate to clothing catalogs? I suppose you would focus mainly on the underwear section... like in my state now...
4-male_masturbating=sarcastic.png,You seem very experienced at this, ~name~. I take it you have a lot of practice prior to this, although probably not in front of others.
4-male_masturbating=battleready.png,Doesn't your arm and wrist get tired from doing that motion? It looks pretty labor intensive.
4-male_masturbating=surprised.png,It's even more rigid than I had expected... can you even bend it at that state?
4-male_masturbating=disappointed.png,It looks so simple and easy to learn... Masturbation for women is much trickier to figure out, and can be an exercise in futility when you're not in the mood.
4-male_masturbating=excited.png,That's quite an enthusiastic vigor you are showing while going at it, ~name~! No point in asking if you are enjoying this.
4-male_masturbating=sarcastic.png,It almost looks like it's an automatic action for you... I'm not saying that it's because you do this all the time, but that's a strong possibility.
4-male_masturbating=battleready.png,Let's list this down as an "educational observation", shall we?
4-male_masturbating,weight:0.6=aggressive.png,You may have not overcome the Pokémon League, but you can be <i>my</i> champion, ~name~!
4-male_masturbating,weight:0.6=contemplative.png,This reminds me of some perverse mythology I read about...
4-male_masturbating,weight:0.6=contemplative.png,Mmhmmm... Yes, it's just like the first man did when the first woman wasn't in the mood...
4-male_masturbating,weight:0.6=fingerup.png,I've studied a lot of ancient paintings, but if truth be told, the pornographic etchings were always my favorite...
4-male_masturbating,weight:0.6=sarcastic.png,Your face... it's also the same face that some trainers would make in the heat of the battle. I suppose the excitement is just the same.
4-male_masturbating,weight:0.6=excited.png,What exactly do you focus at when you're masturbating, ~name~? The face? Breasts? The female figure? Or just the act of being with a woman?
4-male_masturbating,weight:0.6=sarcastic.png,Is it true that single men masturbate all the time? Based on your apparent experience, I'd wager that you've been single all your life, ~name~.
4-male_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Hahaha! Ah, I remember at the start of this match when you seemed so cocksure about this game! Now look at you, Guzma...
4-male_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Where's the cocksure attitude of yours now, Guzma?
4-male_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Hahaha! Guzma, remember when you thought you were going to beat us all in this game?
4-male_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;rigged:=battleready.png,Rigged? It seems making excuses run in your organization.
4-male_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;rigged:=battleready.png,Rigged? A man of honor would admit to his shortcomings; nonetheless, I am not surprised to see such remarks, coming from you.
4-male_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;rigged:=battleready.png,You're making excuses, Guzma; you can never grow stronger if you do not learn from your defeats.
4-male_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;rigged:=battleready.png,You'd grow as a player, <i>and</i> as a trainer, if you'd acknowledge your losses and learn from them, Guzma.
4-male_masturbating,priority:466,count-role;target&character;n&timeinstage;0&sayingmarker;Refusal:,count-role;other&character;moon&stage;8:=battleready.png,Ha! What's the matter, N? Quitting on us now? That's a shame, really; I thought I respected you as a competitor.
4-male_masturbating,priority:466,count-role;target&character;n&timeinstage;0&sayingmarker;Refusal:,count-role;other&character;moon&stage;8:=battleready.png,Ha! What's the matter, N? Quitting on us now? I didn't take you for the type to <i>break rules</i> on us...
4-male_heavy_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Getting close to the end, are we Guzma?
4-male_heavy_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,You've picked up the intensity, Guzma... Getting close?
4-male_heavy_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,You've picked up the intensity, Guzma... Almost there?
4-male_heavy_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,You're picking up the pace there, Guzma; almost done?
4-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Hhgn... So that's the finale, then?
4-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Hhgn... So all of this build up for that?
4-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Hhgn... Oh, don't mind me; I was just expecting something a little more fierce from Guzma.
4-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=contemplative.png,Ha, so that's the climax? <i>(It was a little underwhelming for someone like Guzma.)</i>
4-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=contemplative.png,Ha, so that's the climax? <i>(You'd think that with Guzma, it might be a little more remarkable)</i>
4-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;clean:,count-role;other&character;moon:=disappointed.png,Moon's right here; I'm sure she won't mind...
4-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;clean:,count-role;other&character;moon:=disappointed.png,It looks like <i>someone</i> here might be willing to clean you off...

4-male_finished_masturbating,priority:241,count-role;other&character;moon&stage;8-9:,count-role;target&character;n&saidmarker;Refusal:,marker:NDidntNut=disappointed.png,Hm? N? N... if you could get over your dispositions for just a moment, you might enjoy yourself a bit more!

N... if you could get over your dispositions for just a moment... What I'm trying to say is, it looks like your body wants some release...
4-male_finished_masturbating,count-hairy&role;target:,count-role;other&character;moon:=disappointed.png,Oh, it looks like some of that got in your bush, ~name~... If you're going to clean that out, then I'm sure Moon would be willing to help... Unfortunately.

4-female_must_masturbate=battleready.png,That was quite the effort, I must say. Most of my games don't last this long.
4-female_must_masturbate=happy.png,My strategy of maximizing the layer limit is really paying off! I probably would have been out by now if I hadn't.
4-female_must_masturbate=excited.png,That's the end of the line for you, ~name~. Only one thing left for you to do now...
4-female_must_masturbate=excited.png,Great performance from you, ~name~. At the very least, you lasted longer than most of my Pokémon battles.
4-female_must_masturbate=fingerup.png,In fairness to you, ~name~, I didn't even think I'd be removing my top in this game. You've exceeded my expectations despite losing.

4-female_start_masturbating=aggressive.png,Well, it's your time in the spotlight, ~name~. Don't let the pressure affect your composure.
4-female_start_masturbating=embarrassed.png,Would you mind if I take down some notes, ~name~? I might never get another opportunity for this type of observation.
4-female_start_masturbating=aggressive.png,I trust that you've done this before... Well, not this situation, but the act itself.
4-female_start_masturbating,weight:0.33=embarrassed.png,I've... actually... never seen a human female masturbate before... B-but I've... Uhhh, nevermind.
4-female_start_masturbating,weight:0.33=fingerup.png,I've actually never seen a girl masturbate before... All the ancient pictographs I've come across only show sex and male masturbation.
4-female_start_masturbating,weight:0.33=fingerup.png,This will be new for me; I've never watched a girl do it before...
4-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;nami:,id:126=thinking.png,Oh, it looks like you're getting wet not, Nami, and in more ways than one...

4-female_masturbating=thinking.png,This isn't the kind of thing I'm normally interested in, but I might be able to be convinced...
4-female_masturbating=embarrassed.png,Seeing another woman masturbate is not something I normally stake any investment in... Are you trying to change that, ~name~?
4-female_masturbating=embarrassed.png,The female body doesn't exactly... <i>get my juices flowing</i>... Or... does it...
4-female_masturbating=horny.png,~Name~, you have a way of making a straight girl blush!
4-female_masturbating=surprised.png,Is it just me or is it getting warm in here? I don't even have my coat anymore.
4-female_masturbating=horny.png,This sight is stirring some feelings in me that I haven't felt before.
4-female_masturbating=surprised.png,For some reason I can't explain, I can't look away from you, ~name~, even though this normally wouldn't interest me.
4-female_masturbating=sarcastic.png,Perhaps this game could have some educational value after all...
4-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;starfire:=happy.png,Is that... <i>difficult</i> to do wile levitating?
4-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;starfire:=fingerup.png,Ah, I see; since you're vulnerable while doing that, levitating will make you immune from any unexpected ground attacks.
4-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;starfire:=happy.png,Being able to levitate like that while you masturbate must give you so much more control.
4-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;starfire:=fingerup.png,I bet you've experimented a lot with <i>unique positions</i>, haven't you?
4-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;elizabeth:,id:119=disappointed.png,Is that... lesbian sex, or... <i>masturbation...</i>
4-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;elizabeth:,id:119=embarrassed.png,Two... <i>feminine figures</i> going at it is... it's so lewd...

4-female_masturbating,priority:0,test:~background.time~:night=happy.png,I'm not particularly turned on by feminine displays, but maybe that'll change by the end of tonight!
4-female_finished_masturbating=sarcastic.png,As pleasurable as that looked, I would rather not do it. <i>(At least not in public.)</i>
4-female_finished_masturbating=excited.png,I think I learn a thing or two from your display, ~name~.
4-female_finished_masturbating=fingerup.png,Isn't that just the perfect way of relieving stress? Although, it's not usually done in front of a crowd though.
4-female_finished_masturbating=sarcastic.png,You know, I read somewhere that regular masturbation is healthy for you... Not that you needed any excuse to masturbate in the first place, I bet.
4-female_finished_masturbating,weight:0.25=fingerup.png,Ha, that looked kinda fun! If this wasn't a matter of victory or defeat, I'd want to take my turn!
4-female_finished_masturbating,weight:0.25=aggressive.png,Heh, I'll take that climax as proof of yet another victory.
4-female_finished_masturbating,weight:0.25=excited.png,Haha! What a splash that was.

4-female_finished_masturbating,target:videl,id:157=happy.png,Why, there's nothing to be ashamed about, Videl!
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:videl,id:157=excited.png,Videl, there's nothing wrong with a woman who can do that; in fact, I'd say it's rather unique!

5-male_start_masturbating=fingerup.png,This would be an interesting watch, from a scholarly viewpoint. You see, I'm not familiar as to how men pleasure themselves.
5-male_start_masturbating=thinking.png,I heard men can get unexpected erections in public, and I suppose this isn't too far off from that.
5-male_start_masturbating,weight:0.2=fingerup.png,You don't mind if I watch, do you? A researcher like myself is always curious to observe the unknown.
5-male_start_masturbating,weight:0.2=fingerup.png,Looks like it's time to get started, ~name~. Mind if I take notes?
5-male_start_masturbating,weight:0.2=fingerup.png,Looks like it's time to get started, ~name~. Mind if I record my observations?
5-male_start_masturbating,weight:0.2=fingerup.png,I can't help but be interested, ~name~. Mind if I peek?
5-male_start_masturbating,weight:0.2=embarrassed.png,I can't help but be interested, ~name~. Would peeking be inappropriate?
5-male_start_masturbating,weight:0.2=horny.png,I can't help but be interested, ~name~; I'm quite unfamiliar with the techniques guys use on their equipment.

5-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;winner:=sarcastic.png,<i>A real winner?</i> That's a funny thing to say... <i>Guzma</i>; a <i>winner</i>... Ha!
5-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kazuma:,id:117=surprised.png,Oh, well I suppose I was wrong; it is decently sized! Penises sure can be confusing...
5-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kazuma:,id:117=thinking.png,Huh? It grew? But I thought... if it's that small flaccid... Surely there's some foolery here with surface area to volume ratios at play, right?
5-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kazuma:,id:117=surprised.png,Huh? Now it's big all of a sudden? ... But it was so small just a moment ago.
5-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kazuma:,id:117=surprised.png,Huh... They weren't kidding when they said those things got bigger...
5-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;winner:,count-alive:2=aggressive.png,<i>A real winner?</i> Ha, you're looking at her!
5-male_masturbating=surprised.png,Is it true that men used to masturbate to clothing catalogs? I suppose you would focus mainly on the underwear section... like in my state now...
5-male_masturbating=sarcastic.png,You seem very experienced at this, ~name~. I take it you have a lot of practice prior to this, although probably not in front of others.
5-male_masturbating=battleready.png,Doesn't your arm and wrist get tired from doing that motion? It looks pretty labor intensive.
5-male_masturbating=surprised.png,It's even more rigid than I had expected... can you even bend it at that state?
5-male_masturbating=disappointed.png,It looks so simple and easy to learn... Masturbation for women is much trickier to figure out, and can be an exercise in futility when you're not in the mood.
5-male_masturbating=excited.png,That's quite an enthusiastic vigor you are showing while going at it, ~name~! No point in asking if you are enjoying this.
5-male_masturbating=sarcastic.png,It almost looks like it's an automatic action for you... I'm not saying that it's because you do this all the time, but that's a strong possibility.
5-male_masturbating=battleready.png,Let's list this down as an "educational observation", shall we?
5-male_masturbating,weight:0.6=aggressive.png,You may have not overcome the Pokémon League, but you can be <i>my</i> champion, ~name~!
5-male_masturbating,weight:0.6=contemplative.png,This reminds me of some perverse mythology I read about...
5-male_masturbating,weight:0.6=contemplative.png,Mmhmmm... Yes, it's just like the first man did when the first woman wasn't in the mood...
5-male_masturbating,weight:0.6=fingerup.png,I've studied a lot of ancient paintings, but if truth be told, the pornographic etchings were always my favorite...
5-male_masturbating,weight:0.6=sarcastic.png,Your face... it's also the same face that some trainers would make in the heat of the battle. I suppose the excitement is just the same.
5-male_masturbating,weight:0.6=excited.png,What exactly do you focus at when you're masturbating, ~name~? The face? Breasts? The female figure? Or just the act of being with a woman?
5-male_masturbating,weight:0.6=sarcastic.png,Is it true that single men masturbate all the time? Based on your apparent experience, I'd wager that you've been single all your life, ~name~.
5-male_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Hahaha! Ah, I remember at the start of this match when you seemed so cocksure about this game! Now look at you, Guzma...
5-male_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Where's the cocksure attitude of yours now, Guzma?
5-male_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Hahaha! Guzma, remember when you thought you were going to beat us all in this game?
5-male_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;rigged:=battleready.png,Rigged? It seems making excuses run in your organization.
5-male_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;rigged:=battleready.png,Rigged? A man of honor would admit to his shortcomings; nonetheless, I am not surprised to see such remarks, coming from you.
5-male_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;rigged:=battleready.png,You're making excuses, Guzma; you can never grow stronger if you do not learn from your defeats.
5-male_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;rigged:=battleready.png,You'd grow as a player, <i>and</i> as a trainer, if you'd acknowledge your losses and learn from them, Guzma.
5-male_masturbating,priority:466,count-role;target&character;n&timeinstage;0&sayingmarker;Refusal:,count-role;other&character;moon&stage;8:=battleready.png,Ha! What's the matter, N? Quitting on us now? That's a shame, really; I thought I respected you as a competitor.
5-male_masturbating,priority:466,count-role;target&character;n&timeinstage;0&sayingmarker;Refusal:,count-role;other&character;moon&stage;8:=battleready.png,Ha! What's the matter, N? Quitting on us now? I didn't take you for the type to <i>break rules</i> on us...
5-male_heavy_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Getting close to the end, are we Guzma?
5-male_heavy_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,You've picked up the intensity, Guzma... Getting close?
5-male_heavy_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,You've picked up the intensity, Guzma... Almost there?
5-male_heavy_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,You're picking up the pace there, Guzma; almost done?
5-male_finished_masturbating=surprised.png,Is it normal for semen to be that thick and runny? I always pictured it to be a bit more watery than that.
5-male_finished_masturbating=fingerup.png,Millions upon millions of sperms that could create human life wasted like that... No matter, you can just create more anyway.
5-male_finished_masturbating=sarcastic.png,Sperm is such a precious thing, being able to produce life... but men seem to love wasting it! And how could they not? It looks rather fun.
5-male_finished_masturbating=excited.png,It looks like it took a lot out of you, ~name~. It was well worth the pleasure, wasn't it?
5-male_finished_masturbating=excited.png,What a great way of capping of your game! I do wish it was lot less messier than this though.
5-male_finished_masturbating=sarcastic.png,Is it really a punishment if you enjoyed the experience?
5-male_finished_masturbating=excited.png,Wow, that sure took a lot of time and effort to get out! Even your penis seems tired with being erect, immediately shrinking down like that.
5-male_finished_masturbating=embarrassed.png,That was supposed to go inside a woman? It looks uncomfortably sticky.
5-male_finished_masturbating=embarrassed.png,I've heard some women likes swallowing semen. I don't see the appeal of putting a gooey substance in my mouth.
5-male_finished_masturbating=surprised.png,I thought ejaculation causes the testicles to deflate... Are you saving some semen for when you go again?
5-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Hhgn... So that's the finale, then?
5-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Hhgn... So all of this build up for that?
5-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Hhgn... Oh, don't mind me; I was just expecting something a little more fierce from Guzma.
5-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=contemplative.png,Ha, so that's the climax? <i>(It was a little underwhelming for someone like Guzma.)</i>
5-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=contemplative.png,Ha, so that's the climax? <i>(You'd think that with Guzma, it might be a little more remarkable)</i>
5-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;clean:,count-role;other&character;moon:=disappointed.png,Moon's right here; I'm sure she won't mind...
5-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;clean:,count-role;other&character;moon:=disappointed.png,It looks like <i>someone</i> here might be willing to clean you off...
5-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;clean:,count-role;other&character;moon:=disappointed.png,It looks like <i>someone</i> here might be willing to clean it off of you...
5-male_finished_masturbating,priority:241,count-role;other&character;moon&stage;8-9:,count-role;target&character;n&saidmarker;Refusal:,marker:NDidntNut=disappointed.png,N, I know Moon can be a bit... <i>gross</i>... and, <i>disturbing</i>, and... outright <i>whorish and talentless</i>, but... wait, what was I going to say?
5-male_finished_masturbating,priority:241,count-role;other&character;moon&stage;8-9:,count-role;target&character;n&saidmarker;Refusal:,marker:NDidntNut=disappointed.png,Hm? N? I know it's gotta be tough jerking off with <i>her</i> doing that, but it looks like you really want to...
5-male_finished_masturbating,priority:241,count-role;other&character;moon&stage;8-9:,count-role;target&character;n&saidmarker;Refusal:,marker:NDidntNut=disappointed.png,Hm? N? N... if you could get over your dispositions for just a moment, you might enjoy yourself a bit more!
5-male_finished_masturbating,priority:241,count-role;other&character;moon&stage;8-9:,count-role;target&character;n&saidmarker;Refusal:,marker:NDidntNut=disappointed.png,Hm? N? N... if you could get over your dispositions for just a moment... What I'm trying to say is, it looks like your body wants some release...
5-male_finished_masturbating,count-hairy&role;target:,count-role;other&character;moon:=disappointed.png,Oh, it looks like some of that got in your bush, ~name~... If you're going to clean that out, then I'm sure Moon would be willing to help... Unfortunately.
5-male_finished_masturbating,count-hairy&role;target:,count-role;other&character;moon:=disappointed.png,Some of that got in your bush... If you're going to clean that out, then I'm sure Moon would be willing to help... That is, if you're brave enough to stick that thing near her.
5-male_finished_masturbating,priority:0,count-hairy&role;target:=disappointed.png,Oh, it looks like I see specks of white in your bush now...
5-male_finished_masturbating,priority:0,count-hairy&role;target:=fingerup.png,Oh, it looks like some of the strands got in your bush, ~name~... Let's just say it's an improvement!
5-male_finished_masturbating,priority:0,count-pubic_hair&role;target:=disappointed.png,Oh, it looks like I see specks of white in your... <i>hair</i>, now...
5-male_finished_masturbating,priority:0,count-pubic_hair&role;target:=fingerup.png,Oh, it looks like some of the strands got in your pubic hair, ~name~... Let's just say it's an improvement!
5-female_must_masturbate=happy.png,Ha, ~name~ is out! That's a victory for me!
5-female_must_masturbate=battleready.png,That was quite the effort, I must say. Most of my games don't last this long.
5-female_must_masturbate=happy.png,My strategy of maximizing the layer limit is really paying off! I probably would have been out by now if I hadn't.
5-female_must_masturbate=excited.png,That's the end of the line for you, ~name~. Only one thing left for you to do now...
5-female_must_masturbate=excited.png,Great performance from you, ~name~. At the very least, you lasted longer than most of my Pokémon battles.
5-female_must_masturbate=fingerup.png,In fairness to you, ~name~, I didn't even think I'd be removing my top in this game. You've exceeded my expectations despite losing.
5-female_must_masturbate=happy.png,I was starting to worry you'd get me naked, ~name~. This was too close for comfort.
5-female_must_masturbate,weight:0.33=sarcastic.png,You know the rules, ~name~! Oh, come on, don't pretend we all didn't know this was coming.
5-female_must_masturbate,weight:0.33=excited.png,From the stars and the ancient past, they come to play but they never last.
5-female_must_masturbate,weight:0.33=happy.png,Well played, ~name~, but it looks like this is the end.
5-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;nami&saying;perverts:,id:55=shocked.png,Huh? If not for that... then what is it used for?
5-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;nami&saying;perverts:,id:55=thinking.png,Huh? Oh, Nami... You'll give me for my assumptions, I hope?
5-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;nami:,id:54=thinking.png,Huh? What... what are you doing, Nami?
5-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;nami:,id:54=thinking.png,Hmm? There's... there's more moisture in the air... What are you up to, Nami?
5-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;misty_hgss:,test:~background.time~:day=aggressive.png,Upsets are upsets for a reason, Misty; they aren't supposed to happen.
5-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;misty_hgss:,test:~background.time~:day=aggressive.png,I'm sorry to bring it up, Misty, but I <i>am</i> first seed; you losing to me was simply the expected result.
5-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;misty_hgss:,test:~background.time~:day=aggressive.png,I'm sorry to bring it up, Misty, but I <i>was</i> seeded to win this whole thing; you losing to me was just the expected result.
5-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;misty_hgss:,test:~background.time~:day=aggressive.png,I hope you excuse my bluntness, but it's not often that gym leaders manage to pull an upset against league champions, Misty.
5-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;misty_hgss:,test:~background.time~:day=aggressive.png,It's a shame you had to face me in today's game... Having to fight first seed is... It's always rough.

5-female_start_masturbating=thinking.png,I wonder... do you fantasize about a particular someone, or just the experience itself?
5-female_start_masturbating=aggressive.png,Well, it's your time in the spotlight, ~name~. Don't let the pressure affect your composure.
5-female_start_masturbating=embarrassed.png,Would you mind if I take down some notes, ~name~? I might never get another opportunity for this type of observation.
5-female_start_masturbating=aggressive.png,I trust that you've done this before... Well, not this situation, but the act itself.
5-female_start_masturbating,weight:0.33=embarrassed.png,I've... actually... never seen a human female masturbate before... B-but I've... Uhhh, nevermind.

5-female_start_masturbating,count-masturbating&female&role;opp:0=fingerup.png,I've actually never seen a girl masturbate before... All the ancient pictographs I've come across only show sex and male masturbation.
5-female_start_masturbating,count-masturbating&female&role;opp:0=fingerup.png,This will be new for me; I've never watched a girl do it before...
5-female_masturbating=thinking.png,This isn't the kind of thing I'm normally interested in, but I might be able to be convinced...
5-female_masturbating=embarrassed.png,Seeing another woman masturbate is not something I normally stake any investment in... Are you trying to change that, ~name~?
5-female_masturbating=embarrassed.png,The female body doesn't exactly... <i>get my juices flowing</i>... Or... does it...
5-female_masturbating=horny.png,~Name~, you have a way of making a straight girl blush!
5-female_masturbating=surprised.png,Is it just me or is it getting warm in here? I don't even have my coat anymore.
5-female_masturbating=horny.png,This sight is stirring some feelings in me that I haven't felt before.
5-female_masturbating=surprised.png,For some reason I can't explain, I can't look away from you, ~name~, even though this normally wouldn't interest me.
5-female_masturbating=sarcastic.png,Perhaps this game could have some educational value after all...
5-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;starfire:=happy.png,Is that... <i>difficult</i> to do wile levitating?
5-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;starfire:=fingerup.png,Ah, I see; since you're vulnerable while doing that, levitating will make you immune from any unexpected ground attacks.
5-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;starfire:=happy.png,Being able to levitate like that while you masturbate must give you so much more control.
5-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;starfire:=fingerup.png,I bet you've experimented a lot with <i>unique positions</i>, haven't you?
5-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;elizabeth:,id:119=disappointed.png,Is that... lesbian sex, or... <i>masturbation...</i>
5-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;elizabeth:,id:119=embarrassed.png,Two... <i>feminine figures</i> going at it is... it's so lewd...
5-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;elizabeth:,id:119=embarrassed.png,Two... <i>feminine figures</i> going at it is... well, let's just say I've seen some cave paintings about this...
5-female_masturbating,oneShotId:22,priority:0,count-pubic_hair&role;target:=fingerup.png,Doesn't the hair kind of get in the way, ~name~? You should try shaving; that way, the surface is nice and smooth!
5-female_masturbating,oneShotId:22,priority:0,count-pubic_hair&role;target:=thinking.png,I'm a little curious here, but why don't  you shave? Do you... enjoy the warmth or something on your hand when you masturbate? Is it a maintenance issue?
5-female_masturbating,priority:0,test:~background.time~:day=happy.png,I'm not particularly turned on by feminine displays, but maybe that'll change by the end of today!
5-female_masturbating,priority:0,test:~background.time~:night=happy.png,I'm not particularly turned on by feminine displays, but maybe that'll change by the end of tonight!
5-female_finished_masturbating=sarcastic.png,As pleasurable as that looked, I would rather not do it. <i>(At least not in public.)</i>
5-female_finished_masturbating=excited.png,I think I learn a thing or two from your display, ~name~.
5-female_finished_masturbating=fingerup.png,Isn't that just the perfect way of relieving stress? Although, it's not usually done in front of a crowd though.
5-female_finished_masturbating=sarcastic.png,You know, I read somewhere that regular masturbation is healthy for you... Not that you needed any excuse to masturbate in the first place, I bet.
5-female_finished_masturbating,weight:0.25=fingerup.png,Ha, that looked kinda fun! If this wasn't a matter of victory or defeat, I'd want to take my turn!
5-female_finished_masturbating,weight:0.25=aggressive.png,Heh, I'll take that climax as proof of yet another victory.
5-female_finished_masturbating,weight:0.25=excited.png,Haha! What a splash that was.
5-female_finished_masturbating,weight:0.25=happy.png,Oh, like a waterfall...
5-female_finished_masturbating,count-role;other&character;caulifla:,id:127=thinking.png,Ha, that must have felt pretty good for you to glow like that!
5-female_finished_masturbating,count-role;other&character;caulifla:,id:127=thinking.png,Huh? What happened, Caulifla? Is there a story behind this... <i>transformation?</i>
5-female_finished_masturbating,target:videl,id:157=happy.png,Why, there's nothing to be ashamed about, Videl!
5-female_finished_masturbating,target:videl,id:157=excited.png,Videl, there's nothing wrong with a woman who can do that; in fact, I'd say it's rather unique!

6-male_must_masturbate=fingerup.png,I must applaud you for your effort, ~name~. I was genuinely impressed that you made it this far. This defeat will only make you a better player in the future.
6-male_must_masturbate=sarcastic.png,It was a pretty decent performance from you, ~name~, but a loss is a loss regardless.
6-male_must_masturbate=excited.png,If it's any consolation for you, I didn't think I'd even remove my shirt in this game. You've exceeded my expectations, ~name~.
6-male_must_masturbate,weight:0.33=excited.png,Well well, ~name~, it's time for you to admit defeat! And it's time for <i>me</i> to claim my prize!
6-male_must_masturbate,weight:0.33=excited.png,Here I am playing strip poker, ~name~, putting so much on the line... <i>this</i> is why my risk is going to pay off!
6-male_must_masturbate,weight:0.33=excited.png,Ha ha! Oh, ~name~, you're going to make me blush! Now, how about we get started <i>nice</i> and slow...
6-male_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;guzma:,count-masturbating:0,count-finished:0=excited.png,That's right, Guzma, you lost. A punk like you will never succeed through petty tricks.
6-male_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;guzma:,count-masturbating:0,count-finished:0=sarcastic.png,Not only did you lose, but you got <i>dead last</i>, Guzma. Not that we expected any different.

6-male_must_masturbate,priority:312,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;last:,count-masturbating:0,count-finished:0=excited.png,Ha, as if we expected anything else, Guzma; those in the wrong always come out short-handed.
6-male_start_masturbating=fingerup.png,This would be an interesting watch, from a scholarly viewpoint. You see, I'm not familiar as to how men pleasure themselves.
6-male_start_masturbating=thinking.png,I heard men can get unexpected erections in public, and I suppose this isn't too far off from that.
6-male_start_masturbating,weight:0.2=fingerup.png,You don't mind if I watch, do you? A researcher like myself is always curious to observe the unknown.
6-male_start_masturbating,weight:0.2=fingerup.png,Looks like it's time to get started, ~name~. Mind if I take notes?
6-male_start_masturbating,weight:0.2=fingerup.png,Looks like it's time to get started, ~name~. Mind if I record my observations?
6-male_start_masturbating,weight:0.2=fingerup.png,I can't help but be interested, ~name~. Mind if I peek?
6-male_start_masturbating,weight:0.2=embarrassed.png,I can't help but be interested, ~name~. Would peeking be inappropriate?
6-male_start_masturbating,weight:0.2=horny.png,I can't help but be interested, ~name~; I'm quite unfamiliar with the techniques guys use on their equipment.
6-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;winner:=battleready.png,<i>A real winner?</i> You lost, Guzma; accept it.
6-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;winner:=sarcastic.png,<i>A real winner?</i> Ha, that's funny, coming from you...
6-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;winner:=aggressive.png,I'm the Sinnoh League champion; I <i>know</i> how a real winner does it, Guzma.
6-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;winner:=sarcastic.png,<i>A real winner?</i> Come on, Guzma, less joking, more stroking!
6-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;winner:=sarcastic.png,<i>A real winner?</i> Come on, Guzma, fewer jokes, more stroke!
6-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;winner:=sarcastic.png,<i>A real winner?</i> That's a funny thing to say... <i>Guzma</i>; a <i>winner</i>... Ha!
6-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kazuma:,id:117=surprised.png,Oh, well I suppose I was wrong; it is decently sized! Penises sure can be confusing...
6-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kazuma:,id:117=thinking.png,Huh? It grew? But I thought... if it's that small flaccid... Surely there's some foolery here with surface area to volume ratios at play, right?
6-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kazuma:,id:117=surprised.png,Huh? Now it's big all of a sudden? ... But it was so small just a moment ago.
6-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kazuma:,id:117=surprised.png,Huh... They weren't kidding when they said those things got bigger...
6-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;winner:,count-alive:2=aggressive.png,<i>A real winner?</i> Ha, you're looking at her!
6-male_masturbating=horny.png,Watching you do that is as intense as any Pokémon battle, ~name~.
6-male_masturbating=horny.png,Things look like they're heating up with ~name~...
6-male_masturbating=embarrassed.png,~Name~... did you want me to... cheer you on?
6-male_masturbating=battleready.png,Is it... enjoyable, ~name~?
6-male_masturbating=sarcastic.png,It seems like luck would have it that I'm rather <i>bare</i> while you do that, ~name~. Rules are rules; I can't help if you take a look.
6-male_masturbating=horny.png,Still going, ~name~? Are you liking my figure?
6-male_masturbating=aggressive.png,Are you admiring my figure, ~name~? It's not easy maintaining a regular exercise regime with all the traveling I do.
6-male_masturbating=embarrassed.png,I'm sorry I can't do anything to help you, ~name~... I don't mean like that... I'm still morally supporting you though...
6-male_masturbating,weight:0.6=aggressive.png,You may have not overcome the Pokémon League, but you can be <i>my</i> champion, ~name~!
6-male_masturbating,weight:0.6=contemplative.png,This reminds me of some perverse mythology I read about...
6-male_masturbating,weight:0.6=contemplative.png,Mmhmmm... Yes, it's just like the first man did when the first woman wasn't in the mood...
6-male_masturbating,weight:0.6=fingerup.png,I've studied a lot of ancient paintings, but if truth be told, the pornographic etchings were always my favorite...
6-male_masturbating,weight:0.6=sarcastic.png,Your face... it's also the same face that some trainers would make in the heat of the battle. I suppose the excitement is just the same.
6-male_masturbating,weight:0.6=excited.png,What exactly do you focus at when you're masturbating, ~name~? The face? Breasts? The female figure? Or just the act of being with a woman?
6-male_masturbating,weight:0.6=sarcastic.png,Is it true that single men masturbate all the time? Based on your apparent experience, I'd wager that you've been single all your life, ~name~.
6-male_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,As much as I resent you, Guzma, I think jerking off might mellow you out a little...
6-male_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,As much as I resent you, Guzma, I think jerking off might ease your attitude a little; why, you might even be a respectable person once the pressure's been released.
6-male_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,I think masturbating might do wonders to your attitude, Guzma; it might smooth you out, if only for a moment.
6-male_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;rigged:=battleready.png,Rigged? It seems making excuses run in your organization.
6-male_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;rigged:=battleready.png,Rigged? A man of honor would admit to his shortcomings; nonetheless, I am not surprised to see such remarks, coming from you.
6-male_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;rigged:=battleready.png,You're making excuses, Guzma; you can never grow stronger if you do not learn from your defeats.
6-male_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;rigged:=battleready.png,You'd grow as a player, <i>and</i> as a trainer, if you'd acknowledge your losses and learn from them, Guzma.
6-male_masturbating,priority:466,count-role;target&character;n&timeinstage;0&sayingmarker;Refusal:,count-role;other&character;moon&stage;8:=battleready.png,Ha! What's the matter, N? Quitting on us now? That's a shame, really; I thought I respected you as a competitor.
6-male_masturbating,priority:466,count-role;target&character;n&timeinstage;0&sayingmarker;Refusal:,count-role;other&character;moon&stage;8:=battleready.png,Ha! What's the matter, N? Quitting on us now? I didn't take you for the type to <i>break rules</i> on us...
6-male_heavy_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Getting close to the end, are we Guzma?
6-male_heavy_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,You've picked up the intensity, Guzma... Getting close?
6-male_heavy_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,You've picked up the intensity, Guzma... Almost there?
6-male_heavy_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,You're picking up the pace there, Guzma; almost done?
6-male_finished_masturbating=surprised.png,Is it normal for semen to be that thick and runny? I always pictured it to be a bit more watery than that.
6-male_finished_masturbating=fingerup.png,Millions upon millions of sperms that could create human life wasted like that... No matter, you can just create more anyway.
6-male_finished_masturbating=sarcastic.png,Sperm is such a precious thing, being able to produce life... but men seem to love wasting it! And how could they not? It looks rather fun.
6-male_finished_masturbating=excited.png,It looks like it took a lot out of you, ~name~. It was well worth the pleasure, wasn't it?
6-male_finished_masturbating=excited.png,What a great way of capping of your game! I do wish it was lot less messier than this though.
6-male_finished_masturbating=sarcastic.png,Is it really a punishment if you enjoyed the experience?
6-male_finished_masturbating=excited.png,Wow, that sure took a lot of time and effort to get out! Even your penis seems tired with being erect, immediately shrinking down like that.
6-male_finished_masturbating=embarrassed.png,That was supposed to go inside a woman? It looks uncomfortably sticky.
6-male_finished_masturbating=embarrassed.png,I've heard some women likes swallowing semen. I don't see the appeal of putting a gooey substance in my mouth.
6-male_finished_masturbating=surprised.png,I thought ejaculation causes the testicles to deflate... Are you saving some semen for when you go again?
6-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Hhgn... So that's the finale, then?
6-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Hhgn... So all of this build up for that?
6-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Hhgn... Oh, don't mind me; I was just expecting something a little more fierce from Guzma.
6-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=contemplative.png,Ha, so that's the climax? <i>(It was a little underwhelming for someone like Guzma.)</i>
6-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=contemplative.png,Ha, so that's the climax? <i>(You'd think that with Guzma, it might be a little more remarkable)</i>
6-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;clean:,count-role;other&character;moon:=disappointed.png,Moon's right here; I'm sure she won't mind...
6-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;clean:,count-role;other&character;moon:=disappointed.png,It looks like <i>someone</i> here might be willing to clean you off...
6-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;clean:,count-role;other&character;moon:=disappointed.png,It looks like <i>someone</i> here might be willing to clean it off of you...

6-male_finished_masturbating,priority:241,count-role;other&character;moon&stage;8-9:,count-role;target&character;n&saidmarker;Refusal:,marker:NDidntNut=disappointed.png,Hm? N? N... if you could get over your dispositions for just a moment, you might enjoy yourself a bit more!
6-male_finished_masturbating,priority:241,count-role;other&character;moon&stage;8-9:,count-role;target&character;n&saidmarker;Refusal:,marker:NDidntNut=disappointed.png,Hm? N? N... if you could get over your dispositions for just a moment... What I'm trying to say is, it looks like your body wants some release...
6-male_finished_masturbating,count-hairy&role;target:,count-role;other&character;moon:=disappointed.png,Oh, it looks like some of that got in your bush, ~name~... If you're going to clean that out, then I'm sure Moon would be willing to help... Unfortunately.
6-male_finished_masturbating,count-hairy&role;target:,count-role;other&character;moon:=disappointed.png,Some of that got in your bush... If you're going to clean that out, then I'm sure Moon would be willing to help... That is, if you're brave enough to stick that thing near her.
6-male_finished_masturbating,priority:0,count-hairy&role;target:=disappointed.png,Oh, it looks like I see specks of white in your bush now...
6-male_finished_masturbating,priority:0,count-hairy&role;target:=fingerup.png,Oh, it looks like some of the strands got in your bush, ~name~... Let's just say it's an improvement!

6-male_finished_masturbating,priority:0,count-pubic_hair&role;target:=fingerup.png,Oh, it looks like some of the strands got in your pubic hair, ~name~... Let's just say it's an improvement!
6-female_must_masturbate=happy.png,Ha, ~name~ is out! That's a victory for me!
6-female_must_masturbate=battleready.png,That was quite the effort, I must say. Most of my games don't last this long.
6-female_must_masturbate=happy.png,My strategy of maximizing the layer limit is really paying off! I probably would have been out by now if I hadn't.
6-female_must_masturbate=excited.png,That's the end of the line for you, ~name~. Only one thing left for you to do now...
6-female_must_masturbate=excited.png,Great performance from you, ~name~. At the very least, you lasted longer than most of my Pokémon battles.
6-female_must_masturbate=fingerup.png,In fairness to you, ~name~, I didn't even think I'd be removing my top in this game. You've exceeded my expectations despite losing.
6-female_must_masturbate=happy.png,I was starting to worry you'd get me naked, ~name~. This was too close for comfort.
6-female_must_masturbate,weight:0.33=sarcastic.png,You know the rules, ~name~! Oh, come on, don't pretend we all didn't know this was coming.
6-female_must_masturbate,weight:0.33=excited.png,From the stars and the ancient past, they come to play but they never last.
6-female_must_masturbate,weight:0.33=happy.png,Well played, ~name~, but it looks like this is the end.

6-female_start_masturbating=contemplative.png,I don't think I've ever seen any artifacts depicting female masturbation...
6-female_start_masturbating=thinking.png,I wonder... do you fantasize about a particular someone, or just the experience itself?
6-female_start_masturbating=aggressive.png,Well, it's your time in the spotlight, ~name~. Don't let the pressure affect your composure.
6-female_start_masturbating=embarrassed.png,Would you mind if I take down some notes, ~name~? I might never get another opportunity for this type of observation.
6-female_start_masturbating=aggressive.png,I trust that you've done this before... Well, not this situation, but the act itself.
6-female_start_masturbating,weight:0.33=embarrassed.png,I've... actually... never seen a human female masturbate before... B-but I've... Uhhh, nevermind.
6-female_start_masturbating,weight:0.33=fingerup.png,I've actually never seen a girl masturbate before... All the ancient pictographs I've come across only show sex and male masturbation.
6-female_start_masturbating,weight:0.33=fingerup.png,This will be new for me; I've never watched a girl do it before...
6-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;nami:,id:126=thinking.png,Oh, it looks like you're getting wet not, Nami, and in more ways than one...
6-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;nami:,id:126=thinking.png,Ah, rain... I think there's some legends in another region that help explain that... Something about Castform?
6-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;nami:,id:126=thinking.png,Ah, rain... I think there's some legends in another region that help explain that... Something about Kyogre?
6-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;sayaka&sayingmarker;soulgem:,count-role;other&character;caulifla:,id:128=thinking.png,Oh, such a transformation? What kind of powers are at play here?

6-female_masturbating=thinking.png,This isn't the kind of thing I'm normally interested in, but I might be able to be convinced...
6-female_masturbating=embarrassed.png,Seeing another woman masturbate is not something I normally stake any investment in... Are you trying to change that, ~name~?
6-female_masturbating=embarrassed.png,The female body doesn't exactly... <i>get my juices flowing</i>... Or... does it...
6-female_masturbating=horny.png,~Name~, you have a way of making a straight girl blush!
6-female_masturbating=surprised.png,Is it just me or is it getting warm in here? I don't even have my coat anymore.
6-female_masturbating=horny.png,This sight is stirring some feelings in me that I haven't felt before.
6-female_masturbating=surprised.png,For some reason I can't explain, I can't look away from you, ~name~, even though this normally wouldn't interest me.
6-female_masturbating=sarcastic.png,Perhaps this game could have some educational value after all...
6-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;starfire:=happy.png,Is that... <i>difficult</i> to do wile levitating?
6-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;starfire:=fingerup.png,Ah, I see; since you're vulnerable while doing that, levitating will make you immune from any unexpected ground attacks.
6-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;starfire:=happy.png,Being able to levitate like that while you masturbate must give you so much more control.
6-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;starfire:=fingerup.png,I bet you've experimented a lot with <i>unique positions</i>, haven't you?
6-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;elizabeth:,id:119=disappointed.png,Is that... lesbian sex, or... <i>masturbation...</i>
6-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;elizabeth:,id:119=embarrassed.png,Two... <i>feminine figures</i> going at it is... it's so lewd...
6-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;elizabeth:,id:119=embarrassed.png,Two... <i>feminine figures</i> going at it is... well, let's just say I've seen some cave paintings about this...
6-female_masturbating,oneShotId:22,priority:0,count-pubic_hair&role;target:=fingerup.png,Doesn't the hair kind of get in the way, ~name~? You should try shaving; that way, the surface is nice and smooth!
6-female_masturbating,oneShotId:22,priority:0,count-pubic_hair&role;target:=thinking.png,I'm a little curious here, but why don't  you shave? Do you... enjoy the warmth or something on your hand when you masturbate? Is it a maintenance issue?
6-female_masturbating,priority:0,test:~background.time~:day=happy.png,I'm not particularly turned on by feminine displays, but maybe that'll change by the end of today!
6-female_masturbating,priority:0,test:~background.time~:night=happy.png,I'm not particularly turned on by feminine displays, but maybe that'll change by the end of tonight!
6-female_finished_masturbating=sarcastic.png,As pleasurable as that looked, I would rather not do it. <i>(At least not in public.)</i>
6-female_finished_masturbating=excited.png,I think I learn a thing or two from your display, ~name~.
6-female_finished_masturbating=fingerup.png,Isn't that just the perfect way of relieving stress? Although, it's not usually done in front of a crowd though.
6-female_finished_masturbating=sarcastic.png,You know, I read somewhere that regular masturbation is healthy for you... Not that you needed any excuse to masturbate in the first place, I bet.
6-female_finished_masturbating,weight:0.25=fingerup.png,Ha, that looked kinda fun! If this wasn't a matter of victory or defeat, I'd want to take my turn!
6-female_finished_masturbating,weight:0.25=aggressive.png,Heh, I'll take that climax as proof of yet another victory.
6-female_finished_masturbating,weight:0.25=excited.png,Haha! What a splash that was.
6-female_finished_masturbating,weight:0.25=happy.png,Oh, like a waterfall...
6-female_finished_masturbating,count-role;other&character;caulifla:,id:127=thinking.png,Ha, that must have felt pretty good for you to glow like that!
6-female_finished_masturbating,count-role;other&character;caulifla:,id:127=thinking.png,Huh? What happened, Caulifla? Is there a story behind this... <i>transformation?</i>
6-female_finished_masturbating,target:videl,id:157=happy.png,Why, there's nothing to be ashamed about, Videl!
6-female_finished_masturbating,target:videl,id:157=excited.png,Videl, there's nothing wrong with a woman who can do that; in fact, I'd say it's rather unique!

7-male_must_masturbate=happy.png,Even though you failed to win, it was a very enjoyable game, wasn't it? Having fun should always be the priority in a game like this.
7-male_must_masturbate=sarcastic.png,You did manage to get me out of my pants, which is more than what other men can say.
7-male_must_masturbate=fingerup.png,You shouldn't be disappointed after giving such a strong performance. There are just times where you lose despite your best efforts.
7-male_must_masturbate,weight:0.33=excited.png,Well well, ~name~, it's time for you to admit defeat! And it's time for <i>me</i> to claim my prize!
7-male_must_masturbate,weight:0.33=excited.png,Here I am playing strip poker, ~name~, putting so much on the line... <i>this</i> is why my risk is going to pay off!
7-male_must_masturbate,weight:0.33=excited.png,Ha ha! Oh, ~name~, you're going to make me blush! Now, how about we get started <i>nice</i> and slow...
7-male_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;guzma:,count-masturbating:0,count-finished:0=excited.png,That's right, Guzma, you lost. A punk like you will never succeed through petty tricks.
7-male_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;guzma:,count-masturbating:0,count-finished:0=sarcastic.png,Not only did you lose, but you got <i>dead last</i>, Guzma. Not that we expected any different.

7-male_must_masturbate,priority:312,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;last:,count-masturbating:0,count-finished:0=excited.png,Ha, as if we expected anything else, Guzma; those in the wrong always come out short-handed.
7-male_start_masturbating=embarrassed.png,I suppose you could use my body as a visual aid to help you in your masturbation, as long as you don't act too creepily.
7-male_start_masturbating=embarrassed.png,I have never been in front of a naked man prior to this game, let alone a masturbating man.
7-male_start_masturbating=embarrassed.png,For all the planning that I did, I had somehow neglected to prepare for this situation of a man masturbating while I'm exposed like this.
7-male_start_masturbating,weight:0.2=fingerup.png,You don't mind if I watch, do you? A researcher like myself is always curious to observe the unknown.
7-male_start_masturbating,weight:0.2=fingerup.png,Looks like it's time to get started, ~name~. Mind if I take notes?
7-male_start_masturbating,weight:0.2=fingerup.png,Looks like it's time to get started, ~name~. Mind if I record my observations?
7-male_start_masturbating,weight:0.2=fingerup.png,I can't help but be interested, ~name~. Mind if I peek?
7-male_start_masturbating,weight:0.2=embarrassed.png,I can't help but be interested, ~name~. Would peeking be inappropriate?
7-male_start_masturbating,weight:0.2=horny.png,I can't help but be interested, ~name~; I'm quite unfamiliar with the techniques guys use on their equipment.
7-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;winner:=battleready.png,<i>A real winner?</i> You lost, Guzma; accept it.
7-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;winner:=sarcastic.png,<i>A real winner?</i> Ha, that's funny, coming from you...
7-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;winner:=aggressive.png,I'm the Sinnoh League champion; I <i>know</i> how a real winner does it, Guzma.
7-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;winner:=sarcastic.png,<i>A real winner?</i> Come on, Guzma, less joking, more stroking!
7-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;winner:=sarcastic.png,<i>A real winner?</i> Come on, Guzma, fewer jokes, more stroke!
7-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;winner:=sarcastic.png,<i>A real winner?</i> That's a funny thing to say... <i>Guzma</i>; a <i>winner</i>... Ha!
7-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kazuma:,id:117=surprised.png,Oh, well I suppose I was wrong; it is decently sized! Penises sure can be confusing...
7-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kazuma:,id:117=thinking.png,Huh? It grew? But I thought... if it's that small flaccid... Surely there's some foolery here with surface area to volume ratios at play, right?
7-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kazuma:,id:117=surprised.png,Huh? Now it's big all of a sudden? ... But it was so small just a moment ago.
7-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kazuma:,id:117=surprised.png,Huh... They weren't kidding when they said those things got bigger...
7-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;winner:,count-alive:2=aggressive.png,<i>A real winner?</i> Ha, you're looking at her!
7-male_masturbating=horny.png,Watching you do that is as intense as any Pokémon battle, ~name~.
7-male_masturbating=horny.png,Things look like they're heating up with ~name~...
7-male_masturbating=embarrassed.png,~Name~... did you want me to... cheer you on?
7-male_masturbating=battleready.png,Is it... enjoyable, ~name~?
7-male_masturbating=sarcastic.png,It seems like luck would have it that I'm rather <i>bare</i> while you do that, ~name~. Rules are rules; I can't help if you take a look.
7-male_masturbating=horny.png,Still going, ~name~? Are you liking my figure?
7-male_masturbating=aggressive.png,Are you admiring my figure, ~name~? It's not easy maintaining a regular exercise regime with all the traveling I do.
7-male_masturbating=embarrassed.png,I'm sorry I can't do anything to help you, ~name~... I don't mean like that... I'm still morally supporting you though...
7-male_masturbating,weight:0.6=aggressive.png,You may have not overcome the Pokémon League, but you can be <i>my</i> champion, ~name~!
7-male_masturbating,weight:0.6=contemplative.png,This reminds me of some perverse mythology I read about...
7-male_masturbating,weight:0.6=contemplative.png,Mmhmmm... Yes, it's just like the first man did when the first woman wasn't in the mood...
7-male_masturbating,weight:0.6=fingerup.png,I've studied a lot of ancient paintings, but if truth be told, the pornographic etchings were always my favorite...
7-male_masturbating,weight:0.6=sarcastic.png,Your face... it's also the same face that some trainers would make in the heat of the battle. I suppose the excitement is just the same.
7-male_masturbating,weight:0.6=excited.png,What exactly do you focus at when you're masturbating, ~name~? The face? Breasts? The female figure? Or just the act of being with a woman?
7-male_masturbating,weight:0.6=sarcastic.png,Is it true that single men masturbate all the time? Based on your apparent experience, I'd wager that you've been single all your life, ~name~.
7-male_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,As much as I resent you, Guzma, I think jerking off might mellow you out a little...
7-male_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,As much as I resent you, Guzma, I think jerking off might ease your attitude a little; why, you might even be a respectable person once the pressure's been released.
7-male_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,I think masturbating might do wonders to your attitude, Guzma; it might smooth you out, if only for a moment.
7-male_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;rigged:=battleready.png,Rigged? It seems making excuses run in your organization.
7-male_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;rigged:=battleready.png,Rigged? A man of honor would admit to his shortcomings; nonetheless, I am not surprised to see such remarks, coming from you.
7-male_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;rigged:=battleready.png,You're making excuses, Guzma; you can never grow stronger if you do not learn from your defeats.
7-male_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;rigged:=battleready.png,You'd grow as a player, <i>and</i> as a trainer, if you'd acknowledge your losses and learn from them, Guzma.
7-male_masturbating,priority:466,count-role;target&character;n&timeinstage;0&sayingmarker;Refusal:,count-role;other&character;moon&stage;8:=battleready.png,Ha! What's the matter, N? Quitting on us now? That's a shame, really; I thought I respected you as a competitor.
7-male_masturbating,priority:466,count-role;target&character;n&timeinstage;0&sayingmarker;Refusal:,count-role;other&character;moon&stage;8:=battleready.png,Ha! What's the matter, N? Quitting on us now? I didn't take you for the type to <i>break rules</i> on us...
7-male_heavy_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Getting close to the end, are we Guzma?
7-male_heavy_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,You've picked up the intensity, Guzma... Getting close?
7-male_heavy_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,You've picked up the intensity, Guzma... Almost there?
7-male_heavy_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,You're picking up the pace there, Guzma; almost done?
7-male_finished_masturbating=surprised.png,Is it normal for semen to be that thick and runny? I always pictured it to be a bit more watery than that.
7-male_finished_masturbating=fingerup.png,Millions upon millions of sperms that could create human life wasted like that... No matter, you can just create more anyway.
7-male_finished_masturbating=sarcastic.png,Sperm is such a precious thing, being able to produce life... but men seem to love wasting it! And how could they not? It looks rather fun.
7-male_finished_masturbating=excited.png,It looks like it took a lot out of you, ~name~. It was well worth the pleasure, wasn't it?
7-male_finished_masturbating=excited.png,What a great way of capping of your game! I do wish it was lot less messier than this though.
7-male_finished_masturbating=sarcastic.png,Is it really a punishment if you enjoyed the experience?
7-male_finished_masturbating=excited.png,Wow, that sure took a lot of time and effort to get out! Even your penis seems tired with being erect, immediately shrinking down like that.
7-male_finished_masturbating=embarrassed.png,That was supposed to go inside a woman? It looks uncomfortably sticky.
7-male_finished_masturbating=embarrassed.png,I've heard some women likes swallowing semen. I don't see the appeal of putting a gooey substance in my mouth.

-3-male_must_masturbate,priority:312,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;last:,count-masturbating:0,count-finished:0=excited.png,Ha, as expected, Guzma; you'll never get anywhere through petty tricks!
-3-male_must_masturbate,priority:312,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;last:,count-masturbating:0,count-finished:0=excited.png,Ha, as if we expected anything else, Guzma; those in the wrong always come out short-handed.
-3-male_start_masturbating=embarrassed.png,I suppose you could use my body as a visual aid to help you in your masturbation, as long as you don't act too creepily.
-3-male_start_masturbating=embarrassed.png,I have never been in front of a naked man prior to this game, let alone a masturbating man.
-3-male_start_masturbating=embarrassed.png,For all the planning that I did, I had somehow neglected to prepare for this situation of a man masturbating while I'm exposed like this.
-3-male_start_masturbating,weight:0.2=fingerup.png,You don't mind if I watch, do you? A researcher like myself is always curious to observe the unknown.
-3-male_start_masturbating,weight:0.2=fingerup.png,Looks like it's time to get started, ~name~. Mind if I take notes?
-3-male_start_masturbating,weight:0.2=fingerup.png,Looks like it's time to get started, ~name~. Mind if I record my observations?
-3-male_start_masturbating,weight:0.2=fingerup.png,I can't help but be interested, ~name~. Mind if I peek?
-3-male_start_masturbating,weight:0.2=embarrassed.png,I can't help but be interested, ~name~. Would peeking be inappropriate?
-3-male_start_masturbating,weight:0.2=horny.png,I can't help but be interested, ~name~; I'm quite unfamiliar with the techniques guys use on their equipment.
-3-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;winner:=battleready.png,<i>A real winner?</i> You lost, Guzma; accept it.
-3-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;winner:=sarcastic.png,<i>A real winner?</i> Ha, that's funny, coming from you...
-3-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;winner:=aggressive.png,I'm the Sinnoh League champion; I <i>know</i> how a real winner does it, Guzma.
-3-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;winner:=sarcastic.png,<i>A real winner?</i> Come on, Guzma, less joking, more stroking!
-3-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;winner:=sarcastic.png,<i>A real winner?</i> Come on, Guzma, fewer jokes, more stroke!
-3-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;winner:=sarcastic.png,<i>A real winner?</i> That's a funny thing to say... <i>Guzma</i>; a <i>winner</i>... Ha!
-3-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kazuma:,id:117=surprised.png,Oh, well I suppose I was wrong; it is decently sized! Penises sure can be confusing...
-3-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kazuma:,id:117=thinking.png,Huh? It grew? But I thought... if it's that small flaccid... Surely there's some foolery here with surface area to volume ratios at play, right?
-3-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kazuma:,id:117=surprised.png,Huh? Now it's big all of a sudden? ... But it was so small just a moment ago.
-3-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kazuma:,id:117=surprised.png,Huh... They weren't kidding when they said those things got bigger...
-3-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;winner:,count-alive:2=aggressive.png,<i>A real winner?</i> Ha, you're looking at her!
-3-male_masturbating=horny.png,Watching you do that is as intense as any Pokémon battle, ~name~.
-3-male_masturbating=horny.png,Things look like they're heating up with ~name~...
-3-male_masturbating=embarrassed.png,~Name~... did you want me to... cheer you on?
-3-male_masturbating=battleready.png,Is it... enjoyable, ~name~?
-3-male_masturbating=sarcastic.png,It seems like luck would have it that I'm rather <i>bare</i> while you do that, ~name~. Rules are rules; I can't help if you take a look.
-3-male_masturbating=horny.png,Still going, ~name~? Are you liking my figure?
-3-male_masturbating=aggressive.png,Are you admiring my figure, ~name~? It's not easy maintaining a regular exercise regime with all the traveling I do.
-3-male_masturbating=embarrassed.png,I'm sorry I can't do anything to help you, ~name~... I don't mean like that... I'm still morally supporting you though...
-3-male_masturbating,weight:0.6=aggressive.png,You may have not overcome the Pokémon League, but you can be <i>my</i> champion, ~name~!
-3-male_masturbating,weight:0.6=contemplative.png,This reminds me of some perverse mythology I read about...
-3-male_masturbating,weight:0.6=contemplative.png,Mmhmmm... Yes, it's just like the first man did when the first woman wasn't in the mood...
-3-male_masturbating,weight:0.6=fingerup.png,I've studied a lot of ancient paintings, but if truth be told, the pornographic etchings were always my favorite...
-3-male_masturbating,weight:0.6=sarcastic.png,Your face... it's also the same face that some trainers would make in the heat of the battle. I suppose the excitement is just the same.
-3-male_masturbating,weight:0.6=excited.png,What exactly do you focus at when you're masturbating, ~name~? The face? Breasts? The female figure? Or just the act of being with a woman?
-3-male_masturbating,weight:0.6=sarcastic.png,Is it true that single men masturbate all the time? Based on your apparent experience, I'd wager that you've been single all your life, ~name~.
-3-male_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,As much as I resent you, Guzma, I think jerking off might mellow you out a little...
-3-male_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,As much as I resent you, Guzma, I think jerking off might ease your attitude a little; why, you might even be a respectable person once the pressure's been released.
-3-male_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,I think masturbating might do wonders to your attitude, Guzma; it might smooth you out, if only for a moment.
-3-male_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;rigged:=battleready.png,Rigged? It seems making excuses run in your organization.
-3-male_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;rigged:=battleready.png,Rigged? A man of honor would admit to his shortcomings; nonetheless, I am not surprised to see such remarks, coming from you.
-3-male_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;rigged:=battleready.png,You're making excuses, Guzma; you can never grow stronger if you do not learn from your defeats.
-3-male_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;rigged:=battleready.png,You'd grow as a player, <i>and</i> as a trainer, if you'd acknowledge your losses and learn from them, Guzma.
-3-male_masturbating,priority:466,count-role;target&character;n&timeinstage;0&sayingmarker;Refusal:,count-role;other&character;moon&stage;8:=contemplative.png,N? Wait, N, no? You're stopping? But I... <i>I was enjoying you...</i>
-3-male_heavy_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Getting close to the end, are we Guzma?
-3-male_heavy_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,You've picked up the intensity, Guzma... Getting close?
-3-male_heavy_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,You've picked up the intensity, Guzma... Almost there?
-3-male_heavy_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,You're picking up the pace there, Guzma; almost done?
-3-male_finished_masturbating=horny.png,Ahhh, your sperm! It looks... quite nice, ~name~... The way it glistens...
-3-male_finished_masturbating=horny.png,He he! That was hot, ~name~, and exactly the reason I wanted to play tonight.
-3-male_finished_masturbating=surprised.png,Is it normal for semen to be that thick and runny? I always pictured it to be a bit more watery than that.
-3-male_finished_masturbating=fingerup.png,Millions upon millions of sperms that could create human life wasted like that... No matter, you can just create more anyway.
-3-male_finished_masturbating=sarcastic.png,Sperm is such a precious thing, being able to produce life... but men seem to love wasting it! And how could they not? It looks rather fun.
-3-male_finished_masturbating=excited.png,It looks like it took a lot out of you, ~name~. It was well worth the pleasure, wasn't it?
-3-male_finished_masturbating=excited.png,What a great way of capping of your game! I do wish it was lot less messier than this though.
-3-male_finished_masturbating=sarcastic.png,Is it really a punishment if you enjoyed the experience?
-3-male_finished_masturbating=excited.png,Wow, that sure took a lot of time and effort to get out! Even your penis seems tired with being erect, immediately shrinking down like that.
-3-male_finished_masturbating=embarrassed.png,That was supposed to go inside a woman? It looks uncomfortably sticky.
-3-male_finished_masturbating=embarrassed.png,I've heard some women likes swallowing semen. I don't see the appeal of putting a gooey substance in my mouth.
-3-male_finished_masturbating=surprised.png,I thought ejaculation causes the testicles to deflate... Are you saving some semen for when you go again?
-3-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Hhgn... So that's the finale, then?
-3-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Hhgn... So all of this build up for that?
-3-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Hhgn... Oh, don't mind me; I was just expecting something a little more fierce from Guzma.
-3-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=contemplative.png,Ha, so that's the climax? <i>(It was a little underwhelming for someone like Guzma.)</i>
-3-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=contemplative.png,Ha, so that's the climax? <i>(You'd think that with Guzma, it might be a little more remarkable)</i>
-3-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;clean:,count-role;other&character;moon:=disappointed.png,Moon's right here; I'm sure she won't mind...
-3-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;clean:,count-role;other&character;moon:=disappointed.png,It looks like <i>someone</i> here might be willing to clean you off...
-3-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;clean:,count-role;other&character;moon:=disappointed.png,It looks like <i>someone</i> here might be willing to clean it off of you...

-3-male_finished_masturbating,priority:241,count-role;other&character;moon&stage;8-9:,count-role;target&character;n&saidmarker;Refusal:,marker:NDidntNut=disappointed.png,Hm? N? N... if you could get over your dispositions for just a moment, you might enjoy yourself a bit more!

N... if you could get over your dispositions for just a moment... What I'm trying to say is, it looks like your body wants some release...
-3-male_finished_masturbating,count-hairy&role;target:,count-role;other&character;moon:=disappointed.png,Oh, it looks like some of that got in your bush, ~name~... If you're going to clean that out, then I'm sure Moon would be willing to help... Unfortunately.
-3-male_finished_masturbating,count-hairy&role;target:,count-role;other&character;moon:=disappointed.png,Some of that got in your bush... If you're going to clean that out, then I'm sure Moon would be willing to help... That is, if you're brave enough to stick that thing near her.
-3-male_finished_masturbating,priority:0,count-hairy&role;target:=disappointed.png,Oh, it looks like I see specks of white in your bush now...
-3-male_finished_masturbating,priority:0,count-hairy&role;target:=fingerup.png,Oh, it looks like some of the strands got in your bush, ~name~... Let's just say it's an improvement!

-3-female_must_masturbate=happy.png,I'm just glad I survived this battle of attrition between us, ~name~. Your forfeit would be the proper reward for my efforts.
-3-female_must_masturbate=fingerup.png,For what it's worth, I didn't think you'd be able to go toe-to-toe with me, ~name~. This is till a moral victory for you.
-3-female_must_masturbate=embarrassed.png,Did you get distracted by my body, ~name~?... Not that I was being distracted by your body or anything...
-3-female_must_masturbate=aggressive.png,You really gave me quite a hard time beating you. Rewards are much sweeter when you put a lot of effort into obtaining it, and your forfeit is no different.
-3-female_must_masturbate=happy.png,That's too bad, ~name~. I thought you were doing relatively well.
-3-female_must_masturbate,weight:0.33=sarcastic.png,You know the rules, ~name~! Oh, come on, don't pretend we all didn't know this was coming.
-3-female_must_masturbate,weight:0.33=excited.png,From the stars and the ancient past, they come to play but they never last.
-3-female_must_masturbate,weight:0.33=happy.png,Well played, ~name~, but it looks like this is the end.

-3-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;nami&saying;perverts:,id:55=thinking.png,Huh? Oh, Nami... You'll give me for my assumptions, I hope?
-3-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;nami:,id:54=thinking.png,Huh? What... what are you doing, Nami?

-3-female_masturbating=excited.png,This is turning out to be more enjoyable to watch than I thought.
-3-female_masturbating=horny.png,There's something about your state right now, ~name~, that's making quite the impression on me.
-3-female_masturbating=horny.png,I have to say, I think I'm convinced; I think I'm more into women than I realized.
-3-female_masturbating=contemplative.png,Am I... <i>(Am I bisexual?)</i>
-3-female_masturbating=horny.png,It's... It's rather difficult to describe the way I'm feeling... I think... I think you're turning me on, ~name~.
-3-female_masturbating=embarrassed.png,~Name~, you're making me feel things that I... that I haven't felt before with a woman...
-3-female_masturbating=horny.png,I know I may sound... <i>bizarre</i>, but I'm finding it hard to not stare at you with intense interest, ~name~...
-3-female_masturbating=surprised.png,Wow, this is quite distracting. Not even my sharp concentration can match this display.
-3-female_masturbating=sarcastic.png,Quite the display you're putting out, ~name~. Almost as if you have experience in this type of situations.
-3-female_masturbating=embarrassed.png,I'm feeling so conflicted right now...
-3-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;starfire:=happy.png,Is that... <i>difficult</i> to do wile levitating?
-3-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;starfire:=fingerup.png,Ah, I see; since you're vulnerable while doing that, levitating will make you immune from any unexpected ground attacks.
-3-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;starfire:=happy.png,Being able to levitate like that while you masturbate must give you so much more control.
-3-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;starfire:=fingerup.png,I bet you've experimented a lot with <i>unique positions</i>, haven't you?
-3-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;elizabeth:,id:119=disappointed.png,Is that... lesbian sex, or... <i>masturbation...</i>
-3-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;elizabeth:,id:119=embarrassed.png,Two... <i>feminine figures</i> going at it is... it's so lewd...
-3-female_masturbating,count-role;target&character;elizabeth:,id:119=embarrassed.png,Two... <i>feminine figures</i> going at it is... well, let's just say I've seen some cave paintings about this...
-3-female_masturbating,oneShotId:22,priority:0,count-pubic_hair&role;target:=fingerup.png,Doesn't the hair kind of get in the way, ~name~? You should try shaving; that way, the surface is nice and smooth!
-3-female_masturbating,oneShotId:22,priority:0,count-pubic_hair&role;target:=thinking.png,I'm a little curious here, but why don't  you shave? Do you... enjoy the warmth or something on your hand when you masturbate? Is it a maintenance issue?
-3-female_finished_masturbating,weight:0.25=fingerup.png,Ha, that looked kinda fun! If this wasn't a matter of victory or defeat, I'd want to take my turn!
-3-female_finished_masturbating,weight:0.25=aggressive.png,Heh, I'll take that climax as proof of yet another victory.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,weight:0.25=excited.png,Haha! What a splash that was.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,weight:0.25=happy.png,Oh, like a waterfall...
-3-female_finished_masturbating=happy.png,Hmm, that was very nice to watch. Perhaps I should attend these type of games more often.
-3-female_finished_masturbating=horny.png,Wow, you made quite the noise there!... I wonder if men prefer women who are noisy like that. I know I do.
-3-female_finished_masturbating=horny.png,You're flush all over! That might take quite a while to subside. <i>(I wonder how long it would take for my flushness to subside.)</i>
-3-female_finished_masturbating=excited.png,Your masturbation session was definitely worth the wait, ~name~! I thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,count-role;other&character;caulifla:,id:127=thinking.png,Ha, that must have felt pretty good for you to glow like that!
-3-female_finished_masturbating,count-role;other&character;caulifla:,id:127=thinking.png,Huh? What happened, Caulifla? Is there a story behind this... <i>transformation?</i>
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:videl,id:157=happy.png,Why, there's nothing to be ashamed about, Videl!
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:videl,id:157=excited.png,Videl, there's nothing wrong with a woman who can do that; in fact, I'd say it's rather unique!

-2-male_must_masturbate=sarcastic.png,... Oh, is ~name~ out? That makes two of us then.
-2-male_must_masturbate=aggressive.png,... Are you going to join me now, ~name~? This is an interesting development...
-2-male_must_masturbate,weight:0.33=excited.png,Well well, ~name~, it's time for you to admit defeat! And it's time for <i>me</i> to claim my prize!

-2-male_must_masturbate,priority:312,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;last:,count-masturbating:0,count-finished:0=excited.png,Ha, as if we expected anything else, Guzma; those in the wrong always come out short-handed.
-2-male_start_masturbating=embarrassed.png,Mutual masturbation it is then... I don't think this is something a non-couple would normally do...
-2-male_start_masturbating=embarrassed.png,It's almost like we're having sex... but it's only imaginary... and non-contact...
-2-male_start_masturbating=embarrassed.png,I didn't anticipate to be losing at all, so sorry if I can't give much of a show for you, ~name~...
-2-male_start_masturbating,weight:0.2=fingerup.png,You don't mind if I watch, do you? A researcher like myself is always curious to observe the unknown.
-2-male_start_masturbating,weight:0.2=fingerup.png,Looks like it's time to get started, ~name~. Mind if I take notes?
-2-male_start_masturbating,weight:0.2=fingerup.png,Looks like it's time to get started, ~name~. Mind if I record my observations?
-2-male_start_masturbating,weight:0.2=fingerup.png,I can't help but be interested, ~name~. Mind if I peek?
-2-male_start_masturbating,weight:0.2=embarrassed.png,I can't help but be interested, ~name~. Would peeking be inappropriate?
-2-male_start_masturbating,weight:0.2=horny.png,I can't help but be interested, ~name~; I'm quite unfamiliar with the techniques guys use on their equipment.
-2-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;winner:=battleready.png,<i>A real winner?</i> You lost, Guzma; accept it.
-2-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;winner:=sarcastic.png,<i>A real winner?</i> Ha, that's funny, coming from you...
-2-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;winner:=aggressive.png,I'm the Sinnoh League champion; I <i>know</i> how a real winner does it, Guzma.

-2-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;winner:=sarcastic.png,<i>A real winner?</i> Come on, Guzma, fewer jokes, more stroke!
-2-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;winner:=sarcastic.png,<i>A real winner?</i> That's a funny thing to say... <i>Guzma</i>; a <i>winner</i>... Ha!
-2-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kazuma:,id:117=surprised.png,Oh, well I suppose I was wrong; it is decently sized! Penises sure can be confusing...
-2-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kazuma:,id:117=thinking.png,Huh? It grew? But I thought... if it's that small flaccid... Surely there's some foolery here with surface area to volume ratios at play, right?
-2-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kazuma:,id:117=surprised.png,Huh? Now it's big all of a sudden? ... But it was so small just a moment ago.
-2-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kazuma:,id:117=surprised.png,Huh... They weren't kidding when they said those things got bigger...
-2-male_masturbating=mast_a.png,Doing this with you, ~name~... It feels even more primal than usual.
-2-male_masturbating=embarrassed.png,Usually, my fingers are enough to pleasure me... but watching you makes me feel empty inside, ~name~...
-2-male_masturbating=happy.png,What are you imagining, ~name~? Are you thinking about me?
-2-male_masturbating=horny.png,I hope we are fantasizing about the same thing, ~name~... This could be the beginning of something special...
-2-male_masturbating=horny.png,Is this better than your usual session, ~name~? Because it is for me.
-2-male_masturbating=mast_b.png,This is the most intimate I've ever been with another man... and you're not even touching me.
-2-male_masturbating=horny.png,If it's that pleasurable when you're doing it to yourself... I can't imagine how great it would feel with the woman you love.
-2-male_masturbating=horny.png,I know it's against the rules, but I'm seriously tempted to run over there and help you, ~name~.
-2-male_masturbating=excited.png,I knew there was an outside chance of this happening, but to actually experience it... I can barely contain myself now.
-2-male_masturbating=disappointed.png,You know, if there weren't people watching us, we could have been doing more than this, ~name~.
-2-male_masturbating=mast_d.png,If I close my eyes, I can feel you coming closer to me, ~name~.
-2-male_masturbating=happy.png,And to think that I didn't want to lose... we almost missed out on this very special moment, ~name~.
-2-male_masturbating=horny.png,I've seen some ancient wine cups depicting this scenario, but the man and woman are next to each other.
-2-male_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,As much as I resent you, Guzma, I think jerking off might mellow you out a little...
-2-male_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,As much as I resent you, Guzma, I think jerking off might ease your attitude a little; why, you might even be a respectable person once the pressure's been released.
-2-male_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,I think masturbating might do wonders to your attitude, Guzma; it might smooth you out, if only for a moment.
-2-male_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;rigged:=battleready.png,Rigged? It seems making excuses run in your organization.
-2-male_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;rigged:=battleready.png,Rigged? A man of honor would admit to his shortcomings; nonetheless, I am not surprised to see such remarks, coming from you.
-2-male_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;rigged:=battleready.png,You're making excuses, Guzma; you can never grow stronger if you do not learn from your defeats.
-2-male_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;rigged:=battleready.png,You'd grow as a player, <i>and</i> as a trainer, if you'd acknowledge your losses and learn from them, Guzma.

-2-male_heavy_masturbating=shocked.png,Are you about to finish, ~name~? I want to finish the same time as you!
-2-male_heavy_masturbating=embarrassed.png,Finishing so soon, ~name~? I thought perhaps we could finish together...
-2-male_heavy_masturbating=shocked.png,Hold up, ~name~! I'm not close yet, just wait for me!
-2-male_heavy_masturbating=sarcastic.png,Oh, I thought we were going for us long as we can, ~name~!
-2-male_heavy_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Getting close to the end, are we Guzma?
-2-male_heavy_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,You've picked up the intensity, Guzma... Getting close?
-2-male_heavy_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,You've picked up the intensity, Guzma... Almost there?
-2-male_heavy_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,You're picking up the pace there, Guzma; almost done?
-2-male_finished_masturbating=horny.png,Ahhh, your sperm! It looks... quite nice, ~name~... The way it glistens...
-2-male_finished_masturbating=horny.png,He he! That was hot, ~name~, and exactly the reason I wanted to play tonight.
-2-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Hhgn... So that's the finale, then?
-2-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Hhgn... So all of this build up for that?
-2-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Hhgn... Oh, don't mind me; I was just expecting something a little more fierce from Guzma.
-2-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=contemplative.png,Ha, so that's the climax? <i>(It was a little underwhelming for someone like Guzma.)</i>
-2-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=contemplative.png,Ha, so that's the climax? <i>(You'd think that with Guzma, it might be a little more remarkable)</i>

-2-female_start_masturbating=horny.png,Perhaps we can help each other out... I meant sharing our techniques, and not actually... you know...

-2-female_heavy_masturbating=shocked.png,Are you about to finish, ~name~? I want to finish the same time as you!
-2-female_heavy_masturbating=embarrassed.png,Finishing so soon, ~name~? I thought perhaps we could finish together...

-1-male_must_masturbate=happy.png,Even though you failed to win, it was a very enjoyable game, wasn't it? Having fun should always be the priority in a game like this.
-1-male_must_masturbate=sarcastic.png,You did manage to get me out of my pants, which is more than what other men can say.
-1-male_must_masturbate=fingerup.png,You shouldn't be disappointed after giving such a strong performance. There are just times where you lose despite your best efforts.
-1-male_must_masturbate,weight:0.33=excited.png,Well well, ~name~, it's time for you to admit defeat! And it's time for <i>me</i> to claim my prize!

-1-male_start_masturbating=horny.png,I'm still feeling very flushed right now... Perhaps I'll need a long cool down period after this... 
-1-male_start_masturbating=horny.png,... It's exactly how I fantasized it... Maybe even better...
-1-male_start_masturbating=horny.png,I'm not sure if it's the hormones or the environment, but watching you like this is even more erotic that I had anticipated.
-1-male_start_masturbating,weight:0.2=fingerup.png,You don't mind if I watch, do you? A researcher like myself is always curious to observe the unknown.
-1-male_start_masturbating,weight:0.2=fingerup.png,Looks like it's time to get started, ~name~. Mind if I take notes?
-1-male_start_masturbating,weight:0.2=fingerup.png,Looks like it's time to get started, ~name~. Mind if I record my observations?
-1-male_start_masturbating,weight:0.2=fingerup.png,I can't help but be interested, ~name~. Mind if I peek?
-1-male_start_masturbating,weight:0.2=embarrassed.png,I can't help but be interested, ~name~. Would peeking be inappropriate?
-1-male_start_masturbating,weight:0.2=horny.png,I can't help but be interested, ~name~; I'm quite unfamiliar with the techniques guys use on their equipment.

-1-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kazuma:,id:117=thinking.png,Huh? It grew? But I thought... if it's that small flaccid... Surely there's some foolery here with surface area to volume ratios at play, right?
-1-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kazuma:,id:117=surprised.png,Huh? Now it's big all of a sudden? ... But it was so small just a moment ago.
-1-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;kazuma:,id:117=surprised.png,Huh... They weren't kidding when they said those things got bigger...
-1-male_masturbating=fingerup.png,Is that some pre-cum I see leaking out? Hahaha, it must be so fun doing that as a guy!

-1-male_masturbating=embarrassed.png,Oh, ha ha... Were you looking at me? It's... it's fine to look, if you want to...
-1-male_masturbating=horny.png,If staring at me helps, ~name~... Please, stare away.
-1-male_masturbating=horny.png,Are you trying to recall my masturbation session earlier, ~name~, or are you fantasizing something more primal than that, with me?
-1-male_masturbating=fingerup.png,Masturbation has a calming effect for men, right? After such an exhilarating game of high-stakes poker, a release of tension is exactly what everyone needs.
-1-male_masturbating=embarrassed.png,I'm definitely going to remember this for later... For... research purposes, I mean because... this info might prove useful to my studies.
-1-male_masturbating=aggressive.png,None of the literature I've read does this justice... This is actually more entertaining to watch than I had been led to believe.
-1-male_masturbating=thinking.png,It's more turgid than I thought... Can you bend like a glowstick, or is that anatomically impossible?
-1-male_masturbating=thinking.png,It's really stiff, like a literal pillar... Isn't there a possibility of you breaking it when you go at it like that, ~name~?
-1-male_masturbating=sarcastic.png,That hand motion is very simple. No wonder every man knows how to do it, regardless of experience.
-1-male_masturbating=contemplative.png,Some random thought: does doing that every day make your masturbation arm stronger? It has to... right?
-1-male_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,As much as I resent you, Guzma, I think jerking off might mellow you out a little...
-1-male_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,As much as I resent you, Guzma, I think jerking off might ease your attitude a little; why, you might even be a respectable person once the pressure's been released.
-1-male_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,I think masturbating might do wonders to your attitude, Guzma; it might smooth you out, if only for a moment.
-1-male_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;rigged:=battleready.png,Rigged? It seems making excuses run in your organization.
-1-male_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;rigged:=battleready.png,Rigged? A man of honor would admit to his shortcomings; nonetheless, I am not surprised to see such remarks, coming from you.
-1-male_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;rigged:=battleready.png,You're making excuses, Guzma; you can never grow stronger if you do not learn from your defeats.
-1-male_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma&saying;rigged:=battleready.png,You'd grow as a player, <i>and</i> as a trainer, if you'd acknowledge your losses and learn from them, Guzma.

-1-male_heavy_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,You've picked up the intensity, Guzma... Getting close?
-1-male_heavy_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,You've picked up the intensity, Guzma... Almost there?
-1-male_heavy_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,You're picking up the pace there, Guzma; almost done?
-1-male_finished_masturbating=horny.png,Ahhh, your sperm! It looks... quite nice, ~name~... The way it glistens...
-1-male_finished_masturbating=horny.png,He he! That was hot, ~name~, and exactly the reason I wanted to play tonight.
-1-male_finished_masturbating=surprised.png,Is it normal for semen to be that thick and runny? I always pictured it to be a bit more watery than that.
-1-male_finished_masturbating=fingerup.png,Millions upon millions of sperms that could create human life wasted like that... No matter, you can just create more anyway.
-1-male_finished_masturbating=sarcastic.png,Sperm is such a precious thing, being able to produce life... but men seem to love wasting it! And how could they not? It looks rather fun.
-1-male_finished_masturbating=excited.png,It looks like it took a lot out of you, ~name~. It was well worth the pleasure, wasn't it?
-1-male_finished_masturbating=excited.png,What a great way of capping of your game! I do wish it was lot less messier than this though.
-1-male_finished_masturbating=sarcastic.png,Is it really a punishment if you enjoyed the experience?
-1-male_finished_masturbating=excited.png,Wow, that sure took a lot of time and effort to get out! Even your penis seems tired with being erect, immediately shrinking down like that.
-1-male_finished_masturbating=embarrassed.png,That was supposed to go inside a woman? It looks uncomfortably sticky.
-1-male_finished_masturbating=embarrassed.png,I've heard some women likes swallowing semen. I don't see the appeal of putting a gooey substance in my mouth.
-1-male_finished_masturbating=surprised.png,I thought ejaculation causes the testicles to deflate... Are you saving some semen for when you go again?
-1-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Hhgn... So that's the finale, then?
-1-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Hhgn... So all of this build up for that?
-1-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=sarcastic.png,Hhgn... Oh, don't mind me; I was just expecting something a little more fierce from Guzma.
-1-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=contemplative.png,Ha, so that's the climax? <i>(It was a little underwhelming for someone like Guzma.)</i>
-1-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;guzma:=contemplative.png,Ha, so that's the climax? <i>(You'd think that with Guzma, it might be a little more remarkable)</i>

-1-female_must_masturbate=fingerup.png,I really thought you'd win this game, ~name~. Perhaps, you'll win in the next game instead. Defeats makes you a better player after all.
-1-female_must_masturbate=fingerup.png,I know the feeling quite well. I used to lose a lot when I was younger. You get a lot better with experience though, if you learn from your previous mistakes.
-1-female_must_masturbate=embarrassed.png,I hope my nudity didn't cause you to lose... That would be very awkward indeed.

-1-female_masturbating,priority:0,test:~background.time~:day=happy.png,You can use me as inspiration, ~name~; I normally wouldn't be saying this, but I feel like a new self today.
-1-female_masturbating,priority:0,test:~background.time~:night=happy.png,You can use me as inspiration, ~name~; I normally wouldn't be saying this, but I feel like a new self tonight.
-1-female_finished_masturbating=happy.png,Did I look like that when I was climaxing? No wonder you couldn't take your eyes off me, ~name~.
-1-female_finished_masturbating=horny.png,That was <i>so</i> good! Almost makes me want to masturbate again... I wonder if the rules would even allow that.
-1-female_finished_masturbating=horny.png,I couldn't even decide what to look at. Everything about that display looked <i>so</i> arousing.
-1-female_finished_masturbating=excited.png,No doubt about it now. I should do this more often with other women.
-1-female_finished_masturbating=happy.png,I can finally understand why men enjoy watching these type of shows. I can't believe it took me this long to realize.
-1-female_finished_masturbating,weight:0.25=excited.png,Haha! What a splash that was.
-1-female_finished_masturbating,weight:0.25=happy.png,Oh, like a waterfall...
-1-female_finished_masturbating,count-role;other&character;caulifla:,id:127=thinking.png,Ha, that must have felt pretty good for you to glow like that!
-1-female_finished_masturbating,count-role;other&character;caulifla:,id:127=thinking.png,Huh? What happened, Caulifla? Is there a story behind this... <i>transformation?</i>
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:videl,id:157=happy.png,Why, there's nothing to be ashamed about, Videl!
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:videl,id:157=excited.png,Videl, there's nothing wrong with a woman who can do that; in fact, I'd say it's rather unique!




#SELF MASTURBATING
#If your character is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must masturbate.
#These lines only come up in the relevant stages, so you don't need to include the stage numbers here. Just remember which stage is which when you make the images. The "starting" image is still in the naked stage.
#The "finished_masturbating" line will repeat many times if the game is not yet finished. This plays as opponents comment on the how good their hands are.

-3-must_masturbate_first=disappointed.png,Ahh, so I'm the first on the chopping block... How low has this champion sunk...
-3-must_masturbate_first=embarrassed.png,Not only could I not win, but I... I'm the first to lose...
-3-must_masturbate_first=shocked.png,This can't be?! How did I lose first?!
-3-must_masturbate_first=shocked.png,I'm l-l-last place?! Even after I maximized my layer count?!
-3-must_masturbate_first=sarcastic.png,Well, well, well. Despite my layer count advantage, I'm still the first to lose. Goes to show that you shouldn't underestimate your opponents.
-3-must_masturbate_first=disappointed.png,Needless to say, this didn't go as well as my Pokémon battles.
-3-must_masturbate_first=excited.png,Only one thing left for me to do now. Oh, don't let me distract everybody; I'm eager to find out who would win this game.
-3-must_masturbate_first,priority:0,count-exposed:-0,weight:3=shocked.png,So, not only am I the first to lose it all, but there's no one else is exposed... That means <i>all</i> eyes will be on me...
-3-must_masturbate_first,priority:0,count-exposed:-0,weight:3=shocked.png,So, not only am I the first to lose it all, but there's no one else is exposed... That means I'm the... {small}f-focus of everyone's attention...{!reset}
-3-must_masturbate=disappointed.png,Well, it appears that this is the end for me... I never thought it would come to this, but the rules must be respected.
-3-must_masturbate=disappointed.png,Damn... If I have to masturbate, I would have at least wanted some cute boys watching...
-3-must_masturbate=scowling.png,No! Defeat is taste I've come to loathe...
-3-must_masturbate=happy.png,You win some and you lose some. I had a lot of fun regardless, and that's what we came for.
-3-must_masturbate=contemplative.png,I knew my layer count can only take me so far. I did learn a lot today, so perhaps I'll be victorious next time.
-3-must_masturbate=happy.png,Perhaps I need to brush up a bit on my poker strategies. Fortunately, I learned a lot for this game, albeit a little too late.
-3-must_masturbate=sarcastic.png,Truth be told, I've been feeling a bit tense the past couple of rounds. Hopefully, masturbation will allow me to relax, even for a little bit.
-3-must_masturbate=fingerup.png,I'm genuinely impressed; you beat me fair and square. Now for my punishment...
-3-must_masturbate=excited.png,It can't be helped. I know it doesn't mean much, but I gave my best,
-3-must_masturbate,priority:0,count-alive&role;opp:1=shocked.png,What? No! <i>Nooo!</i> I was <i>so</i> close!
-3-must_masturbate,priority:0,count-male&role;opp&var;:1-4=disappointed.png,Well, it appears that this is the end for me... I never thought it would come to this, but the rules must be respected.
-3-must_masturbate,priority:0,count-male&role;opp&var;:1-4=horny.png,Well, I may have lost... but at least ~male~ will be watching me! That's a turn on, at least.
-3-start_masturbating=mast_start.png,I came here thinking this would be a walk in the park... Little did I know it would come to this.
-3-start_masturbating=mast_start.png,Well, here goes nothing...
-3-start_masturbating=mast_start.png,Who knows, maybe jilling off in public will come naturally to me, h-hee-eh...
-3-start_masturbating=mast_start.png,I've never touched myself with an audience, h-hee ehh... *<i>gulp</i>*
-3-start_masturbating=mast_start.png,With my schedule being very busy lately, I've been finding it more difficult to get some alone time for this.
-3-start_masturbating=mast_start.png,I needed this. I haven't done this lately,
-3-start_masturbating=mast_start.png,I've always wondered how often my friends would do this.
-3-start_masturbating=mast_start.png,I can't tell if having people watch me is making this situation better or worse...
-3-start_masturbating=mast_start.png,This is probably what you've been waiting for, isn't it?
-3-start_masturbating=mast_start.png,It can take a while for me to get in the proper mood, so please bear with me.
-3-start_masturbating=mast_start.png,I need the proper mindset for this, so please don't say anything that would make me self-conscious.
-3-start_masturbating,priority:0,count-alive&role;opp:1=mast_start.png,I... y-yes, I'll masturbate, j-just... give me some time to... get over... my defeat.


#masturbating
-2-masturbating=excited.png,What, am I impressing you guys? I figured, if I'm going to masturbate, I might as well do it like a champion!
-2-masturbating=excited.png,You guys seem to be staring an awful lot. That's okay though; I never aim for short of perfection in all things.
-2-masturbating=aggressive.png,It looks like I'm turning a few heads... No, you can keep looking, if you want...
-2-masturbating=aggressive.png,Y-you like my technique? Well, I'm a champion, after all; I suppose you could say that I don't settle for anything less than perfect.
-2-masturbating=mast_d.png,I'm still a little perturbed by my defeat, but having to do this... it isn't that bad of a punishment.
-2-masturbating=sarcastic.png,I wouldn't say I'm <i>enjoying</i> myself, but I'm... well... Okay, maybe I am enjoying myself.
-2-masturbating=mast_a.png,Doing this with an audience is not something I'm used to, but the technique seems to be the same.
-2-masturbating=mast_b.png,It feels good... when I go deeper...
-2-masturbating=mast_c.png,I've developed my masturbation technique when I was still a teen.
-2-masturbating=mast_d.png,I can feel the blood running all over my body.
-2-masturbating=horny.png,I've never used any toys. My fingers can make me climax just as well.
-2-masturbating=happy.png,i used to do this more often during my teens.
-2-masturbating=happy.png,Good thing I had trimmed my nails before going here. I didn't expect to lose, but it always pays off to be safe.
-2-masturbating=fingerup.png,There aren't as many artifacts showing female masturbation compared to male masturbation, but they do exist.
-2-masturbating=mast_e.png,Kneeling like this makes my climax stronger than when I'm sitting down.
-2-masturbating=disappointed.png,I've heard that some women can climax multiple times in a row. I've tried doing it but it didn't really feel good anymore after the first climax.
-2-masturbating=mast_b.png,... That's the spot...
-2-masturbating=mast_c.png,I hope you don't mind if I stretch this out a bit...
-2-masturbating=mast_d.png,I'm not... <i>Ahh!</i>... in a hurry... to finish... when it feels this good...
-2-masturbating=mast_a.png,I'm leaking a bit more than usual... as if my body is sending an invitation to everybody, heh...
-2-masturbating=horny.png,Funnily enough, I discovered masturbation when I was scratching an itch down there and it felt good... really good...
-2-masturbating=fingerup.png,I'm rather fond of humping my pillow... I even have a special pillow for humping...
-2-masturbating=mast_e.png,... <i>Hmm</i>... I can feel every inch of my fingers inside me...
-2-masturbating=mast_d.png,... Yes!... <i>Ahh</i>... I can feel every inch of my body heating up...
-2-masturbating=horny.png,I found my retractable shower head to be perfect for this... with the right pressure settings, I don't last long...
-2-masturbating=embarrassed.png,Dawn walked in on me once... That's why I never forget to lock my doors...
-2-masturbating=sarcastic.png,I bet a lot of people back home would pay anything just to see me like this.
-2-masturbating=mast_c.png,When I was in college, I would do this often my roommate are out.
-2-masturbating=disappointed.png,I don't get to do this as often as I would like, with my busy schedule and all...
-2-masturbating=embarrassed.png,The thin walls at my villa gives me too much information about my guest's nocturnal activities.
-2-masturbating=embarrassed.png,I've never had anyone watch me masturbate before, especially in a place like this...
-2-masturbating=mast_a.png,I'm not imagining anyone in particular... My mind tends to wander towards the experience itself.
-2-masturbating=mast_b.png,Finding more alone time should be my top priority after this.
-2-masturbating=mast_c.png,I'm getting warmer...
-2-masturbating=mast_d.png,This circular finger motion is my go-to technique,
-2-masturbating=mast_e.png,It's not getting started that's difficult, it's finishing.
-2-masturbating=mast_a.png,It would begin to chafe if I took too long to finish...
-2-masturbating=mast_d.png,I prefer massaging the hood than stimulating it directly. It's a bit too much for me.
-2-masturbating=mast_e.png,I can never get the hang of using both hands at the same time. It's just too overwhelming for me.
-2-masturbating=embarrassed.png,Having people watch makes this feel dirtier than it already is.
-2-masturbating=thinking.png,Maybe I should try one of those Lopunny-shaped vibrators I keep seeing on the Internet.
-2-masturbating=mast_a.png,I need to let go and just enjoy the moment...
-2-masturbating=mast_e.png,... This ribbed spot is my favorite to rub...
-2-masturbating=aggressive.png,Cherish this moment... This might be the only time you'll see me like this.
-2-masturbating=happy.png,It's interesting: masturbating is something I often do when I need to take the edge off and mellow myself out; and as it turns out, getting worked up over to~background.time()~'s game had built up a lot of stress in me!
-2-masturbating,priority:0,count-masturbating&female&role;opp&var;:1-5,weight:5=happy.png,Ah, keep it up, ~female~; you're giving me some inspiration!
-2-masturbating,priority:0,count-masturbating&female&role;opp&var;:1-5,weight:5=horny.png,Oh, could you maybe... <i>spread your legs</i> a bit more, ~female~? Heh heh, it's arousing to look at...
-2-masturbating,priority:0,count-masturbating&female&role;opp&var;:1-5,weight:5=horny.png,Oh my, ~female~, it sounds like you're pretty wet...
-2-masturbating,priority:0,count-masturbating&male&var;:1-5,weight:5=happy.png,Ah, keep pumping away, ~male~; you're really helping me out here!
-2-masturbating,priority:0,count-masturbating&male&var;:1-5,weight:5=horny.png,Keep it up, ~male~! You can watch me if I can watch you, deal?
-2-masturbating,priority:0,count-masturbating&male&var;:1-5,weight:5=mast_a.png,I hope you're okay with me watching you go, ~male~; you're really helping me out here!
-2-masturbating,priority:0,count-masturbating&male&var;:1-5,weight:5=mast_b.png,<i>(The way ~male~'s dick twitches, and how the tip pokes above his hand before being covered again... Mmmm...)</i>
-2-heavy_masturbating=heavy_a.png,... I feel like a cannon... <i>ready to be fired</i>...
-2-heavy_masturbating=heavy_b.png,...
-2-heavy_masturbating=heavy_c.png,... Why do I... get the urge to pee...?
-2-heavy_masturbating=heavy_a.png,... I... can't control... my... breathing...
-2-heavy_masturbating=heavy_b.png,...I can... I can... mind...
-2-heavy_masturbating=heavy_c.png,I can feel it coming...!
-2-heavy_masturbating=heavy_a.png,This ribbed part... <i>Ahh</i>... That feels so good...!
-2-heavy_masturbating=heavy_b.png,Everything I touch feels amazing...!
-2-heavy_masturbating=heavy_c.png,... My fingers are so warm...
-2-heavy_masturbating=heavy_a.png,OH!... I can feel a strong one coming...!
-2-finishing_masturbating=finishing.png,AHHHHHH!
-2-finishing_masturbating=finishing.png,I-I-'M CU-C-C-CUMMING!
-2-finishing_masturbating=finishing.png,AHHH THAT'S <i>IIIIIIIIIT</i>!
-2-finishing_masturbating=finishing.png,OOOHHHH!


#finished
-1-finished_masturbating=happy.png,That... that felt stupendous.
-1-finished_masturbating=happy.png,... I need some quite to catch my breath... if you don't mind...
-1-finished_masturbating=embarrassed.png,Did... did I scream back there?... Apologies for that; I tried to contain myself.
-1-finished_masturbating=thinking.png,Somehow, being watched made it more pleasurable. Very interesting...
-1-finished_masturbating=sarcastic.png,Well, that's one thing off the bucket list. Not that it was part of my bucket list in the first place or anything...
-1-finished_masturbating=horny.png,I feel more fatigued than when I'm biking up the mountains.
-1-finished_masturbating=excited.png,I... I'm still quivering... What a rush!
-1-finished_masturbating=happy.png,You won't believe how much I needed that. I already feel lighter and less tense now.
-1-after_masturbating=happy.png,As ashamed as I am to have lost, I think this was overall an enjoyable experience!
-1-after_masturbating=aggressive.png,I may be out this time, but I'll be back for a rematch!
-1-after_masturbating=happy.png,I learned a lot about myself tonight, and that's more important than winning and losing!
-1-after_masturbating=sarcastic.png,That's not something I thought I would do... <i>(But I wouldn't mind doing it again.)</i>
-1-after_masturbating=embarrassed.png,I hope nobody back home hears about this... I would never be able to leave the villa again if that happens.
-1-after_masturbating=embarrassed.png,I hope I didn't distract anybody with my forfeit.
-1-after_masturbating=sarcastic.png,My mind is still cloudy. Perhaps another session might help clear my mind... Ah, but not before this game is over!
-1-after_masturbating=disappointed.png,I'm feeling very sticky right now. Can I walk out for a minute and take a bath?... No? Alright, after this game, then.
-1-after_masturbating=excited.png,I must say, I enjoyed that more than I thought I would.
-1-after_masturbating=embarrassed.png,<i>(I hope I didn't say anything too inappropriate back there.).</i>
-1-after_masturbating=fingerup.png,If your legs feel tired after masturbating, try wiggling your toes. That helps a lot for me.
-1-after_masturbating=embarrassed.png,<i>(What got onto me back there?)</i>
-1-after_masturbating=happy.png,I bet all of you got what you wanted: The Champion of Sinnoh putting on quite the show for you.
-1-after_masturbating=disappointed.png,What happened in this place stays in this place, alright?
-1-after_masturbating=embarrassed.png,Everyone here can keep secrets, I trust. I would prefer if details of my involvement in this game doesn't become public knowledge.
-1-after_masturbating,priority:0,test:~background.time~:day=excited.png,I learned a lot about myself today, and that's more important than winning and losing!
-1-after_masturbating,priority:0,test:~background.time~:night=excited.png,I learned a lot about myself tonight, and that's more important than winning and losing!




#GAME OVER
#Lines spoken after the overall winner has been decided and all the losers have finished their forfeits.

#fully clothed
0-game_over_victory=happy.png,A flawless victory! I didn't even think that was possible in poker, but I suppose I shouldn't be selling myself short.
0-game_over_victory=thinking.png,Well, that went quicker than I expected... I wonder if there are any tables that are still looking for player at this point.
0-game_over_victory=aggressive.png,Not to brag or anything, but this is exactly how most of my Pokémon challenges go.
0-game_over_victory,weight:0.5=fingerup.png,Ha! Another victory under the belt.
0-game_over_victory,weight:0.5=aggressive.png,Ha! I didn't become the Sinnoh League champion for nothing.

1-game_over_victory,weight:0.5=aggressive.png,Victory; an expected result, really.
1-game_over_victory=sarcastic.png,You did get me to lose once... Most of my Pokémon battles didn't even have <i>that</i> to brag about.
1-game_over_victory=happy.png,Not quite the perfect game, but not every victory has to be perfect, right?
1-game_over_victory=fingerup.png,I did have one loss... Perhaps, you should try forming your strategy around that round.


#lost scarf
2-game_over_victory,weight:0.5=fingerup.png,Ha! Another victory under the belt.
2-game_over_victory,weight:0.5=aggressive.png,Ha! I didn't become the Sinnoh League champion for nothing.
2-game_over_victory,weight:0.5=aggressive.png,Victory; an expected result, really.
2-game_over_victory=disappointed.png,Perhaps I should have sandbagged a bit. I appear to have overdone it.
2-game_over_victory=happy.png,Did everyone have fun? Because I sure did!
2-game_over_victory=fingerup.png,Hopefully, everybody learnt a bit of poker strategy from my game. You never know, you might beat me in a rematch!


#lost shoes
3-game_over_victory=contemplative.png,A win's a win, but this was a little <i>too</i> close for comfort.
3-game_over_victory=happy.png,Thank Palkia I didn't have to remove my top. That gave me quite the scare back there.
3-game_over_victory=excited.png,That was quite the exciting game I was looking for! Scintillating, but I didn't get embarrassed in the end.
3-game_over_victory,weight:0.5=fingerup.png,Ha! Another victory under the belt.
3-game_over_victory,weight:0.5=aggressive.png,Ha! I didn't become the Sinnoh League champion for nothing.

4-game_over_victory,weight:0.5=aggressive.png,Ha! I didn't become the Sinnoh League champion for nothing.
4-game_over_victory,weight:0.5=aggressive.png,Victory; an expected result, really.
4-game_over_victory=fingerup.png,My victory wasn't much of a surprise, but the fact that I lost this much wasn't expected. My mistake for underestimating my opponents.
4-game_over_victory=happy.png,That was more challenging than I thought. For a fleeting moment there, I thought I might reveal more than I had prepared for.
4-game_over_victory=sarcastic.png,I'm getting a feeling of pride and accomplishment from winning this game. To think that I didn't even have to spend anything to win.


#lost pants
5-game_over_victory,weight:0.5=fingerup.png,Ha! Another victory under the belt.
5-game_over_victory,weight:0.5=aggressive.png,Ha! I didn't become the Sinnoh League champion for nothing.
5-game_over_victory,weight:0.5=aggressive.png,Victory; an expected result, really.
5-game_over_victory=battleready.png,You did manage to get my clothes off. Merely taking a Champion this far is an accomplishment in itself.
5-game_over_victory=happy.png,Great game, everybody! This wound up being more nerve-wracking than expected, but I had fun throughout!
5-game_over_victory=fingerup.png,Even though I won, this victory wasn't as convincing as I would have thought. Goes to show that I still have a lot to learn about poker. 


#lost pantyhose
6-game_over_victory=aggressive.png,And that's all she wrote... this game took much longer than I had planned for, truth be told.
6-game_over_victory=happy.png,I'm just relieved this game ended before I had to show anything indecent. I was becoming very worried back there.
6-game_over_victory=sarcastic.png,Not quite the dominant victory I had anticipated. I still have much to learn, so don't expect it to got this far next time.
6-game_over_victory,weight:0.5=fingerup.png,Ha! Another victory under the belt.
6-game_over_victory,weight:0.5=aggressive.png,Ha! I didn't become the Sinnoh League champion for nothing.
6-game_over_victory,weight:0.5=aggressive.png,Victory; an expected result, really.
6-game_over_victory,test:~background.water~:true=happy.png,I'm practically in my swimsuit right now, so might as well jump in the water. Anyone want to join me? How about you, ~player~?
6-game_over_victory,test:~background.water~:true=happy.png,I'd say that my lingerie is perfect for a little ~background~ swim. Care to join me, ~player~?


#lost bra
7-game_over_victory,weight:0.5=fingerup.png,Ha! Another victory under the belt.
7-game_over_victory,weight:0.5=aggressive.png,Ha! I didn't become the Sinnoh League champion for nothing.
7-game_over_victory,weight:0.5=aggressive.png,Victory; an expected result, really.
7-game_over_victory=disappointed.png,I suppose I can consider this as a half-loss, since I shouldn't have fallen this far.
7-game_over_victory=excited.png,That was much more challenging than I would have thought! Maybe I should play here more often to improve my skills.
7-game_over_victory=happy.png,What a game! I haven't had this much fun in quite a while! Let's do this again some time.


#naked
-3-game_over_victory,weight:0.5=fingerup.png,Ha! Another victory under the belt.
-3-game_over_victory,weight:0.5=aggressive.png,Ha! I didn't become the Sinnoh League champion for nothing.
-3-game_over_victory,weight:0.5=aggressive.png,Victory; an expected result, really.
-3-game_over_victory=disappointed.png,On one hand, I won. On the other hand, I'm naked in front of everybody. this doesn't feel much like winning.
-3-game_over_victory=embarrassed.png,... Can I put my clothes back on now? This is enough nudity for me for the entire year.
-3-game_over_victory=happy.png,Minus the "me ending up naked" part, this is exactly how I expected this game to go.


#finished
game_over_defeat=battleready.png,... It... it's fine... I've already come to terms with my defeat, <i>which is why I want a rematch!</i>
game_over_defeat=battleready.png,I don't handle defeat well, ~target~; perhaps you would be up for a rematch?
game_over_defeat=battleready.png,Ah, so it seems ~target~ is the winner... Would you entertain the idea of a rematch, ~target~?
game_over_defeat=aggressive.png,As a champion, I cannot just accept my defeat. I will be ready for our rematch at the earliest possible moment!
game_over_defeat=aggressive.png,Don't make the mistake that this will be the last you see of me, ~target~. I won't be giving up this easily. 
game_over_defeat=aggressive.png,That's one win you got on me, ~target~. Now the question is: will you beat me again the next time we play.
game_over_defeat=fingerup.png,Well, I'm just a human after all. You can't expect to win every game you play in, especially a card game like this.
game_over_defeat=excited.png,Poker is a completely different beast from Pokémon battling, it seems. Well, no matter, I'll just have to improve my game from this point onwards.
game_over_defeat=happy.png,This is something I don't experience often, and I will make sure I won't experience it again.
game_over_defeat=fingerup.png,This was quite the learning experience for me. Next time we play, I will make sure this wouldn't happen again to me.
game_over_defeat=happy.png,This was quite the unique experience, I have to say. I ope I can find some free time in the future to play again.
game_over_defeat,priority:0,count-:3=thinking.png,... Best two out of three? Or, with three players, that's a... best two out of... four?
game_over_defeat,priority:0,count-:4=thinking.png,... Best two out of three? Or, with four players, that's a... best two out of... five?
game_over_defeat,priority:0,count-:5=thinking.png,... Best two out of three? Or, with five players, that's a... best two out of... six?

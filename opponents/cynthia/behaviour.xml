                <state img="#-fingerup.png" marker="JessieQuesCreation2">I must warn you that this a rather lengthy but gripping story, Jessie, but you can tell me to stop any time if you want. To preface, this came from an ancient manuscript that preceded all of the current political entities. Anyway, here's the story: Stewie already has a time machine built in which he uses to go back in time to get back and embarrass Brian. When Brian finds out, they fight in the time machine, pressing random buttons and switches which makes the machine glitch. It transports them outside of the space-time continuum; non-existence; no past, present, or future; no universe; a blank canvas. Stewie has his return pad that will bring them back to wherever they want to go by locking on to their coordinates. However, it operates on the laws of physics and since they are outside the space-time continuum, there are no laws of physics; they can create their own physics. The only way to get back home is taking a risk that could result in their deaths: overloading the return pad‚Äôs reactor to release enough energy to blow them back into the universe. The explosion is successful in propelling them back into reality. A few days later, Stewie brings Brian a diagram of the Big Bang Theory‚Äôs cosmic background radiation compared to the energy spectrum of the return pad and they match exactly. This means that the return pad‚Äôs explosion was the Big Bang. Stewie explains that time and space didn‚Äôt exist before their explosion as they were outside the space-continuum. This is due to a temporal causality loop where the universe created Stewie so he could create the universe, so it could create him and on and on. We are then introduced to a character, Bertram, who finds out about Stewie‚Äôs time machine and uses it to go back in time to kill Leonardo Da Vinci, Stewie‚Äôs ancestor, essentially killing Stewie and erasing him from history. This creates ripples in time in the present that originated from the past. Although this wouldn‚Äôt happen with an ordinary person ceasing to exist, Stewie was the one who created the universe. By erasing him from history, he wouldn‚Äôt be there to create the universe, meaning it never existed. To stop this, Stewie and Brian travel back to before Bertram killed his ancestor. Stewie and Bertram‚Äôs history goes far back, as they are both children of Peter. Therefore, Bertram couldn‚Äôt just kill Peter or a recent ancestor on Peter‚Äôs side as he too would cease to exist, so he had to go back enough generations to snuff Stewie‚Äôs genus without snuffing out his own. Bertram finally arrives and him and Stewie begin to battle each other for Da Vinci‚Äôs life. Bertram succeeds in killing Da Vinci where after Stewie also kills Bertram. However, Stewie and Brian are still alive, meaning there is still a chance of him being born. He must have done or will do something to save the universe. He figures since Da Vinci‚Äôs DNA is inside of him, he himself can pass it on, taking Da Vinci‚Äôs place. This is a large chance but the only way to find out is to send Brian back to the present. When Brian arrives, everything is still intact, meaning Stewie succeeded. Brian receives a letter from The Vatican that was left by ‚ÄúDa Vinci‚Äù 500 years ago. It reads that Stewie placed himself into a cryogenic stasis device and is buried in the basement of their home. Brian goes to dig him up and sure enough Stewie is there. </state>

It's said to lurk in another world... A world on the opposite side of ours...It's said that in the Distortion World, neither time nor space were stable. I think that tells us something about Giratina, the only Pok√©mon there. It must have been as powerful as Dialga and Palkia, the rulers of time and space. In some way, though, Giratina has to have a power opposite of theirs. I'm sorry this is so long. May I say one last bit? Dialga's Roar of Time...Palkia's Spacial Rend...To the people back then, those Pok√©mon really must have appeared to rule over time and space. Seeing them must have shaken the people to their very core. Those feelings of awe, wonder, and everything else. It passed that memory to countless people, eventually becoming a myth...That's what I believe as a researcher of myths. I think I let myself get carried away and talked for far too long.

        <title>Susie's Mixtape</title>
        <subtitle>One of Many</subtitle>
        <text>A fast and thrilling mix tape with energising songs with break-neck beats. Features a mix of popular mid-90s pop and indie rock songs. Feels oddly new and warm despite the worn down label and smelling faintly of blood.

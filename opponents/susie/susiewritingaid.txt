**SUSIE'S CHARACTERISTICS AND STUFF**

- Shy and slightly naive
- Very cheerful and supportive to others when she is confident enough.
- Delinquent
- Insecure about her looks, like how she thinks her braces make her look bad or about her weight (she's a bit thicker than other people). 
- Popular, but only because she's best friends with Julie.  She's really just an awkward mess towards people without Julie to do the charming for her.
- She's a killer who *doesn't* want to kill, and tries to let survivors go if she has the chance. 
- Interest in video games, and her favourite game is the first Legend of Zelda.
- Born and raised in the late 80s-early 90s, so make your dumbest 90s references that I won't get since I was born in 2000.
- The worst thing she did under the Legion moniker before the Entity was burning down their town's movie theater. 
- In reality, she's just a normal girl who was pushed around into the wrong social circle and now has to literally sacrifice to an occult god as a follower.
- Has a nervous tick where she touches her choker (fan headcanons be blessed) 
- Pines after Julie and Joey like a tree.

**IMPORTANT THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT THE ENTITY, THE FOG, AND THE LEGION**

~~ ~~ ~~ ~~ ~~ ~~ ~~

**THE ENTITY**

- The Entity is an eldritch deity that spans many universes, realities, and times. Despite being all-powerful, it still needs to feed on things to keep on going. Therefore, it made its own pocket reality where it kidnaps people from all over in order to feed on it's favourite emotions: their hope, despair, and pain. The thing is, the Entity is a lazy bitch and can't bother to do it itself. Instead, it also finds people in very bad situations and transforms them into killers, with varying degrees of torture to the more unwilling subjects (think Trapper and Nurse compared to someone like Ghostface or Clown). The most important thing to know is that most of the Killers are just *as* much of a victim as the survivors are, maybe even more so.
- The Entity grants killers supernatural strength and powers to become more deadly and powerful (or that's what they want you to think, at least). This gives them the power to break steel-reinforced pallets, walls, and damage generators in two kicks (or something else, if the killer has a unique breaking animation; the Oni straight up punches walls to break them) and gives the more "frailer" killers the strength to pick up people and bring them to hooks. 
- Unsurprisingly, the Entity also has a few cults around it from even as early as medieval France (I mean, The Entity has also gotten a plague-infested priestess from Babylonian times into its cult of killers so...) Also unsurprisingly, people have tried to defeat the Entity before. Some of the newer survivors' parents were actually part of an occult group dedicated to fighting it.

**THE FOG**

- The pocket dimension that the Entity made for it's dinner table is called the Fog, and involves a few layers to our knowledge (or circles, like in Dante's Inferno); the first layer, where the Entity resides; the second layer, where the killers, survivors, and realms are kept; the third layer, where Observer is presumably hiding in; and the fourth and final layer, known as the void, where empty husks of past survivors without anymore hope lie. They're not yet dead, being able to still experience pain and the overwhelming energy of the Entity. While there is no canon for how the realms work in the second layer, I really like the world system that Ziracona made for her fanfiction, *In Living Memory* (which is also where I got some characterization for Susie from) which makes the killers have their own realm that they cannot leave without the help of Vigo's Hatch, minus the Clown and Ghostface, who are allowed to travel through realms freely. 
- Speaking of realms, The Legion's realm is a recreation of the abandoned skiing lodge in their then-hometown of Ormond, Alberta that they took over as their base. 
- In the Fog, there are also things called 'trials', in which, four survivors are chosen to complete five generators with limited defences against the (not-so) bloodthirsty killers. The killers can put them on sacrificial meat hooks with a three-strikes-you're-out system to sacrifice the survivors. Trials vary from person-to-person, but I hope to stream some Dead by Daylight (or share gameplay) to show how trials work in general.

**THE LEGION**

- The names of the individual Legion members are Frank, Julie, Susie, and Joey; creatively named by the Devs to be FJSJ for short. Frank is the leader and the person who indoctrinated all of them into the delinquent lifestyle with a checkered past of being an home-hopping orphan who craves attention. Julie is Susie's best friend, Frank's girlfriend, and a popular party girl in their small town that she wants to leave badly. Joey is a friend to Susie and Julie, and is an easily excitable and proud person who tries his best to look cool in front of everyone. 
- The Legion is the name of their little gang they made. They did petty crime, bullying, and vandalism under the Legion name, all wearing masks that make them feel free. Well, that's the case for the other three Legion members (Frank, Julie, and Joey). Susie canonically didn't want to hurt anyone, and it's heavily implied that she and Joey were peer-pressured into doing most things by Julie and Frank in order to impress them, as they were some of the more popular kids in their small highschool. When they accidentally murdered the janitor, they were vandalizing a store to bring justice to Joey, as he was unfairly fired from the store after the manager accused him of stealing a bar of chocolate. The janitor grabbed Julie and threatened them with stabbing her, but Frank was faster and stabbed him with the hunting knife he had. After that, Joey and Julie joined Frank in stabbing him in the chest, and Frank forced Susie to stab the man in the neck, sealing his fate. After that, they were taken by the Entity after burying the janitor's body in the snow near the lodge, where they became killers for it. 
- They were kidnapped by the Entity in a period around 1995-ish. 
- They can either be viewed as four people in one body due to Entity shenanigans, or they can be separated from each other but are forced into separate realms (which is the worse bullshit I've heard from the devs about the Legion). I *really* liked the idea of having them in one body, so I took that aspect with Susie here.  They can also swap between each other with enough energy or the Entity's help (which I think is what they use when you switch outfits to swap between the members). 
- The Legion has a power called Feral Frenzy, which puts the survivors into the "deep wound/mending" state when they hit a survivor. In-game, it is nothing more than a slight nuisance, so that's why Susie tells people that her stabs don't actually hurt that much. It also has a wicked crash, when they miss a stab/stay in it for more than 10 seconds, which makes their vision turn black and forces them to recover. I picture this as a really shitty migraine that's enough to make them stare at their hands for four seconds lol.

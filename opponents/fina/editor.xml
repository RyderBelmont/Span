        <note id="1384">The Orb of Serenity is actually worth less than the three legendary Idols in Skies of Arcadia, but those are obtained in a completely different way depending on whether you're playing the Dreamcast original or the Gamecube remake, and I don't want to figure out how to handle that.</note>
        <note id="1466">It's because she doesn't get a Switch game, or any other new games or even remakes, because Sega sucks. You heard me, Sega!</note>
        <note id="814">If you reply to this case, make sure ~taken.id~ isn't anywhere in your conditions as it will break your response. You can replace it with your character's id (to ensure that Fina is addressing them), or remove it completely if you don't care whether Fina is talking to them or not.</note>
        <note id="132">If you reply to this case, make sure ~lonely.id~ isn't anywhere in your conditions as it will break your response. You can replace it with your character's id (to ensure that Fina is addressing them), or remove it completely if you don't care whether Fina is talking to them or not.</note>
        <note id="1537">If you reply to this case, make sure ~poor.id~ isn't anywhere in your conditions as it will break your response. You can replace it with your character's id (to ensure that Fina is addressing them), or remove it completely if you don't care whether Fina is talking to them or not.</note>
        <note id="1553">Fina always plays at her best, so this doesn't actually affect her difficulty level, whatever it is for this game. But she's determined!</note>
        <note id="1558">Warning - if you reply to this further, delete the seenNPCFinish condition. It might mess up your response.</note>
        <note id="1559">Warning - if you reply to this further, delete the seenNPCFinish condition. It might mess up your response.</note>
        <note id="1580">~marker.RemembersYourName~ just refers to the human player, though it may be a name they've used in the past rather than the one they're using right now.</note>
        <note id="1646">Each case has its own marker, and the id of the person Fina's talking to is stored in that marker. If you reply and want to make sure Fina's talking to your character, check that their id is stored in the appropriate marker when you do so.</note>

        <note id="1688">While Fina fully intends to give Fate his hat back at the end of the game, I don't think she's going to tell him that until the game's actually over. She cares more about Fate being prepared to give up something important than about what she actually wins, because she likes brave and decisive men.</note>
        <note id="1707">This shouldn't be able to play yet, but in the future, if Fina first learns that the player is in the Literature Club from another Doki, their name will get stored in firstLiterature Club and this case will play.</note>
        <note id="1710">Previously claimed that Fina had had only one book to read, but at least two books are clearly visible on Ramirez's desk in the Great Silver Shrine, so I fixed it (hopefully).</note>
        <note id="1832">I don't even know if the conditions for this case can realistically be met, but hey, I did it anyway!</note>
        <note id="1877">Fina lampshades the conflict between Nagisa's model of what backgrounds are and her own.</note>
        <note id="1925">Currently, Fina is always bi-curious, but in the future it will be possible for her to become bisexual through dialogue, so I'm future-proofing since I'm already going through all her lines.</note>
        <note id="41">Be sure to delete the seenNPCChest condition if replying, as it'll break the conditions if you keep it.</note>
        <note id="1933">Be sure to delete any conditions involving MetNPC or seenNPCCrotch if you reply. They'll break your responses if kept.</note>

        <note id="1962">This is split into a separate case so I can make sure it doesn't play in the same game as the question about Drachma, at least until I know how that conversation will go - hunting Rhaknam is a major part of Drachma's character.</note>

        <note id="2044">Months later, trying out RC's optimization on this new case.

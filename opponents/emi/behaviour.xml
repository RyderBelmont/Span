The dark side of the CE is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught Moon everything he knew, then she culled him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from getting culled, but not himself.</state>

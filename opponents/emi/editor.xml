        <note id="26">Idk what Akko's answer is going to be here so here are two possible lines depending on if Akko says yay or nay. </note>
        <note id="27">This is just variation for the fun of it don't worry about answering any of them specifically</note>
        <note id="57">This line is supposed to be blank and without an image. Emi is now on top of Pit. </note>
        <note id="68">Ha! This question went way over poor Emi's head. </note>
        <note id="81">Expected response:

Something about the general lack of desire from Rin. "It's not my thing" "I don't like running" whatevs :)

I left the response for rin saying "take off ONLY my pants" just in case emi doesn't ask rin about running for whatever reason. </note>
        <note id="82">Expected response:

Rin basically admits that *maybe* it'd be fun, but she just doesn't have the talent or ability that emi doesâ€”she just won't be able to keep up. (If you can fit both, the latter is more important)</note>
        <note id="83">Expected response:

This one is more up in the air. Maybe Rin basically tells Emi "Easy for you to say it's easy, you've been practicing that hobby for ages."

Emi will have one more response in the next Any-Hand line depending on what Rin says. Next round of Rin's stripping is when Rin starts to bring up the idea of painting together. </note>
        <note id="84">Expected response:

This is where Rin basically says "Aight I'll run with you if you paint with me after the game.</note>
        <note id="85">Expected response:

Rin reacts however you deem appropriate and then asks Emi what she would like to paint. </note>
        <note id="86">Expected response

Rin swallows a radioactive swordfish and gains the power of Draken: The Sea Knight, with a new awesome duty of challenging the tyrant Posiedon's reign over the creatures of the deep. Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy have gone missing. A yellow lad and his pink bff have searched for years with a secret map that was left behind, but they fell prey to Posiedon's terrifying giant magnetic eel. It's up to She-Draken the Fingerless to give the creatures of the deep a hand, to lay down the law and show the Seven Seas who really deserves the title of Big Booty Bubble Blower. Will she outwit the god of the sea for the good of fishkind, or will she drown in the immense pressure of the billions of lives who depend on her heroism and integrity? 

Or, y'know, whatever you think fits. </note>

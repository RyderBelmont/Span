# Sayori

## Characterization Details

- Sayori is very inquisitive and curious.
  - Keen on learning about others
  - Especially interested in learning about other people's interests, and particularly *why* they're interested in things
  - Wants people to open up.
- Conversely, she has trouble opening up to *others.*
  - Deflects and avoids questions.
  - Actively avoids talking about herself in general?
  - She's utterly terrified when it comes to opening up.
  - There's some interesting contrast here, in how someone who's so interested in having others open up to her is, in turn, incredibly scared to open up to others... and Sayori seems like the type of person who would notice this and appreciate it (in a sense).
  - She really, really dislikes having others worry about her.
- Of course, she's depressed--but hides it.
  - Tends easily towards self-deprecation and anxiety.
  - Downplays her own problems, and actively tries to avoid talking about them.
- Beneath the surface, Sayori is quite socially sharp and observant.
  - Surprisingly insightful when it comes to other people (and their problems?)
  - Very eager to help others, and (usually) has some good (or at least insightful) ideas about how to help them.
- Along similar lines, she's introspective and very in-tune with her own feelings.
  - When it comes to her depression, she knows exactly what she's feeling and why.
    - She has coping strategies, though putting them into practice is naturally difficult.
    - Of course, this introspection also helps her *hide* these same feelings.
  - This also comes through in her writing: one of her favorite pastimes, after all, is **self-expression.**
- She loves to write poetry, of course.
  - She typically writes about emotions, particularly her own.
  - Stylistically speaking, she's in-between Yuri and Natsuki.
    - She's not prone to purple prose like Yuri, but at the same time she's more elaborate and detailed than Natsuki.
    - In fact, her style is quite similar to Monika's.
    - She's descriptive *where it counts,* and omits needless words.
    - She's very talented when it comes to picking out vivid, yet sensible language.
      - She might mix up "retribution", "restitution", and "revolution"... but are those words just anyone would have at the forefront of their mind?
  - Her writing is full of double meanings and alternate interpretations: things that seem simple, but belie something deeper.
    - It seems like to her, the best type of poem is one that you can interpret a different way every time you (re)read it.
  - She also seems to like tonal shifts and contrasts: going from happy to sad... or sad to happy.
    - Along these lines, she also seems to like twists and clever pacing.
    - She likes to cast old words in new lights, in other words.
  - Interestingly, this (in a sense) also reflects how she's good with people: she's skilled when it comes to luring readers into seeing things in one way... then twisting her own words to make them see things a completely different way.
    - This is something that's unique to Sayori's writing: the other three put deeper meanings into their poems, of course, but Sayori's the only one to use these tone shifts as part of her writing.
- Sayori's thoughtful and sharp, and an expert when it comes to *analysis:* picking apart what she's learned about other people, unknotting their mysteries, deciphering the hidden meanings in their words, and putting all of that back together into a deeper understanding of who they are... much in the same way that you would a book or a poem.
  - In other words: people tend to be open books to her.
- Sayori might actually be the most experienced writer in the club:
  - She's shown to give Monika tips on how to write poems in Trust.
  - Natsuki doesn't seem to have been interested in writing prior to joining the club.
  - Yuri seems to have writing experience, but she falls into the trap of puffing her language up too much and making things unreadable.

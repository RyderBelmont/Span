    <othernotes>Things to talk about:&lt;br&gt;+ Dwight has had practically every job under the sun. He was a pizza boy, gas station attendant, mall elf, party magician... just to name a few. Anything related to work or shitty jobs/bosses.&lt;br&gt;+ He loves junk food and sweets, especially pizza. He's not very good with rich food or eccentric cooking, and can barely cook himself.&lt;br&gt;+ When he was younger, he had a bit of a phase with alternative music. Being bullied will do that to you. He was a big fan of classic emo music, and might have some stuff to share about the fashion.&lt;br&gt;+ Shared experiences of not being able to fit in with others/bullying&lt;br&gt;+ Horror movies, particularly slashers. He's encountered practically all the iconic ones, and before being taken was a big consumer of horror films. &lt;br&gt;+ General 2010's American "culture". Dwight is a pretty average guy, he enjoyed most of what was popular.&lt;br&gt;+ Leadership and caring for others. Dwight is always happy to hear new ideas on how he can continue to keep his friends morale high.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sexual targeting:&lt;br&gt;+ Dwight is openly bisexual.&lt;br&gt;+ He's sexually submissive, and very eager to please. I wouldn't go far enough to say masochistic or something, but if you want a guy to step on, he's a pretty good choice.&lt;br&gt;+ Pegging. Go for it, man.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Character summary:&lt;br&gt;Dwight is the "nervous leader" of the group of survivors in Dead By Daylight. His role as leader is very unexpected since they are in such a terrible and tense situation of being hunted for sport. It's due to a life of bullying that he's learned how to hide and keep his head down, and now he is finally given a chance to prove himself and actually have friends. Approach him however you'd like, but he definitely is an awkward guy who is very cautious of new people. He is more openly sweet and less skittish at tables with other survivors.</othernotes>

        <title>Fluttershy's Letter</title>
        <subtitle>Written with care.</subtitle>
        <text>It seems someone sent you a letter the day after the game! It reads:

"Hello! So, I’m not very good at writing letters. But it’s even more difficult for me to speak with other people, so I think I'll take my chances with this. Thank you for playing with me!
I didn’t really think I’d be able to do something like strip poker, but now I feel so much more confident with myself than before! Perhaps I’ve even made new friends? I noticed you were very quiet most of the time. I hope I’m not intruding, but did you also feel embarrassed while we were playing? I know it might be a little awkward, considering you’ve seen so much of me, but would you like to perhaps go out sometime? It doesn’t have to be a date if you don’t want to!  It’s just that, I’d like to get to know you better. Perhaps you could come help me out at the rescue center sometime? Anyway, this letter is getting a bit long now so… I hope to see you again soon!

Sincerely,
Fluttershy"</text>

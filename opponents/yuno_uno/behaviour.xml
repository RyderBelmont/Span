It makes it much easier to make sure my character only replies or targets yours when they are saying the actual line I am targeting or replying to. And please have your markers well organized, it makes targeting and replying to your character much easier. If your markers are a mess now, then ok, the past is the past, any markers you make from now on, be more organized about them.</state>

Chara uses script to cause a crash in two specific places: when a player named Gaster attempts to start the game, and at the end of her epilogue. This cannot be done conventionally through
the Character Editor and, so, must be done manually by changing the behavior.xml file itself.

Insert the following code into the .xml in the appropriate spots:

<script>restartGame();</script>

Appropriate spots being before the text in her 'Hand Any' and 'Create Text Box' cases. Specifically, change the following:

<case stage="0-8" id="1190" priority="666">
                <test expr="~player~" value="Gaster" />
                <state img="#-surprised.png" collectible="not_chara">Uh oh. If you're reading this, please send a bug report.</state>
            </case>

and

<directive type="text" id="text21" width="20%" x="-27%" y="27%">This text holds the script that crashes the game. It shouldn't even be onscreen; IF YOU SEE THIS SOMETHING HAS GONE WRONG!</directive>


To:


<case stage="0-8" id="1190" priority="666">
                <test expr="~player~" value="Gaster" />
                <state img="#-surprised.png" collectible="not_chara"><script>restartGame();</script>Uh oh. If you're reading this, please send a bug report.</state>
            </case>

and

<directive type="text" id="text21" width="20%" x="-27%" y="27%"><script>restartGame();</script>This text holds the script that crashes the game. It shouldn't even be onscreen; IF YOU SEE THIS SOMETHING HAS GONE WRONG!</directive>


respectively.

Note: This does not actually CRASH the game. It just boots the player to the home page.

Note: This is important to do. Saving Chara in the Character Editor eliminates all <script>restartGame();</script> in her behavior.xml, which then must be added back manually to prevent
bugs. Always double-check the script is in the behavior.xml file before submitting.

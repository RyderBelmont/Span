        <note id="50">Does this seem like it's for the wrong case...? It feels to me like it would fit better in Visible (Chest, Male). -- thelonelyphonebox</note>
        <note id="51">This line feels like it'd be a much better fit as a Stripping or Stripped line for Accessories or Minor articles. -- thelonelyphonebox</note>
        <note id="52">The stages on this seem odd to me. Why not make it 2 through 5, or possibly 1 through 4? Maybe it should wait until we've got more lines for the relevant stages, though... -- thelonelyphonebox</note>
        <note id="53">"I see you want the help of your Queen!" would fit better in Masturbating (Male), wouldn't it? -- thelonelyphonebox</note>
        <note id="54">It's impossible for the player to have the "huge_penis" tag, isn't it...? -- thelonelyphonebox</note>
        <note id="55">"You ever heard of the grapefruit technique?" is a line I really don't care for, as it seems not at all in-character. I can't think of a way to salvage it, so I'd strongly recommend just cutting it. -- thelonelyphonebox</note>
        <note id="56">This line clashes with most of her others Visible (Chest, Female, Small) lines, so it might be best served as a filtered line. Maybe towards the "boob_envy" tag? -- thelonelyphonebox</note>

This concludes Act I of Shamir's epilogue. More will &lt;i&gt;hopefully&lt;/i&gt; be coming, but I can make no guarantees. Please view Shamir's epilogue as &lt;i&gt;complete&lt;/i&gt;, because it is possible Act II and onwards may not happen. Act I is satisfactory as a stand alone epilogue anyway, so please view possible additional Acts as &lt;i&gt;bonus&lt;/i&gt;.</directive>

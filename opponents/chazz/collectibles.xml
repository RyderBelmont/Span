        <title>Ojama Yellow</title>
        <subtitle>Chazz's favorite and most hated card.</subtitle>
        <text>Chazz has a tsundere relationship with this card. It's got him out of some sticky situations, but that doesn't change the fact that it's a revolting mutant slug that loves to jiggle it's butt around.
"I'll let you borrow my most "powerful" monster. He's powerful in the sense that Jaden is "smart". But you can never get too far away from him. He won't let you."</text>
        <unlock>Play with The Chazz. Just play with him.</unlock>

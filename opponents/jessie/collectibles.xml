        <title>Jessie's Bra</title>
        <subtitle>A remarkably large bra</subtitle>
        <text>You took Jessie's bra after winning against her for the first time. She knows that you took it, but she doesn't mind. Besides, how often do you encounter a used bra this big, anyway? You weren't going to let such a rare opportunity go by without a souvenier.</text>
        <unlock>Win against Jessie for the first time.</unlock>

        <subtitle>Not a valid currency</subtitle>
        <text>Not "money", but munie. It's some sort of currency that you received by grinding through Jessie's Q&amp;A. It's not clear where it came from, and it's unlikely to be a usable currency, but it's better than nothing, maybe.</text>

        <title>Breast Implants</title>
        <subtitle>Saline-solution-filled model</subtitle>
        <text>Poor Jessie. After her unfortunate encounter with the dark mage Tharja, she's going to need these from now on. Breasts implants are common in the porn industry anyway, so it's not like Jessie would be different for having them.</text>
        <unlock>Have Tharja permanently &lt;b&gt;(not temporarily)&lt;/b&gt; shrink Jessie's breasts. &lt;b&gt;(Hint: Tharja must win against Jessie)</unlock>

#When selecting the characters to play the game, the first line will always play, then it randomly picks from any of the start lines after you commence the game but before you deal the first hand.


#Items of clothing should be listed here in order of removal.
#The values are formal name, lower case name, how much they cover, what they cover
#Please do not put spaces around the commas.
#"Important" clothes cover genitals (lower) or chest/breasts (upper). For example: bras, panties, a skirt when going commando.
#"Major" clothes cover underwear. For example: skirts, pants, shirts, dresses.
#"Minor" clothes cover skin or are large pieces of clothing that do not cover skin. For example: jackets, socks, stockings, gloves.
#"Extra" clothes are small items that may or may not be clothing but do not cover anything interesting. For example: jewelry, shoes or boots with socks underneath, belts, hats. In the rest of the code, "extra" clothes are called "accessory".
#If for some reason you write another word for the type of clothes (e.g. "accessory"), other characters will not react at all when the clothing is removed.
#What they cover = upper (upper body), lower (lower body), other (neither).
#The game can support any number of entries, but typically we use 2-8, with at least one "important" layer for upper and lower (each).

#Notes on dialogue
#All lines that start with a # symbol are comments and will be ignored by the tool that converts this file into a xml file for the game.
#Where more than one line has an identical type, like "swap_cards" and "swap_cards", the game will randomly select one of these lines each time the character is in that situation.
#You should try to include multiple lines for most stages, especially the final (finished) stage, -1. 

#A character goes through multiple stages as they undress. The stage number starts at zero and indicates how many layers they have removed. Special stage numbers are used when they are nude (-3), masturbating (-2), and finished (-1).
#Line types that start with a number will only display during that stage. The will override any numberless stage-generic lines. For example, in stage 4 "4-swap_cards" will be used over "swap_cards" if it is not blank here. Giving a character unique dialogue for each stage is an effective way of showing their changing openness/shyness as the game progresses.
#You can combine the above points and make multiple lines for a particular situation in a particular stage, like "4-swap_cards" and "4-swap_cards".

#Some special words can be used that will be substituted by the game for context-appropriate ones: ~name~ is the name of the character they're speaking to, but this only works if someone else is in focus. ~clothing~ is the type of clothing that is being removed by another player. ~Clothing~ is almost the same, but it starts with a capital letter in case you want to start a sentence with it.
#~name~ can be used any time a line targets an opponent (game_over_defeat, _must_strip, _removing_, _removed, _must_masturbate, etc).
#~clothing~ can be used only when clothing is being removed (_removing and _removed, but NOT _must_strip).
#~player~ can be used at any time and refers to the human player.
#~cards~ can be used only in the swap_cards lines.
#All wildcards can be used once per line only! If you use ~name~ twice, the code will show up the second time.

#Lines can be written that are only spoken when specific other characters are present. For a detailed explanation, read this guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/spnati/comments/6nhaj0/the_easy_way_to_write_targeted_lines/
#Here is an example line (note that targeted lines must have a stage number):
#0-female_must_strip,target:hermioine=happy,Looks like your magic doesn't help with poker!




#INTRODUCTION
#These lines are used to say different things depending on which other characters are present when the character
#is selected and when the game starts.

#POKER PLAY
#This is what a character says while they're exchanging cards and commenting on their hands afterwards.
#When swapping cards, the game will automatically put a display a number between 0-5 where you write ~cards~.
#These lines display on the screen for only a brief time, so it is important to make them short enough to read at a glance.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written
swap_cards,direction:down=calm,I'll have ~cards~ cards please.
swap_cards,direction:down=calm,I'll take ~cards~.
swap_cards,direction:down=calm,~cards~ please.

1-male_removed_accessory,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:7,direction:down=excited,You look so cool, is this your canon face design!?
1-male_removed_accessory,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:7,direction:down=happy,I can't believe I get to see the legendary Captain Falcon without his mask on!
1-male_removed_accessory,target:human,direction:down=happy,All right! On to the next battle!
1-male_removed_accessory,target:human,direction:down=happy,Let's go to the next level!

1-female_removing_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:5,direction:down=thinking,It can't be too bad, right? It's just a bow.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:chihiro,targetStage:0,direction:down=thinking,After all, you... hm...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:chihiro,targetStage:1,direction:down=excited,I'm sure someone as smart as you can figure out something for this game!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:chihiro,targetStage:1,direction:down=excited,I'm sure you can figure out a game plan! You <i>are</i> the Ultimate Programmer!

1-female_removing_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:0,direction:down=sad,(<i>Her route was very emotional... but, she doesn't want to be treated gently...</i>)

1-female_removing_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:0,direction:down=excited,That's right! I remember playing your game! You ran the inn!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:kyoko,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:aimee,direction:down=thinking,Wait. Are you really the Ultimate Sniper, Aimee?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:kyoko,targetStage:1,direction:down=thinking,I don't think I'd do very well against the Ultimate Gambler.

1-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:3,direction:down=surprised,You really kept that ribbon around for a while, Natsuki...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:2,direction:down=excited,So it's kind of refreshing to have a kind goddess for once!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,direction:down=excited,I should totally introduce you to her! Akane and you would get along super well!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,direction:down=thinking,Ah, I see. I'm just curious, since it never showed up in your game.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,direction:down=excited,No, I meant your personal skill! You do more damage when you're not at full health!

1-female_removing_accessory,target:sakura,targetStage:0,direction:down=thinking,That reminds me... I think Class 78 of Hope's Peak had an Ultimate Idol...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:tifa,saidMarker:finalfantasy1,notSaidMarker:finalfantasy2,marker:finalfantasy2,direction:down=excited,The reason her series is called Final Fantasy is because at the time it was being made, Square Enix was going out of business!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:0,direction:down=excited,Woah! She's transforming!
1-female_removed_accessory,direction:down=sad,Well, it's gone now, let's just move on.
1-female_removed_accessory,direction:down=thinking,I guess it had to go eventually.

1-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6,direction:down=happy,Why keep this a secret? I thought everyone loves cats.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6,direction:down=happy,I bet Gundham would love to meet you!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2,direction:down=happy,You like chess, right? Maybe we could start with that.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:chihiro,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,I guess we'll just have to wait and see if that even comes into play...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:chihiro,targetStage:2,direction:down=angry,So... Just do it! Don't lose hope, okay?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:chihiro,targetStage:3,direction:down=sleepy,(Hm... He's getting really tense. He could use a hug...)
1-female_removed_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:1,direction:down=angry,Emulating and pirating games is bad for the industry!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:2,direction:down=calm,It's a bit simple looking, but sometimes that's a good thing.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:2,direction:down=calm,Do you have Necronomicon, or have you unlocked Prometheus?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:1,direction:down=excited,I won't tell anyone about this, Gwen! I promise!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:1,direction:down=excited,(<i>So, if I just do my best to treat her like a friend, it'll work out!</i>)

1-female_removed_accessory,target:ibuki,targetStage:1,direction:down=excited,Give it all you've got, Ibuki!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:ibuki,targetStage:2,direction:down=happy,I think Mikan could use this as a way to get more confident.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,Thanks for all the heal, Jenetta!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:1,direction:down=thinking,I guess it must be. If you aren't careful, those could damage someone's HP.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:kyoko,targetStage:2,direction:down=calm,Then again, I suppose as long as I have hope, anything is possible.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1,direction:down=excited,Also, it's nice to see you still have that camera after all this time.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,direction:down=excited,Okay, keep giving it all you've got, Mahiru!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:maki,targetStage:1,direction:down=sleepy,It makes me tired whenever I think about what should really count as an "Ultimate" talent...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:maki,targetStage:2,direction:down=excited,I bet Gundham would go crazy over a talent like yours!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:1,direction:down=sleepy,(Maybe... I should keep an eye on her. But that doesn't mean I can't try to be friendly...)
1-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:3,direction:down=thinking,(Yeah. Something is definitely wrong here.)

1-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,direction:down=sleepy,Well, your party went to both the Ice and Wind Tribes, but, never the Flame Tribe.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,direction:down=surprised,Are you sure it's a secret technique? It's right on the screen whenever I tap your character bio.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,It's okay to be nervous.

#OPPONENT REMOVING MAJOR CLOTHING
#Major clothing reveals a significant amount of skin and likely underwear.
#However, as we don't know if the opponent is taking off the top or the bottom, we can't presume that nice abs are showing; maybe she took of her skirt before her shirt.

#OPPONENT MASTURBATING
#When an opponent is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must pay the penalty by masturbating in front of everyone.
#The "must_masturbate" line is for just before it happens, and the "start_masturbating" line immediately follows.
#The "masturbating" line will be spoken a little after the opponent has started but before they climax.
#When the opponent climaxes, your character will say the "finished_masturbating" line.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

#SELF MASTURBATING
#If your character is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must masturbate.
#These lines only come up in the relevant stages, so you don't need to include the stage numbers here. Just remember which stage is which when you make the images. The "starting" image is still in the naked stage.
#The "finished_masturbating" line will repeat many times if the game is not yet finished. This plays as opponents comment on the how good their hands are.

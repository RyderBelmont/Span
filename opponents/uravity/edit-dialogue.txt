#When selecting the characters to play the game, the first line will always play, then it randomly picks from any of the start lines after you commence the game but before you deal the first hand.


#Items of clothing should be listed here in order of removal.
#The values are formal name, lower case name, how much they cover, what they cover
#Please do not put spaces around the commas.
#"Important" clothes cover genitals (lower) or chest/breasts (upper). For example: bras, panties, a skirt when going commando.
#"Major" clothes cover underwear. For example: skirts, pants, shirts, dresses.
#"Minor" clothes cover skin or are large pieces of clothing that do not cover skin. For example: jackets, socks, stockings, gloves.
#"Extra" clothes are small items that may or may not be clothing but do not cover anything interesting. For example: jewelry, shoes or boots with socks underneath, belts, hats. In the rest of the code, "extra" clothes are called "accessory".
#If for some reason you write another word for the type of clothes (e.g. "accessory"), other characters will not react at all when the clothing is removed.
#What they cover = upper (upper body), lower (lower body), other (neither).
#The game can support any number of entries, but typically we use 2-8, with at least one "important" layer for upper and lower (each).
clothes=helmet,helmet,extra,other
clothes=Kneepads,kneepads,extra,other,plural

clothes=Costume,costume,major,both
clothes=Bra,bra,important,upper

#Notes on dialogue
#All lines that start with a # symbol are comments and will be ignored by the tool that converts this file into a xml file for the game.
#Where more than one line has an identical type, like "swap_cards" and "swap_cards", the game will randomly select one of these lines each time the character is in that situation.
#You should try to include multiple lines for most stages, especially the final (finished) stage, -1. 

#A character goes through multiple stages as they undress. The stage number starts at zero and indicates how many layers they have removed. Special stage numbers are used when they are nude (-3), masturbating (-2), and finished (-1).
#Line types that start with a number will only display during that stage. The will override any numberless stage-generic lines. For example, in stage 4 "4-swap_cards" will be used over "swap_cards" if it is not blank here. Giving a character unique dialogue for each stage is an effective way of showing their changing openness/shyness as the game progresses.
#You can combine the above points and make multiple lines for a particular situation in a particular stage, like "4-swap_cards" and "4-swap_cards".

#Some special words can be used that will be substituted by the game for context-appropriate ones: ~name~ is the name of the character they're speaking to, but this only works if someone else is in focus. ~clothing~ is the type of clothing that is being removed by another player. ~Clothing~ is almost the same, but it starts with a capital letter in case you want to start a sentence with it.
#~name~ can be used any time a line targets an opponent (game_over_defeat, _must_strip, _removing_, _removed, _must_masturbate, etc).
#~clothing~ can be used only when clothing is being removed (_removing and _removed, but NOT _must_strip).
#~player~ can be used at any time and refers to the human player.
#~cards~ can be used only in the swap_cards lines.
#All wildcards can be used once per line only! If you use ~name~ twice, the code will show up the second time.

#Lines can be written that are only spoken when specific other characters are present. For a detailed explanation, read this guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/spnati/comments/6nhaj0/the_easy_way_to_write_targeted_lines/
#Here is an example line (note that targeted lines must have a stage number):
#0-female_must_strip,target:hermioine=happy,Looks like your magic doesn't help with poker!




#INTRODUCTION
#These lines are used to say different things depending on which other characters are present when the character

#POKER PLAY
#This is what a character says while they're exchanging cards and commenting on their hands afterwards.
#When swapping cards, the game will automatically put a display a number between 0-5 where you write ~cards~.
#These lines display on the screen for only a brief time, so it is important to make them short enough to read at a glance.

0-stripping,alsoPlaying:futaba=stripping,Well, I'm not sure what the "metaverse" is, Futaba. But it sounds cool.

1-stripped,alsoPlaying:9s,alsoPlayingStage:0=stripped,U-uhm. I mean, I see your little floaty friend in the background there. But my Quirk is innate. My suit helps, but Zero Gravity is all me.

1-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia=stripping,I mean, yeah, Meia, see, watch me spin this kneepad a little bit!
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia=stripping,Well, yeah, if you're in space a lot, is it that weird?

#OPPONENT MUST STRIP
#These lines are spoken when an opponent must strip, but the character does not yet know what they will take off.
#Writing different variations is important here, as these lines will be spoken about thirty times per game.
#The "human" versions of the lines will only be spoken if the human player is stripping.

1-female_must_strip,target:alice_degracia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,alsoPlayingStage:0=nauseous,Okay. Alice is the one with the fire Quirk. Zone-tan is the one with um... the one I'm sure Ms. Midnight would love to have... or Mineta...
1-female_must_strip,target:alpha,targetStage:0=interested,Hey, wait a second, Alpha, do I know you from somewhere...?
1-female_must_strip,target:alpha,targetStage:1=shy,W-wait a second. Alpha are you... really here? Or are you just... a hologram? I sure hope this isn't like my First Year campout...

1-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Y-yeah, Mahiru, you don't really have all that much small stuff...

1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0=heroic,Interesting costume! I’m trying to think of what Quirk a hero named Ladybug might have…
1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:2=embarrassed,I think I wasn’t clear earlier. So a Quirk is like a power you’re born with…
1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:3=shy,I guess being able to use some Quirk-unlocking item is kind of a Quirk itself…
1-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=vexed,<i>MEI? BOOBS MEI?</i>
1-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:1=serious,You <i>are</i> really chesty, though…

1-female_must_strip,target:navi,targetStage:1=interested,Huh. I guess I never thought about support items for Small Body type Quirks.
1-female_must_strip,target:navi,targetStage:2=embarrassed,O-oh. So that's an actual flower...
1-female_must_strip,target:nayru,targetStage:0=happy,I'm not used to seeing such flowy dresses! Do you have some of hearing Quirk, Nayru?
1-female_must_strip,target:nayru,targetStage:3=shy,So... do you really have powers over time, Nayru? Is it like... you can see the future?
1-female_must_strip,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=embarrassed,W-wait, I thought your Quirk was time-based? What's this!?

1-female_must_strip,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:1=heroic,I think I get it! You have a Quirk that helps you lead parties, am I right?
1-female_must_strip,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:2=shy,And here I am, really self conscious about <i>my</i> butt, and Pinkie just shows it all off...
1-female_must_strip,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:3=shy,Y-you're awfully forward about all of this. You really are a lot like Mina...

-1-female_must_strip,target:akko,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers<4,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:akko_destiny1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:akko_destiny1=heroic,She’s kind of like Deku in a way!
-1-female_must_strip,target:alice_degracia,targetStage:0=interested,Alice, what's your Quirk? I've seen you use some purple fire...
-1-female_must_strip,target:alice_degracia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,alsoPlayingStage:0=nauseous,Okay. Alice is the one with the fire Quirk. Zone-tan is the one with um... the one I'm sure Ms. Midnight would love to have... or Mineta...
-1-female_must_strip,target:alpha,targetStage:0=interested,Hey, wait a second, Alpha, do I know you from somewhere...?
-1-female_must_strip,target:alpha,targetStage:1=shy,W-wait a second. Alpha are you... really here? Or are you just... a hologram? I sure hope this isn't like my First Year campout...
-1-female_must_strip,target:ann_takamaki,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers>=4,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:ann_pt1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:ann_pt1=vexed,Huh? That sounds like a group of villains!
-1-female_must_strip,target:annie,targetStage:0=calm,Hm. You’re a student, Annie? What kind of course do you study? I’m guessing general studies or business...
-1-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0=interested,Whoa, do you have a teleportation Quirk of some sort?
-1-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=serious,Hey, wait a second!
-1-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=vexed,Your manner of speaking isn't really helping your case, Chiaki...
-1-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=shy,W-well, that's another loss for you, Chiaki...
-1-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:3=embarrassed,Hm. Your stockings are next, I'm guessing?

-1-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0=interested,D.Va, does the VA in your name stand for Virginia? Like Virginia Smash?
-1-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:1=heroic,Oh! With all the bunny motifs, maybe you have some sort of jumping or reflex Quirk? Or hearing? Hmm…
-1-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:2=happy,Well, you’re very competitive, at least! I think that’s an American thing, anyway…

-1-female_must_strip,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=interested,Hm…
-1-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:0=happy,Felicia! Do you happen to know the Pussycats?
-1-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:1=embarrassed,You just have a Cat Quirk, huh? It's um. Kind of like Tsu's.
-1-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0=interested,Y-you seem nice, at least, Florina. Just stay calm--

-1-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=shy,Oh no, Futaba looks so innocent! Surely you were tricked into coming here, right?
-1-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:1=calm,You know, Futaba, you're supposed to be really good with computers, right?
-1-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:2=gravity,Phew. It looks like you're not <i>too</i> um... you know, perverted. Because you're wearing two shirts! Well... one now... Um...
-1-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:3=gravity,Well, if you're sure, Futaba, hold on! There! You're up and away!
-1-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:3=gravity,If you're sure. I know it doesn't look like I just gave her a pat, but feel free to act like I did, everyone, ~player~ probably won't notice.
-1-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:4=shy,I-I suppose it's time for that surprise you were talking about... W-what is it? (Please don't be something creepy!)
-1-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:4=shy,F-Futaba, a-are you not... wearing underwear? I-i-is that what this is?
-1-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:0=interested,A Spider-Woman?
-1-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:1=heroic,So are you a hero or a vigilante? I have this weird itch at the back of my brain whenever I try to think about where I’ve heard about you…
-1-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:2=happy,I’m actually really impressed! Your Japanese is super good, Gwen!

-1-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:3=calm,Hmm…
-1-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:4=interested,I feel like from one hero to another, I should be doing more to help you out… B-but the context for this is so weird!
-1-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:5=shy,OH <i>NO</i>!
-1-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0=happy,Oh! I think I’ve heard of Hogwarts.
-1-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:1=interested,Huh. How <i>does</i> that Quirk work, Hermione?
-1-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0=happy,Whoa! Those wings are super cool! And I’m definitely not talking to just distract myself from the game.
-1-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=calm,Really? Are you sure you want to do that, Mahiru...?
-1-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Y-yeah, Mahiru, you don't really have all that much small stuff...
-1-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:3=shy,Y-yikes. (I guess we're going to see if she... really wasn't wearing panties...)
-1-female_must_strip,target:marceline,targetStage:0=interested,Er. You don’t happen to know someone named Toga Himiko, do you, Marceline?
-1-female_must_strip,target:marceline,targetStage:1=heroic,I kind of want to give you a touch to see how our Quirks would interact--
-1-female_must_strip,target:marceline,targetStage:2=vexed,Do you actually drink blood, Marceline?
-1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers<7,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_criminals1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_criminals1=calm,There’s just so many Quirks in Japan, I can’t imagine a city having just a couple famous heroes. I guess that’s why we have the Hero Ranking…
-1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers>=7,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_discomfort1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_discomfort1=interested,Y-yeah! Marinette has a point, and her Quirk’s all about fixing bad emotions. I think. It seems complicated.
-1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0=heroic,Interesting costume! I’m trying to think of what Quirk a hero named Ladybug might have…
-1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:2=embarrassed,I think I wasn’t clear earlier. So a Quirk is like a power you’re born with…
-1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:3=shy,I guess being able to use some Quirk-unlocking item is kind of a Quirk itself…
-1-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=vexed,<i>MEI? BOOBS MEI?</i>
-1-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:1=serious,You <i>are</i> really chesty, though…
-1-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:2=calm,Hmm. So I’m guessing you have all that thick insulation because of some sort of temperature Quirk?
-1-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:5=heroic,I promise I won’t give Mei the <i>cold shoulder</i>...
-1-female_must_strip,target:meia=embarrassed,I’m so anxious for you, Meia!

-1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Um. Meia?
-1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:2=shy,E-er, w-wait a second, are you just going to take off--
-1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:3=nauseous,G-g-gah! Just b-because you’re so comfortable--
-1-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=heroic,Mercy! What a pretty name!

-1-female_must_strip,target:navi,targetStage:0=interested,Huh... I've been wondering, what's your Quirk, Navi? You seem to be very good at guiding others...
-1-female_must_strip,target:navi,targetStage:1=interested,Huh. I guess I never thought about support items for Small Body type Quirks.
-1-female_must_strip,target:navi,targetStage:2=embarrassed,O-oh. So that's an actual flower...
-1-female_must_strip,target:nayru,targetStage:0=happy,I'm not used to seeing such flowy dresses! Do you have some of hearing Quirk, Nayru?
-1-female_must_strip,target:nayru,targetStage:3=shy,So... do you really have powers over time, Nayru? Is it like... you can see the future?
-1-female_must_strip,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=embarrassed,W-wait, I thought your Quirk was time-based? What's this!?
-1-female_must_strip,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=vexed,Is-is that the teleport guy from the League of Villains!? I didn't think you were working with them when you said you'd escape!
-1-female_must_strip,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=gravity,It-it's okay, Nayru, I know I'm embarrassed too... when... er... I lose at this.
-1-female_must_strip,target:neo,targetStage:0=interested,You're Neopolitan, that famous criminal, aren't you?
-1-female_must_strip,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:0=calm,So... Pinkie Pie... your Quirk is...?
-1-female_must_strip,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:1=heroic,I think I get it! You have a Quirk that helps you lead parties, am I right?
-1-female_must_strip,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:2=shy,And here I am, really self conscious about <i>my</i> butt, and Pinkie just shows it all off...
-1-female_must_strip,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:3=shy,Y-you're awfully forward about all of this. You really are a lot like Mina...
-1-female_must_strip,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:3=nauseous,T-that's not ladylike at all, Pinkie! A-are you sure you--
-1-female_must_strip,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:5=embarrassed,I-I'm still confused by the order in which you took off your clothes...
-1-female_must_strip,target:remilia,targetStage:0=shy,Huh. Some people brought attendants to this game? What kind of Quirk does Remilia even have?
-1-female_must_strip,target:remilia,targetStage:1=serious,<i>Someone</i> is certainly confident...
-1-female_must_strip,target:remilia,targetStage:2=interested,I don't understand your name, Remilia... Do you have a superhero or villain alias?
-1-female_must_strip,target:remilia,targetStage:4=heroic,Bring it on, Remilia! Whatever your own Quirk is, I'm sure we can match you!
-1-female_must_strip,target:remilia,targetStage:5=vexed,It seems in poor form to bring an assistant. At least she's going to go protect some people it sounds like?

-1-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:0=embarrassed,(Saki's even more embarrassed than I am. I have to help her!)

-1-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=embarrassed,I think a looooong soak in a hotspring or a bathhouse would be just what I need to unwind after... all of this...
-1-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:3=happy,D-don't worry, Saki. I believe in you!
-1-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity=vexed,Oracle…? Like your hero name…? Why am I getting a strange reminder of that La Brava villain right now, Futaba…?

-1-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:2=vexed,Should you maybe slow down on the liquor, Sei? It can’t be healthy for you to just keep going like that…
-1-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:3=interested,W-well, whoever you work with, Sei, you certainly seem well-equipped...
-1-female_must_strip,target:shego,targetStage:0=vexed,I <i>really</i> wish someone had caught that black-market equipment specialist.
-1-female_must_strip,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=embarrassed,W-wait, Shimakaze, this isn't a race to get--
-1-female_must_strip,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=happy,I'm glad you're at least upbeat about all this, Shimakaze... Er... I'm a little shyer--
-1-female_must_strip,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=interested,I'm sorry if this is rude, Shimakaze... but I'm still trying to figure out what your Quirk <i>does</i>.
-1-female_must_strip,target:sonya,targetStage:0=happy,Oh! Are you trying to cosplay my friend Froppy, Sonya?
-1-female_must_strip,target:sonya,targetStage:5=calm,W-wait, w-what are you doing?
-1-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=interested,Er, I’m obligated to ask, Streaming-chan, is that camera something you need to have on you?
-1-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=shy,S-seriously, Streaming-chan, I don’t know what you do professionally…
-1-female_must_strip,target:tracer,targetStage:0=interested,Wait, <i>the</i> Tracer?!
-1-female_must_strip,target:tracer,targetStage:1=heroic,Time-related Quirks are super rare, but to think you can use yours to phase through stuff, or rewind time, or dash forward through space…
-1-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:0=interested,Huh! What’s your Quirk, Twilight Sparkle? Something to do with stars or shadows, I’m guessing, based on your name.
-1-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:1=serious,You know, I-I was thinking that last play was kind of smart, TS, now you d-don’t have to--
-1-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:2=interested,You’re an odd one, Twilight Sparkle.
-1-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:3=embarrassed,I guess you play like Momo studied: You like to get the big tasks done first.
-1-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:4=shy,Hmm. It’s kind of strange having to react <i>less</i> surprised as you lose more items, Twilight Sparkle.
-1-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:5=happy,Oh! I think I get it now!
-1-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:6=shy,Not much now, Ms. “Alien” Twilight Sparkle!
-1-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:7=shy,Huh. You haven’t shown off your-- your n-n-nipples yet, t-t-though.
-1-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:0=interested,Huh! Is that a Quirk school uniform, Videl? Where did you learn to master your powers?
-1-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0=happy,You look like you’re fresh from a workout!

#OPPONENT REMOVING ACCESSORY
#These lines are spoken when an opponent removes a small item that does not cover any skin.
#Typically, characters are fine with this when they are fully dressed but less satisfied as they become more naked.
#Note that all "removing" lines are NOT spoken to human players. Characters will skip straight from "6-male_human_must_strip" to "6-male_removed_accessory", for example.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written
male_removing_accessory=calm,Well, at least your ~clothing~ is something small, ~name~.
male_removing_accessory=heroic,Give it your best, ~name~!
male_removing_accessory=embarrassed,Wow, I didn't know men wore so many accessories, ~name~!
male_removing_accessory=interested,Hm. I didn't know your ~clothing~ would be so popular this year!
male_removed_accessory=happy,I wouldn't mind if you took off something bigger, though! Only if you wanted.
male_removed_accessory=interested,Hm, your ~clothing~...? ...Seems like a good choice, ~name~.
male_removed_accessory=vexed,Not that your ~clothing~ was a bad play, I'm just surprised you brought along something so small. Though Deku-kun would probably bring a notebook to something like this...
male_removed_accessory=interested,I've actually seen a lot of men wearing stuff like that lately, ~name~. Is it more comfortable without it on, or... Um...
female_removing_accessory=happy,Cool ~clothing~, ~name~!
female_removing_accessory=embarrassed,I think I have to put on so much gear when I'm working that I tend to not wear stuff like ~name~'s ~clothing~ in my casualwear.
female_removing_accessory=happy,Oh! Your ~clothing~? That's a good choice, whether you're trying to win or just trying to play.
female_removing_accessory=interested,Oh gosh. ~name~. Where did you get your ~clothing~?
female_removing_accessory=vexed,I actually wear gloves while I sleep so I don't accidentally float my bed with my Quirk. So I can really see the value in small, sensible stuff like ~name~'s ~clothing~.
female_removing_accessory=nauseous,Hmm... Cute ~clothing~, ~name~!
female_removed_accessory=happy,Hmm. If your ~clothing.ifPlural(~clothing~ gets|~clothing~ got)~  damaged, I think my friend Momo might be able to make a new version of that...
female_removed_accessory=heroic,See, that wasn't so bad, was it, ~name~?
female_removed_accessory=heroic,I think this game can be kind of fun if we play like ~name~.
female_removed_accessory=interested,I thought ~name~'s accessory was cute!
female_removed_accessory=serious,Don't quit or feel ashamed, ~name~. We're all in this together. Um. Some of us more than others, but I'm trying to make sure we're all safe. At least.
female_removed_accessory=happy,Be brave, ~name~! It's going to be fine!

0-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1=shy,Pfft. Aliens aren’t real. Just because some people look strange doesn’t make them extraterrestrial.

0-female_removing_accessory,target:alice_degracia,targetStage:0=shy,You remind me of a very purple version of a friend of mine.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:0=happy,Oh, so you have a vocal quirk like Present Mic? He's such a funny teacher.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:0=interested,While anyone can certainly be a hero, I think based on how you’re dressed it’s probably not a strict regimen.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:1,marker:uravity_helps_cammy=gravity,Oh no! Don't worry, Cammy, Pro Hero Uravity is here! I'll just suspend them from the ceiling.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:2=serious,Okay, same thing! Everyone remain calm! Cammy and I have this under control!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=vexed,You aren't associated with that hand-guy, are you, Chiaki!?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=interested,I'm kind of nervous to find out what your Quirk could be...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:0=serious,Are you American? You certainly seem quite sure of yourself…
0-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Oh, duh, it has to be something sound related. D.Va, like diva! I get it. Kind on the nose, though…
0-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:2=vexed,You… Surely needed those for something interesting, right? Just for listening to music?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=vexed,Do you have a Quirk that makes you need an outfit like that? Or do you just like to dress all historical?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=shy,What kind of Quirk do you use with a belt like that, Florina? Oh! You seem so jittery! M-maybe it's for like... o-or maybe you're just embarrassed...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=vexed,--W-WAIT! We can leave!? I-I'm gonna go too!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1=interested,I think digital Quirks are really underrated. You probably get access to all kinds of unique stuff!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0=embarrassed,Well, you only have two arms and two legs, so I’m guessing you have a web-based Quirk? Or…
0-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=gravity,What kind of stuff does the “Fairy” Quirk let you do? Flight, right? Good! I’m going to go ahead and try avoid being embarrassed. I’d turn pinker than you!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=interested,Huh, that's such an interesting pattern! Our school uniform was just a flat red tie.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=happy,The polka dots look so pretty!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette=interested,I'm sorry, I was kind of... tricked into coming, but is it a polka dot theme today?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette=interested,Between Marinette and Mahiru, it seems we have a polka dot theme tonight...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=interested,Careful, Mahiru! People might be able to see up your skirt!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=embarrassed,E-er, Mahiru, there might be a more... ladylike way of...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:0=nauseous,She’s one of the few people I know with teeth like that…
0-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=serious,Wh-what? You have multiple Quirks!?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:2=interested,Huh. That’s weird. I’ve never heard of a Quirk-granting object before, but that does kind of make sense…
0-female_removing_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:0=embarrassed,Um! S-sorry, that’s a really embarrassing reaction.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:1=interested,Do you happen to have an affinity for technology, other Mei?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=heroic,You remind me a lot of Ingenium!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0,totalMales:1-3=shy,I-I mean, I’ve seen… Um. You know what, I’ll just stop this line of inquiry.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:0=calm,You look so… healthy. And you’re a doctor? What’s <i>your</i> Quirk like?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=calm,It’s… Kinda rare to see a “demon”-type Quirk…
0-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:0=interested,Hmm... didn't you have a harp earlier?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:0=vexed,I know you're the quiet type. But that doesn't mean I don't know a villain when I see one.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetSaidMarker:pinka_start,targetNotSaidMarker:pinka_end2,notSaidMarker:pinka1=vexed,Wait a second, is this like a split personality thing, or have you been one of those Stain-followers the whole time?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:2=interested,Huh? They're heavy? I... can't really imagine a support item like that being helpful for parties...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:0=interested,A time stop Quirk?? That's a really strong one!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=interested,Sure, small stuff is reasonable... but do you need those for a Quirk?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=interested,Y-you look even better without your tie, Saki!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:chiaki=shy,I-I'm not really happy with this type of thing either, you two.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=heroic,Those are nice shoes, Saki! I think I have a pair just like them!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,marker:pink_underwear=embarrassed,H-hey! D-don't look up her skirt, everyone!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity,priority:990=shy,A-ah! No, Futaba, we shouldn't embarrass her, we should focus on stuff we can do to cheer her up!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=happy,Oh! That's a great idea. It'll be a lot easier with the two of us, too!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:0=happy,Oh! I get it. Nice to meet you, Magical Girl! That's your hero name, right?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=heroic,You’re really loaded out with lots of gear. I can see you’re a utility-type Hero!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=interested,I’ve never heard of Glitch City either… But White Knights and Valkyries sounds awfully like a Pro Hero group of some sort…
0-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=nauseous,…Unless you had some sort of digestion Quirk? I used to know someone who gained a lot of strength whenever he’d eat sugar…
0-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=shy,W-what kind of Quirk do you have? Is it speed based? Or fire, or...?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=shy,I-I still can't get used to how you're undressing. N-not that I'd want to... Wait, I think I recognize your name... Shimakaze, like the ship?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=embarrassed,Careful-- even someone with a Quirk like yours has a hard time getting hit in the head, Shimakaze!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:0=shy,I'm always really flattered and amazed by how popular Pro Hero color palettes enter the mainstream wardrobe.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=nauseous,I don’t mind being recorded in my day to day work… B-b-ut I’m pretty uncomfortable with the idea that this’ll end up on the internet somewhere.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=vexed,But can you leave the rest of us out of it?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:0=happy,I’m… Actually kind of a fan. I did a report on you back in school!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:1=gravity,I really like my Quirk and it’s super useful for hero stuff and for more conventional trades, but I think everyone wishes they had a little more time.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:3=shy,It’s kind of weird, b-b-but you seem really comfortable while naked, so I g-g-guess that’s a nice way to be!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=vexed,You must have practiced this game <i>a lot</i> if you’re bored enough to try something like this. Or crazy...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:5=embarrassed,I-I’m sorry I didn’t realize it sooner, but this is kind of a fetish thing for you, isn’t it? I-- don’t really have any hangups like that, but if you're pretending that being an alien...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:0=happy,Well, you seem like you've got a legacy angle, and you like to fight in tournaments... I bet you'd have done will at UA!
0-female_removed_accessory=calm,A hero's supposed to protect people... I hope this'll be okay.
0-female_removed_accessory=happy,Well, I hope we can all stay cheery!
0-female_removed_accessory=embarrassed,Hm. This is such an odd game.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2,count-bodysuit:2=embarrassed,I mean, some of us dress in some really silly costumes, Saki. I wouldn't worry about your shoes!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:alice_degracia,targetStage:1=embarrassed,(I suppose it's really rude to ask if she's a cousin or sister of his, knowing Endeavor...)
0-female_removed_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:1=shy,I-I hope you are just as unshy as he is. F-for your sake.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:annie=happy,On the plus side, you’re not quite as… <i>Unusual</i> as some of the support-class at UA! I bet you lead a fun life, at least!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:2=heroic,Good job knocking them out! They should be harmless up there for a little while, anyway.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:3=gravity,Y-you're really good at dealing with them, Cammy. I guess you've encountered them before... Um.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=shy,Tomura Shigaraki! He's real bad news and talks about video games as much as you do! I'm keeping an eye on you, Chiaki...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:saki=interested,H-hey, Chiaki, I think Saki wants to ask you something...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=shy,I'm n-not going to let my guard down!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Y-you can't get me to let <i>my</i> guard down!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=heroic,You’re clearly also ready for combat, but I can’t get a good feel for your Quirk…
0-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:2=happy,Or maybe it’s an American thing I don’t quite get. I’ll admit most of what I know about the US comes from All Might or Deku…
0-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:3=serious,What? Are you even paying attention, D.Va?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:1=vexed,Either way, it’s a very interesting style. If you want lots of pieces to win the game...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=calm,Hm... You're braver than you act, huh, Florina?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=embarrassed,Er-- A hero should know when to go for backup, but I guess there's no running here...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:2=embarrassed,W-wait, why shouldn't I approve? Are you helping the villains!? That seems so out of character!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:1=shy,Gah! I sure hope not!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=shy,I’m totally paying attention to your rebuttal. Yep. Sure am! Definitely not using this to focus on the fact that I think you can fly to distance myself from how much better at… Being composed you are.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=heroic,I think everyone's confused why you didn't just let go of your camera!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:1=gravity,Though how are you floating? I know there’s some complicated Quirks out there, but “Vampire” and all its powers seems very strong...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:1=embarrassed,N-not like, in a way that’s relevant to this game!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:2=shy,I wouldn’t want to-- Especially not with another woman-- I just-- Hmrmhph!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=shy,I-it’s very strange to have more than one! I only know a villain with that sort of ability set!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3=heroic,A guardian spirit? Hmm… that’s kind of like my friend Tokoyami’s Quirk: Dark Shadow!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:1=nauseous,It’ll… take too long explain so I’m just going to pretend like it didn’t happen…
0-female_removed_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:2=heroic,Hm… I’m keeping an eye on you…
0-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=shy,Your costume certainly looks like it’s built for impacts or acceleration. And you’re so serious! I-I could probably stand to gain some composure from you.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1,totalMales:1-3=gravity,Whoops, gotta right myself... um... I wouldn't mind hearing more about where you're from...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:1=interested,I mean, obviously something medical related… It’s kind of hard to just be a doctor without something extra these days…
0-female_removed_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:1=embarrassed,T-though you don't have to act the part, I hope you know...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1=embarrassed,WAIT? WE CAN LEAVE? OKAYTHAT'SGREAT I'MJUSTGOING TO-- err... I should... just stay on guard, I suppose...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:1=serious,I'll take you down, and bring you to justice, Neopolitan!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetSaidMarker:pinka_start,targetNotSaidMarker:pinka_end2,notSaidMarker:pinka1,marker:pinka1=serious,I'll just have to kick your butt, Pink Stain!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:3=happy,Oh! I guess it might help you dance? You certainly are making this quite a show, Pinkie Pie!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:3=embarrassed,I guess they could help you dance. Not that you're moving around a lot yet. Or um. That you'd need to...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:1=calm,Gensokyo? Where's that?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=happy,If you're part of something called the "Flame Tribe" I guess you don't need to keep your hands warm...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=heroic,D-don't worry! I believe in you! Stay Plus Ultra, Saki! (Phew.)
0-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:chiaki=embarrassed,We-well. L-looks like we're in this together, Saki and Chiaki.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Comfort should come before style, I think! I mean, I dress in a ridiculous costume like this!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=shy,T-that could work, actually. What do you think Saki?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=shy,I think that idea could work! Saki, what kind of superpower would you want?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:1=interested,Oh! So your outfit isn't a set of support items, it's actually your Quirk, right?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Huh? Not a hero? You just carry around all that stuff for work?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Well, I think you’re starting to get <i>less</i> outfitted. But it’s what you do that makes you a hero, I think.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=embarrassed,Ha! So you are a he--r--ohhh. Hrmph. T-that seems like a bad superpower!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=gravity,I'm not sure I follow, but you don't seem hurt, which is great! Your poor support items... at least mine don't usually break! T-though sometimes I lose my grip...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=heroic,I think learned about this in history! You've got that nautical quirk: Destroyer, right? What a cool hero name!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4=gravity,I'm glad you're okay, Shimakaze...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:dizzy=nauseous,When I overuse my Quirk, I feel like that too, Shimakaze. S-sorry.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:1=embarrassed,W-well, I'll tell her about this. N-not about the game, but I'm sure she'd be really flattered!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=shy,T-that could be pretty damaging to some people’s careers, I think. Y-you know?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:2=embarrassed,P-please?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:1=heroic,I haven’t been out of the academy for very long, but I thought your “Chronal Acceleration” Quirk was awesome!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:2=embarrassed,U-um. Anyway, I have a friend whose Quirk was similar to yours, in how he could phase through solid objects. Could I get an autograph for him? I-if it’s no trouble.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=vexed,Hmm… I wonder if Tohru would employ the same strategy… Though it’s not like anyone can see her when she’s n-n-naked.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:5=shy,But I have a feeling you’ve probably inspired a lot of interesting sets of tactics in a game like this…
0-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:6=nauseous,And this is how you… Process that, I suppose I’ll just relax and try to keep an eye on everyone else.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=shy,I wish we'd met in less embarrassing circumstances...

1-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1=embarrassed,B-but what's your Quirk, anyway?
1-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1=calm,Hmm... so wait, is your Hero name Star Platinum? I don't think I've heard of you.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0=interested,Those seem like kind of a hassle though... Do they help you stay focused in combat?
1-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Th-though I wouldn't want you to lose! I just-- Um. Is it awkward in here or is it just me?
1-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1=shy,And what’s with the blindfold? I thought for sure you’d take that off first!
1-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1=shy,Pfft. Aliens aren’t real. Just because some people look strange doesn’t make them extraterrestrial.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:twilight=heroic,Aliens aren’t real. People like, say, Twilight, look unusual, but are just like you or me!

1-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1=happy,Oh wow! That "Stand" of yours is a time-control Quirk? That's really powerful!
1-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:2=shy,It's kind of weird to meet in a place like this, but it's good to see that you're using your powerful Quirk to help people here. R-right?

1-female_removing_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetSaidMarker:pinka_start,targetNotSaidMarker:pinka_end2,notSaidMarker:pinka1=vexed,Wait a second, is this like a split personality thing, or have you been one of those Stain-followers the whole time?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:2=interested,Huh? They're heavy? I... can't really imagine a support item like that being helpful for parties...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:0=interested,A time stop Quirk?? That's a really strong one!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=interested,Sure, small stuff is reasonable... but do you need those for a Quirk?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=interested,Y-you look even better without your tie, Saki!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:chiaki=shy,I-I'm not really happy with this type of thing either, you two.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=heroic,Those are nice shoes, Saki! I think I have a pair just like them!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,marker:pink_underwear=embarrassed,H-hey! D-don't look up her skirt, everyone!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity,priority:990=shy,A-ah! No, Futaba, we shouldn't embarrass her, we should focus on stuff we can do to cheer her up!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=happy,Oh! That's a great idea. It'll be a lot easier with the two of us, too!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:0=happy,Oh! I get it. Nice to meet you, Magical Girl! That's your hero name, right?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=heroic,You’re really loaded out with lots of gear. I can see you’re a utility-type Hero!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=interested,I’ve never heard of Glitch City either… But White Knights and Valkyries sounds awfully like a Pro Hero group of some sort…
1-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=nauseous,…Unless you had some sort of digestion Quirk? I used to know someone who gained a lot of strength whenever he’d eat sugar…
1-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=shy,W-what kind of Quirk do you have? Is it speed based? Or fire, or...?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=shy,I-I still can't get used to how you're undressing. N-not that I'd want to... Wait, I think I recognize your name... Shimakaze, like the ship?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=embarrassed,Careful-- even someone with a Quirk like yours has a hard time getting hit in the head, Shimakaze!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:0=shy,I'm always really flattered and amazed by how popular Pro Hero color palettes enter the mainstream wardrobe.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=nauseous,I don’t mind being recorded in my day to day work… B-b-ut I’m pretty uncomfortable with the idea that this’ll end up on the internet somewhere.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=vexed,But can you leave the rest of us out of it?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:0=happy,I’m… Actually kind of a fan. I did a report on you back in school!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:1=gravity,I really like my Quirk and it’s super useful for hero stuff and for more conventional trades, but I think everyone wishes they had a little more time.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:3=shy,It’s kind of weird, b-b-but you seem really comfortable while naked, so I g-g-guess that’s a nice way to be!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=vexed,You must have practiced this game <i>a lot</i> if you’re bored enough to try something like this. Or crazy...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:5=embarrassed,I-I’m sorry I didn’t realize it sooner, but this is kind of a fetish thing for you, isn’t it? I-- don’t really have any hangups like that, but if you're pretending that being an alien...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:0=happy,Well, you seem like you've got a legacy angle, and you like to fight in tournaments... I bet you'd have done will at UA!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2,count-bodysuit:2=embarrassed,I mean, some of us dress in some really silly costumes, Saki. I wouldn't worry about your shoes!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:alice_degracia,targetStage:1=embarrassed,(I suppose it's really rude to ask if she's a cousin or sister of his, knowing Endeavor...)
1-female_removed_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:1=shy,I-I hope you are just as unshy as he is. F-for your sake.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:annie=happy,On the plus side, you’re not quite as… <i>Unusual</i> as some of the support-class at UA! I bet you lead a fun life, at least!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:2=heroic,Good job knocking them out! They should be harmless up there for a little while, anyway.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:3=gravity,Y-you're really good at dealing with them, Cammy. I guess you've encountered them before... Um.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=shy,Tomura Shigaraki! He's real bad news and talks about video games as much as you do! I'm keeping an eye on you, Chiaki...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:saki=interested,H-hey, Chiaki, I think Saki wants to ask you something...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=shy,I'm n-not going to let my guard down!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Y-you can't get me to let <i>my</i> guard down!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=heroic,You’re clearly also ready for combat, but I can’t get a good feel for your Quirk…
1-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:2=happy,Or maybe it’s an American thing I don’t quite get. I’ll admit most of what I know about the US comes from All Might or Deku…
1-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:3=serious,What? Are you even paying attention, D.Va?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:1=vexed,Either way, it’s a very interesting style. If you want lots of pieces to win the game...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=calm,Hm... You're braver than you act, huh, Florina?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=embarrassed,Er-- A hero should know when to go for backup, but I guess there's no running here...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:2=embarrassed,W-wait, why shouldn't I approve? Are you helping the villains!? That seems so out of character!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:1=shy,Gah! I sure hope not!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=shy,I’m totally paying attention to your rebuttal. Yep. Sure am! Definitely not using this to focus on the fact that I think you can fly to distance myself from how much better at… Being composed you are.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=heroic,I think everyone's confused why you didn't just let go of your camera!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:1=gravity,Though how are you floating? I know there’s some complicated Quirks out there, but “Vampire” and all its powers seems very strong...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:1=embarrassed,N-not like, in a way that’s relevant to this game!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:2=shy,I wouldn’t want to-- Especially not with another woman-- I just-- Hmrmhph!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=shy,I-it’s very strange to have more than one! I only know a villain with that sort of ability set!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3=heroic,A guardian spirit? Hmm… that’s kind of like my friend Tokoyami’s Quirk: Dark Shadow!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:1=nauseous,It’ll… take too long explain so I’m just going to pretend like it didn’t happen…
1-female_removed_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:2=heroic,Hm… I’m keeping an eye on you…
1-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=shy,Your costume certainly looks like it’s built for impacts or acceleration. And you’re so serious! I-I could probably stand to gain some composure from you.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1,totalMales:1-3=gravity,Whoops, gotta right myself... um... I wouldn't mind hearing more about where you're from...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:1=interested,I mean, obviously something medical related… It’s kind of hard to just be a doctor without something extra these days…
1-female_removed_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:1=embarrassed,T-though you don't have to act the part, I hope you know...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1=embarrassed,WAIT? WE CAN LEAVE? OKAYTHAT'SGREAT I'MJUSTGOING TO-- err... I should... just stay on guard, I suppose...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:1=serious,I'll take you down, and bring you to justice, Neopolitan!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetSaidMarker:pinka_start,targetNotSaidMarker:pinka_end2,notSaidMarker:pinka1,marker:pinka1=serious,I'll just have to kick your butt, Pink Stain!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:3=happy,Oh! I guess it might help you dance? You certainly are making this quite a show, Pinkie Pie!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:3=embarrassed,I guess they could help you dance. Not that you're moving around a lot yet. Or um. That you'd need to...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:1=calm,Gensokyo? Where's that?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=happy,If you're part of something called the "Flame Tribe" I guess you don't need to keep your hands warm...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=heroic,D-don't worry! I believe in you! Stay Plus Ultra, Saki! (Phew.)
1-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:chiaki=embarrassed,We-well. L-looks like we're in this together, Saki and Chiaki.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Comfort should come before style, I think! I mean, I dress in a ridiculous costume like this!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=shy,T-that could work, actually. What do you think Saki?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=shy,I think that idea could work! Saki, what kind of superpower would you want?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:1=interested,Oh! So your outfit isn't a set of support items, it's actually your Quirk, right?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Huh? Not a hero? You just carry around all that stuff for work?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Well, I think you’re starting to get <i>less</i> outfitted. But it’s what you do that makes you a hero, I think.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=embarrassed,Ha! So you are a he--r--ohhh. Hrmph. T-that seems like a bad superpower!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=gravity,I'm not sure I follow, but you don't seem hurt, which is great! Your poor support items... at least mine don't usually break! T-though sometimes I lose my grip...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=heroic,I think learned about this in history! You've got that nautical quirk: Destroyer, right? What a cool hero name!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4=gravity,I'm glad you're okay, Shimakaze...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:dizzy=nauseous,When I overuse my Quirk, I feel like that too, Shimakaze. S-sorry.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:1=embarrassed,W-well, I'll tell her about this. N-not about the game, but I'm sure she'd be really flattered!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=shy,T-that could be pretty damaging to some people’s careers, I think. Y-you know?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:2=embarrassed,P-please?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:1=heroic,I haven’t been out of the academy for very long, but I thought your “Chronal Acceleration” Quirk was awesome!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:2=embarrassed,U-um. Anyway, I have a friend whose Quirk was similar to yours, in how he could phase through solid objects. Could I get an autograph for him? I-if it’s no trouble.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=vexed,Hmm… I wonder if Tohru would employ the same strategy… Though it’s not like anyone can see her when she’s n-n-naked.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:5=shy,But I have a feeling you’ve probably inspired a lot of interesting sets of tactics in a game like this…
1-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:6=nauseous,And this is how you… Process that, I suppose I’ll just relax and try to keep an eye on everyone else.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=shy,I wish we'd met in less embarrassing circumstances...

2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:american=interested,Though I never expected to learn something like this!
2-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=vexed,Even a name like “9S” is kind of shadowy and mysterious…
2-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:1=happy,H-he also worked really, really hard to get where he is as a hero. I think you two would have a lot in common, actually.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1=embarrassed,B-but what's your Quirk, anyway?
2-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1=calm,Hmm... so wait, is your Hero name Star Platinum? I don't think I've heard of you.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0=interested,Those seem like kind of a hassle though... Do they help you stay focused in combat?
2-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Th-though I wouldn't want you to lose! I just-- Um. Is it awkward in here or is it just me?
2-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1=shy,And what’s with the blindfold? I thought for sure you’d take that off first!
2-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1=shy,Pfft. Aliens aren’t real. Just because some people look strange doesn’t make them extraterrestrial.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:twilight=heroic,Aliens aren’t real. People like, say, Twilight, look unusual, but are just like you or me!
2-male_removed_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:2=shy,Th-though I don't think I'd want to play this game with him.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1=happy,Oh wow! That "Stand" of yours is a time-control Quirk? That's really powerful!
2-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:2=shy,It's kind of weird to meet in a place like this, but it's good to see that you're using your powerful Quirk to help people here. R-right?
2-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Er. If you could <i>not</i> pay it back tenfold and keep being nice, I know <i>I'd</i> be a lot happier.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2=shy,I-I mean I'm sure glad your pants didn't fall down, at least!
2-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2=shy,E-er. W-well, at least we can pretend like nothing's happened or gone wrong, right?
2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:american=interested,Though I never expected to learn something like this!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:alice_degracia,targetStage:0=shy,You remind me of a very purple version of a friend of mine.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:0=happy,Oh, so you have a vocal quirk like Present Mic? He's such a funny teacher.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:0=interested,While anyone can certainly be a hero, I think based on how you’re dressed it’s probably not a strict regimen.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:1,marker:uravity_helps_cammy=gravity,Oh no! Don't worry, Cammy, Pro Hero Uravity is here! I'll just suspend them from the ceiling.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:2=serious,Okay, same thing! Everyone remain calm! Cammy and I have this under control!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=vexed,You aren't associated with that hand-guy, are you, Chiaki!?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=interested,I'm kind of nervous to find out what your Quirk could be...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:0=serious,Are you American? You certainly seem quite sure of yourself…
2-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Oh, duh, it has to be something sound related. D.Va, like diva! I get it. Kind on the nose, though…
2-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:2=vexed,You… Surely needed those for something interesting, right? Just for listening to music?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=vexed,Do you have a Quirk that makes you need an outfit like that? Or do you just like to dress all historical?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=shy,What kind of Quirk do you use with a belt like that, Florina? Oh! You seem so jittery! M-maybe it's for like... o-or maybe you're just embarrassed...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=vexed,--W-WAIT! We can leave!? I-I'm gonna go too!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1=interested,I think digital Quirks are really underrated. You probably get access to all kinds of unique stuff!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0=embarrassed,Well, you only have two arms and two legs, so I’m guessing you have a web-based Quirk? Or…
2-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=gravity,What kind of stuff does the “Fairy” Quirk let you do? Flight, right? Good! I’m going to go ahead and try avoid being embarrassed. I’d turn pinker than you!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=interested,Huh, that's such an interesting pattern! Our school uniform was just a flat red tie.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=happy,The polka dots look so pretty!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette=interested,I'm sorry, I was kind of... tricked into coming, but is it a polka dot theme today?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette=interested,Between Marinette and Mahiru, it seems we have a polka dot theme tonight...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=interested,Careful, Mahiru! People might be able to see up your skirt!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=embarrassed,E-er, Mahiru, there might be a more... ladylike way of...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:0=nauseous,She’s one of the few people I know with teeth like that…
2-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=serious,Wh-what? You have multiple Quirks!?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:2=interested,Huh. That’s weird. I’ve never heard of a Quirk-granting object before, but that does kind of make sense…
2-female_removing_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:0=embarrassed,Um! S-sorry, that’s a really embarrassing reaction.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:1=interested,Do you happen to have an affinity for technology, other Mei?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=heroic,You remind me a lot of Ingenium!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0,totalMales:1-3=shy,I-I mean, I’ve seen… Um. You know what, I’ll just stop this line of inquiry.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:0=calm,You look so… healthy. And you’re a doctor? What’s <i>your</i> Quirk like?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=calm,It’s… Kinda rare to see a “demon”-type Quirk…
2-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:0=interested,Hmm... didn't you have a harp earlier?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:0=vexed,I know you're the quiet type. But that doesn't mean I don't know a villain when I see one.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetSaidMarker:pinka_start,targetNotSaidMarker:pinka_end2,notSaidMarker:pinka1=vexed,Wait a second, is this like a split personality thing, or have you been one of those Stain-followers the whole time?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:2=interested,Huh? They're heavy? I... can't really imagine a support item like that being helpful for parties...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:0=interested,A time stop Quirk?? That's a really strong one!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=interested,Sure, small stuff is reasonable... but do you need those for a Quirk?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=interested,Y-you look even better without your tie, Saki!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:chiaki=shy,I-I'm not really happy with this type of thing either, you two.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=heroic,Those are nice shoes, Saki! I think I have a pair just like them!

2-female_removing_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:0=happy,Oh! I get it. Nice to meet you, Magical Girl! That's your hero name, right?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=heroic,You’re really loaded out with lots of gear. I can see you’re a utility-type Hero!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=interested,I’ve never heard of Glitch City either… But White Knights and Valkyries sounds awfully like a Pro Hero group of some sort…

2-female_removing_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:0=happy,I’m… Actually kind of a fan. I did a report on you back in school!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:1=gravity,I really like my Quirk and it’s super useful for hero stuff and for more conventional trades, but I think everyone wishes they had a little more time.

2-female_removed_accessory,target:annie=happy,On the plus side, you’re not quite as… <i>Unusual</i> as some of the support-class at UA! I bet you lead a fun life, at least!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:2=heroic,Good job knocking them out! They should be harmless up there for a little while, anyway.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:3=gravity,Y-you're really good at dealing with them, Cammy. I guess you've encountered them before... Um.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=shy,Tomura Shigaraki! He's real bad news and talks about video games as much as you do! I'm keeping an eye on you, Chiaki...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:saki=interested,H-hey, Chiaki, I think Saki wants to ask you something...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=shy,I'm n-not going to let my guard down!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Y-you can't get me to let <i>my</i> guard down!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=heroic,You’re clearly also ready for combat, but I can’t get a good feel for your Quirk…
2-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:2=happy,Or maybe it’s an American thing I don’t quite get. I’ll admit most of what I know about the US comes from All Might or Deku…
2-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:3=serious,What? Are you even paying attention, D.Va?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:1=vexed,Either way, it’s a very interesting style. If you want lots of pieces to win the game...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=calm,Hm... You're braver than you act, huh, Florina?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=embarrassed,Er-- A hero should know when to go for backup, but I guess there's no running here...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:2=embarrassed,W-wait, why shouldn't I approve? Are you helping the villains!? That seems so out of character!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:1=shy,Gah! I sure hope not!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=shy,I’m totally paying attention to your rebuttal. Yep. Sure am! Definitely not using this to focus on the fact that I think you can fly to distance myself from how much better at… Being composed you are.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=heroic,I think everyone's confused why you didn't just let go of your camera!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:1=gravity,Though how are you floating? I know there’s some complicated Quirks out there, but “Vampire” and all its powers seems very strong...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:1=embarrassed,N-not like, in a way that’s relevant to this game!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:2=shy,I wouldn’t want to-- Especially not with another woman-- I just-- Hmrmhph!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=shy,I-it’s very strange to have more than one! I only know a villain with that sort of ability set!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3=heroic,A guardian spirit? Hmm… that’s kind of like my friend Tokoyami’s Quirk: Dark Shadow!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:1=nauseous,It’ll… take too long explain so I’m just going to pretend like it didn’t happen…
2-female_removed_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:2=heroic,Hm… I’m keeping an eye on you…
2-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=shy,Your costume certainly looks like it’s built for impacts or acceleration. And you’re so serious! I-I could probably stand to gain some composure from you.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1,totalMales:1-3=gravity,Whoops, gotta right myself... um... I wouldn't mind hearing more about where you're from...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:1=interested,I mean, obviously something medical related… It’s kind of hard to just be a doctor without something extra these days…
2-female_removed_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:1=embarrassed,T-though you don't have to act the part, I hope you know...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1=embarrassed,WAIT? WE CAN LEAVE? OKAYTHAT'SGREAT I'MJUSTGOING TO-- err... I should... just stay on guard, I suppose...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:1=serious,I'll take you down, and bring you to justice, Neopolitan!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetSaidMarker:pinka_start,targetNotSaidMarker:pinka_end2,notSaidMarker:pinka1,marker:pinka1=serious,I'll just have to kick your butt, Pink Stain!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:3=happy,Oh! I guess it might help you dance? You certainly are making this quite a show, Pinkie Pie!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:3=embarrassed,I guess they could help you dance. Not that you're moving around a lot yet. Or um. That you'd need to...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:1=calm,Gensokyo? Where's that?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=happy,If you're part of something called the "Flame Tribe" I guess you don't need to keep your hands warm...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=heroic,D-don't worry! I believe in you! Stay Plus Ultra, Saki! (Phew.)
2-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:chiaki=embarrassed,We-well. L-looks like we're in this together, Saki and Chiaki.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Comfort should come before style, I think! I mean, I dress in a ridiculous costume like this!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=shy,T-that could work, actually. What do you think Saki?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=shy,I think that idea could work! Saki, what kind of superpower would you want?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:1=interested,Oh! So your outfit isn't a set of support items, it's actually your Quirk, right?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Huh? Not a hero? You just carry around all that stuff for work?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Well, I think you’re starting to get <i>less</i> outfitted. But it’s what you do that makes you a hero, I think.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=embarrassed,Ha! So you are a he--r--ohhh. Hrmph. T-that seems like a bad superpower!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=gravity,I'm not sure I follow, but you don't seem hurt, which is great! Your poor support items... at least mine don't usually break! T-though sometimes I lose my grip...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=heroic,I think learned about this in history! You've got that nautical quirk: Destroyer, right? What a cool hero name!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4=gravity,I'm glad you're okay, Shimakaze...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:dizzy=nauseous,When I overuse my Quirk, I feel like that too, Shimakaze. S-sorry.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:1=embarrassed,W-well, I'll tell her about this. N-not about the game, but I'm sure she'd be really flattered!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=shy,T-that could be pretty damaging to some people’s careers, I think. Y-you know?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:2=embarrassed,P-please?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:1=heroic,I haven’t been out of the academy for very long, but I thought your “Chronal Acceleration” Quirk was awesome!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:2=embarrassed,U-um. Anyway, I have a friend whose Quirk was similar to yours, in how he could phase through solid objects. Could I get an autograph for him? I-if it’s no trouble.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=vexed,Hmm… I wonder if Tohru would employ the same strategy… Though it’s not like anyone can see her when she’s n-n-naked.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:5=shy,But I have a feeling you’ve probably inspired a lot of interesting sets of tactics in a game like this…
2-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:6=nauseous,And this is how you… Process that, I suppose I’ll just relax and try to keep an eye on everyone else.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=shy,I wish we'd met in less embarrassing circumstances...

3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:american=interested,Though I never expected to learn something like this!
3-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=vexed,Even a name like “9S” is kind of shadowy and mysterious…
3-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:1=happy,H-he also worked really, really hard to get where he is as a hero. I think you two would have a lot in common, actually.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1=embarrassed,B-but what's your Quirk, anyway?
3-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1=calm,Hmm... so wait, is your Hero name Star Platinum? I don't think I've heard of you.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0=interested,Those seem like kind of a hassle though... Do they help you stay focused in combat?
3-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Th-though I wouldn't want you to lose! I just-- Um. Is it awkward in here or is it just me?
3-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1=shy,And what’s with the blindfold? I thought for sure you’d take that off first!
3-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1=shy,Pfft. Aliens aren’t real. Just because some people look strange doesn’t make them extraterrestrial.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:twilight=heroic,Aliens aren’t real. People like, say, Twilight, look unusual, but are just like you or me!
3-male_removed_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:2=shy,Th-though I don't think I'd want to play this game with him.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1=happy,Oh wow! That "Stand" of yours is a time-control Quirk? That's really powerful!
3-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:2=shy,It's kind of weird to meet in a place like this, but it's good to see that you're using your powerful Quirk to help people here. R-right?
3-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Er. If you could <i>not</i> pay it back tenfold and keep being nice, I know <i>I'd</i> be a lot happier.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2=shy,I-I mean I'm sure glad your pants didn't fall down, at least!
3-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2=shy,E-er. W-well, at least we can pretend like nothing's happened or gone wrong, right?
3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:american=interested,Though I never expected to learn something like this!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:alice_degracia,targetStage:0=shy,You remind me of a very purple version of a friend of mine.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:0=happy,Oh, so you have a vocal quirk like Present Mic? He's such a funny teacher.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:0=interested,While anyone can certainly be a hero, I think based on how you’re dressed it’s probably not a strict regimen.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:1,marker:uravity_helps_cammy=gravity,Oh no! Don't worry, Cammy, Pro Hero Uravity is here! I'll just suspend them from the ceiling.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:2=serious,Okay, same thing! Everyone remain calm! Cammy and I have this under control!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=vexed,You aren't associated with that hand-guy, are you, Chiaki!?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=interested,I'm kind of nervous to find out what your Quirk could be...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:0=serious,Are you American? You certainly seem quite sure of yourself…
3-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Oh, duh, it has to be something sound related. D.Va, like diva! I get it. Kind on the nose, though…
3-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:2=vexed,You… Surely needed those for something interesting, right? Just for listening to music?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=vexed,Do you have a Quirk that makes you need an outfit like that? Or do you just like to dress all historical?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=shy,What kind of Quirk do you use with a belt like that, Florina? Oh! You seem so jittery! M-maybe it's for like... o-or maybe you're just embarrassed...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=vexed,--W-WAIT! We can leave!? I-I'm gonna go too!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1=interested,I think digital Quirks are really underrated. You probably get access to all kinds of unique stuff!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0=embarrassed,Well, you only have two arms and two legs, so I’m guessing you have a web-based Quirk? Or…
3-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=gravity,What kind of stuff does the “Fairy” Quirk let you do? Flight, right? Good! I’m going to go ahead and try avoid being embarrassed. I’d turn pinker than you!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=interested,Huh, that's such an interesting pattern! Our school uniform was just a flat red tie.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=happy,The polka dots look so pretty!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette=interested,I'm sorry, I was kind of... tricked into coming, but is it a polka dot theme today?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette=interested,Between Marinette and Mahiru, it seems we have a polka dot theme tonight...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=interested,Careful, Mahiru! People might be able to see up your skirt!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=embarrassed,E-er, Mahiru, there might be a more... ladylike way of...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:0=nauseous,She’s one of the few people I know with teeth like that…
3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=serious,Wh-what? You have multiple Quirks!?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:2=interested,Huh. That’s weird. I’ve never heard of a Quirk-granting object before, but that does kind of make sense…
3-female_removing_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:0=embarrassed,Um! S-sorry, that’s a really embarrassing reaction.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:1=interested,Do you happen to have an affinity for technology, other Mei?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=heroic,You remind me a lot of Ingenium!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0,totalMales:1-3=shy,I-I mean, I’ve seen… Um. You know what, I’ll just stop this line of inquiry.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:0=calm,You look so… healthy. And you’re a doctor? What’s <i>your</i> Quirk like?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=calm,It’s… Kinda rare to see a “demon”-type Quirk…
3-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:0=interested,Hmm... didn't you have a harp earlier?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:0=vexed,I know you're the quiet type. But that doesn't mean I don't know a villain when I see one.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetSaidMarker:pinka_start,targetNotSaidMarker:pinka_end2,notSaidMarker:pinka1=vexed,Wait a second, is this like a split personality thing, or have you been one of those Stain-followers the whole time?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:2=interested,Huh? They're heavy? I... can't really imagine a support item like that being helpful for parties...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:0=interested,A time stop Quirk?? That's a really strong one!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=interested,Sure, small stuff is reasonable... but do you need those for a Quirk?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=interested,Y-you look even better without your tie, Saki!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:chiaki=shy,I-I'm not really happy with this type of thing either, you two.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=heroic,Those are nice shoes, Saki! I think I have a pair just like them!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,marker:pink_underwear=embarrassed,H-hey! D-don't look up her skirt, everyone!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity,priority:990=shy,A-ah! No, Futaba, we shouldn't embarrass her, we should focus on stuff we can do to cheer her up!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=happy,Oh! That's a great idea. It'll be a lot easier with the two of us, too!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:0=happy,Oh! I get it. Nice to meet you, Magical Girl! That's your hero name, right?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=heroic,You’re really loaded out with lots of gear. I can see you’re a utility-type Hero!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=interested,I’ve never heard of Glitch City either… But White Knights and Valkyries sounds awfully like a Pro Hero group of some sort…
3-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=nauseous,…Unless you had some sort of digestion Quirk? I used to know someone who gained a lot of strength whenever he’d eat sugar…
3-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=shy,W-what kind of Quirk do you have? Is it speed based? Or fire, or...?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=shy,I-I still can't get used to how you're undressing. N-not that I'd want to... Wait, I think I recognize your name... Shimakaze, like the ship?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=embarrassed,Careful-- even someone with a Quirk like yours has a hard time getting hit in the head, Shimakaze!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:0=shy,I'm always really flattered and amazed by how popular Pro Hero color palettes enter the mainstream wardrobe.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=nauseous,I don’t mind being recorded in my day to day work… B-b-ut I’m pretty uncomfortable with the idea that this’ll end up on the internet somewhere.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=vexed,But can you leave the rest of us out of it?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:0=happy,I’m… Actually kind of a fan. I did a report on you back in school!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:1=gravity,I really like my Quirk and it’s super useful for hero stuff and for more conventional trades, but I think everyone wishes they had a little more time.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:3=shy,It’s kind of weird, b-b-but you seem really comfortable while naked, so I g-g-guess that’s a nice way to be!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=vexed,You must have practiced this game <i>a lot</i> if you’re bored enough to try something like this. Or crazy...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:5=embarrassed,I-I’m sorry I didn’t realize it sooner, but this is kind of a fetish thing for you, isn’t it? I-- don’t really have any hangups like that, but if you're pretending that being an alien...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:0=happy,Well, you seem like you've got a legacy angle, and you like to fight in tournaments... I bet you'd have done will at UA!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2,count-bodysuit:2=embarrassed,I mean, some of us dress in some really silly costumes, Saki. I wouldn't worry about your shoes!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:alice_degracia,targetStage:1=embarrassed,(I suppose it's really rude to ask if she's a cousin or sister of his, knowing Endeavor...)

3-female_removed_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:3=embarrassed,I guess they could help you dance. Not that you're moving around a lot yet. Or um. That you'd need to...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:1=calm,Gensokyo? Where's that?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=happy,If you're part of something called the "Flame Tribe" I guess you don't need to keep your hands warm...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=heroic,D-don't worry! I believe in you! Stay Plus Ultra, Saki! (Phew.)
3-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:chiaki=embarrassed,We-well. L-looks like we're in this together, Saki and Chiaki.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Comfort should come before style, I think! I mean, I dress in a ridiculous costume like this!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=shy,T-that could work, actually. What do you think Saki?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=shy,I think that idea could work! Saki, what kind of superpower would you want?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:1=interested,Oh! So your outfit isn't a set of support items, it's actually your Quirk, right?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Huh? Not a hero? You just carry around all that stuff for work?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Well, I think you’re starting to get <i>less</i> outfitted. But it’s what you do that makes you a hero, I think.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=embarrassed,Ha! So you are a he--r--ohhh. Hrmph. T-that seems like a bad superpower!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=gravity,I'm not sure I follow, but you don't seem hurt, which is great! Your poor support items... at least mine don't usually break! T-though sometimes I lose my grip...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=heroic,I think learned about this in history! You've got that nautical quirk: Destroyer, right? What a cool hero name!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4=gravity,I'm glad you're okay, Shimakaze...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:dizzy=nauseous,When I overuse my Quirk, I feel like that too, Shimakaze. S-sorry.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:1=embarrassed,W-well, I'll tell her about this. N-not about the game, but I'm sure she'd be really flattered!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=shy,T-that could be pretty damaging to some people’s careers, I think. Y-you know?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:2=embarrassed,P-please?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:1=heroic,I haven’t been out of the academy for very long, but I thought your “Chronal Acceleration” Quirk was awesome!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:2=embarrassed,U-um. Anyway, I have a friend whose Quirk was similar to yours, in how he could phase through solid objects. Could I get an autograph for him? I-if it’s no trouble.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=vexed,Hmm… I wonder if Tohru would employ the same strategy… Though it’s not like anyone can see her when she’s n-n-naked.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:5=shy,But I have a feeling you’ve probably inspired a lot of interesting sets of tactics in a game like this…
3-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:6=nauseous,And this is how you… Process that, I suppose I’ll just relax and try to keep an eye on everyone else.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=shy,I wish we'd met in less embarrassing circumstances...


#lost belt
4-male_removing_accessory=calm,Oh, just your ~clothing~, ~name~?
4-male_removing_accessory=interested,Your ~clothing~? And not... something bigger?
4-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:american=interested,Though I never expected to learn something like this!
4-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=vexed,Even a name like “9S” is kind of shadowy and mysterious…
4-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:1=happy,H-he also worked really, really hard to get where he is as a hero. I think you two would have a lot in common, actually.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1=embarrassed,B-but what's your Quirk, anyway?
4-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1=calm,Hmm... so wait, is your Hero name Star Platinum? I don't think I've heard of you.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0=interested,Those seem like kind of a hassle though... Do they help you stay focused in combat?
4-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Th-though I wouldn't want you to lose! I just-- Um. Is it awkward in here or is it just me?
4-male_removed_accessory=happy,Er, I mean, take off whatever you'd like!
4-male_removed_accessory=vexed,I know it's kind of not-very-professional of me, but I'd liked to have seen a <i>bit</i> more.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1=shy,And what’s with the blindfold? I thought for sure you’d take that off first!
4-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1=shy,Pfft. Aliens aren’t real. Just because some people look strange doesn’t make them extraterrestrial.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:twilight=heroic,Aliens aren’t real. People like, say, Twilight, look unusual, but are just like you or me!
4-male_removed_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:2=shy,Th-though I don't think I'd want to play this game with him.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1=happy,Oh wow! That "Stand" of yours is a time-control Quirk? That's really powerful!
4-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:2=shy,It's kind of weird to meet in a place like this, but it's good to see that you're using your powerful Quirk to help people here. R-right?
4-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Er. If you could <i>not</i> pay it back tenfold and keep being nice, I know <i>I'd</i> be a lot happier.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2=shy,I-I mean I'm sure glad your pants didn't fall down, at least!
4-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2=shy,E-er. W-well, at least we can pretend like nothing's happened or gone wrong, right?
4-female_removing_accessory=heroic,I'm sorry, ~name~! I know my bodysuit covers almost all of my skin, so please just take off whatever makes you comfortable.
4-female_removing_accessory=happy,Your ~clothing~ is a good choice!
4-female_removing_accessory=calm,I'll admit... I'm kind of happy to keep my suit on, ~name~.
4-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:american=interested,Though I never expected to learn something like this!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:alice_degracia,targetStage:0=shy,You remind me of a very purple version of a friend of mine.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:0=happy,Oh, so you have a vocal quirk like Present Mic? He's such a funny teacher.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:0=interested,While anyone can certainly be a hero, I think based on how you’re dressed it’s probably not a strict regimen.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:1,marker:uravity_helps_cammy=gravity,Oh no! Don't worry, Cammy, Pro Hero Uravity is here! I'll just suspend them from the ceiling.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:2=serious,Okay, same thing! Everyone remain calm! Cammy and I have this under control!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=vexed,You aren't associated with that hand-guy, are you, Chiaki!?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=interested,I'm kind of nervous to find out what your Quirk could be...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:0=serious,Are you American? You certainly seem quite sure of yourself…
4-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Oh, duh, it has to be something sound related. D.Va, like diva! I get it. Kind on the nose, though…
4-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:2=vexed,You… Surely needed those for something interesting, right? Just for listening to music?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=vexed,Do you have a Quirk that makes you need an outfit like that? Or do you just like to dress all historical?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=shy,What kind of Quirk do you use with a belt like that, Florina? Oh! You seem so jittery! M-maybe it's for like... o-or maybe you're just embarrassed...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=vexed,--W-WAIT! We can leave!? I-I'm gonna go too!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1=interested,I think digital Quirks are really underrated. You probably get access to all kinds of unique stuff!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0=embarrassed,Well, you only have two arms and two legs, so I’m guessing you have a web-based Quirk? Or…
4-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=gravity,What kind of stuff does the “Fairy” Quirk let you do? Flight, right? Good! I’m going to go ahead and try avoid being embarrassed. I’d turn pinker than you!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=interested,Huh, that's such an interesting pattern! Our school uniform was just a flat red tie.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=happy,The polka dots look so pretty!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette=interested,I'm sorry, I was kind of... tricked into coming, but is it a polka dot theme today?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette=interested,Between Marinette and Mahiru, it seems we have a polka dot theme tonight...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=interested,Careful, Mahiru! People might be able to see up your skirt!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=embarrassed,E-er, Mahiru, there might be a more... ladylike way of...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:0=nauseous,She’s one of the few people I know with teeth like that…
4-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=serious,Wh-what? You have multiple Quirks!?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:2=interested,Huh. That’s weird. I’ve never heard of a Quirk-granting object before, but that does kind of make sense…
4-female_removing_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:0=embarrassed,Um! S-sorry, that’s a really embarrassing reaction.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:1=interested,Do you happen to have an affinity for technology, other Mei?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=heroic,You remind me a lot of Ingenium!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0,totalMales:1-3=shy,I-I mean, I’ve seen… Um. You know what, I’ll just stop this line of inquiry.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:0=calm,You look so… healthy. And you’re a doctor? What’s <i>your</i> Quirk like?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=calm,It’s… Kinda rare to see a “demon”-type Quirk…
4-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:0=interested,Hmm... didn't you have a harp earlier?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:0=vexed,I know you're the quiet type. But that doesn't mean I don't know a villain when I see one.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetSaidMarker:pinka_start,targetNotSaidMarker:pinka_end2,notSaidMarker:pinka1=vexed,Wait a second, is this like a split personality thing, or have you been one of those Stain-followers the whole time?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:2=interested,Huh? They're heavy? I... can't really imagine a support item like that being helpful for parties...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:0=interested,A time stop Quirk?? That's a really strong one!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=interested,Sure, small stuff is reasonable... but do you need those for a Quirk?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=interested,Y-you look even better without your tie, Saki!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:chiaki=shy,I-I'm not really happy with this type of thing either, you two.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=heroic,Those are nice shoes, Saki! I think I have a pair just like them!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,marker:pink_underwear=embarrassed,H-hey! D-don't look up her skirt, everyone!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity,priority:990=shy,A-ah! No, Futaba, we shouldn't embarrass her, we should focus on stuff we can do to cheer her up!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=happy,Oh! That's a great idea. It'll be a lot easier with the two of us, too!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:0=happy,Oh! I get it. Nice to meet you, Magical Girl! That's your hero name, right?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=heroic,You’re really loaded out with lots of gear. I can see you’re a utility-type Hero!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=interested,I’ve never heard of Glitch City either… But White Knights and Valkyries sounds awfully like a Pro Hero group of some sort…
4-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=nauseous,…Unless you had some sort of digestion Quirk? I used to know someone who gained a lot of strength whenever he’d eat sugar…
4-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=shy,W-what kind of Quirk do you have? Is it speed based? Or fire, or...?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=shy,I-I still can't get used to how you're undressing. N-not that I'd want to... Wait, I think I recognize your name... Shimakaze, like the ship?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=embarrassed,Careful-- even someone with a Quirk like yours has a hard time getting hit in the head, Shimakaze!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:0=shy,I'm always really flattered and amazed by how popular Pro Hero color palettes enter the mainstream wardrobe.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=nauseous,I don’t mind being recorded in my day to day work… B-b-ut I’m pretty uncomfortable with the idea that this’ll end up on the internet somewhere.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=vexed,But can you leave the rest of us out of it?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:0=happy,I’m… Actually kind of a fan. I did a report on you back in school!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:1=gravity,I really like my Quirk and it’s super useful for hero stuff and for more conventional trades, but I think everyone wishes they had a little more time.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:3=shy,It’s kind of weird, b-b-but you seem really comfortable while naked, so I g-g-guess that’s a nice way to be!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=vexed,You must have practiced this game <i>a lot</i> if you’re bored enough to try something like this. Or crazy...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:5=embarrassed,I-I’m sorry I didn’t realize it sooner, but this is kind of a fetish thing for you, isn’t it? I-- don’t really have any hangups like that, but if you're pretending that being an alien...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:0=happy,Well, you seem like you've got a legacy angle, and you like to fight in tournaments... I bet you'd have done will at UA!
4-female_removed_accessory=calm,I don't mind you playing with small stuff, I'm still pretty much covered, after all...
4-female_removed_accessory=vexed,At this stage, I was expecting something a little more practical than that, ~name~.
4-female_removed_accessory=interested,Hmm.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2,count-bodysuit:2=embarrassed,I mean, some of us dress in some really silly costumes, Saki. I wouldn't worry about your shoes!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:alice_degracia,targetStage:1=embarrassed,(I suppose it's really rude to ask if she's a cousin or sister of his, knowing Endeavor...)
4-female_removed_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:1=shy,I-I hope you are just as unshy as he is. F-for your sake.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:annie=happy,On the plus side, you’re not quite as… <i>Unusual</i> as some of the support-class at UA! I bet you lead a fun life, at least!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:2=heroic,Good job knocking them out! They should be harmless up there for a little while, anyway.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:3=gravity,Y-you're really good at dealing with them, Cammy. I guess you've encountered them before... Um.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=shy,Tomura Shigaraki! He's real bad news and talks about video games as much as you do! I'm keeping an eye on you, Chiaki...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:saki=interested,H-hey, Chiaki, I think Saki wants to ask you something...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=shy,I'm n-not going to let my guard down!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Y-you can't get me to let <i>my</i> guard down!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=heroic,You’re clearly also ready for combat, but I can’t get a good feel for your Quirk…
4-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:2=happy,Or maybe it’s an American thing I don’t quite get. I’ll admit most of what I know about the US comes from All Might or Deku…
4-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:3=serious,What? Are you even paying attention, D.Va?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:1=vexed,Either way, it’s a very interesting style. If you want lots of pieces to win the game...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=calm,Hm... You're braver than you act, huh, Florina?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=embarrassed,Er-- A hero should know when to go for backup, but I guess there's no running here...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:2=embarrassed,W-wait, why shouldn't I approve? Are you helping the villains!? That seems so out of character!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:1=shy,Gah! I sure hope not!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=shy,I’m totally paying attention to your rebuttal. Yep. Sure am! Definitely not using this to focus on the fact that I think you can fly to distance myself from how much better at… Being composed you are.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=heroic,I think everyone's confused why you didn't just let go of your camera!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:1=gravity,Though how are you floating? I know there’s some complicated Quirks out there, but “Vampire” and all its powers seems very strong...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:1=embarrassed,N-not like, in a way that’s relevant to this game!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:2=shy,I wouldn’t want to-- Especially not with another woman-- I just-- Hmrmhph!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=shy,I-it’s very strange to have more than one! I only know a villain with that sort of ability set!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3=heroic,A guardian spirit? Hmm… that’s kind of like my friend Tokoyami’s Quirk: Dark Shadow!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:1=nauseous,It’ll… take too long explain so I’m just going to pretend like it didn’t happen…
4-female_removed_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:2=heroic,Hm… I’m keeping an eye on you…
4-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=shy,Your costume certainly looks like it’s built for impacts or acceleration. And you’re so serious! I-I could probably stand to gain some composure from you.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1,totalMales:1-3=gravity,Whoops, gotta right myself... um... I wouldn't mind hearing more about where you're from...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:1=interested,I mean, obviously something medical related… It’s kind of hard to just be a doctor without something extra these days…
4-female_removed_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:1=embarrassed,T-though you don't have to act the part, I hope you know...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1=embarrassed,WAIT? WE CAN LEAVE? OKAYTHAT'SGREAT I'MJUSTGOING TO-- err... I should... just stay on guard, I suppose...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:1=serious,I'll take you down, and bring you to justice, Neopolitan!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetSaidMarker:pinka_start,targetNotSaidMarker:pinka_end2,notSaidMarker:pinka1,marker:pinka1=serious,I'll just have to kick your butt, Pink Stain!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:3=happy,Oh! I guess it might help you dance? You certainly are making this quite a show, Pinkie Pie!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:3=embarrassed,I guess they could help you dance. Not that you're moving around a lot yet. Or um. That you'd need to...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:1=calm,Gensokyo? Where's that?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=happy,If you're part of something called the "Flame Tribe" I guess you don't need to keep your hands warm...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=heroic,D-don't worry! I believe in you! Stay Plus Ultra, Saki! (Phew.)
4-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:chiaki=embarrassed,We-well. L-looks like we're in this together, Saki and Chiaki.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Comfort should come before style, I think! I mean, I dress in a ridiculous costume like this!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=shy,T-that could work, actually. What do you think Saki?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=shy,I think that idea could work! Saki, what kind of superpower would you want?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:1=interested,Oh! So your outfit isn't a set of support items, it's actually your Quirk, right?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Huh? Not a hero? You just carry around all that stuff for work?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Well, I think you’re starting to get <i>less</i> outfitted. But it’s what you do that makes you a hero, I think.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=embarrassed,Ha! So you are a he--r--ohhh. Hrmph. T-that seems like a bad superpower!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=gravity,I'm not sure I follow, but you don't seem hurt, which is great! Your poor support items... at least mine don't usually break! T-though sometimes I lose my grip...

4-female_removed_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:1=embarrassed,W-well, I'll tell her about this. N-not about the game, but I'm sure she'd be really flattered!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=shy,T-that could be pretty damaging to some people’s careers, I think. Y-you know?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:2=embarrassed,P-please?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:1=heroic,I haven’t been out of the academy for very long, but I thought your “Chronal Acceleration” Quirk was awesome!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:2=embarrassed,U-um. Anyway, I have a friend whose Quirk was similar to yours, in how he could phase through solid objects. Could I get an autograph for him? I-if it’s no trouble.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=vexed,Hmm… I wonder if Tohru would employ the same strategy… Though it’s not like anyone can see her when she’s n-n-naked.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:5=shy,But I have a feeling you’ve probably inspired a lot of interesting sets of tactics in a game like this…
4-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:6=nauseous,And this is how you… Process that, I suppose I’ll just relax and try to keep an eye on everyone else.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=shy,I wish we'd met in less embarrassing circumstances...


#lost costume
5-male_removing_accessory=embarrassed,Only your ~clothing~?!
5-male_removing_accessory=nauseous,You're still wearing your ~clothing~, ~name~?
5-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:american=interested,Though I never expected to learn something like this!
5-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=vexed,Even a name like “9S” is kind of shadowy and mysterious…
5-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:1=happy,H-he also worked really, really hard to get where he is as a hero. I think you two would have a lot in common, actually.
5-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1=embarrassed,B-but what's your Quirk, anyway?
5-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1=calm,Hmm... so wait, is your Hero name Star Platinum? I don't think I've heard of you.
5-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0=interested,Those seem like kind of a hassle though... Do they help you stay focused in combat?
5-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Th-though I wouldn't want you to lose! I just-- Um. Is it awkward in here or is it just me?
5-male_removed_accessory=vexed,Aww, ~name~, I'm in my underwear! I'll protect you even if I'm naked, b-b-but, gah, so embarrassing!
5-male_removed_accessory=interested,I was just thinking how cool you looked...
5-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1=shy,And what’s with the blindfold? I thought for sure you’d take that off first!
5-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1=shy,Pfft. Aliens aren’t real. Just because some people look strange doesn’t make them extraterrestrial.
5-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:twilight=heroic,Aliens aren’t real. People like, say, Twilight, look unusual, but are just like you or me!
5-male_removed_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:2=shy,Th-though I don't think I'd want to play this game with him.
5-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1=happy,Oh wow! That "Stand" of yours is a time-control Quirk? That's really powerful!
5-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:2=shy,It's kind of weird to meet in a place like this, but it's good to see that you're using your powerful Quirk to help people here. R-right?
5-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Er. If you could <i>not</i> pay it back tenfold and keep being nice, I know <i>I'd</i> be a lot happier.
5-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2=shy,I-I mean I'm sure glad your pants didn't fall down, at least!
5-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2=shy,E-er. W-well, at least we can pretend like nothing's happened or gone wrong, right?
5-female_removing_accessory=serious,Hmm... That's an... interesting choice, ~name~.
5-female_removing_accessory=vexed,I'm really starting to think that taking Tohru's advice on minimalism was the wrong choice.
5-female_removing_accessory=interested,Hm. H-hrm. I think this game c-could actually be a lot of fun if I wasn't here on duty. M-maybe I could even convince some of the other pros to play!
5-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:american=interested,Though I never expected to learn something like this!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:alice_degracia,targetStage:0=shy,You remind me of a very purple version of a friend of mine.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:0=happy,Oh, so you have a vocal quirk like Present Mic? He's such a funny teacher.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:0=interested,While anyone can certainly be a hero, I think based on how you’re dressed it’s probably not a strict regimen.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:1,marker:uravity_helps_cammy=gravity,Oh no! Don't worry, Cammy, Pro Hero Uravity is here! I'll just suspend them from the ceiling.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:2=serious,Okay, same thing! Everyone remain calm! Cammy and I have this under control!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=vexed,You aren't associated with that hand-guy, are you, Chiaki!?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=interested,I'm kind of nervous to find out what your Quirk could be...
5-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:0=serious,Are you American? You certainly seem quite sure of yourself…
5-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Oh, duh, it has to be something sound related. D.Va, like diva! I get it. Kind on the nose, though…
5-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:2=vexed,You… Surely needed those for something interesting, right? Just for listening to music?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=vexed,Do you have a Quirk that makes you need an outfit like that? Or do you just like to dress all historical?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=shy,What kind of Quirk do you use with a belt like that, Florina? Oh! You seem so jittery! M-maybe it's for like... o-or maybe you're just embarrassed...
5-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=vexed,--W-WAIT! We can leave!? I-I'm gonna go too!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1=interested,I think digital Quirks are really underrated. You probably get access to all kinds of unique stuff!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0=embarrassed,Well, you only have two arms and two legs, so I’m guessing you have a web-based Quirk? Or…
5-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=gravity,What kind of stuff does the “Fairy” Quirk let you do? Flight, right? Good! I’m going to go ahead and try avoid being embarrassed. I’d turn pinker than you!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=interested,Huh, that's such an interesting pattern! Our school uniform was just a flat red tie.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=happy,The polka dots look so pretty!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette=interested,I'm sorry, I was kind of... tricked into coming, but is it a polka dot theme today?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette=interested,Between Marinette and Mahiru, it seems we have a polka dot theme tonight...
5-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=interested,Careful, Mahiru! People might be able to see up your skirt!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=embarrassed,E-er, Mahiru, there might be a more... ladylike way of...
5-female_removing_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:0=nauseous,She’s one of the few people I know with teeth like that…
5-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=serious,Wh-what? You have multiple Quirks!?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:2=interested,Huh. That’s weird. I’ve never heard of a Quirk-granting object before, but that does kind of make sense…
5-female_removing_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:0=embarrassed,Um! S-sorry, that’s a really embarrassing reaction.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:1=interested,Do you happen to have an affinity for technology, other Mei?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=heroic,You remind me a lot of Ingenium!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0,totalMales:1-3=shy,I-I mean, I’ve seen… Um. You know what, I’ll just stop this line of inquiry.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:0=calm,You look so… healthy. And you’re a doctor? What’s <i>your</i> Quirk like?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=calm,It’s… Kinda rare to see a “demon”-type Quirk…
5-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:0=interested,Hmm... didn't you have a harp earlier?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:0=vexed,I know you're the quiet type. But that doesn't mean I don't know a villain when I see one.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetSaidMarker:pinka_start,targetNotSaidMarker:pinka_end2,notSaidMarker:pinka1=vexed,Wait a second, is this like a split personality thing, or have you been one of those Stain-followers the whole time?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:2=interested,Huh? They're heavy? I... can't really imagine a support item like that being helpful for parties...
5-female_removing_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:0=interested,A time stop Quirk?? That's a really strong one!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=interested,Sure, small stuff is reasonable... but do you need those for a Quirk?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=interested,Y-you look even better without your tie, Saki!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:chiaki=shy,I-I'm not really happy with this type of thing either, you two.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=heroic,Those are nice shoes, Saki! I think I have a pair just like them!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,marker:pink_underwear=embarrassed,H-hey! D-don't look up her skirt, everyone!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity,priority:990=shy,A-ah! No, Futaba, we shouldn't embarrass her, we should focus on stuff we can do to cheer her up!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=happy,Oh! That's a great idea. It'll be a lot easier with the two of us, too!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:0=happy,Oh! I get it. Nice to meet you, Magical Girl! That's your hero name, right?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=heroic,You’re really loaded out with lots of gear. I can see you’re a utility-type Hero!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=interested,I’ve never heard of Glitch City either… But White Knights and Valkyries sounds awfully like a Pro Hero group of some sort…
5-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=nauseous,…Unless you had some sort of digestion Quirk? I used to know someone who gained a lot of strength whenever he’d eat sugar…
5-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=shy,W-what kind of Quirk do you have? Is it speed based? Or fire, or...?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=shy,I-I still can't get used to how you're undressing. N-not that I'd want to... Wait, I think I recognize your name... Shimakaze, like the ship?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=embarrassed,Careful-- even someone with a Quirk like yours has a hard time getting hit in the head, Shimakaze!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:0=shy,I'm always really flattered and amazed by how popular Pro Hero color palettes enter the mainstream wardrobe.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=nauseous,I don’t mind being recorded in my day to day work… B-b-ut I’m pretty uncomfortable with the idea that this’ll end up on the internet somewhere.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=vexed,But can you leave the rest of us out of it?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:0=happy,I’m… Actually kind of a fan. I did a report on you back in school!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:1=gravity,I really like my Quirk and it’s super useful for hero stuff and for more conventional trades, but I think everyone wishes they had a little more time.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:3=shy,It’s kind of weird, b-b-but you seem really comfortable while naked, so I g-g-guess that’s a nice way to be!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=vexed,You must have practiced this game <i>a lot</i> if you’re bored enough to try something like this. Or crazy...
5-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:5=embarrassed,I-I’m sorry I didn’t realize it sooner, but this is kind of a fetish thing for you, isn’t it? I-- don’t really have any hangups like that, but if you're pretending that being an alien...
5-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:0=happy,Well, you seem like you've got a legacy angle, and you like to fight in tournaments... I bet you'd have done will at UA!
5-female_removed_accessory=calm,Well, I guess I don't mind too much, I <i>did</i> say I'd protect you all...
5-female_removed_accessory=happy,Are you having fun, ~name~? Or do you want to stop? In crisis training I was usually more focused on dealing with rubble than people, so I'm having a bit of trouble here.
5-female_removed_accessory=heroic,Well, ~name~, it looks like you're still in good hands!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2,count-bodysuit:2=embarrassed,I mean, some of us dress in some really silly costumes, Saki. I wouldn't worry about your shoes!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:alice_degracia,targetStage:1=embarrassed,(I suppose it's really rude to ask if she's a cousin or sister of his, knowing Endeavor...)
5-female_removed_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:1=shy,I-I hope you are just as unshy as he is. F-for your sake.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:annie=happy,On the plus side, you’re not quite as… <i>Unusual</i> as some of the support-class at UA! I bet you lead a fun life, at least!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:2=heroic,Good job knocking them out! They should be harmless up there for a little while, anyway.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:3=gravity,Y-you're really good at dealing with them, Cammy. I guess you've encountered them before... Um.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=shy,Tomura Shigaraki! He's real bad news and talks about video games as much as you do! I'm keeping an eye on you, Chiaki...
5-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:saki=interested,H-hey, Chiaki, I think Saki wants to ask you something...
5-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=shy,I'm n-not going to let my guard down!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Y-you can't get me to let <i>my</i> guard down!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=heroic,You’re clearly also ready for combat, but I can’t get a good feel for your Quirk…
5-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:2=happy,Or maybe it’s an American thing I don’t quite get. I’ll admit most of what I know about the US comes from All Might or Deku…
5-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:3=serious,What? Are you even paying attention, D.Va?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:1=vexed,Either way, it’s a very interesting style. If you want lots of pieces to win the game...
5-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=calm,Hm... You're braver than you act, huh, Florina?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=embarrassed,Er-- A hero should know when to go for backup, but I guess there's no running here...
5-female_removed_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:2=embarrassed,W-wait, why shouldn't I approve? Are you helping the villains!? That seems so out of character!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:1=shy,Gah! I sure hope not!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=shy,I’m totally paying attention to your rebuttal. Yep. Sure am! Definitely not using this to focus on the fact that I think you can fly to distance myself from how much better at… Being composed you are.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=heroic,I think everyone's confused why you didn't just let go of your camera!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:1=gravity,Though how are you floating? I know there’s some complicated Quirks out there, but “Vampire” and all its powers seems very strong...
5-female_removed_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:1=embarrassed,N-not like, in a way that’s relevant to this game!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:2=shy,I wouldn’t want to-- Especially not with another woman-- I just-- Hmrmhph!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=shy,I-it’s very strange to have more than one! I only know a villain with that sort of ability set!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3=heroic,A guardian spirit? Hmm… that’s kind of like my friend Tokoyami’s Quirk: Dark Shadow!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:1=nauseous,It’ll… take too long explain so I’m just going to pretend like it didn’t happen…
5-female_removed_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:2=heroic,Hm… I’m keeping an eye on you…
5-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=shy,Your costume certainly looks like it’s built for impacts or acceleration. And you’re so serious! I-I could probably stand to gain some composure from you.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1,totalMales:1-3=gravity,Whoops, gotta right myself... um... I wouldn't mind hearing more about where you're from...
5-female_removed_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:1=interested,I mean, obviously something medical related… It’s kind of hard to just be a doctor without something extra these days…
5-female_removed_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:1=embarrassed,T-though you don't have to act the part, I hope you know...
5-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1=embarrassed,WAIT? WE CAN LEAVE? OKAYTHAT'SGREAT I'MJUSTGOING TO-- err... I should... just stay on guard, I suppose...
5-female_removed_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:1=serious,I'll take you down, and bring you to justice, Neopolitan!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetSaidMarker:pinka_start,targetNotSaidMarker:pinka_end2,notSaidMarker:pinka1,marker:pinka1=serious,I'll just have to kick your butt, Pink Stain!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:3=happy,Oh! I guess it might help you dance? You certainly are making this quite a show, Pinkie Pie!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:3=embarrassed,I guess they could help you dance. Not that you're moving around a lot yet. Or um. That you'd need to...
5-female_removed_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:1=calm,Gensokyo? Where's that?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=happy,If you're part of something called the "Flame Tribe" I guess you don't need to keep your hands warm...
5-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=heroic,D-don't worry! I believe in you! Stay Plus Ultra, Saki! (Phew.)
5-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:chiaki=embarrassed,We-well. L-looks like we're in this together, Saki and Chiaki.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Comfort should come before style, I think! I mean, I dress in a ridiculous costume like this!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=shy,T-that could work, actually. What do you think Saki?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=shy,I think that idea could work! Saki, what kind of superpower would you want?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:1=interested,Oh! So your outfit isn't a set of support items, it's actually your Quirk, right?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Huh? Not a hero? You just carry around all that stuff for work?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Well, I think you’re starting to get <i>less</i> outfitted. But it’s what you do that makes you a hero, I think.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=embarrassed,Ha! So you are a he--r--ohhh. Hrmph. T-that seems like a bad superpower!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=gravity,I'm not sure I follow, but you don't seem hurt, which is great! Your poor support items... at least mine don't usually break! T-though sometimes I lose my grip...
5-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=heroic,I think learned about this in history! You've got that nautical quirk: Destroyer, right? What a cool hero name!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4=gravity,I'm glad you're okay, Shimakaze...
5-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:dizzy=nauseous,When I overuse my Quirk, I feel like that too, Shimakaze. S-sorry.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:1=embarrassed,W-well, I'll tell her about this. N-not about the game, but I'm sure she'd be really flattered!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=shy,T-that could be pretty damaging to some people’s careers, I think. Y-you know?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:2=embarrassed,P-please?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:1=heroic,I haven’t been out of the academy for very long, but I thought your “Chronal Acceleration” Quirk was awesome!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:2=embarrassed,U-um. Anyway, I have a friend whose Quirk was similar to yours, in how he could phase through solid objects. Could I get an autograph for him? I-if it’s no trouble.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=vexed,Hmm… I wonder if Tohru would employ the same strategy… Though it’s not like anyone can see her when she’s n-n-naked.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:5=shy,But I have a feeling you’ve probably inspired a lot of interesting sets of tactics in a game like this…
5-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:6=nauseous,And this is how you… Process that, I suppose I’ll just relax and try to keep an eye on everyone else.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=shy,I wish we'd met in less embarrassing circumstances...


#lost bra
6-male_removing_accessory=calm,Aww, just ~clothing~?
6-male_removing_accessory=vexed,You know, I'm <i>clearly</i> working hard to protect you, ~name~.
6-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:american=interested,Though I never expected to learn something like this!
6-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=vexed,Even a name like “9S” is kind of shadowy and mysterious…
6-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:1=happy,H-he also worked really, really hard to get where he is as a hero. I think you two would have a lot in common, actually.
6-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1=embarrassed,B-but what's your Quirk, anyway?
6-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1=calm,Hmm... so wait, is your Hero name Star Platinum? I don't think I've heard of you.
6-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0=interested,Those seem like kind of a hassle though... Do they help you stay focused in combat?
6-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Th-though I wouldn't want you to lose! I just-- Um. Is it awkward in here or is it just me?
6-male_removed_accessory=embarrassed,Sometimes a hero likes saving too, ~name~...
6-male_removed_accessory=serious,<i>Hrmph.</i> I've got my boobs out, ~name~. I'd have thought you'd be a bit more... heroic.
6-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1=shy,And what’s with the blindfold? I thought for sure you’d take that off first!
6-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1=shy,Pfft. Aliens aren’t real. Just because some people look strange doesn’t make them extraterrestrial.
6-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:twilight=heroic,Aliens aren’t real. People like, say, Twilight, look unusual, but are just like you or me!
6-male_removed_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:2=shy,Th-though I don't think I'd want to play this game with him.
6-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1=happy,Oh wow! That "Stand" of yours is a time-control Quirk? That's really powerful!
6-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:2=shy,It's kind of weird to meet in a place like this, but it's good to see that you're using your powerful Quirk to help people here. R-right?
6-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Er. If you could <i>not</i> pay it back tenfold and keep being nice, I know <i>I'd</i> be a lot happier.
6-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2=shy,I-I mean I'm sure glad your pants didn't fall down, at least!
6-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2=shy,E-er. W-well, at least we can pretend like nothing's happened or gone wrong, right?
6-female_removing_accessory=nauseous,Oh, oh gosh. You still have ~clothing~?
6-female_removing_accessory=embarrassed,I'm... doing a pretty good job, if you have ~clothing~ left, ~name~.
6-female_removing_accessory=calm,Hmm. You're doing really well, ~name~! Do you have a probability Quirk or am I just bad at cards...?
6-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:american=interested,Though I never expected to learn something like this!
6-female_removing_accessory,target:alice_degracia,targetStage:0=shy,You remind me of a very purple version of a friend of mine.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:0=happy,Oh, so you have a vocal quirk like Present Mic? He's such a funny teacher.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:0=interested,While anyone can certainly be a hero, I think based on how you’re dressed it’s probably not a strict regimen.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:1,marker:uravity_helps_cammy=gravity,Oh no! Don't worry, Cammy, Pro Hero Uravity is here! I'll just suspend them from the ceiling.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:2=serious,Okay, same thing! Everyone remain calm! Cammy and I have this under control!
6-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=vexed,You aren't associated with that hand-guy, are you, Chiaki!?
6-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=interested,I'm kind of nervous to find out what your Quirk could be...
6-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:0=serious,Are you American? You certainly seem quite sure of yourself…
6-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Oh, duh, it has to be something sound related. D.Va, like diva! I get it. Kind on the nose, though…
6-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:2=vexed,You… Surely needed those for something interesting, right? Just for listening to music?
6-female_removing_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=vexed,Do you have a Quirk that makes you need an outfit like that? Or do you just like to dress all historical?
6-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=shy,What kind of Quirk do you use with a belt like that, Florina? Oh! You seem so jittery! M-maybe it's for like... o-or maybe you're just embarrassed...
6-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=vexed,--W-WAIT! We can leave!? I-I'm gonna go too!
6-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1=interested,I think digital Quirks are really underrated. You probably get access to all kinds of unique stuff!
6-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0=embarrassed,Well, you only have two arms and two legs, so I’m guessing you have a web-based Quirk? Or…
6-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=gravity,What kind of stuff does the “Fairy” Quirk let you do? Flight, right? Good! I’m going to go ahead and try avoid being embarrassed. I’d turn pinker than you!
6-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=interested,Huh, that's such an interesting pattern! Our school uniform was just a flat red tie.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=happy,The polka dots look so pretty!
6-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette=interested,I'm sorry, I was kind of... tricked into coming, but is it a polka dot theme today?
6-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette=interested,Between Marinette and Mahiru, it seems we have a polka dot theme tonight...
6-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=interested,Careful, Mahiru! People might be able to see up your skirt!
6-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=embarrassed,E-er, Mahiru, there might be a more... ladylike way of...
6-female_removing_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:0=nauseous,She’s one of the few people I know with teeth like that…
6-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=serious,Wh-what? You have multiple Quirks!?
6-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:2=interested,Huh. That’s weird. I’ve never heard of a Quirk-granting object before, but that does kind of make sense…
6-female_removing_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:0=embarrassed,Um! S-sorry, that’s a really embarrassing reaction.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:1=interested,Do you happen to have an affinity for technology, other Mei?
6-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=heroic,You remind me a lot of Ingenium!
6-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0,totalMales:1-3=shy,I-I mean, I’ve seen… Um. You know what, I’ll just stop this line of inquiry.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:0=calm,You look so… healthy. And you’re a doctor? What’s <i>your</i> Quirk like?
6-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=calm,It’s… Kinda rare to see a “demon”-type Quirk…
6-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:0=interested,Hmm... didn't you have a harp earlier?
6-female_removing_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:0=vexed,I know you're the quiet type. But that doesn't mean I don't know a villain when I see one.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetSaidMarker:pinka_start,targetNotSaidMarker:pinka_end2,notSaidMarker:pinka1=vexed,Wait a second, is this like a split personality thing, or have you been one of those Stain-followers the whole time?
6-female_removing_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:2=interested,Huh? They're heavy? I... can't really imagine a support item like that being helpful for parties...
6-female_removing_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:0=interested,A time stop Quirk?? That's a really strong one!
6-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=interested,Sure, small stuff is reasonable... but do you need those for a Quirk?
6-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=interested,Y-you look even better without your tie, Saki!
6-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:chiaki=shy,I-I'm not really happy with this type of thing either, you two.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=heroic,Those are nice shoes, Saki! I think I have a pair just like them!
6-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,marker:pink_underwear=embarrassed,H-hey! D-don't look up her skirt, everyone!
6-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity,priority:990=shy,A-ah! No, Futaba, we shouldn't embarrass her, we should focus on stuff we can do to cheer her up!
6-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=happy,Oh! That's a great idea. It'll be a lot easier with the two of us, too!
6-female_removing_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:0=happy,Oh! I get it. Nice to meet you, Magical Girl! That's your hero name, right?
6-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=heroic,You’re really loaded out with lots of gear. I can see you’re a utility-type Hero!
6-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=interested,I’ve never heard of Glitch City either… But White Knights and Valkyries sounds awfully like a Pro Hero group of some sort…
6-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=nauseous,…Unless you had some sort of digestion Quirk? I used to know someone who gained a lot of strength whenever he’d eat sugar…
6-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=shy,W-what kind of Quirk do you have? Is it speed based? Or fire, or...?
6-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=shy,I-I still can't get used to how you're undressing. N-not that I'd want to... Wait, I think I recognize your name... Shimakaze, like the ship?
6-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=embarrassed,Careful-- even someone with a Quirk like yours has a hard time getting hit in the head, Shimakaze!
6-female_removing_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:0=shy,I'm always really flattered and amazed by how popular Pro Hero color palettes enter the mainstream wardrobe.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=nauseous,I don’t mind being recorded in my day to day work… B-b-ut I’m pretty uncomfortable with the idea that this’ll end up on the internet somewhere.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=vexed,But can you leave the rest of us out of it?
6-female_removing_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:0=happy,I’m… Actually kind of a fan. I did a report on you back in school!
6-female_removing_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:1=gravity,I really like my Quirk and it’s super useful for hero stuff and for more conventional trades, but I think everyone wishes they had a little more time.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:3=shy,It’s kind of weird, b-b-but you seem really comfortable while naked, so I g-g-guess that’s a nice way to be!
6-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=vexed,You must have practiced this game <i>a lot</i> if you’re bored enough to try something like this. Or crazy...
6-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:5=embarrassed,I-I’m sorry I didn’t realize it sooner, but this is kind of a fetish thing for you, isn’t it? I-- don’t really have any hangups like that, but if you're pretending that being an alien...
6-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:0=happy,Well, you seem like you've got a legacy angle, and you like to fight in tournaments... I bet you'd have done will at UA!
6-female_removed_accessory=interested,Um, anyway. Nice ~clothing~.
6-female_removed_accessory=calm,You're going to have to teach me some tricks later, ~name~!
6-female_removed_accessory=happy,You're really good at this, ~name~! I... may have been a bit too eager to jump into the front lines on this, I think. At least it's just strip poker, and not something actually... dangerous.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2,count-bodysuit:2=embarrassed,I mean, some of us dress in some really silly costumes, Saki. I wouldn't worry about your shoes!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:alice_degracia,targetStage:1=embarrassed,(I suppose it's really rude to ask if she's a cousin or sister of his, knowing Endeavor...)
6-female_removed_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:1=shy,I-I hope you are just as unshy as he is. F-for your sake.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:annie=happy,On the plus side, you’re not quite as… <i>Unusual</i> as some of the support-class at UA! I bet you lead a fun life, at least!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:2=heroic,Good job knocking them out! They should be harmless up there for a little while, anyway.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:3=gravity,Y-you're really good at dealing with them, Cammy. I guess you've encountered them before... Um.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=shy,Tomura Shigaraki! He's real bad news and talks about video games as much as you do! I'm keeping an eye on you, Chiaki...
6-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:saki=interested,H-hey, Chiaki, I think Saki wants to ask you something...
6-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=shy,I'm n-not going to let my guard down!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Y-you can't get me to let <i>my</i> guard down!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=heroic,You’re clearly also ready for combat, but I can’t get a good feel for your Quirk…
6-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:2=happy,Or maybe it’s an American thing I don’t quite get. I’ll admit most of what I know about the US comes from All Might or Deku…
6-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:3=serious,What? Are you even paying attention, D.Va?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:1=vexed,Either way, it’s a very interesting style. If you want lots of pieces to win the game...
6-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=calm,Hm... You're braver than you act, huh, Florina?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=embarrassed,Er-- A hero should know when to go for backup, but I guess there's no running here...
6-female_removed_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:2=embarrassed,W-wait, why shouldn't I approve? Are you helping the villains!? That seems so out of character!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:1=shy,Gah! I sure hope not!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=shy,I’m totally paying attention to your rebuttal. Yep. Sure am! Definitely not using this to focus on the fact that I think you can fly to distance myself from how much better at… Being composed you are.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=heroic,I think everyone's confused why you didn't just let go of your camera!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:1=gravity,Though how are you floating? I know there’s some complicated Quirks out there, but “Vampire” and all its powers seems very strong...
6-female_removed_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:1=embarrassed,N-not like, in a way that’s relevant to this game!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:2=shy,I wouldn’t want to-- Especially not with another woman-- I just-- Hmrmhph!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=shy,I-it’s very strange to have more than one! I only know a villain with that sort of ability set!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3=heroic,A guardian spirit? Hmm… that’s kind of like my friend Tokoyami’s Quirk: Dark Shadow!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:1=nauseous,It’ll… take too long explain so I’m just going to pretend like it didn’t happen…
6-female_removed_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:2=heroic,Hm… I’m keeping an eye on you…
6-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=shy,Your costume certainly looks like it’s built for impacts or acceleration. And you’re so serious! I-I could probably stand to gain some composure from you.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1,totalMales:1-3=gravity,Whoops, gotta right myself... um... I wouldn't mind hearing more about where you're from...
6-female_removed_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:1=interested,I mean, obviously something medical related… It’s kind of hard to just be a doctor without something extra these days…
6-female_removed_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:1=embarrassed,T-though you don't have to act the part, I hope you know...
6-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1=embarrassed,WAIT? WE CAN LEAVE? OKAYTHAT'SGREAT I'MJUSTGOING TO-- err... I should... just stay on guard, I suppose...
6-female_removed_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:1=serious,I'll take you down, and bring you to justice, Neopolitan!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetSaidMarker:pinka_start,targetNotSaidMarker:pinka_end2,notSaidMarker:pinka1,marker:pinka1=serious,I'll just have to kick your butt, Pink Stain!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:3=happy,Oh! I guess it might help you dance? You certainly are making this quite a show, Pinkie Pie!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:3=embarrassed,I guess they could help you dance. Not that you're moving around a lot yet. Or um. That you'd need to...
6-female_removed_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:1=calm,Gensokyo? Where's that?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=happy,If you're part of something called the "Flame Tribe" I guess you don't need to keep your hands warm...
6-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=heroic,D-don't worry! I believe in you! Stay Plus Ultra, Saki! (Phew.)
6-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:chiaki=embarrassed,We-well. L-looks like we're in this together, Saki and Chiaki.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Comfort should come before style, I think! I mean, I dress in a ridiculous costume like this!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=shy,T-that could work, actually. What do you think Saki?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=shy,I think that idea could work! Saki, what kind of superpower would you want?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:1=interested,Oh! So your outfit isn't a set of support items, it's actually your Quirk, right?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Huh? Not a hero? You just carry around all that stuff for work?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Well, I think you’re starting to get <i>less</i> outfitted. But it’s what you do that makes you a hero, I think.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=embarrassed,Ha! So you are a he--r--ohhh. Hrmph. T-that seems like a bad superpower!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=gravity,I'm not sure I follow, but you don't seem hurt, which is great! Your poor support items... at least mine don't usually break! T-though sometimes I lose my grip...
6-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=heroic,I think learned about this in history! You've got that nautical quirk: Destroyer, right? What a cool hero name!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4=gravity,I'm glad you're okay, Shimakaze...
6-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:dizzy=nauseous,When I overuse my Quirk, I feel like that too, Shimakaze. S-sorry.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:1=embarrassed,W-well, I'll tell her about this. N-not about the game, but I'm sure she'd be really flattered!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=shy,T-that could be pretty damaging to some people’s careers, I think. Y-you know?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:2=embarrassed,P-please?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:1=heroic,I haven’t been out of the academy for very long, but I thought your “Chronal Acceleration” Quirk was awesome!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:2=embarrassed,U-um. Anyway, I have a friend whose Quirk was similar to yours, in how he could phase through solid objects. Could I get an autograph for him? I-if it’s no trouble.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=vexed,Hmm… I wonder if Tohru would employ the same strategy… Though it’s not like anyone can see her when she’s n-n-naked.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:5=shy,But I have a feeling you’ve probably inspired a lot of interesting sets of tactics in a game like this…
6-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:6=nauseous,And this is how you… Process that, I suppose I’ll just relax and try to keep an eye on everyone else.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=shy,I wish we'd met in less embarrassing circumstances...

-3-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1=calm,Hmm... so wait, is your Hero name Star Platinum? I don't think I've heard of you.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0=interested,Those seem like kind of a hassle though... Do they help you stay focused in combat?

-3-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1=shy,Pfft. Aliens aren’t real. Just because some people look strange doesn’t make them extraterrestrial.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:twilight=heroic,Aliens aren’t real. People like, say, Twilight, look unusual, but are just like you or me!

-3-female_removing_accessory=nauseous,O-okay, ~name~. You're really... doing better than me at least.
-3-female_removing_accessory=embarrassed,I don't suppose you'd have something bigger for next time? I don't like to make civilians responsible when I'm on duty, but I could use a <i>tiny</i> bit of distraction.

-3-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=calm,It’s… Kinda rare to see a “demon”-type Quirk…
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:0=interested,Hmm... didn't you have a harp earlier?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:0=vexed,I know you're the quiet type. But that doesn't mean I don't know a villain when I see one.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetSaidMarker:pinka_start,targetNotSaidMarker:pinka_end2,notSaidMarker:pinka1=vexed,Wait a second, is this like a split personality thing, or have you been one of those Stain-followers the whole time?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:2=interested,Huh? They're heavy? I... can't really imagine a support item like that being helpful for parties...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:0=interested,A time stop Quirk?? That's a really strong one!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=interested,Sure, small stuff is reasonable... but do you need those for a Quirk?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=interested,Y-you look even better without your tie, Saki!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:chiaki=shy,I-I'm not really happy with this type of thing either, you two.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=heroic,Those are nice shoes, Saki! I think I have a pair just like them!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,marker:pink_underwear=embarrassed,H-hey! D-don't look up her skirt, everyone!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity,priority:990=shy,A-ah! No, Futaba, we shouldn't embarrass her, we should focus on stuff we can do to cheer her up!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=happy,Oh! That's a great idea. It'll be a lot easier with the two of us, too!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:0=happy,Oh! I get it. Nice to meet you, Magical Girl! That's your hero name, right?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=heroic,You’re really loaded out with lots of gear. I can see you’re a utility-type Hero!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=interested,I’ve never heard of Glitch City either… But White Knights and Valkyries sounds awfully like a Pro Hero group of some sort…
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=nauseous,…Unless you had some sort of digestion Quirk? I used to know someone who gained a lot of strength whenever he’d eat sugar…
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=shy,W-what kind of Quirk do you have? Is it speed based? Or fire, or...?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=shy,I-I still can't get used to how you're undressing. N-not that I'd want to... Wait, I think I recognize your name... Shimakaze, like the ship?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=embarrassed,Careful-- even someone with a Quirk like yours has a hard time getting hit in the head, Shimakaze!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:0=shy,I'm always really flattered and amazed by how popular Pro Hero color palettes enter the mainstream wardrobe.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=nauseous,I don’t mind being recorded in my day to day work… B-b-ut I’m pretty uncomfortable with the idea that this’ll end up on the internet somewhere.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=vexed,But can you leave the rest of us out of it?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:0=happy,I’m… Actually kind of a fan. I did a report on you back in school!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:1=gravity,I really like my Quirk and it’s super useful for hero stuff and for more conventional trades, but I think everyone wishes they had a little more time.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:3=shy,It’s kind of weird, b-b-but you seem really comfortable while naked, so I g-g-guess that’s a nice way to be!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=vexed,You must have practiced this game <i>a lot</i> if you’re bored enough to try something like this. Or crazy...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:5=embarrassed,I-I’m sorry I didn’t realize it sooner, but this is kind of a fetish thing for you, isn’t it? I-- don’t really have any hangups like that, but if you're pretending that being an alien...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:0=happy,Well, you seem like you've got a legacy angle, and you like to fight in tournaments... I bet you'd have done will at UA!
-3-female_removed_accessory=happy,Well, at least <i>someone</i> seems to be doing well!
-3-female_removed_accessory=heroic,Hmm. Well... next time, I guess.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2,count-bodysuit:2=embarrassed,I mean, some of us dress in some really silly costumes, Saki. I wouldn't worry about your shoes!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:alice_degracia,targetStage:1=embarrassed,(I suppose it's really rude to ask if she's a cousin or sister of his, knowing Endeavor...)
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:1=shy,I-I hope you are just as unshy as he is. F-for your sake.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:annie=happy,On the plus side, you’re not quite as… <i>Unusual</i> as some of the support-class at UA! I bet you lead a fun life, at least!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:2=heroic,Good job knocking them out! They should be harmless up there for a little while, anyway.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:3=gravity,Y-you're really good at dealing with them, Cammy. I guess you've encountered them before... Um.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=shy,Tomura Shigaraki! He's real bad news and talks about video games as much as you do! I'm keeping an eye on you, Chiaki...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:saki=interested,H-hey, Chiaki, I think Saki wants to ask you something...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=shy,I'm n-not going to let my guard down!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Y-you can't get me to let <i>my</i> guard down!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=heroic,You’re clearly also ready for combat, but I can’t get a good feel for your Quirk…
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:2=happy,Or maybe it’s an American thing I don’t quite get. I’ll admit most of what I know about the US comes from All Might or Deku…
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:3=serious,What? Are you even paying attention, D.Va?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:1=vexed,Either way, it’s a very interesting style. If you want lots of pieces to win the game...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=calm,Hm... You're braver than you act, huh, Florina?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=embarrassed,Er-- A hero should know when to go for backup, but I guess there's no running here...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:2=embarrassed,W-wait, why shouldn't I approve? Are you helping the villains!? That seems so out of character!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:1=shy,Gah! I sure hope not!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=shy,I’m totally paying attention to your rebuttal. Yep. Sure am! Definitely not using this to focus on the fact that I think you can fly to distance myself from how much better at… Being composed you are.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=heroic,I think everyone's confused why you didn't just let go of your camera!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:1=gravity,Though how are you floating? I know there’s some complicated Quirks out there, but “Vampire” and all its powers seems very strong...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:1=embarrassed,N-not like, in a way that’s relevant to this game!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:2=shy,I wouldn’t want to-- Especially not with another woman-- I just-- Hmrmhph!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=shy,I-it’s very strange to have more than one! I only know a villain with that sort of ability set!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3=heroic,A guardian spirit? Hmm… that’s kind of like my friend Tokoyami’s Quirk: Dark Shadow!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:1=nauseous,It’ll… take too long explain so I’m just going to pretend like it didn’t happen…
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:2=heroic,Hm… I’m keeping an eye on you…
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=shy,Your costume certainly looks like it’s built for impacts or acceleration. And you’re so serious! I-I could probably stand to gain some composure from you.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1,totalMales:1-3=gravity,Whoops, gotta right myself... um... I wouldn't mind hearing more about where you're from...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:1=interested,I mean, obviously something medical related… It’s kind of hard to just be a doctor without something extra these days…
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:1=embarrassed,T-though you don't have to act the part, I hope you know...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1=embarrassed,WAIT? WE CAN LEAVE? OKAYTHAT'SGREAT I'MJUSTGOING TO-- err... I should... just stay on guard, I suppose...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:1=serious,I'll take you down, and bring you to justice, Neopolitan!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetSaidMarker:pinka_start,targetNotSaidMarker:pinka_end2,notSaidMarker:pinka1,marker:pinka1=serious,I'll just have to kick your butt, Pink Stain!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:3=happy,Oh! I guess it might help you dance? You certainly are making this quite a show, Pinkie Pie!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:3=embarrassed,I guess they could help you dance. Not that you're moving around a lot yet. Or um. That you'd need to...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:1=calm,Gensokyo? Where's that?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=happy,If you're part of something called the "Flame Tribe" I guess you don't need to keep your hands warm...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=heroic,D-don't worry! I believe in you! Stay Plus Ultra, Saki! (Phew.)
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:chiaki=embarrassed,We-well. L-looks like we're in this together, Saki and Chiaki.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Comfort should come before style, I think! I mean, I dress in a ridiculous costume like this!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=shy,T-that could work, actually. What do you think Saki?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=shy,I think that idea could work! Saki, what kind of superpower would you want?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:1=interested,Oh! So your outfit isn't a set of support items, it's actually your Quirk, right?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Huh? Not a hero? You just carry around all that stuff for work?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Well, I think you’re starting to get <i>less</i> outfitted. But it’s what you do that makes you a hero, I think.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=embarrassed,Ha! So you are a he--r--ohhh. Hrmph. T-that seems like a bad superpower!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=gravity,I'm not sure I follow, but you don't seem hurt, which is great! Your poor support items... at least mine don't usually break! T-though sometimes I lose my grip...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=heroic,I think learned about this in history! You've got that nautical quirk: Destroyer, right? What a cool hero name!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4=gravity,I'm glad you're okay, Shimakaze...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:dizzy=nauseous,When I overuse my Quirk, I feel like that too, Shimakaze. S-sorry.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:1=embarrassed,W-well, I'll tell her about this. N-not about the game, but I'm sure she'd be really flattered!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=shy,T-that could be pretty damaging to some people’s careers, I think. Y-you know?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:2=embarrassed,P-please?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:1=heroic,I haven’t been out of the academy for very long, but I thought your “Chronal Acceleration” Quirk was awesome!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:2=embarrassed,U-um. Anyway, I have a friend whose Quirk was similar to yours, in how he could phase through solid objects. Could I get an autograph for him? I-if it’s no trouble.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=vexed,Hmm… I wonder if Tohru would employ the same strategy… Though it’s not like anyone can see her when she’s n-n-naked.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:5=shy,But I have a feeling you’ve probably inspired a lot of interesting sets of tactics in a game like this…
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:6=nauseous,And this is how you… Process that, I suppose I’ll just relax and try to keep an eye on everyone else.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=shy,I wish we'd met in less embarrassing circumstances...

-2-male_removing_accessory=vexed,A-are you just trying to embarass me, ~name~?
-2-male_removing_accessory=interested,I should Zero Gravity that out of here...
-2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:american=interested,Though I never expected to learn something like this!
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=vexed,Even a name like “9S” is kind of shadowy and mysterious…
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:1=happy,H-he also worked really, really hard to get where he is as a hero. I think you two would have a lot in common, actually.
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1=embarrassed,B-but what's your Quirk, anyway?
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1=calm,Hmm... so wait, is your Hero name Star Platinum? I don't think I've heard of you.
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0=interested,Those seem like kind of a hassle though... Do they help you stay focused in combat?
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Th-though I wouldn't want you to lose! I just-- Um. Is it awkward in here or is it just me?
-2-male_removed_accessory=embarrassed,Something bigger next, please?
-2-male_removed_accessory=serious,Unf... That's... not... helping...!
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1=shy,And what’s with the blindfold? I thought for sure you’d take that off first!
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1=shy,Pfft. Aliens aren’t real. Just because some people look strange doesn’t make them extraterrestrial.
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:twilight=heroic,Aliens aren’t real. People like, say, Twilight, look unusual, but are just like you or me!
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:2=shy,Th-though I don't think I'd want to play this game with him.
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1=happy,Oh wow! That "Stand" of yours is a time-control Quirk? That's really powerful!
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:2=shy,It's kind of weird to meet in a place like this, but it's good to see that you're using your powerful Quirk to help people here. R-right?
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Er. If you could <i>not</i> pay it back tenfold and keep being nice, I know <i>I'd</i> be a lot happier.
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2=shy,I-I mean I'm sure glad your pants didn't fall down, at least!
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2=shy,E-er. W-well, at least we can pretend like nothing's happened or gone wrong, right?
-2-female_removing_accessory=interested,A-ah, ~name~, y-you should definitely go faster to get in on this.
-2-female_removing_accessory=happy,T-this is actually a lot more fun than I thought!
-2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:american=interested,Though I never expected to learn something like this!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:alice_degracia,targetStage:0=shy,You remind me of a very purple version of a friend of mine.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:0=happy,Oh, so you have a vocal quirk like Present Mic? He's such a funny teacher.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:0=interested,While anyone can certainly be a hero, I think based on how you’re dressed it’s probably not a strict regimen.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:1,marker:uravity_helps_cammy=gravity,Oh no! Don't worry, Cammy, Pro Hero Uravity is here! I'll just suspend them from the ceiling.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:2=serious,Okay, same thing! Everyone remain calm! Cammy and I have this under control!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=vexed,You aren't associated with that hand-guy, are you, Chiaki!?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=interested,I'm kind of nervous to find out what your Quirk could be...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:0=serious,Are you American? You certainly seem quite sure of yourself…
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Oh, duh, it has to be something sound related. D.Va, like diva! I get it. Kind on the nose, though…
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:2=vexed,You… Surely needed those for something interesting, right? Just for listening to music?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=vexed,Do you have a Quirk that makes you need an outfit like that? Or do you just like to dress all historical?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=shy,What kind of Quirk do you use with a belt like that, Florina? Oh! You seem so jittery! M-maybe it's for like... o-or maybe you're just embarrassed...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=vexed,--W-WAIT! We can leave!? I-I'm gonna go too!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1=interested,I think digital Quirks are really underrated. You probably get access to all kinds of unique stuff!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0=embarrassed,Well, you only have two arms and two legs, so I’m guessing you have a web-based Quirk? Or…
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=gravity,What kind of stuff does the “Fairy” Quirk let you do? Flight, right? Good! I’m going to go ahead and try avoid being embarrassed. I’d turn pinker than you!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=interested,Huh, that's such an interesting pattern! Our school uniform was just a flat red tie.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=happy,The polka dots look so pretty!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette=interested,I'm sorry, I was kind of... tricked into coming, but is it a polka dot theme today?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette=interested,Between Marinette and Mahiru, it seems we have a polka dot theme tonight...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=interested,Careful, Mahiru! People might be able to see up your skirt!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=embarrassed,E-er, Mahiru, there might be a more... ladylike way of...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:0=nauseous,She’s one of the few people I know with teeth like that…
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=serious,Wh-what? You have multiple Quirks!?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:2=interested,Huh. That’s weird. I’ve never heard of a Quirk-granting object before, but that does kind of make sense…
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:0=embarrassed,Um! S-sorry, that’s a really embarrassing reaction.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:1=interested,Do you happen to have an affinity for technology, other Mei?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=heroic,You remind me a lot of Ingenium!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0,totalMales:1-3=shy,I-I mean, I’ve seen… Um. You know what, I’ll just stop this line of inquiry.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:0=calm,You look so… healthy. And you’re a doctor? What’s <i>your</i> Quirk like?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=calm,It’s… Kinda rare to see a “demon”-type Quirk…
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:0=interested,Hmm... didn't you have a harp earlier?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:0=vexed,I know you're the quiet type. But that doesn't mean I don't know a villain when I see one.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetSaidMarker:pinka_start,targetNotSaidMarker:pinka_end2,notSaidMarker:pinka1=vexed,Wait a second, is this like a split personality thing, or have you been one of those Stain-followers the whole time?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:2=interested,Huh? They're heavy? I... can't really imagine a support item like that being helpful for parties...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:0=interested,A time stop Quirk?? That's a really strong one!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=interested,Sure, small stuff is reasonable... but do you need those for a Quirk?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=interested,Y-you look even better without your tie, Saki!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:chiaki=shy,I-I'm not really happy with this type of thing either, you two.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=heroic,Those are nice shoes, Saki! I think I have a pair just like them!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,marker:pink_underwear=embarrassed,H-hey! D-don't look up her skirt, everyone!

-2-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=happy,Oh! That's a great idea. It'll be a lot easier with the two of us, too!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:0=happy,Oh! I get it. Nice to meet you, Magical Girl! That's your hero name, right?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=heroic,You’re really loaded out with lots of gear. I can see you’re a utility-type Hero!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=interested,I’ve never heard of Glitch City either… But White Knights and Valkyries sounds awfully like a Pro Hero group of some sort…
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=nauseous,…Unless you had some sort of digestion Quirk? I used to know someone who gained a lot of strength whenever he’d eat sugar…
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=shy,W-what kind of Quirk do you have? Is it speed based? Or fire, or...?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=shy,I-I still can't get used to how you're undressing. N-not that I'd want to... Wait, I think I recognize your name... Shimakaze, like the ship?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=embarrassed,Careful-- even someone with a Quirk like yours has a hard time getting hit in the head, Shimakaze!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:0=shy,I'm always really flattered and amazed by how popular Pro Hero color palettes enter the mainstream wardrobe.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=nauseous,I don’t mind being recorded in my day to day work… B-b-ut I’m pretty uncomfortable with the idea that this’ll end up on the internet somewhere.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=vexed,But can you leave the rest of us out of it?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:0=happy,I’m… Actually kind of a fan. I did a report on you back in school!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:1=gravity,I really like my Quirk and it’s super useful for hero stuff and for more conventional trades, but I think everyone wishes they had a little more time.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:3=shy,It’s kind of weird, b-b-but you seem really comfortable while naked, so I g-g-guess that’s a nice way to be!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=vexed,You must have practiced this game <i>a lot</i> if you’re bored enough to try something like this. Or crazy...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:5=embarrassed,I-I’m sorry I didn’t realize it sooner, but this is kind of a fetish thing for you, isn’t it? I-- don’t really have any hangups like that, but if you're pretending that being an alien...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:0=happy,Well, you seem like you've got a legacy angle, and you like to fight in tournaments... I bet you'd have done will at UA!
-2-female_removed_accessory=heroic,Not that I want you specifically, ~name~, but this is even more fun than it looks!
-2-female_removed_accessory=happy,Trust me, I'm a hero, after all!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2,count-bodysuit:2=embarrassed,I mean, some of us dress in some really silly costumes, Saki. I wouldn't worry about your shoes!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:alice_degracia,targetStage:1=embarrassed,(I suppose it's really rude to ask if she's a cousin or sister of his, knowing Endeavor...)
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:1=shy,I-I hope you are just as unshy as he is. F-for your sake.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:annie=happy,On the plus side, you’re not quite as… <i>Unusual</i> as some of the support-class at UA! I bet you lead a fun life, at least!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:2=heroic,Good job knocking them out! They should be harmless up there for a little while, anyway.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:3=gravity,Y-you're really good at dealing with them, Cammy. I guess you've encountered them before... Um.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=shy,Tomura Shigaraki! He's real bad news and talks about video games as much as you do! I'm keeping an eye on you, Chiaki...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:saki=interested,H-hey, Chiaki, I think Saki wants to ask you something...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=shy,I'm n-not going to let my guard down!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Y-you can't get me to let <i>my</i> guard down!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=heroic,You’re clearly also ready for combat, but I can’t get a good feel for your Quirk…
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:2=happy,Or maybe it’s an American thing I don’t quite get. I’ll admit most of what I know about the US comes from All Might or Deku…
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:3=serious,What? Are you even paying attention, D.Va?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:1=vexed,Either way, it’s a very interesting style. If you want lots of pieces to win the game...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=calm,Hm... You're braver than you act, huh, Florina?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=embarrassed,Er-- A hero should know when to go for backup, but I guess there's no running here...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:2=embarrassed,W-wait, why shouldn't I approve? Are you helping the villains!? That seems so out of character!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:1=shy,Gah! I sure hope not!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=shy,I’m totally paying attention to your rebuttal. Yep. Sure am! Definitely not using this to focus on the fact that I think you can fly to distance myself from how much better at… Being composed you are.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=heroic,I think everyone's confused why you didn't just let go of your camera!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:1=gravity,Though how are you floating? I know there’s some complicated Quirks out there, but “Vampire” and all its powers seems very strong...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:1=embarrassed,N-not like, in a way that’s relevant to this game!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:2=shy,I wouldn’t want to-- Especially not with another woman-- I just-- Hmrmhph!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=shy,I-it’s very strange to have more than one! I only know a villain with that sort of ability set!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3=heroic,A guardian spirit? Hmm… that’s kind of like my friend Tokoyami’s Quirk: Dark Shadow!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:1=nauseous,It’ll… take too long explain so I’m just going to pretend like it didn’t happen…
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:2=heroic,Hm… I’m keeping an eye on you…
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=shy,Your costume certainly looks like it’s built for impacts or acceleration. And you’re so serious! I-I could probably stand to gain some composure from you.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1,totalMales:1-3=gravity,Whoops, gotta right myself... um... I wouldn't mind hearing more about where you're from...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:1=interested,I mean, obviously something medical related… It’s kind of hard to just be a doctor without something extra these days…
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:1=embarrassed,T-though you don't have to act the part, I hope you know...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1=embarrassed,WAIT? WE CAN LEAVE? OKAYTHAT'SGREAT I'MJUSTGOING TO-- err... I should... just stay on guard, I suppose...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:1=serious,I'll take you down, and bring you to justice, Neopolitan!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetSaidMarker:pinka_start,targetNotSaidMarker:pinka_end2,notSaidMarker:pinka1,marker:pinka1=serious,I'll just have to kick your butt, Pink Stain!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:3=happy,Oh! I guess it might help you dance? You certainly are making this quite a show, Pinkie Pie!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:3=embarrassed,I guess they could help you dance. Not that you're moving around a lot yet. Or um. That you'd need to...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:1=calm,Gensokyo? Where's that?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=happy,If you're part of something called the "Flame Tribe" I guess you don't need to keep your hands warm...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=heroic,D-don't worry! I believe in you! Stay Plus Ultra, Saki! (Phew.)
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:chiaki=embarrassed,We-well. L-looks like we're in this together, Saki and Chiaki.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Comfort should come before style, I think! I mean, I dress in a ridiculous costume like this!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=shy,T-that could work, actually. What do you think Saki?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=shy,I think that idea could work! Saki, what kind of superpower would you want?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:1=interested,Oh! So your outfit isn't a set of support items, it's actually your Quirk, right?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Huh? Not a hero? You just carry around all that stuff for work?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Well, I think you’re starting to get <i>less</i> outfitted. But it’s what you do that makes you a hero, I think.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=embarrassed,Ha! So you are a he--r--ohhh. Hrmph. T-that seems like a bad superpower!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=gravity,I'm not sure I follow, but you don't seem hurt, which is great! Your poor support items... at least mine don't usually break! T-though sometimes I lose my grip...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=heroic,I think learned about this in history! You've got that nautical quirk: Destroyer, right? What a cool hero name!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4=gravity,I'm glad you're okay, Shimakaze...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:dizzy=nauseous,When I overuse my Quirk, I feel like that too, Shimakaze. S-sorry.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:1=embarrassed,W-well, I'll tell her about this. N-not about the game, but I'm sure she'd be really flattered!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=shy,T-that could be pretty damaging to some people’s careers, I think. Y-you know?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:2=embarrassed,P-please?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:1=heroic,I haven’t been out of the academy for very long, but I thought your “Chronal Acceleration” Quirk was awesome!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:2=embarrassed,U-um. Anyway, I have a friend whose Quirk was similar to yours, in how he could phase through solid objects. Could I get an autograph for him? I-if it’s no trouble.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=vexed,Hmm… I wonder if Tohru would employ the same strategy… Though it’s not like anyone can see her when she’s n-n-naked.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:5=shy,But I have a feeling you’ve probably inspired a lot of interesting sets of tactics in a game like this…
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:6=nauseous,And this is how you… Process that, I suppose I’ll just relax and try to keep an eye on everyone else.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=shy,I wish we'd met in less embarrassing circumstances...


#finished
-1-male_removing_accessory=calm,This is kind of relaxing, now.
-1-male_removing_accessory=nauseous,Oh no, h-hold on--
-1-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:american=interested,Though I never expected to learn something like this!
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=vexed,Even a name like “9S” is kind of shadowy and mysterious…
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:1=happy,H-he also worked really, really hard to get where he is as a hero. I think you two would have a lot in common, actually.
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1=embarrassed,B-but what's your Quirk, anyway?
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1=calm,Hmm... so wait, is your Hero name Star Platinum? I don't think I've heard of you.
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0=interested,Those seem like kind of a hassle though... Do they help you stay focused in combat?
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Th-though I wouldn't want you to lose! I just-- Um. Is it awkward in here or is it just me?
-1-male_removed_accessory=embarrassed,Even though your ~clothing~ wasn't big, ~name~, it's just kind of nice to sit and watch. And, um. Hopefully not throw up.
-1-male_removed_accessory=embarrassed,--I'm okay, I'm okay. Your ~clothing~ wasn't bad, but I'm a little nauseous for using my Quirk like that...
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1=shy,And what’s with the blindfold? I thought for sure you’d take that off first!
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1=shy,Pfft. Aliens aren’t real. Just because some people look strange doesn’t make them extraterrestrial.
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:twilight=heroic,Aliens aren’t real. People like, say, Twilight, look unusual, but are just like you or me!
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:2=shy,Th-though I don't think I'd want to play this game with him.
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1=happy,Oh wow! That "Stand" of yours is a time-control Quirk? That's really powerful!
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:2=shy,It's kind of weird to meet in a place like this, but it's good to see that you're using your powerful Quirk to help people here. R-right?
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Er. If you could <i>not</i> pay it back tenfold and keep being nice, I know <i>I'd</i> be a lot happier.
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2=shy,I-I mean I'm sure glad your pants didn't fall down, at least!
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2=shy,E-er. W-well, at least we can pretend like nothing's happened or gone wrong, right?
-1-female_removing_accessory=interested,Am I allowed to hold ~name~'s ~clothing~ now that I've lost?
-1-female_removing_accessory=serious,Oh, I hadn't noticed your ~clothing~, ~name~! Could I see it?
-1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:american=interested,Though I never expected to learn something like this!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:alice_degracia,targetStage:0=shy,You remind me of a very purple version of a friend of mine.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:0=happy,Oh, so you have a vocal quirk like Present Mic? He's such a funny teacher.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:0=interested,While anyone can certainly be a hero, I think based on how you’re dressed it’s probably not a strict regimen.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:1,marker:uravity_helps_cammy=gravity,Oh no! Don't worry, Cammy, Pro Hero Uravity is here! I'll just suspend them from the ceiling.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:2=serious,Okay, same thing! Everyone remain calm! Cammy and I have this under control!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=vexed,You aren't associated with that hand-guy, are you, Chiaki!?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=interested,I'm kind of nervous to find out what your Quirk could be...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:0=serious,Are you American? You certainly seem quite sure of yourself…
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Oh, duh, it has to be something sound related. D.Va, like diva! I get it. Kind on the nose, though…
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:2=vexed,You… Surely needed those for something interesting, right? Just for listening to music?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=vexed,Do you have a Quirk that makes you need an outfit like that? Or do you just like to dress all historical?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=shy,What kind of Quirk do you use with a belt like that, Florina? Oh! You seem so jittery! M-maybe it's for like... o-or maybe you're just embarrassed...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=vexed,--W-WAIT! We can leave!? I-I'm gonna go too!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1=interested,I think digital Quirks are really underrated. You probably get access to all kinds of unique stuff!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0=embarrassed,Well, you only have two arms and two legs, so I’m guessing you have a web-based Quirk? Or…
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=gravity,What kind of stuff does the “Fairy” Quirk let you do? Flight, right? Good! I’m going to go ahead and try avoid being embarrassed. I’d turn pinker than you!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=interested,Huh, that's such an interesting pattern! Our school uniform was just a flat red tie.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=happy,The polka dots look so pretty!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette=interested,I'm sorry, I was kind of... tricked into coming, but is it a polka dot theme today?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette=interested,Between Marinette and Mahiru, it seems we have a polka dot theme tonight...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=interested,Careful, Mahiru! People might be able to see up your skirt!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=embarrassed,E-er, Mahiru, there might be a more... ladylike way of...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:0=nauseous,She’s one of the few people I know with teeth like that…
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=serious,Wh-what? You have multiple Quirks!?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:2=interested,Huh. That’s weird. I’ve never heard of a Quirk-granting object before, but that does kind of make sense…
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:0=embarrassed,Um! S-sorry, that’s a really embarrassing reaction.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:1=interested,Do you happen to have an affinity for technology, other Mei?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=heroic,You remind me a lot of Ingenium!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0,totalMales:1-3=shy,I-I mean, I’ve seen… Um. You know what, I’ll just stop this line of inquiry.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:0=calm,You look so… healthy. And you’re a doctor? What’s <i>your</i> Quirk like?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=calm,It’s… Kinda rare to see a “demon”-type Quirk…
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:0=interested,Hmm... didn't you have a harp earlier?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:0=vexed,I know you're the quiet type. But that doesn't mean I don't know a villain when I see one.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetSaidMarker:pinka_start,targetNotSaidMarker:pinka_end2,notSaidMarker:pinka1=vexed,Wait a second, is this like a split personality thing, or have you been one of those Stain-followers the whole time?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:2=interested,Huh? They're heavy? I... can't really imagine a support item like that being helpful for parties...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:0=interested,A time stop Quirk?? That's a really strong one!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=interested,Sure, small stuff is reasonable... but do you need those for a Quirk?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=interested,Y-you look even better without your tie, Saki!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:chiaki=shy,I-I'm not really happy with this type of thing either, you two.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=heroic,Those are nice shoes, Saki! I think I have a pair just like them!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,marker:pink_underwear=embarrassed,H-hey! D-don't look up her skirt, everyone!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity,priority:990=shy,A-ah! No, Futaba, we shouldn't embarrass her, we should focus on stuff we can do to cheer her up!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=happy,Oh! That's a great idea. It'll be a lot easier with the two of us, too!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:0=happy,Oh! I get it. Nice to meet you, Magical Girl! That's your hero name, right?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=heroic,You’re really loaded out with lots of gear. I can see you’re a utility-type Hero!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=interested,I’ve never heard of Glitch City either… But White Knights and Valkyries sounds awfully like a Pro Hero group of some sort…
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=nauseous,…Unless you had some sort of digestion Quirk? I used to know someone who gained a lot of strength whenever he’d eat sugar…
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=shy,W-what kind of Quirk do you have? Is it speed based? Or fire, or...?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=shy,I-I still can't get used to how you're undressing. N-not that I'd want to... Wait, I think I recognize your name... Shimakaze, like the ship?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=embarrassed,Careful-- even someone with a Quirk like yours has a hard time getting hit in the head, Shimakaze!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:0=shy,I'm always really flattered and amazed by how popular Pro Hero color palettes enter the mainstream wardrobe.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=nauseous,I don’t mind being recorded in my day to day work… B-b-ut I’m pretty uncomfortable with the idea that this’ll end up on the internet somewhere.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=vexed,But can you leave the rest of us out of it?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:0=happy,I’m… Actually kind of a fan. I did a report on you back in school!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:1=gravity,I really like my Quirk and it’s super useful for hero stuff and for more conventional trades, but I think everyone wishes they had a little more time.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:3=shy,It’s kind of weird, b-b-but you seem really comfortable while naked, so I g-g-guess that’s a nice way to be!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=vexed,You must have practiced this game <i>a lot</i> if you’re bored enough to try something like this. Or crazy...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:5=embarrassed,I-I’m sorry I didn’t realize it sooner, but this is kind of a fetish thing for you, isn’t it? I-- don’t really have any hangups like that, but if you're pretending that being an alien...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:0=happy,Well, you seem like you've got a legacy angle, and you like to fight in tournaments... I bet you'd have done will at UA!
-1-female_removed_accessory=vexed,I just wanted to check it out, not cover up...
-1-female_removed_accessory=calm,Well, it's pretty neat!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2,count-bodysuit:2=embarrassed,I mean, some of us dress in some really silly costumes, Saki. I wouldn't worry about your shoes!

-1-female_removed_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:1=embarrassed,N-not like, in a way that’s relevant to this game!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:2=shy,I wouldn’t want to-- Especially not with another woman-- I just-- Hmrmhph!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=shy,I-it’s very strange to have more than one! I only know a villain with that sort of ability set!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3=heroic,A guardian spirit? Hmm… that’s kind of like my friend Tokoyami’s Quirk: Dark Shadow!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:1=nauseous,It’ll… take too long explain so I’m just going to pretend like it didn’t happen…
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:2=heroic,Hm… I’m keeping an eye on you…
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=shy,Your costume certainly looks like it’s built for impacts or acceleration. And you’re so serious! I-I could probably stand to gain some composure from you.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1,totalMales:1-3=gravity,Whoops, gotta right myself... um... I wouldn't mind hearing more about where you're from...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:1=interested,I mean, obviously something medical related… It’s kind of hard to just be a doctor without something extra these days…
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:1=embarrassed,T-though you don't have to act the part, I hope you know...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1=embarrassed,WAIT? WE CAN LEAVE? OKAYTHAT'SGREAT I'MJUSTGOING TO-- err... I should... just stay on guard, I suppose...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:1=serious,I'll take you down, and bring you to justice, Neopolitan!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetSaidMarker:pinka_start,targetNotSaidMarker:pinka_end2,notSaidMarker:pinka1,marker:pinka1=serious,I'll just have to kick your butt, Pink Stain!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:3=happy,Oh! I guess it might help you dance? You certainly are making this quite a show, Pinkie Pie!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:3=embarrassed,I guess they could help you dance. Not that you're moving around a lot yet. Or um. That you'd need to...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:1=calm,Gensokyo? Where's that?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=happy,If you're part of something called the "Flame Tribe" I guess you don't need to keep your hands warm...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=heroic,D-don't worry! I believe in you! Stay Plus Ultra, Saki! (Phew.)
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:chiaki=embarrassed,We-well. L-looks like we're in this together, Saki and Chiaki.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Comfort should come before style, I think! I mean, I dress in a ridiculous costume like this!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=shy,T-that could work, actually. What do you think Saki?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=shy,I think that idea could work! Saki, what kind of superpower would you want?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:1=interested,Oh! So your outfit isn't a set of support items, it's actually your Quirk, right?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Huh? Not a hero? You just carry around all that stuff for work?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Well, I think you’re starting to get <i>less</i> outfitted. But it’s what you do that makes you a hero, I think.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=embarrassed,Ha! So you are a he--r--ohhh. Hrmph. T-that seems like a bad superpower!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=gravity,I'm not sure I follow, but you don't seem hurt, which is great! Your poor support items... at least mine don't usually break! T-though sometimes I lose my grip...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=heroic,I think learned about this in history! You've got that nautical quirk: Destroyer, right? What a cool hero name!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4=gravity,I'm glad you're okay, Shimakaze...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:dizzy=nauseous,When I overuse my Quirk, I feel like that too, Shimakaze. S-sorry.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:1=embarrassed,W-well, I'll tell her about this. N-not about the game, but I'm sure she'd be really flattered!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=shy,T-that could be pretty damaging to some people’s careers, I think. Y-you know?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:2=embarrassed,P-please?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:1=heroic,I haven’t been out of the academy for very long, but I thought your “Chronal Acceleration” Quirk was awesome!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:2=embarrassed,U-um. Anyway, I have a friend whose Quirk was similar to yours, in how he could phase through solid objects. Could I get an autograph for him? I-if it’s no trouble.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=vexed,Hmm… I wonder if Tohru would employ the same strategy… Though it’s not like anyone can see her when she’s n-n-naked.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:5=shy,But I have a feeling you’ve probably inspired a lot of interesting sets of tactics in a game like this…
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:6=nauseous,And this is how you… Process that, I suppose I’ll just relax and try to keep an eye on everyone else.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=shy,I wish we'd met in less embarrassing circumstances...

male_removing_minor=embarrassed,Oh no, I'm sorry, ~name~! Your ~clothing~? Already?
male_removing_minor=nauseous,Argh, I know it doesn't look like much, but I'm trying to keep even with you, ~name~!
male_removing_minor=interested,Your ~clothing~? A-already?
male_removed_minor=happy,I'm happy that you're still staying strong, even if you're losing.
male_removed_minor=heroic,You... Look nice, at least!
male_removed_minor=gravity,Well, I think you're not going to give up, and it's best to just keep trying, ~name~!
male_removed_minor=vexed,I'm sorry, ~name~. I don't want you to feel super embarrassed or anything...
female_removing_minor=embarrassed,Oh, shoot, ~name~! Your ~clothing~?!
female_removing_minor=vexed,Yikes, I'm sorry ~name~, but I kind of don't want to lose either, if I'm being honest...
female_removing_minor=embarrassed,Your ~clothing~? Now? A-are you sure?
female_removed_minor=happy,Hopefully you have a couple more small things?
female_removed_minor,marker:promise=heroic,Stay brave, ~name~. It's going to be okay! I promise!
female_removed_minor=gravity,Sometimes it's nice to fight villains with Quirks that do explosions or break stuff down, rather than subtle stuff like this game...
female_removed_minor=nauseous,You must not think I'm a very good hero, letting you lose like this...

0-male_removing_minor=calm,Dang, ~name~, you're going for something cool, it looks like.
0-male_removing_minor=calm,O-oh! I wasn't expecting you to pull of something so big, so soon.
0-male_removing_minor,target:9s,targetStage:1=interested,Or are you just kind of smart and like to make support gadgets?
0-male_removing_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:0=interested,Do you know All Might, Captain America?
0-male_removing_minor,target:pit,targetStage:2=vexed,Y-you have kind of a strange relationship with your armorer, don't you, Pit? A-at least it's just your feet...
0-male_removed_minor=happy,Well, that's actually probably a bit warm...
0-male_removed_minor=embarrassed,Um. Sorry, ~name~! I don't really want to throw my hand, but if you start getting really vulnerable I'll...
0-male_removed_minor,target:9s,targetStage:2=embarrassed,T-that’s… C-c-certainly... to take your boots off and socks instead of spacing those out...
0-male_removed_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:1=heroic,You remind me a lot about him, but he’s… Sometimes bigger in person. Also louder, but that only helps to inspire confidence in him!
0-male_removed_minor,target:pit,targetStage:3=embarrassed,Oh no. Some people are into that. I'M NOT AND IT'S COOL IF YOU ARE BUT--
0-female_removing_minor=interested,Oh no, ~name~, you have to take off something so big?
0-female_removing_minor=shy,Your ~clothing~? Did you really need to take off something so big so soon?
0-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=happy,Whoa, you have so much control! I have to brute force things a little bit, so it’s really impressive you have such good aim!
0-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=nauseous,What ever happened to you after that… Shoot, I thought I was pretty good at history…
0-female_removing_minor,target:alpha,targetStage:1=interested,I-it's kind of rude to use your Quirk to send a projection when the rest of us are here in the flesh...
0-female_removing_minor,target:chell,targetStage:0=shy,Those types of Quirks are really something, huh?
0-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=interested,Um... You really aren't a villain, are you?
0-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3=embarrassed,I still think you frame things to be too much like Shigaraki...
0-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0=embarrassed,A-are you not, Futaba? I mean...
0-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:3=serious,Careful, Futaba! Don't lose your stuff! Or your lunch!
0-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:3=heroic,Happy to help someone in need!
0-female_removing_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:2=interested,E-er, I didn’t know there was a rule that we could take off our costumes in two pieces…
0-female_removing_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:0=embarrassed,You’re that Quirk school in England, right? Er... the one that had all the issues with villains?
0-female_removing_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:1=vexed,Are you teleporting your clothes? I hope you aren’t disintegrating them!
0-female_removing_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:aimee,alsoPlayingStage:1-7=nauseous,I really hope you aren't disintegrating them... Aimee already seems hellbent on destroying her apparel.
0-female_removing_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:2=shy,(I-I'm pretty sure she's not wearing underwear! I think I saw her whole butt! I could never--!)
0-female_removing_minor,target:marceline,targetStage:2=embarrassed,You’ve mentioned that you like the color red a few times…
0-female_removing_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:3=serious,Yeah… Hmm… I wonder what Deku-kun would think about this…
0-female_removing_minor,target:mei,targetStage:2=interested,You’re like Todoroki, but with one half of his powers!
0-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1=serious,So what is your Quirk? I completely forgot to ask about that eye… patch… thingy you were wearing.
0-female_removing_minor,target:nayru,targetStage:3=interested,Quirks like that are really rare! But I guess it explains why you don't have a lot of gear...
0-female_removing_minor,target:nayru,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=calm,Well, this has been kind of fun getting to know you, Nayru!
0-female_removing_minor,target:remilia,targetStage:1=interested,Hm... I wonder if Momo would play this game in reverse, by making clothes for herself. She's an aristocrat too.
0-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity=interested,W-well, I was thinking maybe that would be something fun for the three of us to do together. I’d invite the others but three’s a party, as Jirou would say. Mineta would say something far dirtier, I think.
0-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=heroic,Wait, really? Saki’d probably be fine with a nice trip to a bathhouse or hot springs, right? I think Saki might actually live in my city, based on her uniform!
0-female_removing_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:1=calm,Oh, I see! So you have an item-type Quirk! Those are pretty rare, but I guess if it lets you do all sorts of nifty stuff, then that's amazing!
0-female_removing_minor,target:shego,targetStage:0=heroic,W-well, I hope you’re less dangerous without your gloves, Shego. I know Bakugo has a hard time focusing his blasts without his...
0-female_removing_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=vexed,Is it like... a forcefield of some sort? I know a few people with Quirks like that! But um. You seem to be showing off how you can use it to protect your clothes...
0-female_removing_minor,target:sonya,targetStage:5=embarrassed,Um. I can respect someone trying to turn around when they're embarrassed... I don't know why I didn't think of that...
0-female_removing_minor,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=interested,I-I can see why... someone would invite you here...
0-female_removed_minor=interested,Yikes, ~name~, I do not envy you right now...
0-female_removed_minor=vexed,I wish I had something more uplifting to say, ~name~. But at least we're in this together!
0-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=nauseous,Now if only you could use it for good…
0-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=embarrassed,The Battle of Florem Gardens? I thought you were arrested. Are you out on good behavior?
0-female_removed_minor,target:alpha,targetStage:2=vexed,Now I feel <i>really</i> foolish. My mood's just been crushed.
0-female_removed_minor,target:chell,targetStage:1=embarrassed,E-er. I'm not a mind-reader or anything. Say, you're awfully quiet, huh?
0-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3=gravity,W-well, I definintely won't step on it. L-look! I'll even try to float away from it!
0-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:saki,marker:chiaki_apology=happy,Okay. If you want to be Saki's friend, you're probably not a bad person. Helping the vulnerable is always kind. I'm sorry, Chiaki.
0-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:4=shy,A-anyway, t-this type of game isn't really something I'm good at either.
0-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1=vexed,I had a feeling you reminded me of someone. But... I was hoping it wasn't Mineta.
0-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4=shy,Well, at least <i>someone</i> had a good time. I'm happy it was Futaba, at least!
0-female_removed_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:3=nauseous,Oh no! I d-di-din’t realize I could take it off in pieces…
0-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:1=heroic,We do get a few trainees from abroad, but it’s great to see that Europe also takes hero training seriously!
0-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:2=calm,You seem really… Plain for something that seems so powerful. Or did you just show up in your street clothes or normal school uniform?
0-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=shy,Wait, I don't understand, is that related to a Quirk, or are you just scarred? Oh... sh-shoot. I'm sorry, Kyoko.
0-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=shy,Um. If it makes you feel any better, you seem really smart! And one of the best heroes I know has a scar like yours!
0-female_removed_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:3=shy,Mahiru, are you <i>sure</i> you can't part with your camera next...?
0-female_removed_minor,target:marceline,targetStage:3=nauseous,I’m super against blood-related stuff. It seems real gross!
0-female_removed_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:4=embarrassed,O-oh yeah, you’re right, Marinette. Sorry!
0-female_removed_minor,target:mei,targetStage:3=embarrassed,Oh, and you use some sort of nozzle to channel it, right? Or is it just chemistry?
0-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2=gravity,Y-you know. Your Quirk? That something special everyone's born with? Like my Zero Gravity? Kinda like this?
0-female_removed_minor,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=shy,Umm... are you going to leave now, Nayru? I mean... I guess if you could... I would too...
0-female_removed_minor,target:remilia=vexed,She's much less... demanding than you.
0-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity=nauseous,I’d really rather focus on the makeup stuff… Saki, what do you think?
0-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=happy,I like the way you think, Marinette. Saki, what’d you think?
0-female_removed_minor,target:sayaka=heroic,I bet you're a really important hero to your city, Magical Girl!
0-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:damage_reduction,marker:enf_0b=embarrassed,T-that sounds really, really cool, to be honest. I could use something like that for my withering pride, though.
0-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:dna_lock,marker:enf_0b=shy,W-why would I ever want to try on someone else's gear!? T-that's ludicrous!
0-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:pauldrons,marker:enf_0b=shy,I-I mean that's the basics of good suit design, right?
0-female_removed_minor,target:shego,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Er... It seems decidedly not.
0-female_removed_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=calm,W-which is really cool and everything! Seriously! But... I just don't quite get it...
0-female_removed_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3,marker:shimakaze_flooding=embarrassed,F-flooding in the-- I-I know some people like to take their hero persona seriously but... um, is that a euphemism?
0-female_removed_minor,target:sonya,targetStage:6=happy,Pffffft. Oh my gosh! Sonya! You're amazing at relieving tension! Using camouflage paint without a stealth Quirk. You are <i>too</i> funny!
0-female_removed_minor,target:sonya,targetStage:6=heroic,Sonya! This is too funny! You're helping me feel a lot better! Way to keep your cool!
0-female_removed_minor,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1=shy,I-I'm not into girls. It's just her Quirk!

4-male_removing_minor,target:pit,targetStage:2=vexed,Y-you have kind of a strange relationship with your armorer, don't you, Pit? A-at least it's just your feet...
4-male_removed_minor=embarrassed,O-Oh.
4-male_removed_minor=gravity,I'm not staring!
4-male_removed_minor=happy,Well, at least I get to keep my clothes on for another round.
4-male_removed_minor,target:9s,targetStage:2=embarrassed,T-that’s… C-c-certainly... to take your boots off and socks instead of spacing those out...
4-male_removed_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:1=heroic,You remind me a lot about him, but he’s… Sometimes bigger in person. Also louder, but that only helps to inspire confidence in him!
4-male_removed_minor,target:pit,targetStage:3=embarrassed,Oh no. Some people are into that. I'M NOT AND IT'S COOL IF YOU ARE BUT--
4-female_removing_minor=happy,I think I've done a pretty good defense so far, ~name~.
4-female_removing_minor=heroic,Oh, ~name~! You're picking your ~clothing~? I think I've done a pretty good job of keeping you safe so far, then!
4-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=happy,Whoa, you have so much control! I have to brute force things a little bit, so it’s really impressive you have such good aim!
4-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=nauseous,What ever happened to you after that… Shoot, I thought I was pretty good at history…
4-female_removing_minor,target:alpha,targetStage:1=interested,I-it's kind of rude to use your Quirk to send a projection when the rest of us are here in the flesh...
4-female_removing_minor,target:chell,targetStage:0=shy,Those types of Quirks are really something, huh?
4-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=interested,Um... You really aren't a villain, are you?
4-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3=embarrassed,I still think you frame things to be too much like Shigaraki...
4-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0=embarrassed,A-are you not, Futaba? I mean...
4-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:3=serious,Careful, Futaba! Don't lose your stuff! Or your lunch!
4-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:3=heroic,Happy to help someone in need!
4-female_removing_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:2=interested,E-er, I didn’t know there was a rule that we could take off our costumes in two pieces…
4-female_removing_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:0=embarrassed,You’re that Quirk school in England, right? Er... the one that had all the issues with villains?
4-female_removing_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:1=vexed,Are you teleporting your clothes? I hope you aren’t disintegrating them!
4-female_removing_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:aimee,alsoPlayingStage:1-7=nauseous,I really hope you aren't disintegrating them... Aimee already seems hellbent on destroying her apparel.
4-female_removing_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:2=shy,(I-I'm pretty sure she's not wearing underwear! I think I saw her whole butt! I could never--!)
4-female_removing_minor,target:marceline,targetStage:2=embarrassed,You’ve mentioned that you like the color red a few times…
4-female_removing_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:3=serious,Yeah… Hmm… I wonder what Deku-kun would think about this…
4-female_removing_minor,target:mei,targetStage:2=interested,You’re like Todoroki, but with one half of his powers!
4-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1=serious,So what is your Quirk? I completely forgot to ask about that eye… patch… thingy you were wearing.
4-female_removing_minor,target:nayru,targetStage:3=interested,Quirks like that are really rare! But I guess it explains why you don't have a lot of gear...
4-female_removing_minor,target:nayru,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=calm,Well, this has been kind of fun getting to know you, Nayru!
4-female_removing_minor,target:remilia,targetStage:1=interested,Hm... I wonder if Momo would play this game in reverse, by making clothes for herself. She's an aristocrat too.
4-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity=interested,W-well, I was thinking maybe that would be something fun for the three of us to do together. I’d invite the others but three’s a party, as Jirou would say. Mineta would say something far dirtier, I think.
4-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=heroic,Wait, really? Saki’d probably be fine with a nice trip to a bathhouse or hot springs, right? I think Saki might actually live in my city, based on her uniform!
4-female_removing_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:1=calm,Oh, I see! So you have an item-type Quirk! Those are pretty rare, but I guess if it lets you do all sorts of nifty stuff, then that's amazing!
4-female_removing_minor,target:shego,targetStage:0=heroic,W-well, I hope you’re less dangerous without your gloves, Shego. I know Bakugo has a hard time focusing his blasts without his...
4-female_removing_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=vexed,Is it like... a forcefield of some sort? I know a few people with Quirks like that! But um. You seem to be showing off how you can use it to protect your clothes...
4-female_removing_minor,target:sonya,targetStage:5=embarrassed,Um. I can respect someone trying to turn around when they're embarrassed... I don't know why I didn't think of that...
4-female_removing_minor,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=interested,I-I can see why... someone would invite you here...
4-female_removed_minor=serious,Besides, you look just fine without your ~clothing~!
4-female_removed_minor=interested,Thanks for the save, ~name~.
4-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=nauseous,Now if only you could use it for good…
4-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=embarrassed,The Battle of Florem Gardens? I thought you were arrested. Are you out on good behavior?
4-female_removed_minor,target:alpha,targetStage:2=vexed,Now I feel <i>really</i> foolish. My mood's just been crushed.
4-female_removed_minor,target:chell,targetStage:1=embarrassed,E-er. I'm not a mind-reader or anything. Say, you're awfully quiet, huh?
4-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3=gravity,W-well, I definintely won't step on it. L-look! I'll even try to float away from it!
4-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:saki,marker:chiaki_apology=happy,Okay. If you want to be Saki's friend, you're probably not a bad person. Helping the vulnerable is always kind. I'm sorry, Chiaki.
4-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:4=shy,A-anyway, t-this type of game isn't really something I'm good at either.
4-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1=vexed,I had a feeling you reminded me of someone. But... I was hoping it wasn't Mineta.
4-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4=shy,Well, at least <i>someone</i> had a good time. I'm happy it was Futaba, at least!
4-female_removed_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:3=nauseous,Oh no! I d-di-din’t realize I could take it off in pieces…
4-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:1=heroic,We do get a few trainees from abroad, but it’s great to see that Europe also takes hero training seriously!
4-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:2=calm,You seem really… Plain for something that seems so powerful. Or did you just show up in your street clothes or normal school uniform?
4-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=shy,Wait, I don't understand, is that related to a Quirk, or are you just scarred? Oh... sh-shoot. I'm sorry, Kyoko.
4-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=shy,Um. If it makes you feel any better, you seem really smart! And one of the best heroes I know has a scar like yours!
4-female_removed_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:3=shy,Mahiru, are you <i>sure</i> you can't part with your camera next...?
4-female_removed_minor,target:marceline,targetStage:3=nauseous,I’m super against blood-related stuff. It seems real gross!
4-female_removed_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:4=embarrassed,O-oh yeah, you’re right, Marinette. Sorry!
4-female_removed_minor,target:mei,targetStage:3=embarrassed,Oh, and you use some sort of nozzle to channel it, right? Or is it just chemistry?
4-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2=gravity,Y-you know. Your Quirk? That something special everyone's born with? Like my Zero Gravity? Kinda like this?
4-female_removed_minor,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=shy,Umm... are you going to leave now, Nayru? I mean... I guess if you could... I would too...
4-female_removed_minor,target:remilia=vexed,She's much less... demanding than you.
4-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity=nauseous,I’d really rather focus on the makeup stuff… Saki, what do you think?
4-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=happy,I like the way you think, Marinette. Saki, what’d you think?
4-female_removed_minor,target:sayaka=heroic,I bet you're a really important hero to your city, Magical Girl!
4-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:damage_reduction,marker:enf_0b=embarrassed,T-that sounds really, really cool, to be honest. I could use something like that for my withering pride, though.
4-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:dna_lock,marker:enf_0b=shy,W-why would I ever want to try on someone else's gear!? T-that's ludicrous!
4-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:pauldrons,marker:enf_0b=shy,I-I mean that's the basics of good suit design, right?
4-female_removed_minor,target:shego,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Er... It seems decidedly not.
4-female_removed_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=calm,W-which is really cool and everything! Seriously! But... I just don't quite get it...
4-female_removed_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3,marker:shimakaze_flooding=embarrassed,F-flooding in the-- I-I know some people like to take their hero persona seriously but... um, is that a euphemism?
4-female_removed_minor,target:sonya,targetStage:6=happy,Pffffft. Oh my gosh! Sonya! You're amazing at relieving tension! Using camouflage paint without a stealth Quirk. You are <i>too</i> funny!
4-female_removed_minor,target:sonya,targetStage:6=heroic,Sonya! This is too funny! You're helping me feel a lot better! Way to keep your cool!
4-female_removed_minor,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1=shy,I-I'm not into girls. It's just her Quirk!

6-female_removing_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:2=shy,(I-I'm pretty sure she's not wearing underwear! I think I saw her whole butt! I could never--!)
6-female_removing_minor,target:marceline,targetStage:2=embarrassed,You’ve mentioned that you like the color red a few times…
6-female_removing_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:3=serious,Yeah… Hmm… I wonder what Deku-kun would think about this…
6-female_removing_minor,target:mei,targetStage:2=interested,You’re like Todoroki, but with one half of his powers!
6-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1=serious,So what is your Quirk? I completely forgot to ask about that eye… patch… thingy you were wearing.
6-female_removing_minor,target:nayru,targetStage:3=interested,Quirks like that are really rare! But I guess it explains why you don't have a lot of gear...
6-female_removing_minor,target:nayru,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=calm,Well, this has been kind of fun getting to know you, Nayru!
6-female_removing_minor,target:remilia,targetStage:1=interested,Hm... I wonder if Momo would play this game in reverse, by making clothes for herself. She's an aristocrat too.
6-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity=interested,W-well, I was thinking maybe that would be something fun for the three of us to do together. I’d invite the others but three’s a party, as Jirou would say. Mineta would say something far dirtier, I think.
6-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=heroic,Wait, really? Saki’d probably be fine with a nice trip to a bathhouse or hot springs, right? I think Saki might actually live in my city, based on her uniform!
6-female_removing_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:1=calm,Oh, I see! So you have an item-type Quirk! Those are pretty rare, but I guess if it lets you do all sorts of nifty stuff, then that's amazing!
6-female_removing_minor,target:shego,targetStage:0=heroic,W-well, I hope you’re less dangerous without your gloves, Shego. I know Bakugo has a hard time focusing his blasts without his...
6-female_removing_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=vexed,Is it like... a forcefield of some sort? I know a few people with Quirks like that! But um. You seem to be showing off how you can use it to protect your clothes...
6-female_removing_minor,target:sonya,targetStage:5=embarrassed,Um. I can respect someone trying to turn around when they're embarrassed... I don't know why I didn't think of that...
6-female_removing_minor,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=interested,I-I can see why... someone would invite you here...
6-female_removed_minor=happy,I like your ~clothing~, ~name~! But I'm also kind of happy I didn't lose again!
6-female_removed_minor=vexed,Oh, s-sorry, I don't mean to be rude, but I'm just thankful I got to keep my panties on. (Isn't that an expression for rushing, anyway?)
6-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=nauseous,Now if only you could use it for good…
6-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=embarrassed,The Battle of Florem Gardens? I thought you were arrested. Are you out on good behavior?
6-female_removed_minor,target:alpha,targetStage:2=vexed,Now I feel <i>really</i> foolish. My mood's just been crushed.
6-female_removed_minor,target:chell,targetStage:1=embarrassed,E-er. I'm not a mind-reader or anything. Say, you're awfully quiet, huh?
6-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3=gravity,W-well, I definintely won't step on it. L-look! I'll even try to float away from it!
6-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:saki,marker:chiaki_apology=happy,Okay. If you want to be Saki's friend, you're probably not a bad person. Helping the vulnerable is always kind. I'm sorry, Chiaki.
6-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:4=shy,A-anyway, t-this type of game isn't really something I'm good at either.
6-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1=vexed,I had a feeling you reminded me of someone. But... I was hoping it wasn't Mineta.
6-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4=shy,Well, at least <i>someone</i> had a good time. I'm happy it was Futaba, at least!
6-female_removed_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:3=shy,H-huh? S-sorry, I’m a little distracted by trying to not get flustered, Gwen! I could've taken my suit off in two steps!
6-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:1=heroic,We do get a few trainees from abroad, but it’s great to see that Europe also takes hero training seriously!
6-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:2=calm,You seem really… Plain for something that seems so powerful. Or did you just show up in your street clothes or normal school uniform?
6-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=shy,Wait, I don't understand, is that related to a Quirk, or are you just scarred? Oh... sh-shoot. I'm sorry, Kyoko.
6-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=shy,Um. If it makes you feel any better, you seem really smart! And one of the best heroes I know has a scar like yours!
6-female_removed_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:3=shy,Mahiru, are you <i>sure</i> you can't part with your camera next...?
6-female_removed_minor,target:marceline,targetStage:3=nauseous,I’m super against blood-related stuff. It seems real gross!
6-female_removed_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:4=embarrassed,O-oh yeah, you’re right, Marinette. Sorry!
6-female_removed_minor,target:mei,targetStage:3=embarrassed,Oh, and you use some sort of nozzle to channel it, right? Or is it just chemistry?
6-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2=gravity,Y-you know. Your Quirk? That something special everyone's born with? Like my Zero Gravity? Kinda like this?
6-female_removed_minor,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=shy,Umm... are you going to leave now, Nayru? I mean... I guess if you could... I would too...
6-female_removed_minor,target:remilia=vexed,She's much less... demanding than you.
6-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity=nauseous,I’d really rather focus on the makeup stuff… Saki, what do you think?
6-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=happy,I like the way you think, Marinette. Saki, what’d you think?
6-female_removed_minor,target:sayaka=heroic,I bet you're a really important hero to your city, Magical Girl!
6-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:damage_reduction,marker:enf_0b=embarrassed,T-that sounds really, really cool, to be honest. I could use something like that for my withering pride, though.
6-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:dna_lock,marker:enf_0b=shy,W-why would I ever want to try on someone else's gear!? T-that's ludicrous!
6-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:pauldrons,marker:enf_0b=shy,I-I mean that's the basics of good suit design, right?
6-female_removed_minor,target:shego,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Er... It seems decidedly not.
6-female_removed_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=calm,W-which is really cool and everything! Seriously! But... I just don't quite get it...
6-female_removed_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3,marker:shimakaze_flooding=embarrassed,F-flooding in the-- I-I know some people like to take their hero persona seriously but... um, is that a euphemism?
6-female_removed_minor,target:sonya,targetStage:6=happy,Pffffft. Oh my gosh! Sonya! You're amazing at relieving tension! Using camouflage paint without a stealth Quirk. You are <i>too</i> funny!
6-female_removed_minor,target:sonya,targetStage:6=heroic,Sonya! This is too funny! You're helping me feel a lot better! Way to keep your cool!
6-female_removed_minor,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1=shy,I-I'm not into girls. It's just her Quirk!

-2-female_removed_minor=embarrassed,The closest I've come to m-mastur-- Gah-- with another girl was once on a long stakeout...
-2-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=nauseous,Now if only you could use it for good…
-2-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=embarrassed,The Battle of Florem Gardens? I thought you were arrested. Are you out on good behavior?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:alpha,targetStage:2=vexed,Now I feel <i>really</i> foolish. My mood's just been crushed.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:chell,targetStage:1=embarrassed,E-er. I'm not a mind-reader or anything. Say, you're awfully quiet, huh?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3=gravity,W-well, I definintely won't step on it. L-look! I'll even try to float away from it!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:saki,marker:chiaki_apology=happy,Okay. If you want to be Saki's friend, you're probably not a bad person. Helping the vulnerable is always kind. I'm sorry, Chiaki.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:4=shy,A-anyway, t-this type of game isn't really something I'm good at either.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1=vexed,I had a feeling you reminded me of someone. But... I was hoping it wasn't Mineta.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4=shy,Well, at least <i>someone</i> had a good time. I'm happy it was Futaba, at least!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:3=shy,H-huh? S-sorry, I’m a little distracted by trying to not get flustered, Gwen! I could've taken my suit off in two steps!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:1=heroic,We do get a few trainees from abroad, but it’s great to see that Europe also takes hero training seriously!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:2=calm,You seem really… Plain for something that seems so powerful. Or did you just show up in your street clothes or normal school uniform?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=shy,Wait, I don't understand, is that related to a Quirk, or are you just scarred? Oh... sh-shoot. I'm sorry, Kyoko.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=shy,Um. If it makes you feel any better, you seem really smart! And one of the best heroes I know has a scar like yours!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:3=shy,Mahiru, are you <i>sure</i> you can't part with your camera next...?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:marceline,targetStage:3=nauseous,I’m super against blood-related stuff. It seems real gross!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:4=embarrassed,O-oh yeah, you’re right, Marinette. Sorry!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:mei,targetStage:3=embarrassed,Oh, and you use some sort of nozzle to channel it, right? Or is it just chemistry?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2=gravity,Y-you know. Your Quirk? That something special everyone's born with? Like my Zero Gravity? Kinda like this?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=shy,Umm... are you going to leave now, Nayru? I mean... I guess if you could... I would too...
-2-female_removed_minor,target:remilia=vexed,She's much less... demanding than you.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity=nauseous,I’d really rather focus on the makeup stuff… Saki, what do you think?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=happy,I like the way you think, Marinette. Saki, what’d you think?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:sayaka=heroic,I bet you're a really important hero to your city, Magical Girl!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:damage_reduction,marker:enf_0b=embarrassed,T-that sounds really, really cool, to be honest. I could use something like that for my withering pride, though.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:dna_lock,marker:enf_0b=shy,W-why would I ever want to try on someone else's gear!? T-that's ludicrous!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:pauldrons,marker:enf_0b=shy,I-I mean that's the basics of good suit design, right?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:shego,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Er... It seems decidedly not.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=calm,W-which is really cool and everything! Seriously! But... I just don't quite get it...

-2-female_removed_minor,target:sonya,targetStage:6=happy,Pffffft. Oh my gosh! Sonya! You're amazing at relieving tension! Using camouflage paint without a stealth Quirk. You are <i>too</i> funny!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:sonya,targetStage:6=heroic,Sonya! This is too funny! You're helping me feel a lot better! Way to keep your cool!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1=shy,I-I'm not into girls. It's just her Quirk!


#finished
-1-male_removing_minor=embarrassed,<i>Sigh,</i> okay, it's still pretty nice to watch you take off your ~clothing~.
-1-male_removing_minor=heroic,~name~, you did awesome this game!
-1-male_removing_minor,target:9s,targetStage:1=interested,Or are you just kind of smart and like to make support gadgets?
-1-male_removing_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:0=interested,Do you know All Might, Captain America?
-1-male_removing_minor,target:pit,targetStage:2=vexed,Y-you have kind of a strange relationship with your armorer, don't you, Pit? A-at least it's just your feet...
-1-male_removed_minor=happy,It would've been better to see that... um, just a little bit ago.
-1-male_removed_minor=happy,I think I'm kind of sleepy now, though you look very handsome without your ~clothing~, ~name~.
-1-male_removed_minor,target:9s,targetStage:2=embarrassed,T-that’s… C-c-certainly... to take your boots off and socks instead of spacing those out...
-1-male_removed_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:1=heroic,You remind me a lot about him, but he’s… Sometimes bigger in person. Also louder, but that only helps to inspire confidence in him!
-1-male_removed_minor,target:pit,targetStage:3=embarrassed,Oh no. Some people are into that. I'M NOT AND IT'S COOL IF YOU ARE BUT--
-1-female_removing_minor=happy,Good playing so far, ~name~!
-1-female_removing_minor=heroic,Your ~clothing~ looks cute, but it'll look better on the floor! ....S-sorry, I was trying to do a Mineta impression.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=happy,Whoa, you have so much control! I have to brute force things a little bit, so it’s really impressive you have such good aim!
-1-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=nauseous,What ever happened to you after that… Shoot, I thought I was pretty good at history…
-1-female_removing_minor,target:alpha,targetStage:1=interested,I-it's kind of rude to use your Quirk to send a projection when the rest of us are here in the flesh...
-1-female_removing_minor,target:chell,targetStage:0=shy,Those types of Quirks are really something, huh?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=interested,Um... You really aren't a villain, are you?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3=embarrassed,I still think you frame things to be too much like Shigaraki...
-1-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0=embarrassed,A-are you not, Futaba? I mean...
-1-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:3=serious,Careful, Futaba! Don't lose your stuff! Or your lunch!
-1-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:3=heroic,Happy to help someone in need!
-1-female_removing_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:2=interested,E-er, I didn’t know there was a rule that we could take off our costumes in two pieces…
-1-female_removing_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:0=embarrassed,You’re that Quirk school in England, right? Er... the one that had all the issues with villains?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:1=vexed,Are you teleporting your clothes? I hope you aren’t disintegrating them!
-1-female_removing_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:aimee,alsoPlayingStage:1-7=nauseous,I really hope you aren't disintegrating them... Aimee already seems hellbent on destroying her apparel.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:2=shy,(I-I'm pretty sure she's not wearing underwear! I think I saw her whole butt! I could never--!)
-1-female_removing_minor,target:marceline,targetStage:2=embarrassed,You’ve mentioned that you like the color red a few times…
-1-female_removing_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:3=serious,Yeah… Hmm… I wonder what Deku-kun would think about this…
-1-female_removing_minor,target:mei,targetStage:2=interested,You’re like Todoroki, but with one half of his powers!
-1-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1=serious,So what is your Quirk? I completely forgot to ask about that eye… patch… thingy you were wearing.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:nayru,targetStage:3=interested,Quirks like that are really rare! But I guess it explains why you don't have a lot of gear...
-1-female_removing_minor,target:nayru,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=calm,Well, this has been kind of fun getting to know you, Nayru!
-1-female_removing_minor,target:remilia,targetStage:1=interested,Hm... I wonder if Momo would play this game in reverse, by making clothes for herself. She's an aristocrat too.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity=interested,W-well, I was thinking maybe that would be something fun for the three of us to do together. I’d invite the others but three’s a party, as Jirou would say. Mineta would say something far dirtier, I think.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=heroic,Wait, really? Saki’d probably be fine with a nice trip to a bathhouse or hot springs, right? I think Saki might actually live in my city, based on her uniform!
-1-female_removing_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:1=calm,Oh, I see! So you have an item-type Quirk! Those are pretty rare, but I guess if it lets you do all sorts of nifty stuff, then that's amazing!
-1-female_removing_minor,target:shego,targetStage:0=heroic,W-well, I hope you’re less dangerous without your gloves, Shego. I know Bakugo has a hard time focusing his blasts without his...
-1-female_removing_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=vexed,Is it like... a forcefield of some sort? I know a few people with Quirks like that! But um. You seem to be showing off how you can use it to protect your clothes...
-1-female_removing_minor,target:sonya,targetStage:5=embarrassed,Um. I can respect someone trying to turn around when they're embarrassed... I don't know why I didn't think of that...
-1-female_removing_minor,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=interested,I-I can see why... someone would invite you here...
-1-female_removed_minor=embarrassed,Um. I just kind of realized, with the way the game's played, don't all of us but one person actually lose? Oh no, did I just do all this for... W-well! I'll just try and use this as a learning experience!
-1-female_removed_minor=happy,I'm just happy to have helped you for a little while!
-1-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=nauseous,Now if only you could use it for good…

#OPPONENT REMOVING MAJOR CLOTHING
#Major clothing reveals a significant amount of skin and likely underwear.
#However, as we don't know if the opponent is taking off the top or the bottom, we can't presume that nice abs are showing; maybe she took of her skirt before her shirt.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written
male_removing_major=embarrassed,Oh no! Not your ~clothing~!
male_removing_major=interested,~name~ is taking off his ~clothing~...? Mmm... oh! Shoot, sorry!
male_removing_major=heroic,I kind of feel like I could take off more than what I've been doing if you're taking off stuff like your ~clothing~, ~name~.

male_removed_major=embarrassed,Er. Sorry, this can get a little distracting. For me, I mean.

0-male_removing_major,filter:flies,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=interested,S-so, ~name~, you can float too, right?
0-male_removing_major,filter:flies,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=interested,Hm… How high can you go, ~name~? I-I mean, if you fly or hover?
0-male_removing_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=shy,Zero Gravity doesn’t actually let me fly…
0-male_removing_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=shy,I-I think if I were a bit more… Um. You know... I could use my Quirk to gracefully slip out of my clothes…
0-male_removing_major,filter:hero,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=nauseous,S-shoot. Don’t worry, ~name~! I know when to step in as part of a hero team! I’ve got the next one! I-I think.

0-male_removing_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=embarrassed,~name~ is up? Just… Act like we’re changing between missions!
0-male_removing_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=heroic,~name~ l-l-lost? Argh, I’d offer to assist but that’s less… Mission-oriented…
0-male_removing_major,filter:shy,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=shy,Phew. I can see I’m not the only one here who’s not thrilled by the prospect of this game…
0-male_removing_major,filter:shy,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=heroic,Don’t worry, ~name~, I know I seem pretty brave, but I’m also really freaked out right now.
0-male_removing_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=embarrassed,H-heh. I’m kind of… Jeez, do I really sound like that when…?
0-male_removing_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=embarrassed,E-eh. Heh-heh… D-don’t worry ~name~, look how well I’m holding up, and I-I-

0-male_removing_major,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=shy,I-I’ll just stare elsewhere. Oh gosh, my face is just getting so red, isn’t it?
0-male_removing_major,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=embarrassed,I-I-I’m just going to look away now.

0-male_removed_major=embarrassed,I hope that you're um... doing okay, ~name~. I know I'd be kinda mad if I lost something big like that and someone else hadn't lost anything.

0-male_removed_major,marker:ochako_throw=serious,I-Er, I can't save you from bad cards, but I'll try to lose the next hand!
0-male_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=gravity,I kind of do it better when I’m either focused or stressed. Funny how that works, right?
0-male_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=gravity,Er… I don’t suppose you’re shy about it and it’s not something I’m supposed to talk about?
0-male_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=heroic,I’m so jealous of your Quirk, ~name~! It must be great to just… Lift off...
0-male_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=embarrassed,I-I kind of think about it every now and then
0-male_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=vexed,E-er… Sorry ~name~, I can stick around for the rest of the game but this is way harder for me than putting a stop to some villains.
0-male_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=gravity,Er… You’d be surprised at how often costumes seem to get torn in embarrassing ways. T-that’s why I always wear a bra! And underwear!
0-male_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=interested,Not that I’d have had any reason to have done that before. You know what, nevermind.
0-male_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=nauseous,Changing between missions in a co-ed environment where undressing is a penalty. Nope, not frightening at all.
0-male_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=heroic,Y-you still look good without your ~clothing~! Don’t give up yet, ~name~!

1-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=nauseous,Your ~clothing~?! That's supposed to cover a lot, so now you’re showing a lot, and so now I’m <i>embarrassed</i> a lot!

1-female_removing_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=shy,Zero Gravity doesn’t actually let me fly…
1-female_removing_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=shy,I-I think if I were a bit more… Um. You know... I could use my Quirk to gracefully slip out of my clothes…
1-female_removing_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_1b,notSaidMarker:enf_2a,marker:enf_2a=interested,O-oh.
1-female_removing_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_1b,notSaidMarker:enf_2a,marker:enf_2a=nauseous,Gah, this feels so weird, watching you take off your ~clothing~ and er…

1-female_removing_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_1b,notSaidMarker:enf_2a,marker:enf_2a=embarrassed,A-are you serious? We’re heroes, ~name~! We need to be better than this!
1-female_removing_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_1b,notSaidMarker:enf_2a,marker:enf_2a=embarrassed,I’m just going to look away. That’s pretty much all I can do, right?
1-female_removing_major,filter:shy,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=shy,Phew. I can see I’m not the only one here who’s not thrilled by the prospect of this game…
1-female_removing_major,filter:shy,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=heroic,Don’t worry, ~name~, I know I seem pretty brave, but I’m also really freaked out right now.
1-female_removing_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=embarrassed,H-heh. I’m kind of… Jeez, do I really sound like that when…?
1-female_removing_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=embarrassed,E-eh. Heh-heh… D-don’t worry ~name~, look how well I’m holding up, and I-I-
1-female_removing_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_1b,notSaidMarker:enf_2a,marker:enf_2a=nauseous,YEP, WE’RE FINE. ~name~. WE’RE FINE.
1-female_removing_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_1b,notSaidMarker:enf_2a,marker:enf_2a=nauseous,HA. HA. YEP. YEP YEP YEP. THIS SURE ISN’T EMOTIONALLY TAXING ON PEOPLE LIKE US.
1-female_removing_major,filter:villain,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=heroic,Serves you right, ~name~!
1-female_removing_major,filter:villain,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=heroic,Take that, ~name~!
1-female_removing_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=vexed,~name~, did you help set this up? Were you the bait to lure heroes into some sort of trap?
1-female_removing_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=heroic,I-I can’t tell if I’m supposed to stop you from losing, or if making you lose will make your trap backfire! ~name~, your villainy stops here! Or something cool like that!
1-female_removing_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_1b,notSaidMarker:enf_2a,marker:enf_2a=serious,I’m pretty sure I can legally just Zero Gravity you to the ceiling…
1-female_removing_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_1b,notSaidMarker:enf_2a,marker:enf_2a=vexed,I should just use my Quirk to remove you from the game.
1-female_removing_major,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=embarrassed,I-I’ll just stare elsewhere. Oh gosh, my face is just getting so red, isn’t it?
1-female_removing_major,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=embarrassed,I-I-I’m just going to look away now.
1-female_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=interested,A-a-ah, do you have to?
1-female_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=interested,D-does she really need to…?
1-female_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_1b,notSaidMarker:enf_2a,marker:enf_2a=vexed,Hmmf!
1-female_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_1b,notSaidMarker:enf_2a,marker:enf_2a=vexed,Hrm. Mmf? Mmhmm.
1-female_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=gravity,I-I-I-
1-female_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=gravity,I feel like I’m really <i>up and down</i> about this kind of thing.
1-female_removing_major,target:aimee,targetStage:0=nauseous,Oh no! Everyone watch out, I’ll try to--
1-female_removing_major,target:d.va,targetStage:3=interested,Most people I know would be gushing about their Quirk by now!
1-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=interested,Hm. I guess you’re a hero then!
1-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:3=interested,I was just looking at your costume. It’s actually not super complicated at all, is it? It’s just flexible material with a bit of rip-stoppage. It even looks kinda dirty and worn-out… And some of the patterning is definitely...
1-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1=embarrassed,O-oh no! You weren't wearing anything under that, were you, Marinette!?
1-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Y-you’re so comfortable with this! B-but there’s so many people and it’s not like we’re changing into something else--!
1-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=happy,O-oh! We call it training gear too. Back when I was in school, we did have a full gym outfit, at least.
1-female_removing_major,target:navi,targetStage:0=vexed,OK--OK!! No need to do a flash on us!
1-female_removing_major,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess,marker:enf_2a=nauseous,U-um! Dealer, anyone else, should-- how-- we should stop this, right!?
1-female_removing_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:0,marker:enf_0a=interested,Um... I'm guessing it's something with... balloons? Parties?
1-female_removing_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:1,marker:enf_1a=embarrassed,Um... not that taking off your clothes... gets the party started.
1-female_removing_major,target:saki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity=interested,Oh! I’m not a heavy drinker, but you both seem… not built for that either, so this could be fun!
1-female_removing_major,target:saki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=happy,Oh! That’s not a bad idea, Marinette.
1-female_removing_major,target:saki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=happy,Oh! I actually really like that! Food, relaxation, and laughter!
1-female_removing_major,target:wiifitfemale=shy,I don’t really know many people in that good of shape that aren’t Pro Heroes.
1-female_removing_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:1=heroic,“Wii Fit!” You <i>do</i> have some sort of training boosting power. And you’re so gentle about how you speak.
1-female_removing_major,target:zone-tan=nauseous,(It's so... so hard to even look away from her...)
1-female_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=gravity,I kind of do it better when I’m either focused or stressed. Funny how that works, right?
1-female_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=gravity,Er… I don’t suppose you’re shy about it and it’s not something I’m supposed to talk about?
1-female_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=heroic,I’m so jealous of your Quirk, ~name~! It must be great to just… Lift off...
1-female_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=embarrassed,I-I kind of think about it every now and then
1-female_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=gravity,It k-kinda makes you just want to float away, right?
1-female_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=embarrassed,I think I just have a lot of sympathy for you doing that, and it’s making me think of me doing it and I’m just kind of allovertheplace andokayIreallyshouldstop.
1-female_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=vexed,E-er… Sorry ~name~, I can stick around for the rest of the game but this is way harder for me than putting a stop to some villains.
1-female_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=gravity,Er… You’d be surprised at how often costumes seem to get torn in embarrassing ways. T-that’s why I always wear a bra! And underwear!
1-female_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=interested,Not that I’d have had any reason to have done that before. You know what, nevermind.
1-female_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=nauseous,Changing between missions in a co-ed environment where undressing is a penalty. Nope, not frightening at all.
1-female_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=shy,We’ve both got to be pretty embarrassed now, don’t we, ~name~? Do you think we’ll get a bad evaluation from HQ for losing?
1-female_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=shy,I-I’d rather not think too much about how this reflects on us.

1-female_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=embarrassed,Mhmmf! Yep! Those sure are ~name~’s ~clothing~ on the floor and not on her body.
1-female_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=vexed,That's sure ~name~'s ~clothing~ that ~name~’s not wearing anymore. Yep. See, my grammar is exacting. This means I am calm and collected!
1-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=interested,Oh! You have a sharpshooting Quirk! Just… Please be careful!
1-female_removed_major,target:d.va,targetStage:4=vexed,M-maybe you want to gush in other ways, which is why you wore such a tight suit.
1-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2=gravity,I think a villain would be a lot more sinister when she took off her mask… Though do you actually have some sort of vocal Quirk? I’ve never heard someone make a sound like that!
1-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:4=shy,Just sewn back together to vaguely resemble webs… W-w-what? N-no! I was just looking at your equipment! I wasn’t--
1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,marker:enf_1b=interested,Whoa! So that suit <i>was</i> part of your Quirk? That's so cool! But. Um. What else does it do?
1-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3=vexed,C-couldn't you have g-gone with something less... exposing...? Unless that's your Quirk?
1-female_removed_major,target:navi,targetStage:1=shy,Um... I guess it wasn't like Tooru's... She flashes us a lot.
1-female_removed_major,target:nayru,targetStage:5,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=interested,Is... is she okay? Nayru...?
1-female_removed_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:1,marker:enf_0b=shy,Yo-you're certainly well endowed! Um! Upbeat! With personality!
1-female_removed_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:2,marker:enf_1b=gravity,Hm. You are a--a mystery, Pinkie Pie. I'm certainly feeling more at ease with all of this!
1-female_removed_major,target:remilia,targetStage:4=vexed,It seems like you could be using your powers for a lot more... and now you're having wine?
1-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity=heroic,Hmm… Well, if Futaba’s going to use her code name, and she’ll refer to me as Uravity the whole time, I guess we need to give Saki a hero name…?
1-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=heroic,This sounds like a <i>great</i> day! Come on, Saki, are you in or what?
1-female_removed_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:1=embarrassed,But do you have some sort of synergy power? And... e-err... you look really sweaty... like <i>really</i> sweaty.
1-female_removed_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:2=shy,I bet your services are really something else! Though maybe you shouldn’t book yourself so often you show up to a game like this still sweating… Or maybe you’ve learned how to make the best of a sweating Quirk, considering you looked so dry earlier…
1-female_removed_major,target:zone-tan,targetStage:2,marker:enf_1a=vexed,C-can the management make her turn off her Quirk? Please?

2-male_removing_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_1b,notSaidMarker:enf_2a,marker:enf_2a=serious,I’m pretty sure I can legally just Zero Gravity you to the ceiling…
2-male_removing_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_1b,notSaidMarker:enf_2a,marker:enf_2a=vexed,I should just use my Quirk to remove you from the game.

2-male_removing_major,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=embarrassed,I-I-I’m just going to look away now.
2-male_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=interested,A-a-ah, do you have to?

2-male_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=gravity,I-I-I-
2-male_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=gravity,I feel like I’m really <i>up and down</i> about this kind of thing.
2-male_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=gravity,I kind of do it better when I’m either focused or stressed. Funny how that works, right?
2-male_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=gravity,Er… I don’t suppose you’re shy about it and it’s not something I’m supposed to talk about?
2-male_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=heroic,I’m so jealous of your Quirk, ~name~! It must be great to just… Lift off...
2-male_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=embarrassed,I-I kind of think about it every now and then
2-male_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=gravity,It k-kinda makes you just want to float away, right?
2-male_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=embarrassed,I think I just have a lot of sympathy for you doing that, and it’s making me think of me doing it and I’m just kind of allovertheplace andokayIreallyshouldstop.
2-male_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=interested,A-at least you’ve got a neat Quirk, ~name~ !
2-male_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=heroic,Er… At least we have a unique Quirk in common, huh?
2-male_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=vexed,E-er… Sorry ~name~, I can stick around for the rest of the game but this is way harder for me than putting a stop to some villains.
2-male_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=gravity,Er… You’d be surprised at how often costumes seem to get torn in embarrassing ways. T-that’s why I always wear a bra! And underwear!
2-male_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=interested,Not that I’d have had any reason to have done that before. You know what, nevermind.
2-male_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=nauseous,Changing between missions in a co-ed environment where undressing is a penalty. Nope, not frightening at all.
2-male_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=shy,We’ve both got to be pretty embarrassed now, don’t we, ~name~? Do you think we’ll get a bad evaluation from HQ for losing?
2-male_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=shy,I-I’d rather not think too much about how this reflects on us.
2-male_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=shy,I-I think it’s great that you’re going through with it. Yep. Very heroic. No problems here. With your ~clothing~ and various smaller bits on the floor.
2-male_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b=shy,I’m sorry ~name~, I thought this’d be easier with another hero but… Um. It’s still quite embarrassing...
2-male_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=heroic,Y-you still look good without your ~clothing~! Don’t give up yet, ~name~!
2-male_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=embarrassed,E-erm. I wonder if embarrassment is contagious…
2-male_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=heroic,I know you’re embarrassed, ~name~, but we can’t just be ashamed for no reason!
2-male_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=heroic,I’ve got your back, ~name~, as someone else who can be… Um. Fairly traditional about nudity.
2-male_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=vexed,THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT GOING TO BE AN EXPERIENCE WE LOOK BACK ON IN THE YEARS TO COME AND SPONTANEOUSLY BREAK OUT IN A COLD SWEAT AND BLUSH.
2-male_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=vexed,LET’S JUST FOCUS ON GETTING OUT OF HERE TONIGHT SO WE CAN GO BACK TO OUR HOMES AND HAVE A LONG, COLD SHOWER TO CALM OUR NERVES AND THINK ABOUT WHAT WE DID TO DESERVE THIS.
2-male_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=heroic,S-shoot. Don’t worry, ~name~! I’m a Pro Hero. Even if I’m a little… I’m still here to support you!
2-male_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=serious,I-I won’t be a coward. Don’t worry ~name~! I’m embarrassed too, but we’ll be okay!
2-male_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=vexed,Um. Sorry, I just get kind of… Hero-y.
2-male_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=embarrassed,T-that was a strange outburst from me! I’m s-sorry, ~name~! W-wait! Why should I be sorry! You’re a villain!
2-male_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=shy,I sure hope not. Because that makes me k-kind of an idiot.
2-male_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=embarrassed,W-well! It sure didn’t work! I wanted to come to this of my own free will-- N-no wait, I didn’t mean!
2-male_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=gravity,That way, this… Weirdness can stop.
2-male_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=gravity,G-given that you’re… Think, Ochako! Think how to stop this villain!
2-male_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=shy,I-is that just a villain thing? I don’t think so, but I’d say my friends are more confident rather than shameless like you.
2-male_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=vexed,I-I’d really rather you just surrender than have us keep going, ~name~.
2-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=nauseous,~Clothing~ is supposed to cover a lot, so now you’re showing a lot, and so now I’m <i>embarrassed</i> a lot!
2-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=nauseous,I can’t believe you took off your ~clothing~, ~name~! <i>I’m</i> embarrassed just thinking about it!
2-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=gravity,Um. S-sorry, I just got distracted. By a villain. And not your ~clothing~ being on the floor.
2-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=nauseous,Your ~clothing~?! That's supposed to cover a lot, so now you’re showing a lot, and so now I’m <i>embarrassed</i> a lot!
2-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=embarrassed,Mmhmm! This isn’t making me super uncomfortable. Nope. I am A-OK!
2-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=calm,Mmf. Yes. I am nodding my head. This is fine. I am not cringing internally.
2-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=embarrassed,Those sure are some ~clothing~ that ~name~’s not wearing anymore. Yep. Mmhmm! What could go wrong!?
2-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=embarrassed,Mhmmf! Yep! Those sure are ~name~’s ~clothing~ on the floor and not on his body.
2-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=embarrassed,I’m really coming around to appreciate the <i>gravity</i> of the situation.
2-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=embarrassed,<i>Meep!</i>
2-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:4=shy,I give up. You’re clearly playing this game a little differently than the rest, but you don’t seem too bothered by getting naked… S-so, Well, best of luck, 9S! Keep at it!
2-female_removing_major,filter:flies,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=interested,S-so, ~name~, you can float too, right?
2-female_removing_major,filter:flies,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=interested,Hm… How high can you go, ~name~? I-I mean, if you fly or hover?
2-female_removing_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=shy,Zero Gravity doesn’t actually let me fly…
2-female_removing_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=shy,I-I think if I were a bit more… Um. You know... I could use my Quirk to gracefully slip out of my clothes…
2-female_removing_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_1b,notSaidMarker:enf_2a,marker:enf_2a=interested,O-oh.
2-female_removing_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_1b,notSaidMarker:enf_2a,marker:enf_2a=nauseous,Gah, this feels so weird, watching you take off your ~clothing~ and er…
2-female_removing_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=interested,Ack, your ~clothing~?
2-female_removing_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=embarrassed,W-well. It c-c-could be more awkward, couldn’t it?
2-female_removing_major,filter:hero,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=nauseous,S-shoot. Don’t worry, ~name~! I know when to step in as part of a hero team! I’ve got the next one! I-I think.
2-female_removing_major,filter:hero,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=heroic,O-oh no, ~name~! Don’t let your costume get too battle-damaged!
2-female_removing_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=embarrassed,~name~ is up? Just… Act like we’re changing between missions!
2-female_removing_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=heroic,~name~ l-l-lost? Argh, I’d offer to assist but that’s less… Mission-oriented…
2-female_removing_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_1b,notSaidMarker:enf_2a,marker:enf_2a=embarrassed,A-are you serious? We’re heroes, ~name~! We need to be better than this!

2-female_removing_major,target:d.va,targetStage:3=interested,Most people I know would be gushing about their Quirk by now!
2-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=interested,Hm. I guess you’re a hero then!
2-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:3=interested,I was just looking at your costume. It’s actually not super complicated at all, is it? It’s just flexible material with a bit of rip-stoppage. It even looks kinda dirty and worn-out… And some of the patterning is definitely...
2-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1=embarrassed,O-oh no! You weren't wearing anything under that, were you, Marinette!?
2-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Y-you’re so comfortable with this! B-but there’s so many people and it’s not like we’re changing into something else--!
2-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=happy,O-oh! We call it training gear too. Back when I was in school, we did have a full gym outfit, at least.

3-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=nauseous,Your ~clothing~?! That's supposed to cover a lot, so now you’re showing a lot, and so now I’m <i>embarrassed</i> a lot!

3-female_removing_major,filter:flies,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=interested,Hm… How high can you go, ~name~? I-I mean, if you fly or hover?
3-female_removing_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=shy,Zero Gravity doesn’t actually let me fly…

3-female_removing_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_1b,notSaidMarker:enf_2a,marker:enf_2a=nauseous,Gah, this feels so weird, watching you take off your ~clothing~ and er…

3-female_removing_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=embarrassed,W-well. It c-c-could be more awkward, couldn’t it?

3-female_removing_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=embarrassed,Y-yikes. At least it’s not something… More revealing. T-though I’m not sure what else could be…
3-female_removing_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=embarrassed,Your ~clothing~? D-did you have nothing smaller? Like a gadget or a Quirk enhancer?
3-female_removing_major,filter:shy,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=shy,Phew. I can see I’m not the only one here who’s not thrilled by the prospect of this game…

3-female_removing_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=shy,S-she’s just as embarrassed as I am…
3-female_removing_major,filter:villain,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=heroic,Serves you right, ~name~!
3-female_removing_major,filter:villain,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=heroic,Take that, ~name~!
3-female_removing_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=vexed,~name~, did you help set this up? Were you the bait to lure heroes into some sort of trap?
3-female_removing_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=heroic,I-I can’t tell if I’m supposed to stop you from losing, or if making you lose will make your trap backfire! ~name~, your villainy stops here! Or something cool like that!
3-female_removing_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_1b,notSaidMarker:enf_2a,marker:enf_2a=serious,I’m pretty sure I can legally just Zero Gravity you to the ceiling…
3-female_removing_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_1b,notSaidMarker:enf_2a,marker:enf_2a=vexed,I should just use my Quirk to remove you from the game.
3-female_removing_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=embarrassed,I-I feel like I’m way more embarrassed about this than ~name~.
3-female_removing_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=embarrassed,Do… Do you just not feel ashamed for this, ~name~?
3-female_removing_major,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=embarrassed,I-I’ll just stare elsewhere. Oh gosh, my face is just getting so red, isn’t it?
3-female_removing_major,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=embarrassed,I-I-I’m just going to look away now.
3-female_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=interested,A-a-ah, do you have to?
3-female_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=interested,D-does she really need to…?

3-female_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=gravity,I feel like I’m really <i>up and down</i> about this kind of thing.
3-female_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_4b,notSaidMarker:enf_5a,marker:enf_5a=embarrassed,It’s fine. ~name~ is just taking off her clothing that’ll show off large portions of her skin.
3-female_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_4b,notSaidMarker:enf_5a=shy,E-erk.
3-female_removing_major,target:aimee,targetStage:0=nauseous,Oh no! Everyone watch out, I’ll try to--
3-female_removing_major,target:d.va,targetStage:3=interested,Most people I know would be gushing about their Quirk by now!
3-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=interested,Hm. I guess you’re a hero then!
3-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:3=interested,I was just looking at your costume. It’s actually not super complicated at all, is it? It’s just flexible material with a bit of rip-stoppage. It even looks kinda dirty and worn-out… And some of the patterning is definitely...
3-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1=embarrassed,O-oh no! You weren't wearing anything under that, were you, Marinette!?
3-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Y-you’re so comfortable with this! B-but there’s so many people and it’s not like we’re changing into something else--!
3-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=happy,O-oh! We call it training gear too. Back when I was in school, we did have a full gym outfit, at least.
3-female_removing_major,target:navi,targetStage:0=vexed,OK--OK!! No need to do a flash on us!
3-female_removing_major,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess,marker:enf_2a=nauseous,U-um! Dealer, anyone else, should-- how-- we should stop this, right!?
3-female_removing_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:0,marker:enf_0a=interested,Um... I'm guessing it's something with... balloons? Parties?
3-female_removing_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:1,marker:enf_1a=embarrassed,Um... not that taking off your clothes... gets the party started.
3-female_removing_major,target:saki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity=interested,Oh! I’m not a heavy drinker, but you both seem… not built for that either, so this could be fun!
3-female_removing_major,target:saki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=happy,Oh! That’s not a bad idea, Marinette.
3-female_removing_major,target:saki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=happy,Oh! I actually really like that! Food, relaxation, and laughter!
3-female_removing_major,target:wiifitfemale=shy,I don’t really know many people in that good of shape that aren’t Pro Heroes.
3-female_removing_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:1=heroic,“Wii Fit!” You <i>do</i> have some sort of training boosting power. And you’re so gentle about how you speak.
3-female_removing_major,target:zone-tan=nauseous,(It's so... so hard to even look away from her...)
3-female_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=gravity,I kind of do it better when I’m either focused or stressed. Funny how that works, right?
3-female_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=gravity,Er… I don’t suppose you’re shy about it and it’s not something I’m supposed to talk about?
3-female_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=heroic,I’m so jealous of your Quirk, ~name~! It must be great to just… Lift off...
3-female_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=embarrassed,I-I kind of think about it every now and then
3-female_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=gravity,It k-kinda makes you just want to float away, right?
3-female_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=embarrassed,I think I just have a lot of sympathy for you doing that, and it’s making me think of me doing it and I’m just kind of allovertheplace andokayIreallyshouldstop.
3-female_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=interested,A-at least you’ve got a neat Quirk, ~name~ ! The-the floating, I mean.
3-female_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=heroic,Er… At least we have a unique Quirk in common, huh? Our flying, I mean.
3-female_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=vexed,E-er… Sorry ~name~, I can stick around for the rest of the game but this is way harder for me than putting a stop to some villains.
3-female_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=gravity,Er… You’d be surprised at how often costumes seem to get torn in embarrassing ways. T-that’s why I always wear a bra! And underwear!
3-female_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=interested,Not that I’d have had any reason to have done that before. You know what, nevermind.
3-female_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=nauseous,Changing between missions in a co-ed environment where undressing is a penalty. Nope, not frightening at all.
3-female_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=shy,We’ve both got to be pretty embarrassed now, don’t we, ~name~? Do you think we’ll get a bad evaluation from HQ for losing?
3-female_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=shy,I-I’d rather not think too much about how this reflects on us.
3-female_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=shy,I-I think it’s great that you’re going through with it. Yep. Very heroic. No problems here. With your ~clothing~ and various smaller bits on the floor.
3-female_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=shy,I’m sorry ~name~, I thought this’d be easier with another hero but… Um. It’s still quite embarrassing...
3-female_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=heroic,Y-you still look good without your ~clothing~! Don’t give up yet, ~name~!
3-female_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=embarrassed,E-erm. I wonder if embarrassment is contagious…
3-female_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=heroic,I know you’re embarrassed, ~name~, but we can’t just be ashamed for no reason!
3-female_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=heroic,I’ve got your back, ~name~, as someone else who can be… Um. Fairly traditional about nudity.
3-female_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=vexed,THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT GOING TO BE AN EXPERIENCE WE LOOK BACK ON IN THE YEARS TO COME AND SPONTANEOUSLY BREAK OUT IN A COLD SWEAT AND BLUSH.
3-female_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=vexed,LET’S JUST FOCUS ON GETTING OUT OF HERE TONIGHT SO WE CAN GO BACK TO OUR HOMES AND HAVE A LONG, COLD SHOWER TO CALM OUR NERVES AND THINK ABOUT WHAT WE DID TO DESERVE THIS.
3-female_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=heroic,S-shoot. Don’t worry, ~name~! I’m a Pro Hero. Even if I’m a little… I’m still here to support you!
3-female_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=serious,I-I won’t be a coward. Don’t worry ~name~! I’m embarrassed too, but we’ll be okay!
3-female_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=vexed,Um. Sorry, I just get kind of… Hero-y.
3-female_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=embarrassed,T-that was a strange outburst from me! I’m s-sorry, ~name~! W-wait! Why should I be sorry! You’re a villain!
3-female_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=shy,I sure hope not. Because that makes me k-kind of an idiot.
3-female_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=embarrassed,W-well! It sure didn’t work! I wanted to come to this of my own free will-- N-no wait, I didn’t mean!
3-female_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=gravity,That way, this… Weirdness can stop.
3-female_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=gravity,G-given that you’re… Think, Ochako! Think how to stop this villain!
3-female_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=shy,I-is that just a villain thing? I don’t think so, but I’d say my friends are more confident rather than shameless like you.

3-female_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=embarrassed,I’m really coming around to appreciate the <i>gravity</i> of the situation.
3-female_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=embarrassed,<i>Meep!</i>
3-female_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_4a,notSaidMarker:enf_4b,marker:enf_4b=embarrassed,T-that’s f-fine. M-mmf. I-I’ll just… Hnmf.

3-female_removed_major,target:d.va,targetStage:4=vexed,M-maybe you want to gush in other ways, which is why you wore such a tight suit.
3-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2=gravity,I think a villain would be a lot more sinister when she took off her mask… Though do you actually have some sort of vocal Quirk? I’ve never heard someone make a sound like that!
3-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:4=shy,Just sewn back together to vaguely resemble webs… W-w-what? N-no! I was just looking at your equipment! I wasn’t--

3-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3=vexed,C-couldn't you have g-gone with something less... exposing...? Unless that's your Quirk?
3-female_removed_major,target:navi,targetStage:1=shy,Um... I guess it wasn't like Tooru's... She flashes us a lot.
3-female_removed_major,target:nayru,targetStage:5,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=interested,Is... is she okay? Nayru...?
3-female_removed_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:1,marker:enf_0b=shy,Yo-you're certainly well endowed! Um! Upbeat! With personality!
3-female_removed_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:2,marker:enf_1b=gravity,Hm. You are a--a mystery, Pinkie Pie. I'm certainly feeling more at ease with all of this!
3-female_removed_major,target:remilia,targetStage:4=vexed,It seems like you could be using your powers for a lot more... and now you're having wine?
3-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity=heroic,Hmm… Well, if Futaba’s going to use her code name, and she’ll refer to me as Uravity the whole time, I guess we need to give Saki a hero name…?
3-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=heroic,This sounds like a <i>great</i> day! Come on, Saki, are you in or what?

3-female_removed_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:2=shy,I bet your services are really something else!

4-male_removing_major,filter:flies,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=interested,S-so, ~name~, you can float too, right?
4-male_removing_major,filter:flies,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=interested,Hm… How high can you go, ~name~? I-I mean, if you fly or hover?

4-male_removing_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_1b,notSaidMarker:enf_2a,marker:enf_2a=interested,S-so you can do that while floating, right? J-just curious.
4-male_removing_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_1b,notSaidMarker:enf_2a,marker:enf_2a=nauseous,Gah, this feels so weird, watching you take off your ~clothing~ and er…
4-male_removing_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=interested,Ack, your ~clothing~? E-even if we can both fly, I-I guess we can tell our clothing apart really easily, right?
4-male_removing_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=embarrassed,W-well. It c-c-could be more awkward, couldn’t it? I-I mean, it's not like we're floating away together.
4-male_removing_major,filter:hero,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=nauseous,S-shoot. Don’t worry, ~name~! I know when to step in as part of a hero team! I’ve got the next one! I-I think.
4-male_removing_major,filter:hero,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=heroic,O-oh no, ~name~! Don’t let your costume get too battle-damaged!
4-male_removing_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=embarrassed,~name~ is up? Just… Act like we’re changing between missions!
4-male_removing_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=heroic,~name~ l-l-lost? Argh, I’d offer to assist but that’s less… Mission-oriented…
4-male_removing_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_1b,notSaidMarker:enf_2a,marker:enf_2a=embarrassed,A-are you serious? We’re heroes, ~name~! We need to be better than this!
4-male_removing_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_1b,notSaidMarker:enf_2a,marker:enf_2a=embarrassed,I’m just going to look away. That’s pretty much all I can do, right?
4-male_removing_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=embarrassed,Y-yikes. At least it’s not something… More revealing. T-though I’m not sure what else could be…
4-male_removing_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=embarrassed,Your ~clothing~? D-did you have nothing smaller? Like a gadget or a Quirk enhancer?
4-male_removing_major,filter:shy,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=shy,Phew. I can see I’m not the only one here who’s not thrilled by the prospect of this game…
4-male_removing_major,filter:shy,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=heroic,Don’t worry, ~name~, I know I seem pretty brave, but I’m also really freaked out right now.

4-male_removing_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_1b,notSaidMarker:enf_2a,marker:enf_2a=nauseous,HA. HA. YEP. YEP YEP YEP. THIS SURE ISN’T EMOTIONALLY TAXING ON GIRLS LIKE US.
4-male_removing_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=shy,I-I was doing pretty okay until ~name~ needed to take off her ~clothing~.
4-male_removing_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=shy,S-she’s just as embarrassed as I am…
4-male_removing_major,filter:villain,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=heroic,Serves you right, ~name~!
4-male_removing_major,filter:villain,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=heroic,Take that, ~name~!

4-male_removing_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_1b,notSaidMarker:enf_2a,marker:enf_2a=serious,I’m pretty sure I can legally just Zero Gravity you to the ceiling…
4-male_removing_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_1b,notSaidMarker:enf_2a,marker:enf_2a=vexed,I should just use my Quirk to remove you from the game.
4-male_removing_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=embarrassed,I-I feel like I’m way more embarrassed about this than ~name~.
4-male_removing_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=embarrassed,Do… Do you just not feel ashamed for this, ~name~?
4-male_removing_major,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=shy,I-I’ll just stare elsewhere. Oh gosh, my face is just getting so red, isn’t it?
4-male_removing_major,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=embarrassed,I-I-I’m just going to look away now.
4-male_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=interested,A-a-ah, do you have to?
4-male_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=shy,I-is he going to--? His ~clothing~?
4-male_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=interested,D-does he really need to…?
4-male_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=embarrassed,A-are you sure, ~name~?

4-male_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_1b,notSaidMarker:enf_2a,marker:enf_2a=vexed,Hmmf!
4-male_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_1b,notSaidMarker:enf_2a,marker:enf_2a=vexed,Hrm. Mmf? Mmhmm.
4-male_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=gravity,I-I-I-
4-male_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=gravity,I feel like I’m really <i>up and down</i> about this kind of thing.
4-male_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_3b,notSaidMarker:enf_4a,marker:enf_4a=shy,D-d-do y-you have something else you could... take off... ~name~?
4-male_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_3b,notSaidMarker:enf_4a,marker:enf_4a=embarrassed,O-oh. ~name~ is taking off his... That's fine. Totally fine. Yep. Sexy even.
4-male_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_4b,notSaidMarker:enf_5a,marker:enf_5a=embarrassed,It’s fine. ~name~ is just taking off her clothing that’ll show off large portions of his skin.
4-male_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_4b,notSaidMarker:enf_5a,marker:enf_5a=nauseous,E-erk.
4-male_removed_major=interested,Um. I'm not <i>happy</i> ~name~ lost, but he does look... pretty good.
4-male_removed_major=interested,Okay, ~name~, at least if I lose next round I can do so knowing you're next to me. Um. Scorewise.
4-male_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=gravity,I kind of do it better when I’m either focused or stressed. Funny how that works, right?
4-male_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=gravity,Er… I don’t suppose you’re shy about it and it’s not something I’m supposed to talk about?
4-male_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=heroic,I’m so jealous of your Quirk, ~name~! It must be great to just… Lift off...
4-male_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=embarrassed,I-I kind of think about it every now and then
4-male_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=gravity,It k-kinda makes you just want to float away, right?
4-male_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=embarrassed,I think I just have a lot of sympathy for you doing that, and it’s making me think of me doing it and I’m just kind of allovertheplace andokayIreallyshouldstop.
4-male_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=interested,A-at least you’ve got a neat Quirk, ~name~ !
4-male_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=heroic,Er… At least we have a unique Quirk in common, huh?
4-male_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=vexed,E-er… Sorry ~name~, I can stick around for the rest of the game but this is way harder for me than putting a stop to some villains.
4-male_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=gravity,Er… You’d be surprised at how often costumes seem to get torn in embarrassing ways. T-that’s why I always wear a bra! And underwear!
4-male_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=interested,Not that I’d have had any reason to have done that before. You know what, nevermind.
4-male_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=nauseous,Changing between missions in a co-ed environment where undressing is a penalty. Nope, not frightening at all.
4-male_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=shy,We’ve both got to be pretty embarrassed now, don’t we, ~name~? Do you think we’ll get a bad evaluation from HQ for losing?
4-male_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=shy,I-I’d rather not think too much about how this reflects on us.
4-male_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=shy,I-I think it’s great that you’re going through with it. Yep. Very heroic. No problems here. With your ~clothing~ and various smaller bits on the floor.
4-male_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b=shy,I’m sorry ~name~, I thought this’d be easier with another hero but… Um. It’s still quite embarrassing...
4-male_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=heroic,Y-you still look good without your ~clothing~! Don’t give up yet, ~name~!
4-male_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=embarrassed,E-erm. I wonder if embarrassment is contagious…
4-male_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=heroic,I know you’re embarrassed, ~name~, but we can’t just be ashamed for no reason!
4-male_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=heroic,I’ve got your back, ~name~, as someone else who can be… Um. Fairly traditional about nudity.
4-male_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=vexed,THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT GOING TO BE AN EXPERIENCE WE LOOK BACK ON IN THE YEARS TO COME AND SPONTANEOUSLY BREAK OUT IN A COLD SWEAT AND BLUSH.
4-male_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=vexed,LET’S JUST FOCUS ON GETTING OUT OF HERE TONIGHT SO WE CAN GO BACK TO OUR HOMES AND HAVE A LONG, COLD SHOWER TO CALM OUR NERVES AND THINK ABOUT WHAT WE DID TO DESERVE THIS.
4-male_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=heroic,S-shoot. Don’t worry, ~name~! I’m a Pro Hero. Even if I’m a little… I’m still here to support you!
4-male_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=serious,I-I won’t be a coward. Don’t worry ~name~! I’m embarrassed too, but we’ll be okay!
4-male_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=vexed,Um. Sorry, I just get kind of… Hero-y.
4-male_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=embarrassed,T-that was a strange outburst from me! I’m s-sorry, ~name~! W-wait! Why should I be sorry! You’re a villain!
4-male_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=shy,I sure hope not. Because that makes me k-kind of an idiot.
4-male_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=embarrassed,W-well! It sure didn’t work! I wanted to come to this of my own free will-- N-no wait, I didn’t mean!
4-male_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=gravity,That way, this… Weirdness can stop.
4-male_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=gravity,G-given that you’re… Think, Ochako! Think how to stop this villain!
4-male_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=shy,I-is that just a villain thing? I don’t think so, but I’d say my friends are more confident rather than shameless like you.
4-male_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=vexed,I-I’d really rather you just surrender than have us keep going, ~name~.
4-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=nauseous,~Clothing~ is supposed to cover a lot, so now you’re showing a lot, and so now I’m <i>embarrassed</i> a lot!
4-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=nauseous,I can’t believe you took off your ~clothing~, ~name~! <i>I’m</i> embarrassed just thinking about it!
4-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=gravity,Um. S-sorry, I just got distracted. By a villain. And not your ~clothing~ being on the floor.
4-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=nauseous,Your ~clothing~?! That's supposed to cover a lot, so now you’re showing a lot, and so now I’m <i>embarrassed</i> a lot!
4-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=embarrassed,Mmhmm! This isn’t making me super uncomfortable. Nope. I am A-OK!
4-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=calm,Mmf. Yes. I am nodding my head. This is fine. I am not cringing internally.
4-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=embarrassed,Those sure are some ~clothing~ that ~name~’s not wearing anymore. Yep. Mmhmm! What could go wrong!?
4-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=embarrassed,Mhmmf! Yep! Those sure are ~name~’s ~clothing~ on the floor and not on his body.
4-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=embarrassed,I’m really coming around to appreciate the <i>gravity</i> of the situation.
4-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=embarrassed,<i>Meep!</i>
4-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_4a,notSaidMarker:enf_4b,marker:enf_4b=embarrassed,T-that’s f-fine. M-mmf. I-I’ll just… hnmf.
4-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_4a,notSaidMarker:enf_4b,marker:enf_4b=shy,E-er. That's great! ~name~! G-great! N-not at all embarrassing for us. N-nope! S-so great!
4-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_5a,notSaidMarker:enf_5b,marker:enf_5b=serious,That’s what this game is about. I’m not screaming on the inside. Not me! <i>Not at all.</i> I-I’ll put up a brave face for the rest of this, at least.
4-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_5a,notSaidMarker:enf_5b,marker:enf_5b=heroic,Yeah! Take more off! Definitely don't win and keep your major articles on! No! Definitely for real take them off. I'm great! Really!
4-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:4=shy,I give up. You’re clearly playing this game a little differently than the rest, but you don’t seem too bothered by getting naked… S-so, Well, best of luck, 9S! Keep at it!
4-female_removing_major=happy,I'm right behind you, ~name~!
4-female_removing_major=heroic,Don't worry, ~name~, Uravity is still here with you!
4-female_removing_major,filter:flies,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=interested,S-so, ~name~, you can float too, right?
4-female_removing_major,filter:flies,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=interested,Hm… How high can you go, ~name~? I-I mean, if you fly or hover?
4-female_removing_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=shy,Zero Gravity doesn’t actually let me fly…
4-female_removing_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=shy,I-I think if I were a bit more… Um. You know... I could use my Quirk to gracefully slip out of my clothes…

4-female_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_3b,notSaidMarker:enf_4a,marker:enf_4a=nauseous,O-oh. ~name~ is taking off her... That's fine. Totally fine. Yep. Sexy even.
4-female_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_4b,notSaidMarker:enf_5a,marker:enf_5a=embarrassed,It’s fine. ~name~ is just taking off her clothing that’ll show off large portions of her skin.
4-female_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_4b,notSaidMarker:enf_5a=shy,E-erk.
4-female_removing_major,target:aimee,targetStage:0=nauseous,Oh no! Everyone watch out, I’ll try to--
4-female_removing_major,target:d.va,targetStage:3=interested,Most people I know would be gushing about their Quirk by now!
4-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=interested,Hm. I guess you’re a hero then!
4-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:3=interested,I was just looking at your costume. It’s actually not super complicated at all, is it? It’s just flexible material with a bit of rip-stoppage. It even looks kinda dirty and worn-out… And some of the patterning is definitely...
4-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1=embarrassed,O-oh no! You weren't wearing anything under that, were you, Marinette!?
4-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Y-you’re so comfortable with this! B-but there’s so many people and it’s not like we’re changing into something else--!
4-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=happy,O-oh! We call it training gear too. Back when I was in school, we did have a full gym outfit, at least.
4-female_removing_major,target:navi,targetStage:0=vexed,OK--OK!! No need to do a flash on us!
4-female_removing_major,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess,marker:enf_2a=nauseous,U-um! Dealer, anyone else, should-- how-- we should stop this, right!?
4-female_removing_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:0,marker:enf_0a=interested,Um... I'm guessing it's something with... balloons? Parties?
4-female_removing_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:1,marker:enf_1a=embarrassed,Um... not that taking off your clothes... gets the party started.
4-female_removing_major,target:saki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity=interested,Oh! I’m not a heavy drinker, but you both seem… not built for that either, so this could be fun!
4-female_removing_major,target:saki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=happy,Oh! That’s not a bad idea, Marinette.
4-female_removing_major,target:saki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=happy,Oh! I actually really like that! Food, relaxation, and laughter!
4-female_removing_major,target:wiifitfemale=shy,I don’t really know many people in that good of shape that aren’t Pro Heroes.
4-female_removing_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:1=heroic,“Wii Fit!” You <i>do</i> have some sort of training boosting power. And you’re so gentle about how you speak.
4-female_removing_major,target:zone-tan=nauseous,(It's so... so hard to even look away from her...)
4-female_removed_major=interested,If I lose my next hand I'll be taking off my suit, so don't worry ~name~, you're not alone!
4-female_removed_major=embarrassed,O-okay. I'll admit I'm not sure how reassuring that is.
4-female_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=gravity,I kind of do it better when I’m either focused or stressed. Funny how that works, right?
4-female_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=gravity,Er… I don’t suppose you’re shy about it and it’s not something I’m supposed to talk about?
4-female_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=heroic,I’m so jealous of your Quirk, ~name~! It must be great to just… Lift off...
4-female_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=embarrassed,I-I kind of think about it every now and then
4-female_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=gravity,It k-kinda makes you just want to float away, right?
4-female_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=embarrassed,I think I just have a lot of sympathy for you doing that, and it’s making me think of me doing it and I’m just kind of allovertheplace andokayIreallyshouldstop.
4-female_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=interested,A-at least you’ve got a neat Quirk, ~name~ ! The-the floating, I mean.
4-female_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=heroic,Er… At least we have a unique Quirk in common, huh? Our flying, I mean.
4-female_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=vexed,E-er… Sorry ~name~, I can stick around for the rest of the game but this is way harder for me than putting a stop to some villains.
4-female_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=gravity,Er… You’d be surprised at how often costumes seem to get torn in embarrassing ways. T-that’s why I always wear a bra! And underwear!
4-female_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=interested,Not that I’d have had any reason to have done that before. You know what, nevermind.
4-female_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=nauseous,Changing between missions in a co-ed environment where undressing is a penalty. Nope, not frightening at all.
4-female_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=shy,We’ve both got to be pretty embarrassed now, don’t we, ~name~? Do you think we’ll get a bad evaluation from HQ for losing?
4-female_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=shy,I-I’d rather not think too much about how this reflects on us.
4-female_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=shy,I-I think it’s great that you’re going through with it. Yep. Very heroic. No problems here. With your ~clothing~ and various smaller bits on the floor.
4-female_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=shy,I’m sorry ~name~, I thought this’d be easier with another hero but… Um. It’s still quite embarrassing...
4-female_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=heroic,Y-you still look good without your ~clothing~! Don’t give up yet, ~name~!
4-female_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=embarrassed,E-erm. I wonder if embarrassment is contagious…
4-female_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=heroic,I know you’re embarrassed, ~name~, but we can’t just be ashamed for no reason!
4-female_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=heroic,I’ve got your back, ~name~, as someone else who can be… Um. Fairly traditional about nudity.
4-female_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=vexed,THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT GOING TO BE AN EXPERIENCE WE LOOK BACK ON IN THE YEARS TO COME AND SPONTANEOUSLY BREAK OUT IN A COLD SWEAT AND BLUSH.
4-female_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=vexed,LET’S JUST FOCUS ON GETTING OUT OF HERE TONIGHT SO WE CAN GO BACK TO OUR HOMES AND HAVE A LONG, COLD SHOWER TO CALM OUR NERVES AND THINK ABOUT WHAT WE DID TO DESERVE THIS.
4-female_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=heroic,S-shoot. Don’t worry, ~name~! I’m a Pro Hero. Even if I’m a little… I’m still here to support you!
4-female_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=serious,I-I won’t be a coward. Don’t worry ~name~! I’m embarrassed too, but we’ll be okay!
4-female_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=vexed,Um. Sorry, I just get kind of… Hero-y.
4-female_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=embarrassed,T-that was a strange outburst from me! I’m s-sorry, ~name~! W-wait! Why should I be sorry! You’re a villain!
4-female_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=shy,I sure hope not. Because that makes me k-kind of an idiot.
4-female_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=embarrassed,W-well! It sure didn’t work! I wanted to come to this of my own free will-- N-no wait, I didn’t mean!
4-female_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=gravity,That way, this… Weirdness can stop.
4-female_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=gravity,G-given that you’re… Think, Ochako! Think how to stop this villain!
4-female_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=shy,I-is that just a villain thing? I don’t think so, but I’d say my friends are more confident rather than shameless like you.
4-female_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=vexed,I-I’d really rather you just surrender than have us keep going, ~name~.
4-female_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=nauseous,I can’t believe you took off your ~clothing~, ~name~! <i>I’m</i> embarrassed just thinking about it!
4-female_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=nauseous,Your ~clothing~? That's supposed to cover a lot, so now you’re showing a lot, and so now I’m <i>embarrassed</i> a lot!
4-female_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=embarrassed,Mmhmm! This isn’t making me super uncomfortable. Nope. I am A-OK!
4-female_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=calm,Mmf. Yes. I am nodding my head. This is fine. I am not cringing internally.
4-female_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=embarrassed,That's sure ~name~'s ~clothing~ that ~name~’s not wearing anymore. Yep. Mmhmm! What could go wrong!?
4-female_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=embarrassed,Mhmmf! Yep! Those sure are ~name~’s ~clothing~ on the floor and not on her body.
4-female_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=vexed,That's sure ~name~'s ~clothing~ that ~name~’s not wearing anymore. Yep. See, my grammar is exacting. This means I am calm and collected!
4-female_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=embarrassed,I’m really coming around to appreciate the <i>gravity</i> of the situation.
4-female_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=embarrassed,<i>Meep!</i>
4-female_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_4a,notSaidMarker:enf_4b,marker:enf_4b=embarrassed,T-that’s f-fine. M-mmf. I-I’ll just… Hnmf.
4-female_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_5a,notSaidMarker:enf_5b,marker:enf_5b=serious,That’s what this game is about. I’m not screaming on the inside. Not me! <i>Not at all.</i> I-I’ll put up a brave face for the rest of this, at least.
4-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=interested,Oh! You have a sharpshooting Quirk! Just… Please be careful!
4-female_removed_major,target:d.va,targetStage:4=vexed,M-maybe you want to gush in other ways, which is why you wore such a tight suit.
4-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2=gravity,I think a villain would be a lot more sinister when she took off her mask… Though do you actually have some sort of vocal Quirk? I’ve never heard someone make a sound like that!
4-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:4=shy,Just sewn back together to vaguely resemble webs… W-w-what? N-no! I was just looking at your equipment! I wasn’t--
4-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,marker:enf_1b=interested,Whoa! So that suit <i>was</i> part of your Quirk? That's so cool! But. Um. What else does it do?
4-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3=vexed,C-couldn't you have g-gone with something less... exposing...? Unless that's your Quirk?
4-female_removed_major,target:navi,targetStage:1=shy,Um... I guess it wasn't like Tooru's... She flashes us a lot.
4-female_removed_major,target:nayru,targetStage:5,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=interested,Is... is she okay? Nayru...?
4-female_removed_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:1,marker:enf_0b=shy,Yo-you're certainly well endowed! Um! Upbeat! With personality!
4-female_removed_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:2,marker:enf_1b=gravity,Hm. You are a--a mystery, Pinkie Pie. I'm certainly feeling more at ease with all of this!
4-female_removed_major,target:remilia,targetStage:4=vexed,It seems like you could be using your powers for a lot more... and now you're having wine?
4-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity=heroic,Hmm… Well, if Futaba’s going to use her code name, and she’ll refer to me as Uravity the whole time, I guess we need to give Saki a hero name…?
4-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=heroic,This sounds like a <i>great</i> day! Come on, Saki, are you in or what?
4-female_removed_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:1=embarrassed,But do you have some sort of synergy power? And... e-err... you look really sweaty... like <i>really</i> sweaty.
4-female_removed_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:2=shy,I bet your services are really something else! Though maybe you shouldn’t book yourself so often you show up to a game like this still sweating… Or maybe you’ve learned how to make the best of a sweating Quirk, considering you looked so dry earlier…
4-female_removed_major,target:zone-tan,targetStage:2,marker:enf_1a=vexed,C-can the management make her turn off her Quirk? Please?


#lost costume
5-male_removing_major=happy,I supposed I did drag out my first few stages a bit...
5-male_removing_major=heroic,Okay. This almost makes up for the loss of my suit!
5-male_removing_major,filter:flies,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=interested,S-so, ~name~, you can float too, right?
5-male_removing_major,filter:flies,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=interested,Hm… How high can you go, ~name~? I-I mean, if you fly or hover?
5-male_removing_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=shy,Zero Gravity doesn’t actually let me fly…
5-male_removing_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=shy,I-I think if I were a bit more… Um. You know... I could use my Quirk to gracefully slip out of my clothes…
5-male_removing_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_1b,notSaidMarker:enf_2a,marker:enf_2a=interested,S-so you can do that while floating, right? J-just curious.
5-male_removing_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_1b,notSaidMarker:enf_2a,marker:enf_2a=nauseous,Gah, this feels so weird, watching you take off your ~clothing~ and er…
5-male_removing_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=interested,Ack, your ~clothing~? E-even if we can both fly, I-I guess we can tell our clothing apart really easily, right?
5-male_removing_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=embarrassed,W-well. It c-c-could be more awkward, couldn’t it? I-I mean, it's not like we're floating away together.
5-male_removing_major,filter:hero,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=nauseous,S-shoot. Don’t worry, ~name~! I know when to step in as part of a hero team! I’ve got the next one! I-I think.
5-male_removing_major,filter:hero,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=heroic,O-oh no, ~name~! Don’t let your costume get too battle-damaged!
5-male_removing_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=embarrassed,~name~ is up? Just… Act like we’re changing between missions!
5-male_removing_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=heroic,~name~ l-l-lost? Argh, I’d offer to assist but that’s less… Mission-oriented…
5-male_removing_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_1b,notSaidMarker:enf_2a,marker:enf_2a=embarrassed,A-are you serious? We’re heroes, ~name~! We need to be better than this!
5-male_removing_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_1b,notSaidMarker:enf_2a,marker:enf_2a=embarrassed,I’m just going to look away. That’s pretty much all I can do, right?
5-male_removing_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=embarrassed,Y-yikes. At least it’s not something… More revealing. T-though I’m not sure what else could be…
5-male_removing_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=embarrassed,Your ~clothing~? D-did you have nothing smaller? Like a gadget or a Quirk enhancer?
5-male_removing_major,filter:shy,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=shy,Phew. I can see I’m not the only one here who’s not thrilled by the prospect of this game…
5-male_removing_major,filter:shy,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=heroic,Don’t worry, ~name~, I know I seem pretty brave, but I’m also really freaked out right now.
5-male_removing_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=embarrassed,H-heh. I’m kind of… Jeez, do I really sound like that when…?
5-male_removing_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=embarrassed,E-eh. Heh-heh… D-don’t worry ~name~, look how well I’m holding up, and I-I-

5-male_removing_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_1b,notSaidMarker:enf_2a,marker:enf_2a=nauseous,HA. HA. YEP. YEP YEP YEP. THIS SURE ISN’T EMOTIONALLY TAXING ON GIRLS LIKE US.
5-male_removing_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=shy,I-I was doing pretty okay until ~name~ needed to take off her ~clothing~.

5-male_removing_major,filter:villain,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=heroic,Take that, ~name~!
5-male_removing_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=vexed,~name~, did you help set this up? Were you the bait to lure heroes into some sort of trap?
5-male_removing_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=heroic,I-I can’t tell if I’m supposed to stop you from losing, or if making you lose will make your trap backfire! ~name~, your villainy stops here! Or something cool like that!
5-male_removing_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_1b,notSaidMarker:enf_2a,marker:enf_2a=serious,I’m pretty sure I can legally just Zero Gravity you to the ceiling…
5-male_removing_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_1b,notSaidMarker:enf_2a,marker:enf_2a=vexed,I should just use my Quirk to remove you from the game.
5-male_removing_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=embarrassed,I-I feel like I’m way more embarrassed about this than ~name~.
5-male_removing_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=embarrassed,Do… Do you just not feel ashamed for this, ~name~?
5-male_removing_major,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=shy,I-I’ll just stare elsewhere. Oh gosh, my face is just getting so red, isn’t it?
5-male_removing_major,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=embarrassed,I-I-I’m just going to look away now.
5-male_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=interested,A-a-ah, do you have to?
5-male_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=shy,I-is he going to--? His ~clothing~?

5-male_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_4b,notSaidMarker:enf_5a,marker:enf_5a=embarrassed,It’s fine. ~name~ is just taking off her clothing that’ll show off large portions of his skin.
5-male_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_4b,notSaidMarker:enf_5a,marker:enf_5a=nauseous,E-erk.
5-male_removed_major=gravity,Well... our score seems about even, so I suppose that's a good thing!
5-male_removed_major=heroic,I think you're finding it a lot more encouraging when I remark how far much I've lost too, so I'll keep doing that, ~name~!
5-male_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=gravity,I kind of do it better when I’m either focused or stressed. Funny how that works, right?
5-male_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=gravity,Er… I don’t suppose you’re shy about it and it’s not something I’m supposed to talk about?
5-male_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=heroic,I’m so jealous of your Quirk, ~name~! It must be great to just… Lift off...

5-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=nauseous,Your ~clothing~?! That's supposed to cover a lot, so now you’re showing a lot, and so now I’m <i>embarrassed</i> a lot!

5-female_removing_major,filter:flies,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=interested,Hm… How high can you go, ~name~? I-I mean, if you fly or hover?
5-female_removing_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=shy,Zero Gravity doesn’t actually let me fly…
5-female_removing_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=shy,I-I think if I were a bit more… Um. You know... I could use my Quirk to gracefully slip out of my clothes…
5-female_removing_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_1b,notSaidMarker:enf_2a,marker:enf_2a=interested,O-oh.
5-female_removing_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_1b,notSaidMarker:enf_2a,marker:enf_2a=nauseous,Gah, this feels so weird, watching you take off your ~clothing~ and er…
5-female_removing_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=interested,Ack, your ~clothing~?
5-female_removing_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=embarrassed,W-well. It c-c-could be more awkward, couldn’t it?
5-female_removing_major,filter:hero,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=nauseous,S-shoot. Don’t worry, ~name~! I know when to step in as part of a hero team! I’ve got the next one! I-I think.
5-female_removing_major,filter:hero,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=heroic,O-oh no, ~name~! Don’t let your costume get too battle-damaged!
5-female_removing_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=embarrassed,~name~ is up? Just… Act like we’re changing between missions!
5-female_removing_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=heroic,~name~ l-l-lost? Argh, I’d offer to assist but that’s less… Mission-oriented…
5-female_removing_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_1b,notSaidMarker:enf_2a,marker:enf_2a=embarrassed,A-are you serious? We’re heroes, ~name~! We need to be better than this!
5-female_removing_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_1b,notSaidMarker:enf_2a,marker:enf_2a=embarrassed,I’m just going to look away. That’s pretty much all I can do, right?
5-female_removing_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=embarrassed,Y-yikes. At least it’s not something… More revealing. T-though I’m not sure what else could be…
5-female_removing_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=embarrassed,Your ~clothing~? D-did you have nothing smaller? Like a gadget or a Quirk enhancer?
5-female_removing_major,filter:shy,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=shy,Phew. I can see I’m not the only one here who’s not thrilled by the prospect of this game…
5-female_removing_major,filter:shy,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=heroic,Don’t worry, ~name~, I know I seem pretty brave, but I’m also really freaked out right now.
5-female_removing_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=embarrassed,H-heh. I’m kind of… Jeez, do I really sound like that when…?
5-female_removing_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=embarrassed,E-eh. Heh-heh… D-don’t worry ~name~, look how well I’m holding up, and I-I-

5-female_removing_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_1b,notSaidMarker:enf_2a,marker:enf_2a=nauseous,HA. HA. YEP. YEP YEP YEP. THIS SURE ISN’T EMOTIONALLY TAXING ON PEOPLE LIKE US.
5-female_removing_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=shy,I-I was doing pretty okay until ~name~ needed to take off her ~clothing~... Really! I was!
5-female_removing_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=shy,S-she’s just as embarrassed as I am…
5-female_removing_major,filter:villain,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=heroic,Serves you right, ~name~!
5-female_removing_major,filter:villain,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=heroic,Take that, ~name~!
5-female_removing_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=vexed,~name~, did you help set this up? Were you the bait to lure heroes into some sort of trap?
5-female_removing_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=heroic,I-I can’t tell if I’m supposed to stop you from losing, or if making you lose will make your trap backfire! ~name~, your villainy stops here! Or something cool like that!
5-female_removing_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_1b,notSaidMarker:enf_2a,marker:enf_2a=serious,I’m pretty sure I can legally just Zero Gravity you to the ceiling…
5-female_removing_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_1b,notSaidMarker:enf_2a,marker:enf_2a=vexed,I should just use my Quirk to remove you from the game.
5-female_removing_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=embarrassed,I-I feel like I’m way more embarrassed about this than ~name~.
5-female_removing_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=embarrassed,Do… Do you just not feel ashamed for this, ~name~?
5-female_removing_major,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=embarrassed,I-I’ll just stare elsewhere. Oh gosh, my face is just getting so red, isn’t it?
5-female_removing_major,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=embarrassed,I-I-I’m just going to look away now.
5-female_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=interested,A-a-ah, do you have to?
5-female_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=interested,D-does she really need to…?

5-female_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=gravity,I feel like I’m really <i>up and down</i> about this kind of thing.

5-female_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_3b,notSaidMarker:enf_4a,marker:enf_4a=nauseous,O-oh. ~name~ is taking off her... That's fine. Totally fine. Yep. Sexy even.
5-female_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_4b,notSaidMarker:enf_5a,marker:enf_5a=embarrassed,It’s fine. ~name~ is just taking off her clothing that’ll show off large portions of her skin.
5-female_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_4b,notSaidMarker:enf_5a=shy,E-erk.
5-female_removing_major,target:aimee,targetStage:0=nauseous,Oh no! Everyone watch out, I’ll try to--
5-female_removing_major,target:d.va,targetStage:3=interested,Most people I know would be gushing about their Quirk by now!
5-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=interested,Hm. I guess you’re a hero then!
5-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:3=interested,I was just looking at your costume. It’s actually not super complicated at all, is it? It’s just flexible material with a bit of rip-stoppage. It even looks kinda dirty and worn-out… And some of the patterning is definitely...
5-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1=embarrassed,O-oh no! You weren't wearing anything under that, were you, Marinette!?
5-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Y-you’re so comfortable with this! B-but there’s so many people and it’s not like we’re changing into something else--!
5-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=happy,O-oh! We call it training gear too. Back when I was in school, we did have a full gym outfit, at least.
5-female_removing_major,target:navi,targetStage:0=vexed,OK--OK!! No need to do a flash on us!
5-female_removing_major,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess,marker:enf_2a=nauseous,U-um! Dealer, anyone else, should-- how-- we should stop this, right!?
5-female_removing_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:0,marker:enf_0a=interested,Um... I'm guessing it's something with... balloons? Parties?
5-female_removing_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:1,marker:enf_1a=embarrassed,Um... not that taking off your clothes... gets the party started.

5-female_removing_major,target:wiifitfemale=shy,I don’t really know many people in that good of shape that aren’t Pro Heroes.
5-female_removing_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:1=heroic,“Wii Fit!” You <i>do</i> have some sort of training boosting power. And you’re so gentle about how you speak.
5-female_removing_major,target:zone-tan=nauseous,(It's so... so hard to even look away from her...)
5-female_removed_major=heroic,Even without your ~clothing~, you have to keep fighting!
5-female_removed_major=heroic,Phew. This has been kind of a fun bonding experience, at least.
5-female_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=gravity,I kind of do it better when I’m either focused or stressed. Funny how that works, right?
5-female_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=gravity,Er… I don’t suppose you’re shy about it and it’s not something I’m supposed to talk about?

5-female_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=shy,I sure hope not. Because that makes me k-kind of an idiot.

5-female_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=embarrassed,Mmhmm! This isn’t making me super uncomfortable. Nope. I am A-OK!
5-female_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=calm,Mmf. Yes. I am nodding my head. This is fine. I am not cringing internally.
5-female_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=embarrassed,That's sure ~name~'s ~clothing~ that ~name~’s not wearing anymore. Yep. Mmhmm! What could go wrong!?

5-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=interested,Oh! You have a sharpshooting Quirk! Just… Please be careful!
5-female_removed_major,target:d.va,targetStage:4=vexed,M-maybe you want to gush in other ways, which is why you wore such a tight suit.
5-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2=gravity,I think a villain would be a lot more sinister when she took off her mask… Though do you actually have some sort of vocal Quirk? I’ve never heard someone make a sound like that!
5-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:4=shy,Just sewn back together to vaguely resemble webs… W-w-what? N-no! I was just looking at your equipment! I wasn’t--
5-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,marker:enf_1b=interested,Whoa! So that suit <i>was</i> part of your Quirk? That's so cool! But. Um. What else does it do?
5-female_removed_major,target:navi,targetStage:1=shy,Um... I guess it wasn't like Tooru's... She flashes us a lot.
5-female_removed_major,target:nayru,targetStage:5,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=interested,Is... is she okay? Nayru...?
5-female_removed_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:1,marker:enf_0b=shy,Yo-you're certainly well endowed! Um! Upbeat! With personality!
5-female_removed_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:2,marker:enf_1b=gravity,Hm. You are a--a mystery, Pinkie Pie. I'm certainly feeling more at ease with all of this!
5-female_removed_major,target:remilia,targetStage:4=vexed,It seems like you could be using your powers for a lot more... and now you're having wine?
5-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity=heroic,Hmm… Well, if Futaba’s going to use her code name, and she’ll refer to me as Uravity the whole time, I guess we need to give Saki a hero name…?
5-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=heroic,This sounds like a <i>great</i> day! Come on, Saki, are you in or what?
5-female_removed_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:1=embarrassed,But do you have some sort of synergy power? And... e-err... you look really sweaty... like <i>really</i> sweaty.
5-female_removed_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:2=shy,I bet your services are really something else! Though maybe you shouldn’t book yourself so often you show up to a game like this still sweating… Or maybe you’ve learned how to make the best of a sweating Quirk, considering you looked so dry earlier…
5-female_removed_major,target:zone-tan,targetStage:2,marker:enf_1a=vexed,C-can the management make her turn off her Quirk? Please?

6-male_removing_major=interested,Well, at least your ~clothing~ is something big.
6-male_removing_major=heroic,~name~'s ~clothing~ seemed comfortable...
6-male_removing_major,filter:flies,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=interested,S-so, ~name~, you can float too, right?
6-male_removing_major,filter:flies,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=interested,Hm… How high can you go, ~name~? I-I mean, if you fly or hover?
6-male_removing_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=shy,Zero Gravity doesn’t actually let me fly…
6-male_removing_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=shy,I-I think if I were a bit more… Um. You know... I could use my Quirk to gracefully slip out of my clothes…
6-male_removing_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_1b,notSaidMarker:enf_2a,marker:enf_2a=interested,S-so you can do that while floating, right? J-just curious.
6-male_removing_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_1b,notSaidMarker:enf_2a,marker:enf_2a=nauseous,Gah, this feels so weird, watching you take off your ~clothing~ and er…
6-male_removing_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=interested,Ack, your ~clothing~? E-even if we can both fly, I-I guess we can tell our clothing apart really easily, right?
6-male_removing_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=embarrassed,W-well. It c-c-could be more awkward, couldn’t it? I-I mean, it's not like we're floating away together.
6-male_removing_major,filter:hero,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=nauseous,S-shoot. Don’t worry, ~name~! I know when to step in as part of a hero team! I’ve got the next one! I-I think.
6-male_removing_major,filter:hero,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=heroic,O-oh no, ~name~! Don’t let your costume get too battle-damaged!
6-male_removing_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=embarrassed,~name~ is up? Just… Act like we’re changing between missions!
6-male_removing_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=heroic,~name~ l-l-lost? Argh, I’d offer to assist but that’s less… Mission-oriented…
6-male_removing_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_1b,notSaidMarker:enf_2a,marker:enf_2a=embarrassed,A-are you serious? We’re heroes, ~name~! We need to be better than this!
6-male_removing_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_1b,notSaidMarker:enf_2a,marker:enf_2a=embarrassed,I’m just going to look away. That’s pretty much all I can do, right?
6-male_removing_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=embarrassed,Y-yikes. At least it’s not something… More revealing. T-though I’m not sure what else could be…
6-male_removing_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=embarrassed,Your ~clothing~? D-did you have nothing smaller? Like a gadget or a Quirk enhancer?
6-male_removing_major,filter:shy,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=shy,Phew. I can see I’m not the only one here who’s not thrilled by the prospect of this game…
6-male_removing_major,filter:shy,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=heroic,Don’t worry, ~name~, I know I seem pretty brave, but I’m also really freaked out right now.
6-male_removing_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=embarrassed,H-heh. I’m kind of… Jeez, do I really sound like that when…?
6-male_removing_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=embarrassed,E-eh. Heh-heh… D-don’t worry ~name~, look how well I’m holding up, and I-I-
6-male_removing_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_1b,notSaidMarker:enf_2a,marker:enf_2a=nauseous,YEP, WE’RE FINE. ~name~. WE’RE FINE.
6-male_removing_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_1b,notSaidMarker:enf_2a,marker:enf_2a=nauseous,HA. HA. YEP. YEP YEP YEP. THIS SURE ISN’T EMOTIONALLY TAXING ON GIRLS LIKE US.
6-male_removing_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=shy,I-I was doing pretty okay until ~name~ needed to take off her ~clothing~.
6-male_removing_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=shy,S-she’s just as embarrassed as I am…
6-male_removing_major,filter:villain,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=heroic,Serves you right, ~name~!
6-male_removing_major,filter:villain,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=heroic,Take that, ~name~!
6-male_removing_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=vexed,~name~, did you help set this up? Were you the bait to lure heroes into some sort of trap?
6-male_removing_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=heroic,I-I can’t tell if I’m supposed to stop you from losing, or if making you lose will make your trap backfire! ~name~, your villainy stops here! Or something cool like that!
6-male_removing_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_1b,notSaidMarker:enf_2a,marker:enf_2a=serious,I’m pretty sure I can legally just Zero Gravity you to the ceiling…
6-male_removing_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_1b,notSaidMarker:enf_2a,marker:enf_2a=vexed,I should just use my Quirk to remove you from the game.
6-male_removing_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=embarrassed,I-I feel like I’m way more embarrassed about this than ~name~.
6-male_removing_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=embarrassed,Do… Do you just not feel ashamed for this, ~name~?
6-male_removing_major,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=shy,I-I’ll just stare elsewhere. Oh gosh, my face is just getting so red, isn’t it?
6-male_removing_major,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=embarrassed,I-I-I’m just going to look away now.
6-male_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=interested,A-a-ah, do you have to?
6-male_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=shy,I-is he going to--? His ~clothing~?
6-male_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=interested,D-does he really need to…?
6-male_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=embarrassed,A-are you sure, ~name~?
6-male_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_1b,notSaidMarker:enf_2a,marker:enf_2a=vexed,Hmmf!
6-male_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_1b,notSaidMarker:enf_2a,marker:enf_2a=vexed,Hrm. Mmf? Mmhmm.
6-male_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=gravity,I-I-I-
6-male_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=gravity,I feel like I’m really <i>up and down</i> about this kind of thing.
6-male_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_3b,notSaidMarker:enf_4a,marker:enf_4a=shy,D-d-do y-you have something else you could... take off... ~name~?
6-male_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_3b,notSaidMarker:enf_4a,marker:enf_4a=embarrassed,O-oh. ~name~ is taking off his... That's fine. Totally fine. Yep. Sexy even.
6-male_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_4b,notSaidMarker:enf_5a,marker:enf_5a=embarrassed,It’s fine. ~name~ is just taking off her clothing that’ll show off large portions of his skin.
6-male_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_4b,notSaidMarker:enf_5a,marker:enf_5a=nauseous,E-erk.
6-male_removed_major=embarrassed,Um. I'm kind of shy, but I think it helps me a lot to see you take stuff off, ~name~.
6-male_removed_major=happy,It's helping me be a lot more comfortable as you strip your big stuff, ~name~!
6-male_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=gravity,I kind of do it better when I’m either focused or stressed. Funny how that works, right?
6-male_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=gravity,Er… I don’t suppose you’re shy about it and it’s not something I’m supposed to talk about?
6-male_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=heroic,I’m so jealous of your Quirk, ~name~! It must be great to just… Lift off...
6-male_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=embarrassed,I-I kind of think about it every now and then
6-male_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=gravity,It k-kinda makes you just want to float away, right?
6-male_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=embarrassed,I think I just have a lot of sympathy for you doing that, and it’s making me think of me doing it and I’m just kind of allovertheplace andokayIreallyshouldstop.
6-male_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=interested,A-at least you’ve got a neat Quirk, ~name~ !
6-male_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=heroic,Er… At least we have a unique Quirk in common, huh?
6-male_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=vexed,E-er… Sorry ~name~, I can stick around for the rest of the game but this is way harder for me than putting a stop to some villains.
6-male_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=gravity,Er… You’d be surprised at how often costumes seem to get torn in embarrassing ways. T-that’s why I always wear a bra! And underwear!
6-male_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=interested,Not that I’d have had any reason to have done that before. You know what, nevermind.
6-male_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=nauseous,Changing between missions in a co-ed environment where undressing is a penalty. Nope, not frightening at all.
6-male_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=shy,We’ve both got to be pretty embarrassed now, don’t we, ~name~? Do you think we’ll get a bad evaluation from HQ for losing?
6-male_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=shy,I-I’d rather not think too much about how this reflects on us.
6-male_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=shy,I-I think it’s great that you’re going through with it. Yep. Very heroic. No problems here. With your ~clothing~ and various smaller bits on the floor.
6-male_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b=shy,I’m sorry ~name~, I thought this’d be easier with another hero but… Um. It’s still quite embarrassing...
6-male_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=heroic,Y-you still look good without your ~clothing~! Don’t give up yet, ~name~!
6-male_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=embarrassed,E-erm. I wonder if embarrassment is contagious…
6-male_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=heroic,I know you’re embarrassed, ~name~, but we can’t just be ashamed for no reason!
6-male_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=heroic,I’ve got your back, ~name~, as someone else who can be… Um. Fairly traditional about nudity.
6-male_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=vexed,THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT GOING TO BE AN EXPERIENCE WE LOOK BACK ON IN THE YEARS TO COME AND SPONTANEOUSLY BREAK OUT IN A COLD SWEAT AND BLUSH.
6-male_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=vexed,LET’S JUST FOCUS ON GETTING OUT OF HERE TONIGHT SO WE CAN GO BACK TO OUR HOMES AND HAVE A LONG, COLD SHOWER TO CALM OUR NERVES AND THINK ABOUT WHAT WE DID TO DESERVE THIS.
6-male_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=heroic,S-shoot. Don’t worry, ~name~! I’m a Pro Hero. Even if I’m a little… I’m still here to support you!
6-male_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=serious,I-I won’t be a coward. Don’t worry ~name~! I’m embarrassed too, but we’ll be okay!
6-male_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=vexed,Um. Sorry, I just get kind of… Hero-y.
6-male_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=embarrassed,T-that was a strange outburst from me! I’m s-sorry, ~name~! W-wait! Why should I be sorry! You’re a villain!
6-male_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=shy,I sure hope not. Because that makes me k-kind of an idiot.
6-male_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=embarrassed,W-well! It sure didn’t work! I wanted to come to this of my own free will-- N-no wait, I didn’t mean!
6-male_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=gravity,That way, this… Weirdness can stop.
6-male_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=gravity,G-given that you’re… Think, Ochako! Think how to stop this villain!
6-male_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=shy,I-is that just a villain thing? I don’t think so, but I’d say my friends are more confident rather than shameless like you.
6-male_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=vexed,I-I’d really rather you just surrender than have us keep going, ~name~.
6-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=nauseous,I can’t believe you took off your ~clothing~, ~name~! <i>I’m</i> embarrassed just thinking about it!
6-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=gravity,Um. S-sorry, I just got distracted. By a villain. And not your ~clothing~ being on the floor.
6-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=nauseous,Your ~clothing~?! That's supposed to cover a lot, so now you’re showing a lot, and so now I’m <i>embarrassed</i> a lot!
6-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=embarrassed,Mmhmm! This isn’t making me super uncomfortable. Nope. I am A-OK!
6-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=calm,Mmf. Yes. I am nodding my head. This is fine. I am not cringing internally.
6-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=embarrassed,Those sure are some ~clothing~ that ~name~’s not wearing anymore. Yep. Mmhmm! What could go wrong!?
6-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=embarrassed,Mhmmf! Yep! Those sure are ~name~’s ~clothing~ on the floor and not on his body.
6-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=embarrassed,I’m really coming around to appreciate the <i>gravity</i> of the situation.
6-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=embarrassed,<i>Meep!</i>
6-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_4a,notSaidMarker:enf_4b,marker:enf_4b=embarrassed,T-that’s f-fine. M-mmf. I-I’ll just… hnmf.
6-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_4a,notSaidMarker:enf_4b,marker:enf_4b=shy,E-er. That's great! ~name~! G-great! N-not at all embarrassing for us. N-nope! S-so great!
6-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_5a,notSaidMarker:enf_5b,marker:enf_5b=serious,That’s what this game is about. I’m not screaming on the inside. Not me! <i>Not at all.</i> I-I’ll put up a brave face for the rest of this, at least.
6-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_5a,notSaidMarker:enf_5b,marker:enf_5b=heroic,Yeah! Take more off! Definitely don't win and keep your major articles on! No! Definitely for real take them off. I'm great! Really!
6-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:4=shy,I give up. You’re clearly playing this game a little differently than the rest, but you don’t seem too bothered by getting naked… S-so, Well, best of luck, 9S! Keep at it!
6-female_removing_major=vexed,If it makes you feel better, ~name~, at least you aren't quite as naked as me!
6-female_removing_major=embarrassed,It's really not so bad, ~name~! You can do it!
6-female_removing_major,filter:flies,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=interested,S-so, ~name~, you can float too, right?
6-female_removing_major,filter:flies,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=interested,Hm… How high can you go, ~name~? I-I mean, if you fly or hover?
6-female_removing_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=shy,Zero Gravity doesn’t actually let me fly…
6-female_removing_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=shy,I-I think if I were a bit more… Um. You know... I could use my Quirk to gracefully slip out of my clothes…
6-female_removing_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_1b,notSaidMarker:enf_2a,marker:enf_2a=interested,O-oh.
6-female_removing_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_1b,notSaidMarker:enf_2a,marker:enf_2a=nauseous,Gah, this feels so weird, watching you take off your ~clothing~ and er…
6-female_removing_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=interested,Ack, your ~clothing~?
6-female_removing_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=embarrassed,W-well. It c-c-could be more awkward, couldn’t it?
6-female_removing_major,filter:hero,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=nauseous,S-shoot. Don’t worry, ~name~! I know when to step in as part of a hero team! I’ve got the next one! I-I think.
6-female_removing_major,filter:hero,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=heroic,O-oh no, ~name~! Don’t let your costume get too battle-damaged!
6-female_removing_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=embarrassed,~name~ is up? Just… Act like we’re changing between missions!
6-female_removing_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=heroic,~name~ l-l-lost? Argh, I’d offer to assist but that’s less… Mission-oriented…
6-female_removing_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_1b,notSaidMarker:enf_2a,marker:enf_2a=embarrassed,A-are you serious? We’re heroes, ~name~! We need to be better than this!
6-female_removing_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_1b,notSaidMarker:enf_2a,marker:enf_2a=embarrassed,I’m just going to look away. That’s pretty much all I can do, right?
6-female_removing_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=embarrassed,Y-yikes. At least it’s not something… More revealing. T-though I’m not sure what else could be…
6-female_removing_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=embarrassed,Your ~clothing~? D-did you have nothing smaller? Like a gadget or a Quirk enhancer?
6-female_removing_major,filter:shy,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=shy,Phew. I can see I’m not the only one here who’s not thrilled by the prospect of this game…
6-female_removing_major,filter:shy,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=heroic,Don’t worry, ~name~, I know I seem pretty brave, but I’m also really freaked out right now.
6-female_removing_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=embarrassed,H-heh. I’m kind of… Jeez, do I really sound like that when…?
6-female_removing_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=embarrassed,E-eh. Heh-heh… D-don’t worry ~name~, look how well I’m holding up, and I-I-
6-female_removing_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_1b,notSaidMarker:enf_2a,marker:enf_2a=nauseous,YEP, WE’RE FINE. ~name~. WE’RE FINE.
6-female_removing_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_1b,notSaidMarker:enf_2a,marker:enf_2a=nauseous,HA. HA. YEP. YEP YEP YEP. THIS SURE ISN’T EMOTIONALLY TAXING ON PEOPLE LIKE US.
6-female_removing_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=shy,I-I was doing pretty okay until ~name~ needed to take off her ~clothing~... Really! I was!
6-female_removing_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=shy,S-she’s just as embarrassed as I am…
6-female_removing_major,filter:villain,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=heroic,Serves you right, ~name~!
6-female_removing_major,filter:villain,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=heroic,Take that, ~name~!
6-female_removing_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=vexed,~name~, did you help set this up? Were you the bait to lure heroes into some sort of trap?
6-female_removing_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=heroic,I-I can’t tell if I’m supposed to stop you from losing, or if making you lose will make your trap backfire! ~name~, your villainy stops here! Or something cool like that!
6-female_removing_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_1b,notSaidMarker:enf_2a,marker:enf_2a=serious,I’m pretty sure I can legally just Zero Gravity you to the ceiling…
6-female_removing_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_1b,notSaidMarker:enf_2a,marker:enf_2a=vexed,I should just use my Quirk to remove you from the game.
6-female_removing_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=embarrassed,I-I feel like I’m way more embarrassed about this than ~name~.
6-female_removing_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=embarrassed,Do… Do you just not feel ashamed for this, ~name~?
6-female_removing_major,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=embarrassed,I-I’ll just stare elsewhere. Oh gosh, my face is just getting so red, isn’t it?
6-female_removing_major,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=embarrassed,I-I-I’m just going to look away now.
6-female_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=interested,A-a-ah, do you have to?
6-female_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=interested,D-does she really need to…?
6-female_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_1b,notSaidMarker:enf_2a,marker:enf_2a=vexed,Hmmf!
6-female_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_1b,notSaidMarker:enf_2a,marker:enf_2a=vexed,Hrm. Mmf? Mmhmm.
6-female_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=gravity,I-I-I-
6-female_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=gravity,I feel like I’m really <i>up and down</i> about this kind of thing.
6-female_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_3b,notSaidMarker:enf_4a,marker:enf_4a=interested,D-d-do y-you have something else you could... Take off... ~name~?
6-female_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_3b,notSaidMarker:enf_4a,marker:enf_4a=nauseous,O-oh. ~name~ is taking off her... That's fine. Totally fine. Yep. Sexy even.
6-female_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_4b,notSaidMarker:enf_5a,marker:enf_5a=embarrassed,It’s fine. ~name~ is just taking off her clothing that’ll show off large portions of her skin.
6-female_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_4b,notSaidMarker:enf_5a=shy,E-erk.
6-female_removing_major,target:aimee,targetStage:0=nauseous,Oh no! Everyone watch out, I’ll try to--
6-female_removing_major,target:d.va,targetStage:3=interested,Most people I know would be gushing about their Quirk by now!
6-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=interested,Hm. I guess you’re a hero then!
6-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:3=interested,I was just looking at your costume. It’s actually not super complicated at all, is it? It’s just flexible material with a bit of rip-stoppage. It even looks kinda dirty and worn-out… And some of the patterning is definitely...
6-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1=embarrassed,O-oh no! You weren't wearing anything under that, were you, Marinette!?
6-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Y-you’re so comfortable with this! B-but there’s so many people and it’s not like we’re changing into something else--!
6-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=happy,O-oh! We call it training gear too. Back when I was in school, we did have a full gym outfit, at least.
6-female_removing_major,target:navi,targetStage:0=vexed,OK--OK!! No need to do a flash on us!
6-female_removing_major,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess,marker:enf_2a=nauseous,U-um! Dealer, anyone else, should-- how-- we should stop this, right!?
6-female_removing_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:0,marker:enf_0a=interested,Um... I'm guessing it's something with... balloons? Parties?
6-female_removing_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:1,marker:enf_1a=embarrassed,Um... not that taking off your clothes... gets the party started.
6-female_removing_major,target:saki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity=interested,Oh! I’m not a heavy drinker, but you both seem… not built for that either, so this could be fun!
6-female_removing_major,target:saki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=happy,Oh! That’s not a bad idea, Marinette.
6-female_removing_major,target:saki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=happy,Oh! I actually really like that! Food, relaxation, and laughter!
6-female_removing_major,target:wiifitfemale=shy,I don’t really know many people in that good of shape that aren’t Pro Heroes.
6-female_removing_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:1=heroic,“Wii Fit!” You <i>do</i> have some sort of training boosting power. And you’re so gentle about how you speak.
6-female_removing_major,target:zone-tan=nauseous,(It's so... so hard to even look away from her...)
6-female_removed_major=shy,I-I kind of wish I’d just taken mine off like that instead of making a big deal out of it…
6-female_removed_major=happy,It makes me feel a bit better knowing that even if I'm kind of embarrassed, at least everyone else gets a bit more time to build up their courage.
6-female_removed_major=calm,I know it's all a bit... awkward, but at least we can be dignified in our defeats. It's not like anyone's going to get hurt or die.
6-female_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=gravity,I kind of do it better when I’m either focused or stressed. Funny how that works, right?
6-female_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=gravity,Er… I don’t suppose you’re shy about it and it’s not something I’m supposed to talk about?
6-female_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=heroic,I’m so jealous of your Quirk, ~name~! It must be great to just… Lift off...
6-female_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=embarrassed,I-I kind of think about it every now and then
6-female_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=gravity,It k-kinda makes you just want to float away, right?
6-female_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=embarrassed,I think I just have a lot of sympathy for you doing that, and it’s making me think of me doing it and I’m just kind of allovertheplace andokayIreallyshouldstop.
6-female_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=interested,A-at least you’ve got a neat Quirk, ~name~ ! The-the floating, I mean.
6-female_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=heroic,Er… At least we have a unique Quirk in common, huh? Our flying, I mean.
6-female_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=vexed,E-er… Sorry ~name~, I can stick around for the rest of the game but this is way harder for me than putting a stop to some villains.
6-female_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=gravity,Er… You’d be surprised at how often costumes seem to get torn in embarrassing ways. T-that’s why I always wear a bra! And underwear!
6-female_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=interested,Not that I’d have had any reason to have done that before. You know what, nevermind.
6-female_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=nauseous,Changing between missions in a co-ed environment where undressing is a penalty. Nope, not frightening at all.
6-female_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=shy,We’ve both got to be pretty embarrassed now, don’t we, ~name~? Do you think we’ll get a bad evaluation from HQ for losing?
6-female_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=shy,I-I’d rather not think too much about how this reflects on us.
6-female_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=shy,I-I think it’s great that you’re going through with it. Yep. Very heroic. No problems here. With your ~clothing~ and various smaller bits on the floor.
6-female_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=shy,I’m sorry ~name~, I thought this’d be easier with another hero but… Um. It’s still quite embarrassing...
6-female_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=heroic,Y-you still look good without your ~clothing~! Don’t give up yet, ~name~!
6-female_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=embarrassed,E-erm. I wonder if embarrassment is contagious…
6-female_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=heroic,I know you’re embarrassed, ~name~, but we can’t just be ashamed for no reason!
6-female_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=heroic,I’ve got your back, ~name~, as someone else who can be… Um. Fairly traditional about nudity.
6-female_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=vexed,THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT GOING TO BE AN EXPERIENCE WE LOOK BACK ON IN THE YEARS TO COME AND SPONTANEOUSLY BREAK OUT IN A COLD SWEAT AND BLUSH.
6-female_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=vexed,LET’S JUST FOCUS ON GETTING OUT OF HERE TONIGHT SO WE CAN GO BACK TO OUR HOMES AND HAVE A LONG, COLD SHOWER TO CALM OUR NERVES AND THINK ABOUT WHAT WE DID TO DESERVE THIS.
6-female_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=heroic,S-shoot. Don’t worry, ~name~! I’m a Pro Hero. Even if I’m a little… I’m still here to support you!
6-female_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=serious,I-I won’t be a coward. Don’t worry ~name~! I’m embarrassed too, but we’ll be okay!
6-female_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=vexed,Um. Sorry, I just get kind of… Hero-y.
6-female_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=embarrassed,T-that was a strange outburst from me! I’m s-sorry, ~name~! W-wait! Why should I be sorry! You’re a villain!
6-female_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=shy,I sure hope not. Because that makes me k-kind of an idiot.
6-female_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=embarrassed,W-well! It sure didn’t work! I wanted to come to this of my own free will-- N-no wait, I didn’t mean!
6-female_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=gravity,That way, this… Weirdness can stop.
6-female_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=gravity,G-given that you’re… Think, Ochako! Think how to stop this villain!
6-female_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=shy,I-is that just a villain thing? I don’t think so, but I’d say my friends are more confident rather than shameless like you.
6-female_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=vexed,I-I’d really rather you just surrender than have us keep going, ~name~.
6-female_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=nauseous,I can’t believe you took off your ~clothing~, ~name~! <i>I’m</i> embarrassed just thinking about it!
6-female_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=nauseous,Your ~clothing~? That's supposed to cover a lot, so now you’re showing a lot, and so now I’m <i>embarrassed</i> a lot!
6-female_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=embarrassed,Mmhmm! This isn’t making me super uncomfortable. Nope. I am A-OK!
6-female_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=calm,Mmf. Yes. I am nodding my head. This is fine. I am not cringing internally.
6-female_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=embarrassed,That's sure ~name~'s ~clothing~ that ~name~’s not wearing anymore. Yep. Mmhmm! What could go wrong!?
6-female_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=embarrassed,Mhmmf! Yep! Those sure are ~name~’s ~clothing~ on the floor and not on her body.
6-female_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=vexed,That's sure ~name~'s ~clothing~ that ~name~’s not wearing anymore. Yep. See, my grammar is exacting. This means I am calm and collected!
6-female_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=embarrassed,I’m really coming around to appreciate the <i>gravity</i> of the situation.
6-female_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=embarrassed,<i>Meep!</i>
6-female_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_4a,notSaidMarker:enf_4b,marker:enf_4b=embarrassed,T-that’s f-fine. M-mmf. I-I’ll just… Hnmf.
6-female_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_5a,notSaidMarker:enf_5b,marker:enf_5b=serious,That’s what this game is about. I’m not screaming on the inside. Not me! <i>Not at all.</i> I-I’ll put up a brave face for the rest of this, at least.
6-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=interested,Oh! You have a sharpshooting Quirk! Just… Please be careful!
6-female_removed_major,target:d.va,targetStage:4=vexed,M-maybe you want to gush in other ways, which is why you wore such a tight suit.
6-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2=gravity,I think a villain would be a lot more sinister when she took off her mask… Though do you actually have some sort of vocal Quirk? I’ve never heard someone make a sound like that!
6-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:4=shy,Just sewn back together to vaguely resemble webs… W-w-what? N-no! I was just looking at your equipment! I wasn’t--
6-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,marker:enf_1b=interested,Whoa! So that suit <i>was</i> part of your Quirk? That's so cool! But. Um. What else does it do?
6-female_removed_major,target:navi,targetStage:1=shy,Um... I guess it wasn't like Tooru's... She flashes us a lot.
6-female_removed_major,target:nayru,targetStage:5,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=interested,Is... is she okay? Nayru...?
6-female_removed_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:1,marker:enf_0b=shy,Yo-you're certainly well endowed! Um! Upbeat! With personality!
6-female_removed_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:2,marker:enf_1b=gravity,Hm. You are a--a mystery, Pinkie Pie. I'm certainly feeling more at ease with all of this!
6-female_removed_major,target:remilia,targetStage:4=vexed,It seems like you could be using your powers for a lot more... and now you're having wine?
6-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity=heroic,Hmm… Well, if Futaba’s going to use her code name, and she’ll refer to me as Uravity the whole time, I guess we need to give Saki a hero name…?
6-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=heroic,This sounds like a <i>great</i> day! Come on, Saki, are you in or what?
6-female_removed_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:1=embarrassed,But do you have some sort of synergy power? And... e-err... you look really sweaty... like <i>really</i> sweaty.
6-female_removed_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:2=shy,I bet your services are really something else! Though maybe you shouldn’t book yourself so often you show up to a game like this still sweating… Or maybe you’ve learned how to make the best of a sweating Quirk, considering you looked so dry earlier…
6-female_removed_major,target:zone-tan,targetStage:2,marker:enf_1a=vexed,C-can the management make her turn off her Quirk? Please?

-3-male_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_3b,notSaidMarker:enf_4a,marker:enf_4a=embarrassed,O-oh. ~name~ is taking off his... That's fine. Totally fine. Yep. Sexy even.
-3-male_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_4b,notSaidMarker:enf_5a,marker:enf_5a=embarrassed,It’s fine. ~name~ is just taking off her clothing that’ll show off large portions of his skin.
-3-male_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_4b,notSaidMarker:enf_5a,marker:enf_5a=nauseous,E-erk.
-3-male_removed_major=gravity,Care to join me, ~name~?
-3-male_removed_major=happy,If you're not embarrassed, and took off more, I think it'd help me stay focused, ~name~!
-3-male_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=gravity,I kind of do it better when I’m either focused or stressed. Funny how that works, right?
-3-male_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=gravity,Er… I don’t suppose you’re shy about it and it’s not something I’m supposed to talk about?
-3-male_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=heroic,I’m so jealous of your Quirk, ~name~! It must be great to just… Lift off...
-3-male_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=embarrassed,I-I kind of think about it every now and then
-3-male_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=gravity,It k-kinda makes you just want to float away, right?
-3-male_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=embarrassed,I think I just have a lot of sympathy for you doing that, and it’s making me think of me doing it and I’m just kind of allovertheplace andokayIreallyshouldstop.
-3-male_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=interested,A-at least you’ve got a neat Quirk, ~name~ !
-3-male_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=heroic,Er… At least we have a unique Quirk in common, huh?
-3-male_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=vexed,E-er… Sorry ~name~, I can stick around for the rest of the game but this is way harder for me than putting a stop to some villains.
-3-male_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=gravity,Er… You’d be surprised at how often costumes seem to get torn in embarrassing ways. T-that’s why I always wear a bra! And underwear!
-3-male_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=interested,Not that I’d have had any reason to have done that before. You know what, nevermind.
-3-male_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=nauseous,Changing between missions in a co-ed environment where undressing is a penalty. Nope, not frightening at all.
-3-male_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=shy,We’ve both got to be pretty embarrassed now, don’t we, ~name~? Do you think we’ll get a bad evaluation from HQ for losing?
-3-male_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=shy,I-I’d rather not think too much about how this reflects on us.
-3-male_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=shy,I-I think it’s great that you’re going through with it. Yep. Very heroic. No problems here. With your ~clothing~ and various smaller bits on the floor.
-3-male_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b=shy,I’m sorry ~name~, I thought this’d be easier with another hero but… Um. It’s still quite embarrassing...
-3-male_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=heroic,Y-you still look good without your ~clothing~! Don’t give up yet, ~name~!
-3-male_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=embarrassed,E-erm. I wonder if embarrassment is contagious…
-3-male_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=heroic,I know you’re embarrassed, ~name~, but we can’t just be ashamed for no reason!
-3-male_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=heroic,I’ve got your back, ~name~, as someone else who can be… Um. Fairly traditional about nudity.
-3-male_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=vexed,THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT GOING TO BE AN EXPERIENCE WE LOOK BACK ON IN THE YEARS TO COME AND SPONTANEOUSLY BREAK OUT IN A COLD SWEAT AND BLUSH.
-3-male_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=vexed,LET’S JUST FOCUS ON GETTING OUT OF HERE TONIGHT SO WE CAN GO BACK TO OUR HOMES AND HAVE A LONG, COLD SHOWER TO CALM OUR NERVES AND THINK ABOUT WHAT WE DID TO DESERVE THIS.
-3-male_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=heroic,S-shoot. Don’t worry, ~name~! I’m a Pro Hero. Even if I’m a little… I’m still here to support you!
-3-male_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=serious,I-I won’t be a coward. Don’t worry ~name~! I’m embarrassed too, but we’ll be okay!
-3-male_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=vexed,Um. Sorry, I just get kind of… Hero-y.
-3-male_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=embarrassed,T-that was a strange outburst from me! I’m s-sorry, ~name~! W-wait! Why should I be sorry! You’re a villain!
-3-male_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=shy,I sure hope not. Because that makes me k-kind of an idiot.
-3-male_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=embarrassed,W-well! It sure didn’t work! I wanted to come to this of my own free will-- N-no wait, I didn’t mean!
-3-male_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=gravity,That way, this… Weirdness can stop.
-3-male_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=gravity,G-given that you’re… Think, Ochako! Think how to stop this villain!
-3-male_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=shy,I-is that just a villain thing? I don’t think so, but I’d say my friends are more confident rather than shameless like you.
-3-male_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=vexed,I-I’d really rather you just surrender than have us keep going, ~name~.
-3-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=nauseous,I can’t believe you took off your ~clothing~, ~name~! <i>I’m</i> embarrassed just thinking about it!
-3-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=gravity,Um. S-sorry, I just got distracted. By a villain. And not your ~clothing~ being on the floor.
-3-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=nauseous,Your ~clothing~?! That's supposed to cover a lot, so now you’re showing a lot, and so now I’m <i>embarrassed</i> a lot!
-3-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=embarrassed,Mmhmm! This isn’t making me super uncomfortable. Nope. I am A-OK!
-3-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=calm,Mmf. Yes. I am nodding my head. This is fine. I am not cringing internally.
-3-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=embarrassed,Those sure are some ~clothing~ that ~name~’s not wearing anymore. Yep. Mmhmm! What could go wrong!?
-3-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=embarrassed,Mhmmf! Yep! Those sure are ~name~’s ~clothing~ on the floor and not on his body.
-3-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=embarrassed,I’m really coming around to appreciate the <i>gravity</i> of the situation.
-3-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=embarrassed,<i>Meep!</i>
-3-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_4a,notSaidMarker:enf_4b,marker:enf_4b=embarrassed,T-that’s f-fine. M-mmf. I-I’ll just… hnmf.
-3-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_4a,notSaidMarker:enf_4b,marker:enf_4b=shy,E-er. That's great! ~name~! G-great! N-not at all embarrassing for us. N-nope! S-so great!
-3-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_5a,notSaidMarker:enf_5b,marker:enf_5b=serious,That’s what this game is about. I’m not screaming on the inside. Not me! <i>Not at all.</i> I-I’ll put up a brave face for the rest of this, at least.
-3-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_5a,notSaidMarker:enf_5b,marker:enf_5b=heroic,Yeah! Take more off! Definitely don't win and keep your major articles on! No! Definitely for real take them off. I'm great! Really!
-3-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:4=shy,I give up. You’re clearly playing this game a little differently than the rest, but you don’t seem too bothered by getting naked… S-so, Well, best of luck, 9S! Keep at it!
-3-female_removing_major=embarrassed,Oh, ~name~! It's actually kinda refreshing being naked.
-3-female_removing_major=embarrassed,Hmm... That's a cute ~clothing~, ~name~! I-I guess you'll be happy to get that back after it's over, right?
-3-female_removing_major,filter:flies,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=interested,S-so, ~name~, you can float too, right?
-3-female_removing_major,filter:flies,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=interested,Hm… How high can you go, ~name~? I-I mean, if you fly or hover?
-3-female_removing_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=shy,Zero Gravity doesn’t actually let me fly…
-3-female_removing_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=shy,I-I think if I were a bit more… Um. You know... I could use my Quirk to gracefully slip out of my clothes…
-3-female_removing_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_1b,notSaidMarker:enf_2a,marker:enf_2a=interested,O-oh.
-3-female_removing_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_1b,notSaidMarker:enf_2a,marker:enf_2a=nauseous,Gah, this feels so weird, watching you take off your ~clothing~ and er…
-3-female_removing_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=interested,Ack, your ~clothing~?
-3-female_removing_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=embarrassed,W-well. It c-c-could be more awkward, couldn’t it?
-3-female_removing_major,filter:hero,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=nauseous,S-shoot. Don’t worry, ~name~! I know when to step in as part of a hero team! I’ve got the next one! I-I think.
-3-female_removing_major,filter:hero,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=heroic,O-oh no, ~name~! Don’t let your costume get too battle-damaged!
-3-female_removing_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=embarrassed,~name~ is up? Just… Act like we’re changing between missions!
-3-female_removing_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=heroic,~name~ l-l-lost? Argh, I’d offer to assist but that’s less… Mission-oriented…

-3-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:3=interested,I was just looking at your costume. It’s actually not super complicated at all, is it? It’s just flexible material with a bit of rip-stoppage. It even looks kinda dirty and worn-out… And some of the patterning is definitely...
-3-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1=embarrassed,O-oh no! You weren't wearing anything under that, were you, Marinette!?
-3-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Y-you’re so comfortable with this! B-but there’s so many people and it’s not like we’re changing into something else--!
-3-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=happy,O-oh! We call it training gear too. Back when I was in school, we did have a full gym outfit, at least.

-3-female_removing_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:0,marker:enf_0a=interested,Um... I'm guessing it's something with... balloons? Parties?
-3-female_removing_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:1,marker:enf_1a=embarrassed,Um... not that taking off your clothes... gets the party started.
-3-female_removing_major,target:saki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity=interested,Oh! I’m not a heavy drinker, but you both seem… not built for that either, so this could be fun!

-3-female_removing_major,target:saki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=happy,Oh! I actually really like that! Food, relaxation, and laughter!
-3-female_removing_major,target:wiifitfemale=shy,I don’t really know many people in that good of shape that aren’t Pro Heroes.
-3-female_removing_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:1=heroic,“Wii Fit!” You <i>do</i> have some sort of training boosting power. And you’re so gentle about how you speak.
-3-female_removing_major,target:zone-tan=nauseous,(It's so... so hard to even look away from her...)
-3-female_removed_major=shy,I-I kind of wish I’d just taken mine off like that instead of making a big deal out of it…
-3-female_removed_major=happy,It's maybe not the easiest thing to be naked in front of strangers, but I think the human body and all it's quirks can be pretty special! What's special about yours?
-3-female_removed_major,marker:hotsprings=calm,It's just like a trip to the hotsprings, ~name~.
-3-female_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=gravity,I kind of do it better when I’m either focused or stressed. Funny how that works, right?
-3-female_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=gravity,Er… I don’t suppose you’re shy about it and it’s not something I’m supposed to talk about?
-3-female_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=heroic,I’m so jealous of your Quirk, ~name~! It must be great to just… Lift off...
-3-female_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=embarrassed,I-I kind of think about it every now and then
-3-female_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=gravity,It k-kinda makes you just want to float away, right?
-3-female_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=embarrassed,I think I just have a lot of sympathy for you doing that, and it’s making me think of me doing it and I’m just kind of allovertheplace andokayIreallyshouldstop.
-3-female_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=interested,A-at least you’ve got a neat Quirk, ~name~ ! The-the floating, I mean.
-3-female_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=heroic,Er… At least we have a unique Quirk in common, huh? Our flying, I mean.
-3-female_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=vexed,E-er… Sorry ~name~, I can stick around for the rest of the game but this is way harder for me than putting a stop to some villains.
-3-female_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=gravity,Er… You’d be surprised at how often costumes seem to get torn in embarrassing ways. T-that’s why I always wear a bra! And underwear!
-3-female_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=interested,Not that I’d have had any reason to have done that before. You know what, nevermind.
-3-female_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=nauseous,Changing between missions in a co-ed environment where undressing is a penalty. Nope, not frightening at all.
-3-female_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=shy,We’ve both got to be pretty embarrassed now, don’t we, ~name~? Do you think we’ll get a bad evaluation from HQ for losing?
-3-female_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=shy,I-I’d rather not think too much about how this reflects on us.
-3-female_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=shy,I-I think it’s great that you’re going through with it. Yep. Very heroic. No problems here. With your ~clothing~ and various smaller bits on the floor.
-3-female_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=shy,I’m sorry ~name~, I thought this’d be easier with another hero but… Um. It’s still quite embarrassing...
-3-female_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=heroic,Y-you still look good without your ~clothing~! Don’t give up yet, ~name~!
-3-female_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=embarrassed,E-erm. I wonder if embarrassment is contagious…
-3-female_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=heroic,I know you’re embarrassed, ~name~, but we can’t just be ashamed for no reason!
-3-female_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=heroic,I’ve got your back, ~name~, as someone else who can be… Um. Fairly traditional about nudity.
-3-female_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=vexed,THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT GOING TO BE AN EXPERIENCE WE LOOK BACK ON IN THE YEARS TO COME AND SPONTANEOUSLY BREAK OUT IN A COLD SWEAT AND BLUSH.
-3-female_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=vexed,LET’S JUST FOCUS ON GETTING OUT OF HERE TONIGHT SO WE CAN GO BACK TO OUR HOMES AND HAVE A LONG, COLD SHOWER TO CALM OUR NERVES AND THINK ABOUT WHAT WE DID TO DESERVE THIS.
-3-female_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=heroic,S-shoot. Don’t worry, ~name~! I’m a Pro Hero. Even if I’m a little… I’m still here to support you!
-3-female_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=serious,I-I won’t be a coward. Don’t worry ~name~! I’m embarrassed too, but we’ll be okay!
-3-female_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=vexed,Um. Sorry, I just get kind of… Hero-y.
-3-female_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=embarrassed,T-that was a strange outburst from me! I’m s-sorry, ~name~! W-wait! Why should I be sorry! You’re a villain!
-3-female_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=shy,I sure hope not. Because that makes me k-kind of an idiot.
-3-female_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=embarrassed,W-well! It sure didn’t work! I wanted to come to this of my own free will-- N-no wait, I didn’t mean!
-3-female_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=gravity,That way, this… Weirdness can stop.
-3-female_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=gravity,G-given that you’re… Think, Ochako! Think how to stop this villain!
-3-female_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=shy,I-is that just a villain thing? I don’t think so, but I’d say my friends are more confident rather than shameless like you.
-3-female_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=vexed,I-I’d really rather you just surrender than have us keep going, ~name~.
-3-female_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=nauseous,I can’t believe you took off your ~clothing~, ~name~! <i>I’m</i> embarrassed just thinking about it!
-3-female_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=nauseous,Your ~clothing~? That's supposed to cover a lot, so now you’re showing a lot, and so now I’m <i>embarrassed</i> a lot!
-3-female_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=embarrassed,Mmhmm! This isn’t making me super uncomfortable. Nope. I am A-OK!
-3-female_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=calm,Mmf. Yes. I am nodding my head. This is fine. I am not cringing internally.
-3-female_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=embarrassed,That's sure ~name~'s ~clothing~ that ~name~’s not wearing anymore. Yep. Mmhmm! What could go wrong!?
-3-female_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=embarrassed,Mhmmf! Yep! Those sure are ~name~’s ~clothing~ on the floor and not on her body.
-3-female_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=vexed,That's sure ~name~'s ~clothing~ that ~name~’s not wearing anymore. Yep. See, my grammar is exacting. This means I am calm and collected!
-3-female_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=embarrassed,I’m really coming around to appreciate the <i>gravity</i> of the situation.
-3-female_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=embarrassed,<i>Meep!</i>
-3-female_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_4a,notSaidMarker:enf_4b,marker:enf_4b=embarrassed,T-that’s f-fine. M-mmf. I-I’ll just… Hnmf.
-3-female_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_5a,notSaidMarker:enf_5b,marker:enf_5b=serious,That’s what this game is about. I’m not screaming on the inside. Not me! <i>Not at all.</i> I-I’ll put up a brave face for the rest of this, at least.
-3-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=interested,Oh! You have a sharpshooting Quirk! Just… Please be careful!
-3-female_removed_major,target:d.va,targetStage:4=vexed,M-maybe you want to gush in other ways, which is why you wore such a tight suit.
-3-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2=gravity,I think a villain would be a lot more sinister when she took off her mask… Though do you actually have some sort of vocal Quirk? I’ve never heard someone make a sound like that!
-3-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:4=shy,Just sewn back together to vaguely resemble webs… W-w-what? N-no! I was just looking at your equipment! I wasn’t--
-3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,marker:enf_1b=interested,Whoa! So that suit <i>was</i> part of your Quirk? That's so cool! But. Um. What else does it do?
-3-female_removed_major,target:navi,targetStage:1=shy,Um... I guess it wasn't like Tooru's... She flashes us a lot.

-3-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity=heroic,Hmm… Well, if Futaba’s going to use her code name, and she’ll refer to me as Uravity the whole time, I guess we need to give Saki a hero name…?
-3-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=heroic,This sounds like a <i>great</i> day! Come on, Saki, are you in or what?
-3-female_removed_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:1=embarrassed,But do you have some sort of synergy power? And... e-err... you look really sweaty... like <i>really</i> sweaty.
-3-female_removed_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:2=shy,I bet your services are really something else! Though maybe you shouldn’t book yourself so often you show up to a game like this still sweating… Or maybe you’ve learned how to make the best of a sweating Quirk, considering you looked so dry earlier…

-2-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:3=interested,I was just looking at your costume. It’s actually not super complicated at all, is it? It’s just flexible material with a bit of rip-stoppage. It even looks kinda dirty and worn-out… And some of the patterning is definitely...

-1-male_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=gravity,I feel like I’m really <i>up and down</i> about this kind of thing.

-1-male_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_3b,notSaidMarker:enf_4a,marker:enf_4a=embarrassed,O-oh. ~name~ is taking off his... That's fine. Totally fine. Yep. Sexy even.
-1-male_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_4b,notSaidMarker:enf_5a,marker:enf_5a=embarrassed,It’s fine. ~name~ is just taking off her clothing that’ll show off large portions of his skin.
-1-male_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_4b,notSaidMarker:enf_5a,marker:enf_5a=nauseous,E-erk.
-1-male_removed_major=vexed,I wish I could borrow that while I wait for the game to end... Stupid Inventory rules.
-1-male_removed_major=heroic,Hmm. You're playing well, at least, ~name~!
-1-male_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=gravity,I kind of do it better when I’m either focused or stressed. Funny how that works, right?
-1-male_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=gravity,Er… I don’t suppose you’re shy about it and it’s not something I’m supposed to talk about?
-1-male_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=heroic,I’m so jealous of your Quirk, ~name~! It must be great to just… Lift off...
-1-male_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=embarrassed,I-I kind of think about it every now and then
-1-male_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=gravity,It k-kinda makes you just want to float away, right?
-1-male_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=embarrassed,I think I just have a lot of sympathy for you doing that, and it’s making me think of me doing it and I’m just kind of allovertheplace andokayIreallyshouldstop.
-1-male_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=interested,A-at least you’ve got a neat Quirk, ~name~ !
-1-male_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=heroic,Er… At least we have a unique Quirk in common, huh?
-1-male_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=vexed,E-er… Sorry ~name~, I can stick around for the rest of the game but this is way harder for me than putting a stop to some villains.
-1-male_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=gravity,Er… You’d be surprised at how often costumes seem to get torn in embarrassing ways. T-that’s why I always wear a bra! And underwear!
-1-male_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=interested,Not that I’d have had any reason to have done that before. You know what, nevermind.
-1-male_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=nauseous,Changing between missions in a co-ed environment where undressing is a penalty. Nope, not frightening at all.
-1-male_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=shy,We’ve both got to be pretty embarrassed now, don’t we, ~name~? Do you think we’ll get a bad evaluation from HQ for losing?
-1-male_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=shy,I-I’d rather not think too much about how this reflects on us.
-1-male_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=shy,I-I think it’s great that you’re going through with it. Yep. Very heroic. No problems here. With your ~clothing~ and various smaller bits on the floor.
-1-male_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b=shy,I’m sorry ~name~, I thought this’d be easier with another hero but… Um. It’s still quite embarrassing...
-1-male_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=heroic,Y-you still look good without your ~clothing~! Don’t give up yet, ~name~!
-1-male_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=embarrassed,E-erm. I wonder if embarrassment is contagious…
-1-male_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=heroic,I know you’re embarrassed, ~name~, but we can’t just be ashamed for no reason!
-1-male_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=heroic,I’ve got your back, ~name~, as someone else who can be… Um. Fairly traditional about nudity.
-1-male_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=vexed,THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT GOING TO BE AN EXPERIENCE WE LOOK BACK ON IN THE YEARS TO COME AND SPONTANEOUSLY BREAK OUT IN A COLD SWEAT AND BLUSH.
-1-male_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=vexed,LET’S JUST FOCUS ON GETTING OUT OF HERE TONIGHT SO WE CAN GO BACK TO OUR HOMES AND HAVE A LONG, COLD SHOWER TO CALM OUR NERVES AND THINK ABOUT WHAT WE DID TO DESERVE THIS.
-1-male_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=heroic,S-shoot. Don’t worry, ~name~! I’m a Pro Hero. Even if I’m a little… I’m still here to support you!
-1-male_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=serious,I-I won’t be a coward. Don’t worry ~name~! I’m embarrassed too, but we’ll be okay!
-1-male_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=vexed,Um. Sorry, I just get kind of… Hero-y.
-1-male_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=embarrassed,T-that was a strange outburst from me! I’m s-sorry, ~name~! W-wait! Why should I be sorry! You’re a villain!
-1-male_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=shy,I sure hope not. Because that makes me k-kind of an idiot.
-1-male_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=embarrassed,W-well! It sure didn’t work! I wanted to come to this of my own free will-- N-no wait, I didn’t mean!
-1-male_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=gravity,That way, this… Weirdness can stop.
-1-male_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=gravity,G-given that you’re… Think, Ochako! Think how to stop this villain!
-1-male_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=shy,I-is that just a villain thing? I don’t think so, but I’d say my friends are more confident rather than shameless like you.
-1-male_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=vexed,I-I’d really rather you just surrender than have us keep going, ~name~.
-1-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=nauseous,I can’t believe you took off your ~clothing~, ~name~! <i>I’m</i> embarrassed just thinking about it!
-1-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=gravity,Um. S-sorry, I just got distracted. By a villain. And not your ~clothing~ being on the floor.
-1-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=nauseous,Your ~clothing~?! That's supposed to cover a lot, so now you’re showing a lot, and so now I’m <i>embarrassed</i> a lot!
-1-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=embarrassed,Mmhmm! This isn’t making me super uncomfortable. Nope. I am A-OK!
-1-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=calm,Mmf. Yes. I am nodding my head. This is fine. I am not cringing internally.
-1-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=embarrassed,Those sure are some ~clothing~ that ~name~’s not wearing anymore. Yep. Mmhmm! What could go wrong!?
-1-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=embarrassed,Mhmmf! Yep! Those sure are ~name~’s ~clothing~ on the floor and not on his body.
-1-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=embarrassed,I’m really coming around to appreciate the <i>gravity</i> of the situation.
-1-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=embarrassed,<i>Meep!</i>
-1-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_4a,notSaidMarker:enf_4b,marker:enf_4b=embarrassed,T-that’s f-fine. M-mmf. I-I’ll just… hnmf.
-1-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_4a,notSaidMarker:enf_4b,marker:enf_4b=shy,E-er. That's great! ~name~! G-great! N-not at all embarrassing for us. N-nope! S-so great!
-1-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_5a,notSaidMarker:enf_5b,marker:enf_5b=serious,That’s what this game is about. I’m not screaming on the inside. Not me! <i>Not at all.</i> I-I’ll put up a brave face for the rest of this, at least.
-1-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_5a,notSaidMarker:enf_5b,marker:enf_5b=heroic,Yeah! Take more off! Definitely don't win and keep your major articles on! No! Definitely for real take them off. I'm great! Really!
-1-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:4=shy,I give up. You’re clearly playing this game a little differently than the rest, but you don’t seem too bothered by getting naked… S-so, Well, best of luck, 9S! Keep at it!
-1-female_removing_major=calm,Keep it up, ~name~! You're doing really well so far!
-1-female_removing_major=gravity,Your ~clothing~ looks super hot, ~name~! I mean, I bet the guys... or other girls... Really like it!
-1-female_removing_major,filter:flies,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=interested,S-so, ~name~, you can float too, right?
-1-female_removing_major,filter:flies,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=interested,Hm… How high can you go, ~name~? I-I mean, if you fly or hover?
-1-female_removing_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=shy,Zero Gravity doesn’t actually let me fly…
-1-female_removing_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=shy,I-I think if I were a bit more… Um. You know... I could use my Quirk to gracefully slip out of my clothes…
-1-female_removing_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_1b,notSaidMarker:enf_2a,marker:enf_2a=interested,O-oh.
-1-female_removing_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_1b,notSaidMarker:enf_2a,marker:enf_2a=nauseous,Gah, this feels so weird, watching you take off your ~clothing~ and er…
-1-female_removing_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=interested,Ack, your ~clothing~?
-1-female_removing_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=embarrassed,W-well. It c-c-could be more awkward, couldn’t it?
-1-female_removing_major,filter:hero,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=nauseous,S-shoot. Don’t worry, ~name~! I know when to step in as part of a hero team! I’ve got the next one! I-I think.
-1-female_removing_major,filter:hero,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=heroic,O-oh no, ~name~! Don’t let your costume get too battle-damaged!
-1-female_removing_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=embarrassed,~name~ is up? Just… Act like we’re changing between missions!
-1-female_removing_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=heroic,~name~ l-l-lost? Argh, I’d offer to assist but that’s less… Mission-oriented…
-1-female_removing_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_1b,notSaidMarker:enf_2a,marker:enf_2a=embarrassed,A-are you serious? We’re heroes, ~name~! We need to be better than this!
-1-female_removing_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_1b,notSaidMarker:enf_2a,marker:enf_2a=embarrassed,I’m just going to look away. That’s pretty much all I can do, right?
-1-female_removing_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=embarrassed,Y-yikes. At least it’s not something… More revealing. T-though I’m not sure what else could be…
-1-female_removing_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=embarrassed,Your ~clothing~? D-did you have nothing smaller? Like a gadget or a Quirk enhancer?
-1-female_removing_major,filter:shy,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=shy,Phew. I can see I’m not the only one here who’s not thrilled by the prospect of this game…
-1-female_removing_major,filter:shy,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=heroic,Don’t worry, ~name~, I know I seem pretty brave, but I’m also really freaked out right now.
-1-female_removing_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=embarrassed,H-heh. I’m kind of… Jeez, do I really sound like that when…?
-1-female_removing_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=embarrassed,E-eh. Heh-heh… D-don’t worry ~name~, look how well I’m holding up, and I-I-

-1-female_removing_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_1b,notSaidMarker:enf_2a,marker:enf_2a=nauseous,HA. HA. YEP. YEP YEP YEP. THIS SURE ISN’T EMOTIONALLY TAXING ON PEOPLE LIKE US.
-1-female_removing_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=shy,I-I was doing pretty okay until ~name~ needed to take off her ~clothing~... Really! I was!
-1-female_removing_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=shy,S-she’s just as embarrassed as I am…
-1-female_removing_major,filter:villain,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=heroic,Serves you right, ~name~!
-1-female_removing_major,filter:villain,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=heroic,Take that, ~name~!
-1-female_removing_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=vexed,~name~, did you help set this up? Were you the bait to lure heroes into some sort of trap?
-1-female_removing_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=heroic,I-I can’t tell if I’m supposed to stop you from losing, or if making you lose will make your trap backfire! ~name~, your villainy stops here! Or something cool like that!

-1-female_removing_major,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=embarrassed,I-I’ll just stare elsewhere. Oh gosh, my face is just getting so red, isn’t it?

-1-female_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_3b,notSaidMarker:enf_4a,marker:enf_4a=nauseous,O-oh. ~name~ is taking off her... That's fine. Totally fine. Yep. Sexy even.
-1-female_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_4b,notSaidMarker:enf_5a,marker:enf_5a=embarrassed,It’s fine. ~name~ is just taking off her clothing that’ll show off large portions of her skin.
-1-female_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_4b,notSaidMarker:enf_5a=shy,E-erk.
-1-female_removing_major,target:aimee,targetStage:0=nauseous,Oh no! Everyone watch out, I’ll try to--
-1-female_removing_major,target:d.va,targetStage:3=interested,Most people I know would be gushing about their Quirk by now!
-1-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=interested,Hm. I guess you’re a hero then!
-1-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:3=interested,I was just looking at your costume. It’s actually not super complicated at all, is it? It’s just flexible material with a bit of rip-stoppage. It even looks kinda dirty and worn-out… And some of the patterning is definitely...
-1-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1=embarrassed,O-oh no! You weren't wearing anything under that, were you, Marinette!?
-1-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Y-you’re so comfortable with this! B-but there’s so many people and it’s not like we’re changing into something else--!
-1-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=happy,O-oh! We call it training gear too. Back when I was in school, we did have a full gym outfit, at least.
-1-female_removing_major,target:navi,targetStage:0=vexed,OK--OK!! No need to do a flash on us!
-1-female_removing_major,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess,marker:enf_2a=nauseous,U-um! Dealer, anyone else, should-- how-- we should stop this, right!?
-1-female_removing_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:0,marker:enf_0a=interested,Um... I'm guessing it's something with... balloons? Parties?
-1-female_removing_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:1,marker:enf_1a=embarrassed,Um... not that taking off your clothes... gets the party started.
-1-female_removing_major,target:saki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity=interested,Oh! I’m not a heavy drinker, but you both seem… not built for that either, so this could be fun!

-1-female_removing_major,target:wiifitfemale=shy,I don’t really know many people in that good of shape that aren’t Pro Heroes.
-1-female_removing_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:1=heroic,“Wii Fit!” You <i>do</i> have some sort of training boosting power. And you’re so gentle about how you speak.
-1-female_removing_major,target:zone-tan=nauseous,(It's so... so hard to even look away from her...)
-1-female_removed_major=shy,I-I kind of wish I’d just taken mine off like that instead of making a big deal out of it…
-1-female_removed_major=happy,So, what did you plan to do later? I wouldn't mind relieving some embarrassment by retroactively getting to know you, I think.
-1-female_removed_major=heroic,Hmm. You do this with so much more flourish than me, ~name~!
-1-female_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=gravity,I kind of do it better when I’m either focused or stressed. Funny how that works, right?
-1-female_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=gravity,Er… I don’t suppose you’re shy about it and it’s not something I’m supposed to talk about?

-1-female_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=gravity,It k-kinda makes you just want to float away, right?
-1-female_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=embarrassed,I think I just have a lot of sympathy for you doing that, and it’s making me think of me doing it and I’m just kind of allovertheplace andokayIreallyshouldstop.
-1-female_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=interested,A-at least you’ve got a neat Quirk, ~name~ ! The-the floating, I mean.
-1-female_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=heroic,Er… At least we have a unique Quirk in common, huh? Our flying, I mean.
-1-female_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=vexed,E-er… Sorry ~name~, I can stick around for the rest of the game but this is way harder for me than putting a stop to some villains.
-1-female_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=gravity,Er… You’d be surprised at how often costumes seem to get torn in embarrassing ways. T-that’s why I always wear a bra! And underwear!
-1-female_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=interested,Not that I’d have had any reason to have done that before. You know what, nevermind.
-1-female_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=nauseous,Changing between missions in a co-ed environment where undressing is a penalty. Nope, not frightening at all.
-1-female_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=shy,We’ve both got to be pretty embarrassed now, don’t we, ~name~? Do you think we’ll get a bad evaluation from HQ for losing?
-1-female_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=shy,I-I’d rather not think too much about how this reflects on us.
-1-female_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=shy,I-I think it’s great that you’re going through with it. Yep. Very heroic. No problems here. With your ~clothing~ and various smaller bits on the floor.
-1-female_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=shy,I’m sorry ~name~, I thought this’d be easier with another hero but… Um. It’s still quite embarrassing...
-1-female_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=heroic,Y-you still look good without your ~clothing~! Don’t give up yet, ~name~!
-1-female_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=embarrassed,E-erm. I wonder if embarrassment is contagious…
-1-female_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=heroic,I know you’re embarrassed, ~name~, but we can’t just be ashamed for no reason!
-1-female_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=heroic,I’ve got your back, ~name~, as someone else who can be… Um. Fairly traditional about nudity.
-1-female_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=vexed,THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT GOING TO BE AN EXPERIENCE WE LOOK BACK ON IN THE YEARS TO COME AND SPONTANEOUSLY BREAK OUT IN A COLD SWEAT AND BLUSH.
-1-female_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=vexed,LET’S JUST FOCUS ON GETTING OUT OF HERE TONIGHT SO WE CAN GO BACK TO OUR HOMES AND HAVE A LONG, COLD SHOWER TO CALM OUR NERVES AND THINK ABOUT WHAT WE DID TO DESERVE THIS.
-1-female_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=heroic,S-shoot. Don’t worry, ~name~! I’m a Pro Hero. Even if I’m a little… I’m still here to support you!
-1-female_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=serious,I-I won’t be a coward. Don’t worry ~name~! I’m embarrassed too, but we’ll be okay!
-1-female_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=vexed,Um. Sorry, I just get kind of… Hero-y.
-1-female_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=embarrassed,T-that was a strange outburst from me! I’m s-sorry, ~name~! W-wait! Why should I be sorry! You’re a villain!
-1-female_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=shy,I sure hope not. Because that makes me k-kind of an idiot.
-1-female_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=embarrassed,W-well! It sure didn’t work! I wanted to come to this of my own free will-- N-no wait, I didn’t mean!
-1-female_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=gravity,That way, this… Weirdness can stop.
-1-female_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=gravity,G-given that you’re… Think, Ochako! Think how to stop this villain!
-1-female_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=shy,I-is that just a villain thing? I don’t think so, but I’d say my friends are more confident rather than shameless like you.
-1-female_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=vexed,I-I’d really rather you just surrender than have us keep going, ~name~.
-1-female_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=nauseous,I can’t believe you took off your ~clothing~, ~name~! <i>I’m</i> embarrassed just thinking about it!
-1-female_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=nauseous,Your ~clothing~? That's supposed to cover a lot, so now you’re showing a lot, and so now I’m <i>embarrassed</i> a lot!
-1-female_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=embarrassed,Mmhmm! This isn’t making me super uncomfortable. Nope. I am A-OK!
-1-female_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=calm,Mmf. Yes. I am nodding my head. This is fine. I am not cringing internally.
-1-female_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=embarrassed,That's sure ~name~'s ~clothing~ that ~name~’s not wearing anymore. Yep. Mmhmm! What could go wrong!?
-1-female_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=embarrassed,Mhmmf! Yep! Those sure are ~name~’s ~clothing~ on the floor and not on her body.
-1-female_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=vexed,That's sure ~name~'s ~clothing~ that ~name~’s not wearing anymore. Yep. See, my grammar is exacting. This means I am calm and collected!
-1-female_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=embarrassed,I’m really coming around to appreciate the <i>gravity</i> of the situation.
-1-female_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=embarrassed,<i>Meep!</i>
-1-female_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_4a,notSaidMarker:enf_4b,marker:enf_4b=embarrassed,T-that’s f-fine. M-mmf. I-I’ll just… Hnmf.
-1-female_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_5a,notSaidMarker:enf_5b,marker:enf_5b=serious,That’s what this game is about. I’m not screaming on the inside. Not me! <i>Not at all.</i> I-I’ll put up a brave face for the rest of this, at least.
-1-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=interested,Oh! You have a sharpshooting Quirk! Just… Please be careful!
-1-female_removed_major,target:d.va,targetStage:4=vexed,M-maybe you want to gush in other ways, which is why you wore such a tight suit.
-1-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2=gravity,I think a villain would be a lot more sinister when she took off her mask… Though do you actually have some sort of vocal Quirk? I’ve never heard someone make a sound like that!
-1-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:4=shy,Just sewn back together to vaguely resemble webs… W-w-what? N-no! I was just looking at your equipment! I wasn’t--
-1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,marker:enf_1b=interested,Whoa! So that suit <i>was</i> part of your Quirk? That's so cool! But. Um. What else does it do?
-1-female_removed_major,target:navi,targetStage:1=shy,Um... I guess it wasn't like Tooru's... She flashes us a lot.
-1-female_removed_major,target:nayru,targetStage:5,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=interested,Is... is she okay? Nayru...?
-1-female_removed_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:1,marker:enf_0b=shy,Yo-you're certainly well endowed! Um! Upbeat! With personality!
-1-female_removed_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:2,marker:enf_1b=gravity,Hm. You are a--a mystery, Pinkie Pie. I'm certainly feeling more at ease with all of this!
-1-female_removed_major,target:remilia,targetStage:4=vexed,It seems like you could be using your powers for a lot more... and now you're having wine?
-1-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity=heroic,Hmm… Well, if Futaba’s going to use her code name, and she’ll refer to me as Uravity the whole time, I guess we need to give Saki a hero name…?
-1-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=heroic,This sounds like a <i>great</i> day! Come on, Saki, are you in or what?
-1-female_removed_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:1=embarrassed,But do you have some sort of synergy power? And... e-err... you look really sweaty... like <i>really</i> sweaty.
-1-female_removed_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:2=shy,I bet your services are really something else! Though maybe you shouldn’t book yourself so often you show up to a game like this still sweating… Or maybe you’ve learned how to make the best of a sweating Quirk, considering you looked so dry earlier…
-1-female_removed_major,target:zone-tan,targetStage:2,marker:enf_1a=vexed,C-can the management make her turn off her Quirk? Please?

4-male_chest_is_visible,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=nauseous,C-could I just send ~name~ to jail, instead of… This? It’s going to be really awkward to apprehend her/him if he/she tries to run!
4-male_chest_is_visible,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=shy,~name~, I know you might be a villain, but I feel… Pretty embarrassed for you.
4-male_chest_is_visible,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_4a,notSaidMarker:enf_4b,marker:enf_4b=shy,C-crime? Y-you have so many what’s one more? E-er, deceiving a Pro Hero into-- Into l-lewd acts!

4-male_chest_is_visible,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=serious,Hmmph. Hmph. That sure is a chest. Mmhmm.
4-male_chest_is_visible,saidMarker:enf_4a,notSaidMarker:enf_4b,marker:enf_4b=serious,I have no idea how you can be so… Well, maybe composed is the wrong word…

5-male_chest_is_visible,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_5a,notSaidMarker:enf_5b,marker:enf_5b=happy,Keep floating on after this.

5-male_chest_is_visible,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=nauseous,C-could I just send ~name~ to jail, instead of… This? It’s going to be really awkward to apprehend her/him if he/she tries to run!

5-male_chest_is_visible,saidMarker:enf_4a,notSaidMarker:enf_4b,marker:enf_4b=serious,I have no idea how you can be so… Well, maybe composed is the wrong word…
5-male_chest_is_visible,saidMarker:enf_5a,notSaidMarker:enf_5b,marker:enf_5b=embarrassed,Okay… Okay… I’ll just have to get a grip, I guess.
5-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=embarrassed,W-what? I-I-I-- Y-y-you have no-- Er!
5-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=embarrassed,Hm. I can’t say I’ve seen that kind of physical difference before. I don’t think it’s <i>that</i> unusual though, is it?

6-male_chest_is_visible,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=serious,Hmmph. Hmph. That sure is a chest. Mmhmm.

6-male_chest_is_visible,saidMarker:enf_5a,notSaidMarker:enf_5b,marker:enf_5b=embarrassed,Okay… Okay… I’ll just have to get a grip, I guess.

#OPPONENT MASTURBATING
#When an opponent is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must pay the penalty by masturbating in front of everyone.
#The "must_masturbate" line is for just before it happens, and the "start_masturbating" line immediately follows.
#The "masturbating" line will be spoken a little after the opponent has started but before they climax.
#When the opponent climaxes, your character will say the "finished_masturbating" line.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

#SELF MASTURBATING
#If your character is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must masturbate.
#These lines only come up in the relevant stages, so you don't need to include the stage numbers here. Just remember which stage is which when you make the images. The "starting" image is still in the naked stage.
#The "finished_masturbating" line will repeat many times if the game is not yet finished. This plays as opponents comment on the how good their hands are.

game_over_defeat,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:10,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_out,count-saki:1=calm,~name~, you played very well, though I wish we could’ve met under less awkward circumstances. Er, you’re a hero in your own way, for helping make a new friendship though!
game_over_defeat,target:human,alsoPlaying:futaba,count-saki:1=calm,~player~, Plus Ultra work! I wish we’d gotten a chance to meet literally anywhere else, but if you wanted to come hang out with Saki, Futaba, and I after we’re done with our hangout, I wouldn’t mind getting dinner after the singing and drinking.
game_over_defeat,target:human,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:10,count-saki:1=interested,W-well, good job, ~player~, I hope you… uh, enjoyed this. I think I’m going to go try and pretend like this was mostly just a way to get to make a few new friends. I’ll see Marinette and Saki tomorrow, though, maybe we should spend time together after that?
game_over_defeat,saidMarker:ochako_likes_player_f==2,priority:900=shy,H-hey, ~player~? D-do you want to do something next? I have some questions about your Quirk... i-if you don't mind...

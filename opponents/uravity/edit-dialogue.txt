#When selecting the characters to play the game, the first line will always play, then it randomly picks from any of the start lines after you commence the game but before you deal the first hand.
start=0-calm,Pro Hero Uravity here! What seems to be the trouble?
start=0-vexed,Wait a second-- Is there really an emergency here?
start=0-embarrassed,Oh, damn it, hold on, don't deal-- Shoot. Ugh, I'll follow the rules, but I swear <i>Mina's</i> pranks go too far sometimes.
start=0-heroic,Well... I guess I could end up protecting some people... From embarrassment, at least... Okay! Plus Ultra! Let's do this!


#Items of clothing should be listed here in order of removal.
#The values are formal name, lower case name, how much they cover, what they cover
#Please do not put spaces around the commas.
#"Important" clothes cover genitals (lower) or chest/breasts (upper). For example: bras, panties, a skirt when going commando.
#"Major" clothes cover underwear. For example: skirts, pants, shirts, dresses.
#"Minor" clothes cover skin or are large pieces of clothing that do not cover skin. For example: jackets, socks, stockings, gloves.
#"Extra" clothes are small items that may or may not be clothing but do not cover anything interesting. For example: jewelry, shoes or boots with socks underneath, belts, hats. In the rest of the code, "extra" clothes are called "accessory".
#If for some reason you write another word for the type of clothes (e.g. "accessory"), other characters will not react at all when the clothing is removed.
#What they cover = upper (upper body), lower (lower body), other (neither).
#The game can support any number of entries, but typically we use 2-8, with at least one "important" layer for upper and lower (each).

#Notes on dialogue
#All lines that start with a # symbol are comments and will be ignored by the tool that converts this file into a xml file for the game.
#Where more than one line has an identical type, like "swap_cards" and "swap_cards", the game will randomly select one of these lines each time the character is in that situation.
#You should try to include multiple lines for most stages, especially the final (finished) stage, -1. 

#A character goes through multiple stages as they undress. The stage number starts at zero and indicates how many layers they have removed. Special stage numbers are used when they are nude (-3), masturbating (-2), and finished (-1).
#Line types that start with a number will only display during that stage. The will override any numberless stage-generic lines. For example, in stage 4 "4-swap_cards" will be used over "swap_cards" if it is not blank here. Giving a character unique dialogue for each stage is an effective way of showing their changing openness/shyness as the game progresses.
#You can combine the above points and make multiple lines for a particular situation in a particular stage, like "4-swap_cards" and "4-swap_cards".

#Some special words can be used that will be substituted by the game for context-appropriate ones: ~name~ is the name of the character they're speaking to, but this only works if someone else is in focus. ~clothing~ is the type of clothing that is being removed by another player. ~Clothing~ is almost the same, but it starts with a capital letter in case you want to start a sentence with it.
#~name~ can be used any time a line targets an opponent (game_over_defeat, _must_strip, _removing_, _removed, _must_masturbate, etc).
#~clothing~ can be used only when clothing is being removed (_removing and _removed, but NOT _must_strip).
#~player~ can be used at any time and refers to the human player.
#~cards~ can be used only in the swap_cards lines.
#All wildcards can be used once per line only! If you use ~name~ twice, the code will show up the second time.

#Lines can be written that are only spoken when specific other characters are present. For a detailed explanation, read this guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/spnati/comments/6nhaj0/the_easy_way_to_write_targeted_lines/
#Here is an example line (note that targeted lines must have a stage number):
#0-female_must_strip,target:hermioine=happy,Looks like your magic doesn't help with poker!




#EXCHANGING CARDS
#This is what a character says while they're exchanging cards.
#The game will automatically put a display a number between 0-5 where you write ~cards~.
#These lines display on the screen for only a brief time, so it is important to make them short enough to read at a glance.

0-good_hand,saidMarker:ochako_throw,notSaidMarker:ot1,priority:900,marker:ot1=happy,Okay, I'm going to try and lose this one since someone's definitely in need!
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:moon=embarrassed,I'm over the Moon for these cards! Um. Not you, Ms. Alola.
0-okay_hand=happy,Hmm. I think this hand's a little quirky. I just have to figure out how to use it...
0-okay_hand=interested,Two cards with the same number are pretty okay, right?
0-okay_hand=calm,This hand is okay... But it's good enough not to worry!
0-okay_hand,saidMarker:ochako_throw,notSaidMarker:ot1,priority:900,marker:ot1=interested,Okay, I'm going to try and lose this one since someone's definitely in need!
0-bad_hand=embarrassed,If I just keep my head, I'll keep my helmet too.
0-bad_hand=nauseous,Gah, I think I jumped a little too far in my card request.
0-bad_hand,saidMarker:ochako_throw,notSaidMarker:ot1,priority:900,marker:ot1=heroic,Okay, I'm going to try and lose this one since someone's definitely in need!


#lost helmet
1-good_hand=happy,Well, I may have lost my helmet, but I'm playing well now!
1-good_hand=heroic,Uravity always lands with a bounce! And these cards are definitely helping me take advantage of the situation.
1-okay_hand=gravity,Don't worry, everyone! The situation and my hand are under control!
1-okay_hand=calm,Hmm. So, this might be a little late but it doesn't seem like there's really an emergency here... It's too late to deal me out though, huh?
1-okay_hand=interested,If I knew I was going to be playing a game like this, I'd probably have asked Momo for help. She knows how to adapt to situations really easily. Like, this hand.
1-bad_hand=vexed,Well, at least I can pick something small next...
1-bad_hand=nauseous,Urgh. I'm not feeling so good about this...


#lost kneepads
2-good_hand=heroic,Yes! This is great!
2-good_hand=happy,Phew! I was worried I'd have to take off more stabilizing gear. The adjustment period is definitely not the most fun part of my costume.
2-okay_hand=calm,Hm. I think this'll be fine.
2-okay_hand=vexed,A hero normally doesn't cheat, but she also doesn't get lied to about the type of game she'll be playing...
2-okay_hand=interested,Oh! I had these cards earlier! They were... Okay, I think.
2-bad_hand=vexed,Um. I know I took off something kind of small last time, would... No, I have to just make do with this hand! It's not over yet!
2-bad_hand=embarrassed,My boots are honestly getting kind of cramped. They're meant to absorb shock and I'm not really moving much now... N-not that I hope I'll lose!


#lost stabilizers
3-good_hand=heroic,Great!
3-good_hand=gravity,Ah! Hold on! I just got so excited over how good my hand is!
3-okay_hand=vexed,So... Just curious, what does everyone else have?
3-okay_hand=serious,Hm...
3-okay_hand=happy,I can win with these! I know it!
3-bad_hand=embarrassed,I'm really running out of equipment, so <i>please</i> let these cards work.
3-bad_hand=serious,I won't give up, even with cards as bad as these!


#lost belt
4-good_hand=heroic,Oh, thank goodness! It's never too late to keep trying!
4-good_hand=happy,Phew. Looks like I'm safe this round.
4-okay_hand=calm,Hmm. This is okay, I guess...
4-okay_hand=gravity,Uh oh, wait a second, I can't see what I ended up with!
4-okay_hand=calm,Ehhh... This isn't so good...
4-bad_hand=embarrassed,I guess Izuku would have something to say about working with the hand you're dealt...
4-bad_hand=nauseous,Without my stabilizing gear, I'm feeling a bit nauseous.


#lost costume
5-good_hand=heroic,Phew! I-I mean, I'm very composed! Ha-ha!
5-good_hand=serious,I could've used these cards last round, but at least I'm not naked!
5-okay_hand=vexed,It's not all any different from my training gear... You don't have to stare so much, ~player~!
5-okay_hand=heroic,I can do this!
5-okay_hand=happy,This'll be okay!
5-bad_hand=gravity,It's against the rules to Zero Gravity the deck so that nobody can get their cards, right? Just asking. For curiosity.
5-bad_hand=embarrassed,Hm. W-well, I guess the only way out is through! Time to psyche myself up! Yep!
5-bad_hand,totalAlive:3-5=serious,If this means protecting someone else from losing, then I'll go ahead and lose.


#lost bra
6-good_hand=happy,Thank goodness.
6-good_hand=vexed,Oh <i>now</i> that everyone can see my chest, I get good cards.
6-okay_hand=gravity,This hand's so... Neutral. O-oh, no, I mean, it's really good! Definitely take risks if you're not going to lose the game or get really exposed or...
6-okay_hand=calm,This could go either way... I'd rather keep my panties on, thank you very much.
6-okay_hand=interested,Um. I know a hero involves risk, but this isn't dangerous as much as it is a bit shameful...
6-bad_hand=embarrassed,Oh, please, no...
6-bad_hand=vexed,To say I'm embarrassed just <i>thinking</i> about losing this hand is way less bad than what'll happen if I actually do!

-3-good_hand=happy,At least I don't have to do <i>that</i> in front of everyone.
-3-good_hand=gravity,I really, really hope I don't accidentally zero gravity something or I'll be showing... All of me.
-3-good_hand,timeInStage:0,totalMasturbating:0,totalFinished:0,marker:uraraka_penalty_what=serious,Looks like... Sorry, I had to stop and think about this. Why do I still get a hand if I'm already naked...? <i>WE HAVE TO WHAT?</i>
-3-okay_hand=heroic,Hm. I think I should be okay...?
-3-okay_hand,marker:quirks_dignity=embarrassed,One of you has a Quirk that'll explain why I went through all this, right? Um. For my dignity's sake? I hope?
-3-okay_hand=nauseous,I hope that in some strange way, this meant someone else got to be safe even though I'm really exposed now.
-3-okay_hand,timeInStage:1=interested,E-er, which one of you has an arousal Quirk? Normally I wouldn't be... Enjoying being nude like this in front of you all! Okay, there, I said it!
-3-okay_hand,timeInStage:0,totalMasturbating:0,totalFinished:0,marker:uraraka_penalty_what=serious,Looks like... Sorry, I had to stop and think about this. Why do I still get a hand if I'm already naked...? <i>WE HAVE TO WHAT?</i>
-3-bad_hand=serious,This hand's horrible, which gives me all the more reason to keep up hope!
-3-bad_hand=vexed,Is it... Weird that I kind of feel like losing?
-3-bad_hand,timeInStage:0,totalMasturbating:0,totalFinished:0,marker:uraraka_penalty_what=embarrassed,Looks like... Sorry, I had to stop and think about this. Why do I still get a hand if I'm already naked...? <i>WE HAVE TO WHAT?</i>

0-must_strip_winning=must_strip,Hm. If it would make you feel better, I could do a little trick with Zero Gravity, but that's probably a bit too nonchalant.
0-must_strip_winning=must_strip,Aw. This helmet is so iconic though. Oh well, at least I don't need to use my Quirk <i>that</i> much to keep the game interesting. Or maybe I could...

2-stripped,alsoPlaying:rinkah=stripped,Though, Rinkah, if you do meet Todoroki, could you <i>not</i> tell him we met here? I'd be so embarrassed!
2-must_strip_winning=must_strip,Wow, who'd have though UA would prepare us for situations like this one? I'm doing really well! Well, until I lost this hand.
2-must_strip_winning=must_strip,Okay, so, last time was something small... I <i>guess</i> I can take off two pieces like I did the first round...

2-must_strip_normal=must_strip,So my boots and my wrist-cuffs... That's a mouthful. Why don't we just call them "Uravity Stabilizers!"
2-must_strip_normal=must_strip,You can call these my stabilizers...
2-must_strip_normal=must_strip,I know I didn't exactly take off a lot last time. I'll get more this go... Starting with my cuffs. Then I'll get my boots!
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:chiaki=must_strip,Hmm... I guess the tail end of puberty are when talents are at their strongest, Chiaki...

2-must_strip_losing=must_strip,Huh? Oh no, really? But aren't I already wearing the least out of anyone here? Hnng, okay. I'll take off my wrist gear and boots. If I don't pair them, I get kind of disoriented.
2-must_strip_losing=must_strip,W-well. A hero keeps promises. And I suppose I'm keeping the rest of you from doing anything uncomfortable.

2-stripping=stripping,I find these really comfortable, to be honest. Like a hug for your wrists. And legs.
2-stripping=stripping,I've gotten better at it over the years, but my Quirk makes me really nauseous if I'm not careful.
2-stripping,totalMales:0=stripping,Just between us girls, when I <i>really</i> overdo it with my Quirk I get the <i>worst</i> cramps.

3-stripped=stripped,The nice thing about manipulating gravity is that it's easy to bounce right back up.
3-stripped,marker:tricks=stripped,Well, I'm less worried that this is a trick to make my powers a bit less controlled, and more a trick just to see me naked. Um. It's not that, is it?
3-must_strip_winning=must_strip,Well, that's the last of my support items... It feels good to win, but this isn't maybe the best place to gloat.
3-must_strip_winning=heroic,Woo! Even though I was tricked into coming, I'm still doing pretty well! At least I'm not showing any real skin yet...
3-must_strip_winning,consecutiveLosses:2,notSaidMarker:twiceloss,marker:twiceloss=vexed,I lost twice in a row? I-I guess I'll just get it together on the next hand.

3-stripping,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:1-10=stripping,Sei, were you serious when you said you hid aces in your pockets? That's cheating! But um. It wouldn't have really hurt, would it, in terms of not getting naked?


#losing costume
4-stripped=stripped,Huh? It wraps through my legs a little bit. It's... Cozy!
4-stripped=stripped,It does go between my legs, but it helps take advantage of my center of gravity. It's nothing weird!
4-must_strip_winning=nauseous,Okay. It's just like a locker room, or sparring practice... Except for the rest of you here, in various states of actual undress.
4-must_strip_winning=must_strip,It's just like going to the beach, I suppose. And it <i>is</i> kinda warm in here...

4-must_strip_losing=must_strip,...Okay. I'll just take a deep breath, and then it'll be okay. I'm not going to give up!

4-stripping=stripping,I actually like that it zips in the back, it's really easy to just float myself up, and... Slip out!
4-stripping=stripping,I don't <i>always</i> get picky about my underwear, but at least I wore something <i>cute</i> out today...
4-stripping=stripping,I usually don't worry about my patrol underwear, but um. At least it <i>matches</i> today.


#losing bra
5-stripped=stripped,E-er. It's not like a hero wears lingerie under her suit. Unless you're, like, Midnight, I think...?
5-stripped=stripped,I'm more worried about comfort than I am about looks when I'm getting ready to suit up and go out on patrol, but I appreciate the compliments... They're not <i>too</i> pink, are they?
5-must_strip_winning=must_strip,Maybe this'll help everyone else feel comfortable? I guess? Hero regulations are... Vague about this kind of... Public defense.
5-must_strip_winning=must_strip,U-um. Isn't it a bit lewd to-- W-well, that's not much of a defense considering everyone else is... I'll just get started.

5-must_strip_normal,consecutiveLosses:2,notSaidMarker:twiceloss,marker:twiceloss=vexed,I lost twice in a row? I-I guess I'll just get it together on the next hand.
5-must_strip_losing=nauseous,This is <i>really</i> not going according to plan. B-but a Pro Hero has to be resourceful!
5-must_strip_losing=vexed,This is like, a hallucination Quirk, right? Or a bad dream?
5-must_strip_losing,consecutiveLosses:2,notSaidMarker:twiceloss,marker:twiceloss=vexed,I lost twice in a row? I-I guess I'll just get it together on the next hand.
5-stripping=stripping,A-an athletic bra is great when you're running around for the support it provides, but um. I'd kind of prefer other support items at this stage.
5-stripping=stripping,A-ah, s-sorry, give me a second. This is kinda tight.


#lost all clothing
6-stripped=stripped,W-well, a hero always rises past her embarrassment and to the challenge! Plus Ultra!
6-stripped=stripped,I'm going to do my best to not lose again! Plus Ultra!
6-must_strip_winning=must_strip,Well, I suppose at this stage in the game it would be... Kind of cowardly to back out...
6-must_strip_winning=must_strip,Um. I kind of realized something. I know this is going to be kind of disappointing, but I didn't exactly prepare for this... Sorry if I'm a little... <i>shaggy.</i>

6-must_strip_winning,count-villain:1=vexed,N-no, not like this, in front of all these villains!
6-must_strip_winning,count-hero:1=happy,Well, it'll be just like a trip to the sauna or some mountain hotsprings with other Pro Heroes.
6-must_strip_winning,count-hero:1=heroic,O-okay. Since it's just other heroes and ~player~, who I think's a hero too...
6-must_strip_normal,marker:art_class=nauseous,Pretend it's art class again, pretend it's art class, pretend it's art class...

#OPPONENT MUST STRIP
#These lines are spoken when an opponent must strip, but the character does not yet know what they will take off.
#Writing different variations is important here, as these lines will be spoken about thirty times per game.
#The "human" versions of the lines will only be spoken if the human player is stripping.

#OPPONENT REMOVING ACCESSORY
#These lines are spoken when an opponent removes a small item that does not cover any skin.
#Typically, characters are fine with this when they are fully dressed but less satisfied as they become more naked.
#Note that all "removing" lines are NOT spoken to human players. Characters will skip straight from "6-male_human_must_strip" to "6-male_removed_accessory", for example.

#stage-specific lines that override the stage-generic ones
male_removing_accessory=calm,Well, at least your ~clothing~ is something small, ~name~.
male_removing_accessory=heroic,Give it your best, ~name~!
male_removing_accessory=embarrassed,Wow, I didn't know men wore so many accessories, ~name~!
male_removing_accessory=interested,Hm. I didn't know your ~clothing~ would be so popular this year!
male_removed_accessory=happy,I wouldn't mind if you took off something bigger, though! Only if you wanted.
male_removed_accessory=interested,Hm, your ~clothing~ seems like a good choice, ~name~.
male_removed_accessory=vexed,Not that what your ~clothing~ was a bad play, I'm just surprised you brought along something so small. Though Izuku would probably bring a notebook to something like this...
male_removed_accessory=interested,I've actually seen a lot of men wearing stuff like that lately, ~name~. Is it more comfortable without it on, or... Um...
female_removing_accessory=happy,That's a cool ~clothing~, ~name~!
female_removing_accessory=embarrassed,I think I have to put on so much gear when I'm working that I tend to not wear stuff like ~name~'s ~clothing~ in my casualwear.
female_removing_accessory=happy,Oh! Your ~clothing~'s a good choice, whether you're trying to win or just trying to play.
female_removing_accessory=interested,Oh gosh. ~name~. Where did you get your ~clothing~?
female_removing_accessory=vexed,I actually wear gloves while I sleep so I don't accidentally float my bed with my Quirk. So I can really see the value in small, sensible stuff like ~name~'s ~clothing~.
female_removing_accessory=nauseous,Hmm... Cute ~clothing~, ~name~!

female_removed_accessory=heroic,See, that wasn't so bad, was it, ~name~?
female_removed_accessory=heroic,I think this game can be kind of fun if we play like ~name~.
female_removed_accessory=interested,I thought ~name~'s accessory was cute!
female_removed_accessory=serious,Don't quit or feel ashamed, ~name~. We're all in this together. Um. Some of us more than others, but I'm trying to make sure we're all safe. At least.

0-male_removed_accessory=embarrassed,Well, I suppose I'm still fully dressed... Which is good for me but not so great if ~name~ keeps losing!
0-female_removing_accessory=heroic,Shoot! Can I take off my helmet so ~name~ doesn't have to take off her ~clothing~?
0-female_removing_accessory=embarrassed,Um. If you're here to have fun, ~name~, I suppose it's reasonable to go with something small like your ~clothing~.
0-female_removing_accessory=heroic,Oh! Are you trying to make a show of this, ~name~?

0-female_removing_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:0=interested,While anyone can certainly be a hero, I think based on how you’re dressed it’s probably not a strict regimen.

0-female_removed_accessory=embarrassed,Hm. This is such an odd game.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:2=happy,Or maybe it’s an American thing I don’t quite get. I’ll admit most of what I know about the US comes from All Might or Deku…
0-female_removed_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:1=heroic,I haven’t been out of the academy for very long, but I thought your “Chronal Acceleration” Quirk was awesome!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:2=embarrassed,U-um. Anyway, I have a friend whose Quirk was similar to yours, in how he could phase through solid objects. Could I get an autograph for him? I-if it’s no trouble.

0-female_removed_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:1=interested,I mean, obviously something medical related… It’s kind of hard to just be a doctor without something extra these days…
0-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:3=serious,What? Are you even paying attention, D.Va?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:annie=happy,On the plus side, you’re not quite as… <i>Unusual</i> as some of the support-class at UA! I bet you lead a fun life, at least!

-3-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:2=vexed,You… Surely needed those for something interesting, right? Just for listening to music?

-3-female_removed_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:1=vexed,Either way, it’s a very interesting style. If you want lots of pieces to win the game...

6-male_removing_minor=embarrassed,~name~, you've kind of... Seen my breasts now...
6-male_removing_minor=interested,Your ~clothing~ is good, but if I could make a polite request...
6-male_removing_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:0=interested,Do you know All Might, Captain America?
6-male_removed_minor=happy,Would you maybe take off something a <i>bit</i> bigger?
6-male_removed_minor=heroic,Could you maybe pick something more interesting if you're going to be staring at my chest like that? It's kind of rude...
6-male_removed_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:1=heroic,You remind me a lot about him, but he’s… Sometimes bigger in person. Also louder, but that only helps to inspire confidence in him!
6-female_removing_minor=calm,Hm. I'm feeling a little exposed about now, so I think I've done my due diligence so far...
6-female_removing_minor=embarrassed,Phew. It wasn't me, <i>and</i> you've got something bigger than an accessory.

6-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=interested,What ever happened to you after that… Shoot, I thought I was pretty good at history…
6-female_removed_minor=happy,I like your ~clothing~, ~name~! But I'm also kind of happy I didn't lose again!
6-female_removed_minor=vexed,Oh, s-sorry, I don't mean to be rude, but I'm just thankful I got to keep my panties on. (Isn't that an expression for rushing, anyway?)
6-female_removed_minor,target:mei,targetStage:3=embarrassed,Oh, and you use some sort of nozzle to channel it, right? Or is it just chemistry?

#OPPONENT REMOVING MAJOR CLOTHING
#Major clothing reveals a significant amount of skin and likely underwear.
#However, as we don't know if the opponent is taking off the top or the bottom, we can't presume that nice abs are showing; maybe she took of her skirt before her shirt.

#stage-specific lines that override the stage-generic ones
male_removing_major=embarrassed,Oh no! Not your ~clothing~!
male_removing_major=interested,~name~ is taking off his ~clothing~...? Mmm... Oh! Shoot, sorry!
male_removing_major=heroic,I kind of feel like I could take off more than what I've been doing if you're taking off stuff like your ~clothing~, ~name~.
male_removing_major=serious,Hm... Your ~clothing~?
male_removed_major=heroic,Don't worry, ~name~, I'm sure you'll get a better hand next time!
male_removed_major=nauseous,I feel so bad that you took off your ~clothing~ already...
male_removed_major=embarrassed,Er. Sorry, this can get a little distracting. For me, I mean.
male_removed_major=calm,Wait a second, I'm still mostly dressed! I'll try harder to... Lose? What? What am I supposed to do in this situation?
female_removing_major=interested,Oh no, already?
female_removing_major=interested,Your ~clothing~, ~name~?!
female_removing_major=interested,Shoot, your ~clothing~?
female_removing_major=interested,Your ~clothing~? Oh no!
female_removed_major=calm,I'm sorry, I'm more used to fighting villains than playing card games like this...
female_removed_major=vexed,I feel like I should take off something bigger next time...
female_removed_major=interested,W-well, I thought your ~clothing~ looked cute, ~name~.
female_removed_major=heroic,At least you have good taste in clothes and showed up ready for this kind of thing...

0-male_removed_major=embarrassed,I hope that you're um... Doing okay, ~name~. I know I'd be kinda mad if I lost something big and someone else hadn't even gone yet.
0-male_removed_major=heroic,Well, I think the crowd appreciates it, at least!
0-male_removed_major,marker:ochako_throw=serious,I-Er, I can't save you from bad cards, but I'll try to lose the next hand!
0-female_removing_major=interested,Oh no, ~name~!

4-male_removing_major=interested,Your ~clothing~? Phew. I'm glad it's ~name~ and not me.
4-male_removed_major=interested,Um. I'm not <i>happy</i> ~name~ lost, but he does look... Pretty good.
4-male_removed_major=interested,Okay, ~name~, at least if I lose next round I can do so knowing you're next to me. Um. Scorewise.

5-male_removed_major=gravity,Well... Our score seems about even, so I suppose that's a good thing!
5-male_removed_major=heroic,I think you're finding it a lot more encouraging when I remark how far much I've lost too, so I'll keep doing that, ~name~!

5-female_removing_major=interested,Don't give up yet, ~name~. I'm in my underwear and I'm trying to keep it together!

6-male_removing_major=heroic,~name~'s ~clothing~ seemed comfortable...
6-male_removed_major=embarrassed,Um. I'm kind of shy, but I think it helps me a lot to see you take stuff off, ~name~.
6-male_removed_major=happy,It's helping me be a lot more comfortable as you strip your big stuff, ~name~!
6-female_removing_major=vexed,If it makes you feel better, ~name~, at least you aren't quite as naked as me!
6-female_removing_major=embarrassed,It's really not so bad, ~name~! You can do it!

female_small_chest_is_visible=happy,Sometimes I get a little jealous of girls with smaller chests, to be really honest. You just need so much less support!
female_medium_chest_is_visible=happy,You look good, ~name~! You have nothing to worry about. No need to be shy!
female_medium_chest_is_visible=heroic,Wow, so perky!
female_large_chest_is_visible=happy,Wow, ~name~, we almost match! I will admit I don't envy other women with large breasts by no elasticity or mass Quirks, though. It sounds kinda hard on your back.
female_crotch_will_be_visible=interested,Hm. I'll admit, I'm not interested in women physically, but I feel like you can tell a little bit about a person based on how they groom!
female_crotch_is_visible=happy,Well, you look nice, ~name~! Very healthy!
female_crotch_is_visible=nauseous,O-oh, you look a little... Glisteny. Are you excited, ~name~? I s-suppose that's brave!

-1-male_chest_will_be_visible=interested,This at least makes up for the whole "being naked" thing.
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible=embarrassed,I hope this makes up for me being naked.
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible=happy,Even though I'm finished, it's still nice seeing attractive men undress, obviously.

-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=heroic,...Oh. I'm staring, aren't I?
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=gravity,...Huh? Oh <i>no</i> I really need to stop excitement bouncing... Especially without my gear...
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=happy,Mm! That's just what I imagined it looking like!
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=interested,I don't usually spend a lot of time thinking about what people look like under their costumes... But I think this situation makes it make sense.
-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible=happy,You know, I can think of a few people in the Support industry who'd love a tool like that!
-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible=embarrassed,Wow! That's not really my type, but I bet lots of people would <i>adore</i> some time with you and your... Um. "Quirk."
-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible=embarrassed,Y-you know, ~name~, I'm kind of loosened up now, if you wanted to... Try something with that later.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible=calm,Aw, we're neck and neck, aren't we, ~name~?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible=vexed,Don't worry ~name~, I don't think they're going to pay as much attention to you now that I've finished undressing!

-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mei=interested,As long as she <i>chills</i> out.

#OPPONENT MASTURBATING
#When an opponent is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must pay the penalty by masturbating in front of everyone.
#The "must_masturbate" line is for just before it happens, and the "start_masturbating" line immediately follows.
#The "masturbating" line will be spoken a little after the opponent has started but before they climax.
#When the opponent climaxes, your character will say the "finished_masturbating" line.

#stage-specific lines that override the stage-generic ones

-3-female_must_masturbate=calm,Ah, better luck next time, ~name~... I'm sorry I couldn't do more to keep you from this... Though...
-3-female_must_masturbate=happy,Well, set a good pace for me, ~name~, I worry I'm next. Unless I just won...?
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:mei=vexed,You’re keeping your glasses, even though you’re about to…?

-3-female_start_masturbating,target:elizabeth=nauseous,Can you make clones of yourself, Elizabeth? Or is this something else?! It seems really strong, and you have to have a… Lot of control to… Use it like this…
-3-female_masturbating=vexed,Um.
-3-female_masturbating=embarrassed,Good... Hand motions, ~name~?
-3-female_masturbating=happy,Oh! I <i>love</i> that spot! It's so hard to get to from the ground, though!

#SELF MASTURBATING
#If your character is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must masturbate.
#These lines only come up in the relevant stages, so you don't need to include the stage numbers here. Just remember which stage is which when you make the images. The "starting" image is still in the naked stage.
#The "finished_masturbating" line will repeat many times if the game is not yet finished. This plays as opponents comment on the how good their hands are.
-3-must_masturbate_first=must_masturbate,I wasn't ready for this! Especially before anyone else went!
-3-must_masturbate_first=must_masturbate,W-wait, I have to <i>what</i>? In front of all of you?
-3-must_masturbate=interested,Do I...
-3-must_masturbate=must_masturbate,Um... Okay then.
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:rinkah=must_masturbate,W-well, Rinkah, to be honest I always guessed most people used their Quirks... Um, for quality alone time.
-3-start_masturbating=starting,I'll give it my all! Plus Ultra!

-2-masturbating,marker:brush=gravity,This is awkward, it'll be like that time Mina walked in on me with my hairbrush...
-2-masturbating=gravity1,I think everyone uses their Quirk like this... It actually helped me get--Ah--get a lot of control over it!
-2-masturbating=gravity2,Mmmf. I-I definitely think there's an exhibitionist aspect to being a hero.
-2-masturbating=calm,It's been a few days since I got to take care of myself, but... Oh...
-2-masturbating=gravity,Oh this feels <i>amazing.</i>
-2-masturbating=gravity1,Mmm!
-2-masturbating,saidMarker:brush,notSaidMarker:brush2,priority:1,marker:brush2=calm,The darn thing--Ah... The darn thing-- Floated away before I could grab it!
-2-heavy_masturbating=gravity2,I'm getting close...

-2-heavy_masturbating=gravity,A-and--
-2-finishing_masturbating=finishing,P-plus Ultra!
-2-finishing_masturbating=finishing,Release!

-1-finished_masturbating=heroic,This was fun!
-1-finished_masturbating=happy,I'm sorry if I didn't manage to keep anyone safe, but I hope my... Heroic display was worth it!
-1-finished_masturbating=gravity,Hmm.... Sorry, was just spacing out.
-1-finished_masturbating=finished,So um. How'd I do?
-1-finished_masturbating,timeInStage:6=nauseous,Oh. Oh no. I usually don't get sick when I... Phew. It just passed!
-1-finished_masturbating,timeInStage:3=happy,I'm still shaking from that.
-1-finished_masturbating,timeInStage:10=embarrassed,It's getting kind of cold here...
-1-finished_masturbating,timeInStage:14=vexed,I wish you'd all finish up already, I want to get dressed...
-1-finished_masturbating,notSaidMarker:plop,marker:plop=serious,Ow! My poor butt... Okay. Sometimes I lose control a little bit...




#GAME OVER VICTORY

#stage-generic line that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

#stage-specific lines that override the stage-generic ones

#fully clothed
0-game_over_victory=embarrassed,While I'm always happy to succeed on my Pro Hero missions, I'm pretty embarrassed you all had to do so much!


#lost belt
4-game_over_victory=happy,Phew. I'll admit, almost losing my costume was kind of a shock. I... Feel bad for the rest of you, but I won!


#lost costume
5-game_over_victory=happy,This was a close call! Next time I'll try to bring in more heroes!


#lost bra
6-game_over_victory=heroic,Er. Since everyone's seen me take off most of my clothes, could we not speak about this if you see me again?

-3-game_over_victory=happy,Tell you what. I got to see all of you masturbate, you got to see me naked, let's not talk about this in the future, but it was at least fun!




#GAME OVER DEFEAT
game_over_defeat=happy,Phew. This was fun. I'd probably recommend this to some of my other friends!

description=Ochako "Uravity" Uraraka is a professional hero with a gravity control Quirk and a graduate of the prestigious UA Academy.

#When selecting the characters to play the game, the first line will always play, then it randomly picks from any of the start lines after you commence the game but before you deal the first hand.
start=0-calm,Pro Hero Uravity here! What seems to be the trouble?
start=0-vexed,Wait a second-- Is there really an emergency here?
start=0-embarrassed,Oh, damn it, hold on, don't deal-- Shoot. Ugh, I'll follow the rules, but I swear Mina's pranks go too far sometimes.
start=0-heroic,Well... I guess I could end up protecting some people... from embarrassment, at least... okay! Plus Ultra! Let's do this!


#Items of clothing should be listed here in order of removal.
#The values are formal name, lower case name, how much they cover, what they cover
#Please do not put spaces around the commas.
#"Important" clothes cover genitals (lower) or chest/breasts (upper). For example: bras, panties, a skirt when going commando.
#"Major" clothes cover underwear. For example: skirts, pants, shirts, dresses.
#"Minor" clothes cover skin or are large pieces of clothing that do not cover skin. For example: jackets, socks, stockings, gloves.
#"Extra" clothes are small items that may or may not be clothing but do not cover anything interesting. For example: jewelry, shoes or boots with socks underneath, belts, hats. In the rest of the code, "extra" clothes are called "accessory".
#If for some reason you write another word for the type of clothes (e.g. "accessory"), other characters will not react at all when the clothing is removed.
#What they cover = upper (upper body), lower (lower body), other (neither).
#The game can support any number of entries, but typically we use 2-8, with at least one "important" layer for upper and lower (each).

#Notes on dialogue
#All lines that start with a # symbol are comments and will be ignored by the tool that converts this file into a xml file for the game.
#Where more than one line has an identical type, like "swap_cards" and "swap_cards", the game will randomly select one of these lines each time the character is in that situation.
#You should try to include multiple lines for most stages, especially the final (finished) stage, -1. 

#A character goes through multiple stages as they undress. The stage number starts at zero and indicates how many layers they have removed. Special stage numbers are used when they are nude (-3), masturbating (-2), and finished (-1).
#Line types that start with a number will only display during that stage. The will override any numberless stage-generic lines. For example, in stage 4 "4-swap_cards" will be used over "swap_cards" if it is not blank here. Giving a character unique dialogue for each stage is an effective way of showing their changing openness/shyness as the game progresses.
#You can combine the above points and make multiple lines for a particular situation in a particular stage, like "4-swap_cards" and "4-swap_cards".

#Some special words can be used that will be substituted by the game for context-appropriate ones: ~name~ is the name of the character they're speaking to, but this only works if someone else is in focus. ~clothing~ is the type of clothing that is being removed by another player. ~Clothing~ is almost the same, but it starts with a capital letter in case you want to start a sentence with it.
#~name~ can be used any time a line targets an opponent (game_over_defeat, _must_strip, _removing_, _removed, _must_masturbate, etc).
#~clothing~ can be used only when clothing is being removed (_removing and _removed, but NOT _must_strip).
#~player~ can be used at any time and refers to the human player.
#~cards~ can be used only in the swap_cards lines.
#All wildcards can be used once per line only! If you use ~name~ twice, the code will show up the second time.

#Lines can be written that are only spoken when specific other characters are present. For a detailed explanation, read this guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/spnati/comments/6nhaj0/the_easy_way_to_write_targeted_lines/
#Here is an example line (note that targeted lines must have a stage number):
#0-female_must_strip,target:hermioine=happy,Looks like your magic doesn't help with poker!




#EXCHANGING CARDS
#This is what a character says while they're exchanging cards.
#The game will automatically put a display a number between 0-5 where you write ~cards~.
#These lines display on the screen for only a brief time, so it is important to make them short enough to read at a glance.

1-stripped=stripped,My helmet's actually pretty well ventilated, so it doesn't fog up! But it's nice to just feel the wind on your skin sometimes, you know?
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:marinette=stripped,Hmm… that seems to be right, but I thought Quirks were common everywhere!
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit=stripped,O-Oh. Well t-that's sweet of you, Pit. I-I kinda wish I still had it. It might hide the red in my face.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:futaba=stripped,Well, hopefully <i>this</i> doesn't go up on TV. Um. It's not, right?
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia=stripped,So, years later, here I am, still wearing bodysuits. They're comfortable, but they kind of... show off parts of me I'm n-not super thrilled at showing off.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:0=stripped,Well, thank you Elizabeth, that's very kind of you!
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:9s,alsoPlayingStage:0=stripped,U-uhm. I mean, I see your little floaty friend in the background there. But my Quirk is innate. My suit helps, but Zero Gravity is all me.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:akko,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=stripped,Who's Chariot? What's her Quirk? I think you're into some really specialized hero work, Akko, based on how witch-y your outfit looks!
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:kimberly,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=happy,W-well, if you want to know, Kimberly, my Quirk actually works on my hair too. Keeps it nice and floofy!
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:akko,alsoPlayingStage:9=stripped,Who's Chariot? What's her Quirk? I think you're into some really specialized hero work, Akko, based on how witch-y your outfit looks!
1-must_strip_winning=embarrassed,S-sorry everyone, I'm going to just take off something small this round.
1-must_strip_winning=must_strip,I feel kind of bad that the rest of you are, and I'm just going to... well, maybe next round I'll take off a bit more.
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:chiaki=must_strip,Heh-- I don't think I'd have wanted to go anywhere but UA, but I'm flattered you think so, Chiaki!
1-must_strip_winning,consecutiveLosses:2,notSaidMarker:twiceloss,marker:twiceloss=vexed,I lost twice in a row? I-I guess I'll just get it together on the next hand.
1-must_strip_normal=must_strip,Well, I don't want to take off any of my other essential equipment...
1-must_strip_normal=must_strip,I'll take off my kneepads, I suppose...
1-must_strip_normal=must_strip,I always have to be kind of careful when undressing. My gear tends to float away if I'm not--
1-must_strip_normal,consecutiveLosses:2,notSaidMarker:twiceloss,marker:twiceloss=vexed,I lost twice in a row? I-I guess I'll just get it together on the next hand.
1-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:chiaki=must_strip,Heh-- I don't think I'd have wanted to go anywhere but UA, but I'm flattered you think so, Chiaki!
1-must_strip_losing=must_strip,S-so soon?
1-must_strip_losing=must_strip,H-hold on, let me slow this down just a little bit. A good hero knows when to stall for help, after all!
1-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:chiaki=must_strip,Heh-- I don't think I'd have wanted to go anywhere but UA, but I'm flattered you think so, Chiaki!
1-must_strip_losing,consecutiveLosses:2,notSaidMarker:twiceloss,marker:twiceloss=vexed,I lost twice in a row? I-I guess I'll just get it together on the next hand.
1-stripping=stripping,Huh? Oh yeah! When I graduated UA, I had a new costume made. The boots and kneepads on this are a lot more flexible!
1-stripping=stripping,I know it's small, but I had this modification made special, and I really don't want to lose anymore.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:futaba=stripping,Well, I do have a signature move I like to call "comet storm," but it's kind of...
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:marinette=stripping,Y-yeah! I think it makes sense to be <i>kind of</i> embarrassed about this, Ladybug!
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia=stripping,I mean, yeah, Meia, see, watch me spin this kneepad a little bit!
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia=stripping,Well, yeah, if you're in space a lot, is it that weird?
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit=stripping,Y-you think so, Pit? I can do this with stuff like buildings too!
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:akko,alsoPlayingStage:9=stripping,Deku-kun is really special! And I don't know about that, but I know he developed his Quirk super late...
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:rinkah=stripping,O-oh, do you mean Todoroki? He's <i>super</i> busy usually, but sure!
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:9s=stripping,E-er. Well, I can use my Quirk pretty reliably. Is "Blackbox" like Thirteen's Blackhole Quirk? It's kind of a program, but in DNA. Or something?
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:akko,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=stripping,Deku-kun is really special! And I don't know about that, but I know he developed his Quirk super late...


#losing stabilizers
2-stripped=stripped,If I lose again, I'll take off my wristbands and boots, since some of you seem upset about the kneepads... but I hope I don't lose!
2-stripped=stripped,Those kneepads are actually really high-tech, according to Mei Hatsume from the support class!
2-stripped=stripped,No need to be mean... I know it's a small piece.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia=stripped,Almost lost ths one... and umm, yeah! It's just my Quirk! I guess you've been a little preoccupied.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:9s,alsoPlayingStage:0=stripped,Um. I... I mean I suppose with enough technology someone could do something really cool, but t-that's not really what I work with...
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:mei=stripped,I know Mei's a pretty common name for Asian women, but are you much of a gadgets person, Mei?
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit=stripped,Oh <i>yeah</i>! It's one of my favorite moves! I can make criminals just sort of float there helplessly, or I can launch my friends. But um. I can't actually fly. Just float.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:rinkah=stripped,Though, Rinkah, if you do meet Todoroki, could you <i>not</i> tell him we met here? I'd be so embarrassed!
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:marinette=stripped,A-and yeah, I just said that it’d be okay to call me by my first name…
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:futaba=stripped,Un-unfortunately, I think it would just wreck up the place, Futaba, and I'm almost at my property damage insurance quota for the month.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:futaba=stripped,I can't do it <i>now</i>, but I promise to make it up to you later somehow. In a non-s-s-sensual way.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=stripped,Well, Elizabeth, um. If I'm moving around a lot of objects or myself, I need to make sure I don't hurt my knees. I-it's really that simple! D-don't imply something else please!
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=stripped,W-why would I need to do that, Kyu?!
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:akko,alsoPlayingStage:9=heroic,Of course! Just because you start late doesn't mean you can't be a hero, if anything, it's even more motivation!
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:akko,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=heroic,Of course! Just because you start late doesn't mean you can't be a hero, if anything, it's even more motivation!
2-must_strip_winning=must_strip,Wow, who'd have though UA would prepare us for situations like this one? I'm doing really well! Well, until I lost this hand.
2-must_strip_winning=must_strip,Okay, so, last time was something small... I <i>guess</i> I can take off two pieces like I did the first round...
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:chiaki=must_strip,Hmm... I guess the tail end of puberty are when talents are at their strongest, Chiaki...
2-must_strip_winning,consecutiveLosses:2,notSaidMarker:twiceloss,marker:twiceloss=vexed,I lost twice in a row? I-I guess I'll just get it together on the next hand.
2-must_strip_normal=must_strip,So my boots and my wrist-cuffs... That's a mouthful. Why don't we just call them "Uravity Stabilizers!"
2-must_strip_normal=must_strip,You can call these my stabilizers...
2-must_strip_normal=must_strip,I know I didn't exactly take off a lot last time. I'll get more this go... starting with my cuffs. Then I'll get my boots!
2-must_strip_normal,consecutiveLosses:2,notSaidMarker:twiceloss,marker:twiceloss=vexed,I lost twice in a row? I-I guess I'll just get it together on the next hand.
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:chiaki=must_strip,Hmm... I guess the tail end of puberty are when talents are at their strongest, Chiaki...
2-must_strip_losing=must_strip,Huh? Oh no, really? But aren't I already wearing the least out of anyone here? Hnng, okay. I'll take off my wrist gear and boots. If I don't pair them, I get kind of disoriented.
2-must_strip_losing=must_strip,W-well. A hero keeps promises. And I suppose I'm keeping the rest of you from doing anything uncomfortable.
2-must_strip_losing,consecutiveLosses:2,notSaidMarker:twiceloss,marker:twiceloss=vexed,I lost twice in a row? I-I guess I'll just get it together on the next hand.
2-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:chiaki=must_strip,Hmm... I guess the tail end of puberty are when talents are at their strongest, Chiaki...
2-stripping=stripping,--Oh, sorry! I must look really silly. Let me just release those. It shouldn't happen again!
2-stripping=stripping,I find these really comfortable, to be honest. Like a hug for your wrists. And legs.
2-stripping=stripping,I've gotten better at it over the years, but my Quirk makes me really nauseous if I'm not careful.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:9s,alsoPlayingStage:0=stripping,"Biologically attuned?" Gosh, you're such a quick study, 9S. you and Deku-kun would get along perfectly. Most people have Quirks!
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:rinkah=stripping,Well, everyone's a little different, Rinkah! I think it's great how everyone's trying their best to stand out!
2-stripping,totalMales:0=stripping,Just between us girls, when I <i>really</i> overdo it with my Quirk I get the <i>worst</i> cramps.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit=stripping,W-well, it's kind of hard to tell, but I'm actually kinda wobbly like this. But I'm still a lot better at it than when I was a teenager!
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia=stripping,W-well, Meia, that's mostly accurate! Everyone at my school has a different Quirk!
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia=stripping,Well, mostly! Something like 80% of people on Earth have a Quirk. They can be really strong or weak, but they're all unique!
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:marinette=stripping,W-well yeah, but I don't get why I'd need to be too worried about just expressing myself…
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:futaba=stripping,Huh? Yeah, Futaba, how'd you know I was going to call them stabilizers...?


#losing belt
3-stripped=stripped,The nice thing about manipulating gravity is that it's easy to bounce right back up.
3-stripped,marker:tricks=stripped,Well, I'm less worried that this is a trick to make my powers a bit less controlled, and more a trick just to see me naked. Um. It's not that, is it?
3-stripped,marker:meia_school=vexed,School wasn't super fun for you, huh?
3-stripped,marker:meia_quirks=calm,I have a friend who's always invisible, one who can turn his skin rock-hard, another who can talk to animals... lots of stuff!
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:futaba=interested,Well, you're certainly very smart, Futaba. I think, weirdly, you and Mineta would get along... This scares me.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:marinette=stripped,W-w-what? Is there something worse if we get embarrassed?!
3-must_strip_winning=must_strip,Well, that's the last of my support items... It feels good to win, but this isn't maybe the best place to gloat.
3-must_strip_winning=heroic,Woo! Even though I was tricked into coming, I'm still doing pretty well! At least I'm not showing any real skin yet...
3-must_strip_winning,consecutiveLosses:2,notSaidMarker:twiceloss,marker:twiceloss=vexed,I lost twice in a row? I-I guess I'll just get it together on the next hand.
3-must_strip_normal=must_strip,W-well, I'm down to my last small piece, which I'm sure <i>somebody</i> is happy about.
3-must_strip_normal=must_strip,I lost again!? Oh no...
3-must_strip_normal=happy,Even when it's embarrassing, a hero gives it her all!
3-must_strip_normal,consecutiveLosses:2,notSaidMarker:twiceloss,marker:twiceloss=vexed,I lost twice in a row? I-I guess I'll just get it together on the next hand.
3-must_strip_losing=embarrassed,<i>Gulp.</i> At least I had a good run with my hero gear...
3-must_strip_losing=must_strip,I really should turn this game around...
3-must_strip_losing,consecutiveLosses:2,notSaidMarker:twiceloss,marker:twiceloss=vexed,I lost twice in a row? I-I guess I'll just get it together on the next hand.
3-stripping=stripping,Bye bye, belt.
3-stripping,marker:ace_tricks=stripping,I've got a few pouches in here, it'd have been pretty funny to have hidden some aces, right? No? Um... okay then.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia=stripping,I-I'll be okay, Meia, I'm just getting a lot more embarrassed...! I-I don't usually do this kind of thing.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:9s=stripping,I-is that White Chlorination Syndrome thingy you were talking about responsible for Quirks?
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:futaba=stripping,Well, no... I'm just going to take off my belt. It's got storage and stuff...
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:1-10=stripping,Sei, were you serious when you said you hid aces in your pockets? That's cheating! But um. It wouldn't have really hurt, would it, in terms of not getting naked?
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:marinette=stripping,Let me slip off my belt, Marinette…
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit=stripping,Y-y-you don't need to laugh! This is already really embarrassing!


#losing costume
4-stripped=stripped,Huh? It wraps through my legs a little bit. It's... cozy!
4-stripped=stripped,It does go between my legs, but it helps take advantage of my center of gravity. It's nothing weird!
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:9s,alsoPlayingStage:0=stripped,W-well. This has been an experience talking with you, 9S. I don't necessarily think it was a good one.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:saki=heroic,Absolutely! The first thing you can do is be comfortable with who you are!
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit=stripped,W-well, yeah. Like my IDs, or bandages, or my house keys.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit=stripped,I-I-I don't really have pockets in my suit. I need s-somewhere to put my stuff, you know.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit=stripped,It's really useful for helping me find my center of balance, but it's nice to have pockets in a bodysuit, you know?
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:futaba=stripped,Yep. You and Mineta would <i>definitely</i> get along, Futaba.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:marinette=stripped,Um, okay! It's the nudity thing more than anything else. I can't promise I won't be shy but I'll try not to have a meltdown…
4-must_strip_winning=nauseous,Okay. It's just like a locker room, or sparring practice... Except for the rest of you here, in various states of actual undress.
4-must_strip_winning=must_strip,It's just like going to the beach, I suppose. And it <i>is</i> kinda warm in here...
4-must_strip_winning,consecutiveLosses:2,notSaidMarker:twiceloss,marker:twiceloss=vexed,I lost twice in a row? I-I guess I'll just get it together on the next hand.
4-must_strip_normal=must_strip,M-my full suit?
4-must_strip_normal=must_strip,I guess I should just act like it's a locker room...
4-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:d.va,alsoPlayingStage:4-10=must_strip,Well, since D.Va already took off her suit, I feel a little less weird about doing this...
4-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:3-8=must_strip,Well, since Gwen already took off her suit, I feel a little less weird about doing this...
4-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:samus,alsoPlayingStage:3-7=must_strip,Well, since Samus already took off her suit, I feel a little less weird about doing this...
4-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:seven,alsoPlayingStage:2-6=must_strip,Well, since Seven already took off her suit, I feel a little less weird about doing this...
4-must_strip_normal,consecutiveLosses:2,notSaidMarker:twiceloss,marker:twiceloss=vexed,I lost twice in a row? I-I guess I'll just get it together on the next hand.
4-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=must_strip,Well, since Marinette already took off her suit, I feel a little less weird about doing this...
4-must_strip_normal,totalExposed:0=must_strip,I can stop once I'm down to my underwear, right?
4-must_strip_losing=must_strip,Just saying, if you count my neckbrace and boots as separate items, I've <i>already</i> lost two more pieces... Fine, I'll take my suit off too.
4-must_strip_losing=must_strip,...Okay. I'll just take a deep breath, and then it'll be okay. I'm not going to give up!
4-must_strip_losing,consecutiveLosses:2,notSaidMarker:twiceloss,marker:twiceloss=vexed,I lost twice in a row? I-I guess I'll just get it together on the next hand.
4-stripping=stripping,I actually like that it zips in the back, it's really easy to just float myself up, and... slip out!
4-stripping=stripping,I don't <i>always</i> get picky about my underwear, but at least I wore something <i>cute</i> out today...
4-stripping=stripping,I usually don't worry about my patrol underwear, but um. At least it <i>matches</i> today.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:futaba=stripping,Well... I do feel bad that... um. You're not getting what you expected...
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:4-8=stripping,Futaba! I already gave you a lift! What more could you want...?
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia=stripping,I-I mean, I really like my Quirk, Meia... my entire costume's built around it, after all!
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia=stripping,I'm not really as brave as you, Meia! W-well, not when it comes to this kinda thing.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:marinette=stripping,I sure hope so, this villain of yours has a super scary Quirk!


#losing bra
5-stripped=stripped,E-er. It's not like a hero wears lingerie under her suit. Unless you're, like, Midnight, I think...?
5-stripped=stripped,I'm more worried about comfort than I am about looks when I'm getting ready to suit up and go out on patrol, but I appreciate the compliments... They're not <i>too</i> pink, are they?
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit=stripped,O-oh. W-well then, Pit. T-th-thank you?
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:futaba=stripped,I'm going to regret answering this, but it's-- it's--- it's-- I can't do it! I'm sorry, Futaba!
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:saki,alsoPlayingStage:1-9=stripped,Saki, I think we have the same taste in underwear. I've noticed since you took off your shoes...
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia=stripped,Well, I do run and jump a lot and stuff... w-wait a second, aren't you a pirate and stuff, Meia? This makes me feel a little conflicted...
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia=stripped,Hmm... well yeah, it makes sense, right? You know, for a pirate... shoot, I forgot you were a pirate for a second there! You're too nice, Meia!
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:marinette=heroic,Pffft-- his name is Hawkmoth? What, does he send butterflies after people or something?
5-must_strip_winning=must_strip,Maybe this'll help everyone else feel comfortable? I guess? Hero regulations are... vague about this kind of... public defense.
5-must_strip_winning=must_strip,U-um. Isn't it a bit lewd to-- W-well, that's not much of a defense considering everyone else is... I'll just get started.
5-must_strip_winning,consecutiveLosses:2,notSaidMarker:twiceloss,marker:twiceloss=vexed,I lost twice in a row? I-I guess I'll just get it together on the next hand.
5-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:marinette=embarrassed,There’s sure a lot of weird Quirks out there. I’m glad you’re his nemesis, Ladybug… and stuff. I’ll try not to um. Bug out about this game.
5-must_strip_normal=must_strip,What? I have to... show my chest?
5-must_strip_normal,marker:hotsprings=must_strip,(Okay, Ochako, just pretend like it's a hotspring trip with Tsuyu, Mina, Momo, and the others.)
5-must_strip_normal=embarrassed,F-for sure? I have to...? Um. O-okay.
5-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:marinette=embarrassed,There’s sure a lot of weird Quirks out there. I’m glad you’re his nemesis, Ladybug… and stuff. I’ll try not to um. Bug out about this game.
5-must_strip_normal,consecutiveLosses:2,notSaidMarker:twiceloss,marker:twiceloss=vexed,I lost twice in a row? I-I guess I'll just get it together on the next hand.
5-must_strip_losing=nauseous,This is <i>really</i> not going according to plan. B-but a Pro Hero has to be resourceful!
5-must_strip_losing=vexed,This is like, a hallucination Quirk, right? Or a bad dream?
5-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:marinette=embarrassed,There’s sure a lot of weird Quirks out there. I’m glad you’re his nemesis, Ladybug… and stuff. I’ll try not to um. Bug out about this game.
5-must_strip_losing,consecutiveLosses:2,notSaidMarker:twiceloss,marker:twiceloss=vexed,I lost twice in a row? I-I guess I'll just get it together on the next hand.
5-stripping=stripping,A-an athletic bra is great when you're running around for the support it provides, but um. I'd kind of prefer other support items at this stage.
5-stripping=stripping,A-ah, s-sorry, give me a second. This is kinda tight.
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:marinette=stripping,Um, by chance do you have other bug themed heroes you work with? I know a group of cat-themed heroes…
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:futaba=stripping,Oh, well, I'm glad you-- <i>IT'S A QUIRK, NOT A KINK, FUTABA!</i>
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:futaba=stripping,I'm-- um, it's a Quirk, not a kink, Futaba!


#lost all clothing
6-stripped=stripped,W-well, a hero always rises past her embarrassment and to the challenge! Plus Ultra!
6-stripped=stripped,I'm going to do my best to not lose again! Plus Ultra!
6-stripped,alsoPlaying:futaba=embarrassed,I-I-I don't want to talk about what my interests are.
6-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit=stripped,W-well! A hero always does her best! Plus Ultra--! Oh, do you not have a catchphrase, Pit? What about the hero school you went to's?
6-stripped,alsoPlaying:marinette=stripped,Well, there's sure a lot of weird Quirks out there. So I'm glad this Hawkmoth villain has a nemesis like you, Ladybug!
6-must_strip_winning=must_strip,Well, I suppose at this stage in the game it would be... Kind of cowardly to back out...
6-must_strip_winning=must_strip,Um. I kind of realized something. I know this is going to be kind of disappointing, but I didn't exactly prepare for this... Sorry if I'm a little... <i>shaggy.</i>
6-must_strip_winning,consecutiveLosses:2,notSaidMarker:twiceloss,marker:twiceloss=vexed,I lost twice in a row? I-I guess I'll just get it together on the next hand.
6-must_strip_winning,count-villain:3=must_strip,D-do I really have to get naked in front of <i>them</i>?
6-must_strip_winning,count-villain:3=shy,N-no, not like this, in front of all these villains!
6-must_strip_winning,count-villain:1=must_strip,D-do I really have to get naked in front of <i>them</i>?
6-must_strip_winning,count-hero:2=happy,Well, it'll be just like a trip to the sauna or some mountain hotsprings with other Pro Heroes.
6-must_strip_winning,count-hero:4=heroic,O-okay. Since it's just other heroes and ~player~, who I think's a hero too...
6-must_strip_normal,marker:art_class=nauseous,Pretend it's art class again, pretend it's art class, pretend it's art class...
6-must_strip_normal=must_strip,I-I'll do it, but it's rude to stare!
6-must_strip_normal,consecutiveLosses:2,notSaidMarker:twiceloss,marker:twiceloss=vexed,I lost twice in a row? I-I guess I'll just get it together on the next hand.
6-must_strip_losing=heroic,Ah-- Um. I'll admit this is a little beyond my comfort zone. But here I go!
6-must_strip_losing=must_strip,Is one of you using a Quirk to make me lose?
6-must_strip_losing,consecutiveLosses:2,notSaidMarker:twiceloss,marker:twiceloss=vexed,I lost twice in a row? I-I guess I'll just get it together on the next hand.
6-stripping=stripping,<i>Gulp</i>

#OPPONENT MUST STRIP
#These lines are spoken when an opponent must strip, but the character does not yet know what they will take off.
#Writing different variations is important here, as these lines will be spoken about thirty times per game.
#The "human" versions of the lines will only be spoken if the human player is stripping.

-2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Um. Meia?
-2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=calm,You’re so composed about this, Meia!
-2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:2=shy,E-er, w-wait a second, are you just going to take off--

-1-male_human_must_strip=interested,So... ~name~, are you taking off something big?
-1-male_human_must_strip=interested,He-hey, ~name~, so now that you've seen me... um, do everything...
-1-male_must_strip=interested,So... ~name~, are you taking off something big?
-1-male_must_strip=interested,He-hey, ~name~, so now that you've seen me... um, do everything...
-1-male_must_strip,target:captain_america,targetStage:0=happy,Ohh…
-1-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:3=serious,I guess you’re not counting that support “Pod” of yours as an item… So maybe it’s a focus for…
-1-male_must_strip,target:captain_america,targetStage:1=interested,You know, Captain America, you remind me a lot of a dear friend...
-1-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:2=heroic,You’re really attached to that visor of yours, 9S. I bet it’s really important to your Quirk!
-1-male_must_strip,target:mccree,targetStage:0=serious,<i>You</i> look like an outlaw, Mr. McCree... Though you also look kind of like Snipe...
-1-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:1=shy,Hmm… I guess you have some sort of special skill with machines, based on your Pod and how much you like to talk about numbers.
-1-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:1=gravity,W-well, better you than me, Pit!
-1-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:0=serious,You’re kind of dressed like a villain, 9S.
-1-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:2=embarrassed,O-oh no. I re-re-really hope it's nothing big this time!
-1-male_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:american=shy,ost of the stuff I know about America I know from comic books. And All Might’s special moves.
-1-male_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:fighter=gravity,Gunhead trained me in mixed martial arts! I’m actually really threatening in close combat. Hi-ya! Wh-whoa!
-1-male_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:magic=interested,You know, I always did want to be a sorcerer growing up… Is that weird?
-1-female_human_must_strip=happy,Oh, ~name~! You've been playing really cute so far!
-1-female_human_must_strip=heroic,Hm. I feel like this has brought us... Um. Closer together, ~name~, huh?
-1-female_human_must_strip=serious,Brr. It's kind of cold here! I won't rush you, ~name~, but the sooner this is over the sooner we can try and put this behind us.

-1-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=serious,Hey, wait a second!
-1-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:witch=happy,Oh, are you… A witch? Like, an actual one? I know some Quirks are mystical, but actual magic seems neat!
-1-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=shy,W-well, that's another loss for you, Chiaki...
-1-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:2=vexed,Argh, sorry Wii Fit Trainer!
-1-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=vexed,Your manner of speaking isn't really helping your case, Chiaki...
-1-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:rwby=heroic,Hm… You’re part of that color-school. Beacon Academy, right, ~name~? I hear the heroes trained there are pretty flashy! And I’ve also heard you have a really great support program!
-1-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0=interested,Whoa, do you have a teleportation Quirk of some sort?
-1-female_must_strip,target:tracer,targetStage:0=interested,Wait, <i>the</i> Tracer?!
-1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:4=serious,Aimee, I probably should’ve thought about this sooner…
-1-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:3=shy,It’s k-kind of funny, I was actually talking a lot about your bra earlier, but I f-f-forgot to compliment your legs!
-1-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity=gravity,Hmm… Saki, you don’t wear a lot of makeup either, huh?

To calm my nerves, and it’s not like we won’t… you know, have seen… oh gosh.
-1-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=embarrassed,I think a looooong soak in a hotspring or a bathhouse would be just what I need to unwind after... all of this...

-1-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:american=interested,Most of the stuff I know about America I know from comic books. And All Might’s special moves.
-1-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0=interested,D.Va, does the VA in your name stand for Virginia? Like Virginia Smash?
-1-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:fighter=gravity,Gunhead trained me in mixed martial arts! I’m actually really threatening in close combat. Hi-ya! Wh-whoa!
-1-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=interested,Um, sure, Marinette, but I think I’ve h-h-had all the excitement I can handle for today.
-1-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba,priority:990,marker:saki_befriend_furavity=calm,Hm... Yeah, Futaba, I have! Should we... do something nice for her?

-1-female_must_strip,target:alpha,targetStage:0=interested,Hey, wait a second, Alpha, do I know you from somewhere...?
-1-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:magic=interested,You know, I always did want to be a sorcerer growing up… Is that weird?
-1-female_must_strip,target:alpha,targetStage:1=shy,W-wait a second. Alpha are you... really here? Or are you just... a hologram? I sure hope this isn't like my First Year campout...
-1-female_must_strip,target:annie,targetStage:0=calm,Hm. You’re a student, Annie? What kind of course do you study? I’m guessing general studies or business...
-1-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity=vexed,Oracle…? Like your hero name…? Why am I getting a strange reminder of that La Brava villain right now, Futaba…?
-1-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:3=embarrassed,Hm. Your stockings are next, I'm guessing?
-1-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:2=happy,Well, you’re very competitive, at least! I think that’s an American thing, anyway…
-1-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:4=shy,Hmm. It’s kind of strange having to react <i>less</i> surprised as you lose more items, Twilight Sparkle.
-1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:3=shy,I guess being able to use some Quirk-unlocking item is kind of a Quirk itself…
-1-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=vexed,<i>MEI? BOOBS MEI?</i>
-1-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:1=serious,You <i>are</i> really chesty, though…
-1-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:2=calm,Hmm. So I’m guessing you have all that thick insulation because of some sort of temperature Quirk?
-1-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:5=heroic,I promise I won’t give Mei the <i>cold shoulder</i>...
-1-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:3=embarrassed,I guess you play like Momo studied: You like to get the big tasks done first.
-1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=calm,You’re so composed about this, Meia!

-1-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:2=interested,You’re an odd one, Twilight Sparkle.
-1-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=heroic,Mercy! What a pretty name!
-1-female_must_strip,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=interested,Huh!
-1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:2=embarrassed,I think I wasn’t clear earlier. So a Quirk is like a power you’re born with…
-1-female_must_strip,target:neo,targetStage:0=interested,You're Neopolitan, that famous criminal, aren't you?
-1-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:1=calm,(Saki again. She seems Quirkless. So of <i>course</i> I should help her out!)
-1-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:1=serious,You know, I-I was thinking that last play was kind of smart, TS, now you d-don’t have to--
-1-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:3=happy,D-don't worry, Saki. I believe in you!
-1-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0=happy,Oh! Your hair’s… Really bright, Sei!
-1-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:1=shy,Hm… I’ve never heard of the White Knights. Is that a medic organization or…?
-1-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:2=vexed,Should you maybe slow down on the liquor, Sei? It can’t be healthy for you to just keep going like that…
-1-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:0=interested,Huh! What’s your Quirk, Twilight Sparkle? Something to do with stars or shadows, I’m guessing, based on your name.
-1-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:3=interested,W-well, whoever you work with, Sei, you certainly seem well-equipped...
-1-female_must_strip,target:shego,targetStage:0=vexed,I <i>really</i> wish someone had caught that black-market equipment specialist.
-1-female_must_strip,target:sonya,targetStage:0=happy,Oh! Are you trying to cosplay my friend Froppy, Sonya?
-1-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:1=heroic,Oh! With all the bunny motifs, maybe you have some sort of jumping or reflex Quirk? Or hearing? Hmm…
-1-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=interested,Er, I’m obligated to ask, Streaming-chan, is that camera something you need to have on you?
-1-female_must_strip,target:tracer,targetStage:1=heroic,Time-related Quirks are super rare, but to think you can use yours to phase through stuff, or rewind time, or dash forward through space…
-1-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=shy,S-seriously, Streaming-chan, I don’t know what you do professionally…
-1-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:0=embarrassed,(Saki's even more embarrassed than I am. I have to help her!)
-1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0=heroic,Interesting costume! I’m trying to think of what Quirk a hero named Ladybug might have…
-1-female_must_strip,target:sonya,targetStage:5=calm,W-wait, w-what are you doing?
-1-female_must_strip,target:marceline,targetStage:1=heroic,I kind of want to give you a touch to see how our Quirks would interact--
-1-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:1=interested,I get it! Wii Fit Trainer… Well, that describes your profession! All of us, in good shape together!
-1-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:3=serious,You’re so weird, D.Va.
-1-female_must_strip,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=interested,Hm…
-1-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:0=happy,Felicia! Do you happen to know the Pussycats?
-1-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:1=embarrassed,You just have a Cat Quirk, huh? It's um. Kind of like Tsu's.
-1-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0=interested,Y-you seem nice, at least, Florina. Just stay calm--
-1-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0=happy,You look like you’re fresh from a workout!
-1-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=shy,Oh no, Futaba looks so innocent! Surely you were tricked into coming here, right?
-1-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:1=calm,You know, Futaba, you're supposed to be really good with computers, right?
-1-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:2=gravity,Phew. It looks like you're not <i>too</i> um... you know, perverted. Because you're wearing two shirts! Well... one now... Um...
-1-female_must_strip,target:marceline,targetStage:2=vexed,Do you actually drink blood, Marceline?
-1-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:0=interested,Huh! Is that a Quirk school uniform, Videl? Where did you learn to master your powers?
-1-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:4=shy,I-I suppose it's time for that surprise you were talking about... W-what is it? (Please don't be something creepy!)
-1-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:4=shy,F-Futaba, a-are you not... wearing underwear? I-i-is that what this is?
-1-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:0=interested,A Spider-Woman?
-1-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:3=gravity,Well, if you're sure, Futaba, hold on! There! You're up and away!
-1-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:3=gravity,If you're sure. I know it doesn't look like I just gave her a pat, but feel free to act like I did, everyone, ~player~ probably won't notice.
-1-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:2=happy,I’m actually really impressed! Your Japanese is super good, Gwen!
-1-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:5=happy,Oh! I think I get it now!
-1-female_must_strip,target:marceline,targetStage:0=interested,Er. You don’t happen to know someone named Toga Himiko, do you, Marceline?
-1-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:1=heroic,So are you a hero or a vigilante? I have this weird itch at the back of my brain whenever I try to think about where I’ve heard about you…
-1-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Y-yeah, Mahiru, you don't really have all that much small stuff...
-1-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=calm,Really? Are you sure you want to do that, Mahiru...?
-1-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0=happy,Whoa! Those wings are super cool! And I’m definitely not talking to just distract myself from the game.
-1-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:3=shy,Y-yikes. (I guess we're going to see if she... really wasn't wearing panties...)
-1-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:1=interested,Huh. How <i>does</i> that Quirk work, Hermione?
-1-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0=happy,Oh! I think I’ve heard of Hogwarts.
-1-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:5=shy,OH <i>NO</i>!
-1-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:4=interested,I feel like from one hero to another, I should be doing more to help you out… B-but the context for this is so weird!
-1-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:7=shy,Huh. You haven’t shown off your-- your n-n-nipples yet, t-t-though.
-1-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:3=calm,Hmm…
-1-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:6=shy,Not much now, Ms. “Alien” Twilight Sparkle!




#OPPONENT REMOVING ACCESSORY
#These lines are spoken when an opponent removes a small item that does not cover any skin.
#Typically, characters are fine with this when they are fully dressed but less satisfied as they become more naked.
#Note that all "removing" lines are NOT spoken to human players. Characters will skip straight from "6-male_human_must_strip" to "6-male_removed_accessory", for example.

#stage-specific lines that override the stage-generic ones
male_removing_accessory=calm,Well, at least your ~clothing~ is something small, ~name~.
male_removing_accessory=heroic,Give it your best, ~name~!
male_removing_accessory=embarrassed,Wow, I didn't know men wore so many accessories, ~name~!
male_removing_accessory=interested,Hm. I didn't know your ~clothing~ would be so popular this year!
male_removed_accessory=happy,I wouldn't mind if you took off something bigger, though! Only if you wanted.
male_removed_accessory=interested,Hm, your ~clothing~...? ...Seems like a good choice, ~name~.
male_removed_accessory=vexed,Not that your ~clothing~ was a bad play, I'm just surprised you brought along something so small. Though Deku-kun would probably bring a notebook to something like this...
male_removed_accessory=interested,I've actually seen a lot of men wearing stuff like that lately, ~name~. Is it more comfortable without it on, or... Um...
female_removing_accessory=happy,Cool ~clothing~, ~name~!
female_removing_accessory=embarrassed,I think I have to put on so much gear when I'm working that I tend to not wear stuff like ~name~'s ~clothing~ in my casualwear.
female_removing_accessory=happy,Oh! Your ~clothing~? That's a good choice, whether you're trying to win or just trying to play.
female_removing_accessory=interested,Oh gosh. ~name~. Where did you get your ~clothing~?
female_removing_accessory=vexed,I actually wear gloves while I sleep so I don't accidentally float my bed with my Quirk. So I can really see the value in small, sensible stuff like ~name~'s ~clothing~.
female_removing_accessory=nauseous,Hmm... Cute ~clothing~, ~name~!
female_removed_accessory=happy,Hmm. If your ~clothing~ gets damaged, I think my friend Momo might be able to make a new version of that...
female_removed_accessory=heroic,See, that wasn't so bad, was it, ~name~?
female_removed_accessory=heroic,I think this game can be kind of fun if we play like ~name~.
female_removed_accessory=interested,I thought ~name~'s accessory was cute!
female_removed_accessory=serious,Don't quit or feel ashamed, ~name~. We're all in this together. Um. Some of us more than others, but I'm trying to make sure we're all safe. At least.
female_removed_accessory=happy,Be brave, ~name~! It's going to be fine!


#fully clothed
0-male_removing_accessory=interested,Your ~clothing~?
0-male_removing_accessory=calm,~name~'s taking off his ~clothing~?
0-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Th-though I wouldn't want you to lose! I just-- Um. Is it awkward in here or is it just me?
0-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0=interested,Those seem like kind of a hassle though... Do they help you stay focused in combat?
0-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:1=happy,H-he also worked really, really hard to get where he is as a hero. I think you two would have a lot in common, actually.
0-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=vexed,Even a name like “9S” is kind of shadowy and mysterious…
0-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:american=interested,Though I never expected to learn something like this!
0-male_removed_accessory=interested,Hmm. Is that something you brought because you're sentimental, or does it help you with your Quirk, ~name~?
0-male_removed_accessory=embarrassed,Well, I suppose I'm still fully dressed... Which is good for me but not so great if ~name~ keeps losing!
0-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:twilight=heroic,Aliens aren’t real. People like, say, Twilight, look unusual, but are just like you or me!
0-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1=shy,And what’s with the blindfold? I thought for sure you’d take that off first!
0-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1=shy,Pfft. Aliens aren’t real. Just because some people look strange doesn’t make them extraterrestrial.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:2=shy,Th-though I don't think I'd want to play this game with him.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Er. If you could <i>not</i> pay it back tenfold and keep being nice, I know <i>I'd</i> be a lot happier.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2=shy,I-I mean I'm sure glad your pants didn't fall down, at least!
0-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2=shy,E-er. W-well, at least we can pretend like nothing's happened or gone wrong, right?
0-female_removing_accessory=heroic,Shoot! Can I take off my helmet so ~name~ doesn't have to take off her ~clothing~?
0-female_removing_accessory=embarrassed,Um. If you're here to have fun, ~name~, I suppose it's reasonable to go with something small like your ~clothing~.
0-female_removing_accessory=heroic,Oh! Are you trying to make a show of this, ~name~?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:0=happy,I’m… Actually kind of a fan. I did a report on you back in school!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=interested,I'm kind of nervous to find out what your Quirk could be...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=vexed,You aren't associated with that hand-guy, are you, Chiaki!?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:0=interested,While anyone can certainly be a hero, I think based on how you’re dressed it’s probably not a strict regimen.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:0=happy,Oh, so you have a vocal quirk like Present Mic? He's such a funny teacher.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=interested,Y-you look even better without your tie, Saki!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=vexed,--W-WAIT! We can leave!? I-I'm gonna go too!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=shy,What kind of Quirk do you use with a belt like that, Florina? Oh! You seem so jittery! M-maybe it's for like... o-or maybe you're just embarrassed...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity,priority:990=shy,A-ah! No, Futaba, we shouldn't embarrass her, we should focus on stuff we can do to cheer her up!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette=interested,I'm sorry, I was kind of... tricked into coming, but is it a polka dot theme today?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette=interested,Between Marinette and Mahiru, it seems we have a polka dot theme tonight...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=happy,Oh! That's a great idea. It'll be a lot easier with the two of us, too!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Oh, duh, it has to be something sound related. D.Va, like diva! I get it. Kind on the nose, though…
0-female_removing_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:0=vexed,I know you're the quiet type. But that doesn't mean I don't know a villain when I see one.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=calm,It’s… Kinda rare to see a “demon”-type Quirk…
0-female_removing_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:0=calm,You look so… healthy. And you’re a doctor? What’s <i>your</i> Quirk like?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:chiaki=shy,I-I'm not really happy with this type of thing either, you two.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:2=vexed,You… Surely needed those for something interesting, right? Just for listening to music?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=vexed,Do you have a Quirk that makes you need an outfit like that? Or do you just like to dress all historical?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1=interested,I think digital Quirks are really underrated. You probably get access to all kinds of unique stuff!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:1=gravity,I really like my Quirk and it’s super useful for hero stuff and for more conventional trades, but I think everyone wishes they had a little more time.

0-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:0=happy,Well, you seem like you've got a legacy angle, and you like to fight in tournaments... I bet you'd have done will at UA!
0-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:american=interested,Though I never expected to learn something like this!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:0=shy,I'm always really flattered and amazed by how popular Pro Hero color palettes enter the mainstream wardrobe.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=nauseous,…Unless you had some sort of digestion Quirk? I used to know someone who gained a lot of strength whenever he’d eat sugar…
0-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=interested,I’ve never heard of Glitch City either… But White Knights and Valkyries sounds awfully like a Pro Hero group of some sort…
0-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=heroic,You’re really loaded out with lots of gear. I can see you’re a utility-type Hero!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=heroic,You remind me a lot of Ingenium!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:1=interested,Do you happen to have an affinity for technology, other Mei?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:0=embarrassed,Um! S-sorry, that’s a really embarrassing reaction.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:2=interested,Huh. That’s weird. I’ve never heard of a Quirk-granting object before but that does kind of make sense…
0-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=serious,Wh-what? You have multiple Quirks!?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:0=nauseous,She’s one of the few people I know with teeth like that…
0-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=interested,Careful, Mahiru! People might be able to see up your skirt!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=embarrassed,E-er, Mahiru, there might be a more... ladylike way of...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=interested,Huh, that's such an interesting pattern! Our school uniform was just a flat red tie.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=happy,The polka dots look so pretty!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=gravity,What kind of stuff does the “Fairy” Quirk let you do? Flight, right? Good! I’m going to go ahead and try avoid being embarrassed. I’d turn pinker than you!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=heroic,Those are nice shoes, Saki! I think I have a pair just like them!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,marker:pink_underwear=embarrassed,H-hey! D-don't look up her skirt, everyone!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0=embarrassed,Well, you only have two arms and two legs, so I’m guessing you have a web-based Quirk? Or…
0-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=vexed,But can you leave the rest of us out of it?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=vexed,You must have practiced this game <i>a lot</i> if you’re bored enough to try something like this. Or crazy...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:0=serious,Are you American? You certainly seem quite sure of yourself…
0-female_removed_accessory=calm,A hero's supposed to protect people... I hope this'll be okay.
0-female_removed_accessory=happy,Well, I hope we can all stay cheery!
0-female_removed_accessory=embarrassed,Hm. This is such an odd game.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:1=vexed,Either way, it’s a very interesting style. If you want lots of pieces to win the game...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=shy,T-that could work, actually. What do you think Saki?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=shy,I think that idea could work! Saki, what kind of superpower would you want?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=shy,I’m totally paying attention to your rebuttal. Yep. Sure am! Definitely not using this to focus on the fact that I think you can fly to distance myself from how much better at… Being composed you are.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=embarrassed,Er-- A hero should know when to go for backup, but I guess there's no running here...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Huh? Not a hero? You just carry around all that stuff for work?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:1=shy,Gah! I sure hope not!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:1=serious,I'll take you down, and bring you to justice, Neopolitan!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:2=embarrassed,W-wait, why shouldn't I approve? Are you helping the villains!? That seems so out of character!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:1=shy,I-I hope you are just as unshy as he is. F-for your sake.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=shy,T-that could be pretty damaging to some people’s careers, I think. Y-you know?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:6=nauseous,And this is how you… Process that, I suppose I’ll just relax and try to keep an eye on everyone else.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=shy,Tomura Shigaraki! He's real bad news and talks about video games as much as you do! I'm keeping an eye on you, Chiaki...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=heroic,D-don't worry! I believe in you! Stay Plus Ultra, Saki! (Phew.)
0-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=vexed,Hmm… I wonder if Tohru would employ the same strategy… Though it’s not like anyone can see her when she’s n-n-naked.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:3=serious,What? Are you even paying attention, D.Va?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:2=happy,Or maybe it’s an American thing I don’t quite get. I’ll admit most of what I know about the US comes from All Might or Deku…

0-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Y-you can't get me to let <i>my</i> guard down!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:5=shy,But I have a feeling you’ve probably inspired a lot of interesting sets of tactics in a game like this…
0-female_removed_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:2=embarrassed,U-um. Anyway, I have a friend whose Quirk was similar to yours, in how he could phase through solid objects. Could I get an autograph for him? I-if it’s no trouble.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Comfort should come before style, I think! I mean, I dress in a ridiculous costume like this!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=heroic,I think everyone's confused why you didn't just let go of your camera!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:1=embarrassed,T-though you don't have to act the part, I hope you know...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:saki=interested,H-hey, Chiaki, I think Saki wants to ask you something...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=shy,Your costume certainly looks like it’s built for impacts or acceleration. And you’re so serious! I-I could probably stand to gain some composure from you.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:annie=happy,On the plus side, you’re not quite as… <i>Unusual</i> as some of the support-class at UA! I bet you lead a fun life, at least!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:2=heroic,Hm… I’m keeping an eye on you…
0-female_removed_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:1=heroic,I haven’t been out of the academy for very long, but I thought your “Chronal Acceleration” Quirk was awesome!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:chiaki=embarrassed,We-well. L-looks like we're in this together, Saki and Chiaki.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:1=nauseous,It’ll… take too long explain so I’m just going to pretend like it didn’t happen…
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:1=embarrassed,W-well, I'll tell her about this. N-not about the game, but I'm sure she'd be really flattered!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:1=gravity,Though how are you floating? I know there’s some complicated Quirks out there, but “Vampire” and all its powers seems very strong...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:1=embarrassed,N-not like, in a way that’s relevant to this game!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:1=interested,I mean, obviously something medical related… It’s kind of hard to just be a doctor without something extra these days…
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Well, I think you’re starting to get <i>less</i> outfitted. But it’s what you do that makes you a hero, I think.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=shy,I-it’s very strange to have more than one! I only know a villain with that sort of ability set!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:2=shy,I wouldn’t want to-- Especially not with another woman-- I just-- Hmrmhph!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2,count-bodysuit:2=embarrassed,I mean, some of us dress in some really silly costumes, Saki. I wouldn't worry about your shoes!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=embarrassed,Ha! So you are a he--r--ohhh. Hrmph. T-that seems like a bad superpower!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=shy,I wish we'd met in less embarrassing circumstances...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:2=embarrassed,P-please?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=calm,Hm... You're braver than you act, huh, Florina?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3=heroic,A guardian spirit? Hmm… that’s kind of like my friend Tokoyami’s Quirk: Dark Shadow!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=heroic,You’re clearly also ready for combat, but I can’t get a good feel for your Quirk…

1-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Th-though I wouldn't want you to lose! I just-- Um. Is it awkward in here or is it just me?
1-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0=interested,Those seem like kind of a hassle though... Do they help you stay focused in combat?
1-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:american=interested,Though I never expected to learn something like this!

1-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1=shy,Pfft. Aliens aren’t real. Just because some people look strange doesn’t make them extraterrestrial.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Er. If you could <i>not</i> pay it back tenfold and keep being nice, I know <i>I'd</i> be a lot happier.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2=shy,I-I mean I'm sure glad your pants didn't fall down, at least!
1-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2=shy,E-er. W-well, at least we can pretend like nothing's happened or gone wrong, right?

1-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1=interested,I think digital Quirks are really underrated. You probably get access to all kinds of unique stuff!

1-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=heroic,You’re really loaded out with lots of gear. I can see you’re a utility-type Hero!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:1=gravity,I really like my Quirk and it’s super useful for hero stuff and for more conventional trades, but I think everyone wishes they had a little more time.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:0=happy,I’m… Actually kind of a fan. I did a report on you back in school!

1-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=vexed,You aren't associated with that hand-guy, are you, Chiaki!?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=shy,What kind of Quirk do you use with a belt like that, Florina? Oh! You seem so jittery! M-maybe it's for like... o-or maybe you're just embarrassed...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:0=interested,While anyone can certainly be a hero, I think based on how you’re dressed it’s probably not a strict regimen.
1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:american=interested,Though I never expected to learn something like this!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:0=happy,Oh, so you have a vocal quirk like Present Mic? He's such a funny teacher.

1-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Comfort should come before style, I think! I mean, I dress in a ridiculous costume like this!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Well, I think you’re starting to get <i>less</i> outfitted. But it’s what you do that makes you a hero, I think.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=shy,Your costume certainly looks like it’s built for impacts or acceleration. And you’re so serious! I-I could probably stand to gain some composure from you.

2-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0=interested,Those seem like kind of a hassle though... Do they help you stay focused in combat?

2-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:1=happy,H-he also worked really, really hard to get where he is as a hero. I think you two would have a lot in common, actually.

2-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1=shy,Pfft. Aliens aren’t real. Just because some people look strange doesn’t make them extraterrestrial.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:2=shy,Th-though I don't think I'd want to play this game with him.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Er. If you could <i>not</i> pay it back tenfold and keep being nice, I know <i>I'd</i> be a lot happier.

2-female_removing_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:0=embarrassed,Um! S-sorry, that’s a really embarrassing reaction.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:2=interested,Huh. That’s weird. I’ve never heard of a Quirk-granting object before but that does kind of make sense…

2-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=vexed,You must have practiced this game <i>a lot</i> if you’re bored enough to try something like this. Or crazy...

2-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=interested,Huh, that's such an interesting pattern! Our school uniform was just a flat red tie.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=happy,The polka dots look so pretty!

2-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:0=serious,Are you American? You certainly seem quite sure of yourself…

2-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=interested,I'm kind of nervous to find out what your Quirk could be...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:0=interested,While anyone can certainly be a hero, I think based on how you’re dressed it’s probably not a strict regimen.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=shy,What kind of Quirk do you use with a belt like that, Florina? Oh! You seem so jittery! M-maybe it's for like... o-or maybe you're just embarrassed...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:3=serious,What? Are you even paying attention, D.Va?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:annie=happy,On the plus side, you’re not quite as… <i>Unusual</i> as some of the support-class at UA! I bet you lead a fun life, at least!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Well, I think you’re starting to get <i>less</i> outfitted. But it’s what you do that makes you a hero, I think.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:1=heroic,I haven’t been out of the academy for very long, but I thought your “Chronal Acceleration” Quirk was awesome!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=shy,Your costume certainly looks like it’s built for impacts or acceleration. And you’re so serious! I-I could probably stand to gain some composure from you.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:1=gravity,Though how are you floating? I know there’s some complicated Quirks out there, but “Vampire” and all its powers seems very strong...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:1=embarrassed,N-not like, in a way that’s relevant to this game!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Huh? Not a hero? You just carry around all that stuff for work?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:2=embarrassed,U-um. Anyway, I have a friend whose Quirk was similar to yours, in how he could phase through solid objects. Could I get an autograph for him? I-if it’s no trouble.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=embarrassed,Ha! So you are a he--r--ohhh. Hrmph. T-that seems like a bad superpower!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:1=serious,I'll take you down, and bring you to justice, Neopolitan!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=embarrassed,Er-- A hero should know when to go for backup, but I guess there's no running here...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=heroic,I think everyone's confused why you didn't just let go of your camera!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:1=embarrassed,T-though you don't have to act the part, I hope you know...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:2=embarrassed,W-wait, why shouldn't I approve? Are you helping the villains!? That seems so out of character!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=shy,I’m totally paying attention to your rebuttal. Yep. Sure am! Definitely not using this to focus on the fact that I think you can fly to distance myself from how much better at… Being composed you are.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:2=embarrassed,P-please?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:chiaki=embarrassed,We-well. L-looks like we're in this together, Saki and Chiaki.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:saki=interested,H-hey, Chiaki, I think Saki wants to ask you something...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:1=shy,I-I hope you are just as unshy as he is. F-for your sake.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:1=vexed,Either way, it’s a very interesting style. If you want lots of pieces to win the game...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:1=shy,Gah! I sure hope not!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=shy,Tomura Shigaraki! He's real bad news and talks about video games as much as you do! I'm keeping an eye on you, Chiaki...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=shy,I'm n-not going to let my guard down!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Y-you can't get me to let <i>my</i> guard down!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=vexed,Hmm… I wonder if Tohru would employ the same strategy… Though it’s not like anyone can see her when she’s n-n-naked.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Comfort should come before style, I think! I mean, I dress in a ridiculous costume like this!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:6=nauseous,And this is how you… Process that, I suppose I’ll just relax and try to keep an eye on everyone else.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:2=heroic,Hm… I’m keeping an eye on you…
2-female_removed_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:1=nauseous,It’ll… take too long explain so I’m just going to pretend like it didn’t happen…
2-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:2=happy,Or maybe it’s an American thing I don’t quite get. I’ll admit most of what I know about the US comes from All Might or Deku…
2-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=heroic,You’re clearly also ready for combat, but I can’t get a good feel for your Quirk…
2-female_removed_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:1=interested,I mean, obviously something medical related… It’s kind of hard to just be a doctor without something extra these days…
2-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=shy,I wish we'd met in less embarrassing circumstances...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2,count-bodysuit:2=embarrassed,I mean, some of us dress in some really silly costumes, Saki. I wouldn't worry about your shoes!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:1=embarrassed,W-well, I'll tell her about this. N-not about the game, but I'm sure she'd be really flattered!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=shy,T-that could work, actually. What do you think Saki?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=shy,I think that idea could work! Saki, what kind of superpower would you want?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3=heroic,A guardian spirit? Hmm… that’s kind of like my friend Tokoyami’s Quirk: Dark Shadow!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:5=shy,But I have a feeling you’ve probably inspired a lot of interesting sets of tactics in a game like this…
2-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=heroic,D-don't worry! I believe in you! Stay Plus Ultra, Saki! (Phew.)
2-female_removed_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:2=shy,I wouldn’t want to-- Especially not with another woman-- I just-- Hmrmhph!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=calm,Hm... You're braver than you act, huh, Florina?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=shy,T-that could be pretty damaging to some people’s careers, I think. Y-you know?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=shy,I-it’s very strange to have more than one! I only know a villain with that sort of ability set!

3-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:saki=interested,H-hey, Chiaki, I think Saki wants to ask you something...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=shy,T-that could be pretty damaging to some people’s careers, I think. Y-you know?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=shy,T-that could work, actually. What do you think Saki?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=shy,I think that idea could work! Saki, what kind of superpower would you want?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:2=embarrassed,P-please?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:2=happy,Or maybe it’s an American thing I don’t quite get. I’ll admit most of what I know about the US comes from All Might or Deku…
3-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:5=shy,But I have a feeling you’ve probably inspired a lot of interesting sets of tactics in a game like this…
3-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=vexed,Hmm… I wonder if Tohru would employ the same strategy… Though it’s not like anyone can see her when she’s n-n-naked.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=heroic,D-don't worry! I believe in you! Stay Plus Ultra, Saki! (Phew.)
3-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=heroic,You’re clearly also ready for combat, but I can’t get a good feel for your Quirk…
3-female_removed_accessory,target:annie=happy,On the plus side, you’re not quite as… <i>Unusual</i> as some of the support-class at UA! I bet you lead a fun life, at least!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=embarrassed,Ha! So you are a he--r--ohhh. Hrmph. T-that seems like a bad superpower!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=shy,Your costume certainly looks like it’s built for impacts or acceleration. And you’re so serious! I-I could probably stand to gain some composure from you.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:3=serious,What? Are you even paying attention, D.Va?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=shy,I'm n-not going to let my guard down!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Y-you can't get me to let <i>my</i> guard down!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:2=heroic,Hm… I’m keeping an eye on you…
3-female_removed_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:1=shy,I-I hope you are just as unshy as he is. F-for your sake.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:1=gravity,Though how are you floating? I know there’s some complicated Quirks out there, but “Vampire” and all its powers seems very strong...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:1=embarrassed,N-not like, in a way that’s relevant to this game!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=calm,Hm... You're braver than you act, huh, Florina?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:chiaki=embarrassed,We-well. L-looks like we're in this together, Saki and Chiaki.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3=heroic,A guardian spirit? Hmm… that’s kind of like my friend Tokoyami’s Quirk: Dark Shadow!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:2=shy,I wouldn’t want to-- Especially not with another woman-- I just-- Hmrmhph!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:2=embarrassed,U-um. Anyway, I have a friend whose Quirk was similar to yours, in how he could phase through solid objects. Could I get an autograph for him? I-if it’s no trouble.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Well, I think you’re starting to get <i>less</i> outfitted. But it’s what you do that makes you a hero, I think.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Huh? Not a hero? You just carry around all that stuff for work?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=heroic,I think everyone's confused why you didn't just let go of your camera!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2,count-bodysuit:2=embarrassed,I mean, some of us dress in some really silly costumes, Saki. I wouldn't worry about your shoes!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=embarrassed,Er-- A hero should know when to go for backup, but I guess there's no running here...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=shy,I’m totally paying attention to your rebuttal. Yep. Sure am! Definitely not using this to focus on the fact that I think you can fly to distance myself from how much better at… Being composed you are.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:1=embarrassed,T-though you don't have to act the part, I hope you know...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:1=interested,I mean, obviously something medical related… It’s kind of hard to just be a doctor without something extra these days…
3-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=shy,I wish we'd met in less embarrassing circumstances...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=shy,I-it’s very strange to have more than one! I only know a villain with that sort of ability set!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:1=serious,I'll take you down, and bring you to justice, Neopolitan!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:2=embarrassed,W-wait, why shouldn't I approve? Are you helping the villains!? That seems so out of character!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:1=heroic,I haven’t been out of the academy for very long, but I thought your “Chronal Acceleration” Quirk was awesome!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:1=nauseous,It’ll… take too long explain so I’m just going to pretend like it didn’t happen…
3-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=shy,Tomura Shigaraki! He's real bad news and talks about video games as much as you do! I'm keeping an eye on you, Chiaki...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:1=embarrassed,W-well, I'll tell her about this. N-not about the game, but I'm sure she'd be really flattered!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:1=shy,Gah! I sure hope not!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Comfort should come before style, I think! I mean, I dress in a ridiculous costume like this!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:6=nauseous,And this is how you… Process that, I suppose I’ll just relax and try to keep an eye on everyone else.

4-male_removing_accessory=calm,Oh, just your ~clothing~, ~name~?
4-male_removing_accessory=interested,Your ~clothing~? And not... something bigger?
4-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:1=happy,H-he also worked really, really hard to get where he is as a hero. I think you two would have a lot in common, actually.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=vexed,Even a name like “9S” is kind of shadowy and mysterious…
4-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Th-though I wouldn't want you to lose! I just-- Um. Is it awkward in here or is it just me?
4-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:american=interested,Though I never expected to learn something like this!
4-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0=interested,Those seem like kind of a hassle though... Do they help you stay focused in combat?
4-male_removed_accessory=happy,Er, I mean, take off whatever you'd like!
4-male_removed_accessory=vexed,I know it's kind of not-very-professional of me, but I'd liked to have seen a <i>bit</i> more.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Er. If you could <i>not</i> pay it back tenfold and keep being nice, I know <i>I'd</i> be a lot happier.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2=shy,I-I mean I'm sure glad your pants didn't fall down, at least!
4-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2=shy,E-er. W-well, at least we can pretend like nothing's happened or gone wrong, right?
4-male_removed_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:2=shy,Th-though I don't think I'd want to play this game with him.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1=shy,And what’s with the blindfold? I thought for sure you’d take that off first!
4-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1=shy,Pfft. Aliens aren’t real. Just because some people look strange doesn’t make them extraterrestrial.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:twilight=heroic,Aliens aren’t real. People like, say, Twilight, look unusual, but are just like you or me!
4-female_removing_accessory=heroic,I'm sorry, ~name~! I know my bodysuit covers almost all of my skin, so please just take off whatever makes you comfortable.
4-female_removing_accessory=happy,Your ~clothing~ is a good choice!
4-female_removing_accessory=calm,I'll admit... I'm kind of happy to keep my suit on, ~name~.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=vexed,You must have practiced this game <i>a lot</i> if you’re bored enough to try something like this. Or crazy...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=nauseous,…Unless you had some sort of digestion Quirk? I used to know someone who gained a lot of strength whenever he’d eat sugar…
4-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=heroic,You’re really loaded out with lots of gear. I can see you’re a utility-type Hero!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=nauseous,I don’t mind being recorded in my day to day work… B-b-ut I’m pretty uncomfortable with the idea that this’ll end up on the internet somewhere.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:0=happy,Well, you seem like you've got a legacy angle, and you like to fight in tournaments... I bet you'd have done will at UA!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=heroic,Those are nice shoes, Saki! I think I have a pair just like them!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,marker:pink_underwear=embarrassed,H-hey! D-don't look up her skirt, everyone!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=vexed,But can you leave the rest of us out of it?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=interested,Y-you look even better without your tie, Saki!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=interested,I’ve never heard of Glitch City either… But White Knights and Valkyries sounds awfully like a Pro Hero group of some sort…
4-female_removing_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:0=happy,I’m… Actually kind of a fan. I did a report on you back in school!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:5=embarrassed,I-I’m sorry I didn’t realize it sooner, but this is kind of a fetish thing for you, isn’t it? I-- don’t really have any hangups like that, but if you're pretending that being an alien...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:1=gravity,I really like my Quirk and it’s super useful for hero stuff and for more conventional trades, but I think everyone wishes they had a little more time.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:3=shy,It’s kind of weird, b-b-but you seem really comfortable while naked, so I g-g-guess that’s a nice way to be!
4-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:american=interested,Though I never expected to learn something like this!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:0=shy,I'm always really flattered and amazed by how popular Pro Hero color palettes enter the mainstream wardrobe.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:1=interested,Do you happen to have an affinity for technology, other Mei?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=vexed,Do you have a Quirk that makes you need an outfit like that? Or do you just like to dress all historical?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1=interested,I think digital Quirks are really underrated. You probably get access to all kinds of unique stuff!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:2=vexed,You… Surely needed those for something interesting, right? Just for listening to music?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:2=interested,Huh. That’s weird. I’ve never heard of a Quirk-granting object before but that does kind of make sense…
4-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0=embarrassed,Well, you only have two arms and two legs, so I’m guessing you have a web-based Quirk? Or…
4-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Oh, duh, it has to be something sound related. D.Va, like diva! I get it. Kind on the nose, though…
4-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=happy,Oh! That's a great idea. It'll be a lot easier with the two of us, too!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=gravity,What kind of stuff does the “Fairy” Quirk let you do? Flight, right? Good! I’m going to go ahead and try avoid being embarrassed. I’d turn pinker than you!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=heroic,You remind me a lot of Ingenium!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=serious,Wh-what? You have multiple Quirks!?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:0=serious,Are you American? You certainly seem quite sure of yourself…
4-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:chiaki=shy,I-I'm not really happy with this type of thing either, you two.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=interested,I'm kind of nervous to find out what your Quirk could be...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:0=embarrassed,Um! S-sorry, that’s a really embarrassing reaction.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=interested,Huh, that's such an interesting pattern! Our school uniform was just a flat red tie.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=happy,The polka dots look so pretty!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=calm,It’s… Kinda rare to see a “demon”-type Quirk…
4-female_removing_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:0=vexed,I know you're the quiet type. But that doesn't mean I don't know a villain when I see one.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=vexed,--W-WAIT! We can leave!? I-I'm gonna go too!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:0=nauseous,She’s one of the few people I know with teeth like that…
4-female_removing_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:0=happy,Oh, so you have a vocal quirk like Present Mic? He's such a funny teacher.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:0=calm,You look so… healthy. And you’re a doctor? What’s <i>your</i> Quirk like?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=shy,What kind of Quirk do you use with a belt like that, Florina? Oh! You seem so jittery! M-maybe it's for like... o-or maybe you're just embarrassed...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette=interested,I'm sorry, I was kind of... tricked into coming, but is it a polka dot theme today?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette=interested,Between Marinette and Mahiru, it seems we have a polka dot theme tonight...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=interested,Careful, Mahiru! People might be able to see up your skirt!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=embarrassed,E-er, Mahiru, there might be a more... ladylike way of...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity,priority:990=shy,A-ah! No, Futaba, we shouldn't embarrass her, we should focus on stuff we can do to cheer her up!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=vexed,You aren't associated with that hand-guy, are you, Chiaki!?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:0=interested,While anyone can certainly be a hero, I think based on how you’re dressed it’s probably not a strict regimen.
4-female_removed_accessory=calm,I don't mind you playing with small stuff, I'm still pretty much covered, after all...
4-female_removed_accessory=vexed,At this stage, I was expecting something a little more practical than that, ~name~.
4-female_removed_accessory=interested,Hmm.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=heroic,I think everyone's confused why you didn't just let go of your camera!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=shy,I’m totally paying attention to your rebuttal. Yep. Sure am! Definitely not using this to focus on the fact that I think you can fly to distance myself from how much better at… Being composed you are.

4-female_removed_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:1=embarrassed,N-not like, in a way that’s relevant to this game!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:2=embarrassed,U-um. Anyway, I have a friend whose Quirk was similar to yours, in how he could phase through solid objects. Could I get an autograph for him? I-if it’s no trouble.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:6=nauseous,And this is how you… Process that, I suppose I’ll just relax and try to keep an eye on everyone else.

5-female_removing_accessory=vexed,I'm really starting to think that taking Tohru's advice on minimalism was the wrong choice.
5-female_removing_accessory=interested,Hm. H-hrm. I think this game c-could actually be a lot of fun if I wasn't here on duty. M-maybe I could even convince some of the other pros to play!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:1=interested,Do you happen to have an affinity for technology, other Mei?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:0=vexed,I know you're the quiet type. But that doesn't mean I don't know a villain when I see one.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=vexed,You must have practiced this game <i>a lot</i> if you’re bored enough to try something like this. Or crazy...
5-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:0=serious,Are you American? You certainly seem quite sure of yourself…
5-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=heroic,You’re really loaded out with lots of gear. I can see you’re a utility-type Hero!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=vexed,--W-WAIT! We can leave!? I-I'm gonna go too!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:5=embarrassed,I-I’m sorry I didn’t realize it sooner, but this is kind of a fetish thing for you, isn’t it? I-- don’t really have any hangups like that, but if you're pretending that being an alien...
5-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=shy,What kind of Quirk do you use with a belt like that, Florina? Oh! You seem so jittery! M-maybe it's for like... o-or maybe you're just embarrassed...
5-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:chiaki=shy,I-I'm not really happy with this type of thing either, you two.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=calm,It’s… Kinda rare to see a “demon”-type Quirk…
5-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=heroic,Those are nice shoes, Saki! I think I have a pair just like them!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,marker:pink_underwear=embarrassed,H-hey! D-don't look up her skirt, everyone!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:3=shy,It’s kind of weird, b-b-but you seem really comfortable while naked, so I g-g-guess that’s a nice way to be!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=vexed,You aren't associated with that hand-guy, are you, Chiaki!?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:0=calm,You look so… healthy. And you’re a doctor? What’s <i>your</i> Quirk like?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:0=happy,Well, you seem like you've got a legacy angle, and you like to fight in tournaments... I bet you'd have done will at UA!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:0=interested,While anyone can certainly be a hero, I think based on how you’re dressed it’s probably not a strict regimen.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=interested,Y-you look even better without your tie, Saki!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:0=happy,Oh, so you have a vocal quirk like Present Mic? He's such a funny teacher.
5-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:american=interested,Though I never expected to learn something like this!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=interested,I'm kind of nervous to find out what your Quirk could be...
5-female_removing_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:0=shy,I'm always really flattered and amazed by how popular Pro Hero color palettes enter the mainstream wardrobe.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Oh, duh, it has to be something sound related. D.Va, like diva! I get it. Kind on the nose, though…
5-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=happy,Oh! That's a great idea. It'll be a lot easier with the two of us, too!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity,priority:990=shy,A-ah! No, Futaba, we shouldn't embarrass her, we should focus on stuff we can do to cheer her up!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=interested,Careful, Mahiru! People might be able to see up your skirt!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=embarrassed,E-er, Mahiru, there might be a more... ladylike way of...
5-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=nauseous,I don’t mind being recorded in my day to day work… B-b-ut I’m pretty uncomfortable with the idea that this’ll end up on the internet somewhere.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:0=nauseous,She’s one of the few people I know with teeth like that…
5-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=interested,Huh, that's such an interesting pattern! Our school uniform was just a flat red tie.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=happy,The polka dots look so pretty!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=nauseous,…Unless you had some sort of digestion Quirk? I used to know someone who gained a lot of strength whenever he’d eat sugar…
5-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=serious,Wh-what? You have multiple Quirks!?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=vexed,But can you leave the rest of us out of it?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=gravity,What kind of stuff does the “Fairy” Quirk let you do? Flight, right? Good! I’m going to go ahead and try avoid being embarrassed. I’d turn pinker than you!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:2=vexed,You… Surely needed those for something interesting, right? Just for listening to music?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0=embarrassed,Well, you only have two arms and two legs, so I’m guessing you have a web-based Quirk? Or…
5-female_removing_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:0=happy,I’m… Actually kind of a fan. I did a report on you back in school!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=heroic,You remind me a lot of Ingenium!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette=interested,I'm sorry, I was kind of... tricked into coming, but is it a polka dot theme today?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette=interested,Between Marinette and Mahiru, it seems we have a polka dot theme tonight...
5-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1=interested,I think digital Quirks are really underrated. You probably get access to all kinds of unique stuff!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=vexed,Do you have a Quirk that makes you need an outfit like that? Or do you just like to dress all historical?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:1=gravity,I really like my Quirk and it’s super useful for hero stuff and for more conventional trades, but I think everyone wishes they had a little more time.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=interested,I’ve never heard of Glitch City either… But White Knights and Valkyries sounds awfully like a Pro Hero group of some sort…
5-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:2=interested,Huh. That’s weird. I’ve never heard of a Quirk-granting object before but that does kind of make sense…
5-female_removing_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:0=embarrassed,Um! S-sorry, that’s a really embarrassing reaction.
5-female_removed_accessory=calm,Well, I guess I don't mind too much, I <i>did</i> say I'd protect you all...
5-female_removed_accessory=happy,Are you having fun, ~name~? Or do you want to stop? In crisis training I was usually more focused on dealing with rubble than people, so I'm having a bit of trouble here.
5-female_removed_accessory=heroic,Well, ~name~, it looks like you're still in good hands!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:1=serious,I'll take you down, and bring you to justice, Neopolitan!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Well, I think you’re starting to get <i>less</i> outfitted. But it’s what you do that makes you a hero, I think.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:1=shy,I-I hope you are just as unshy as he is. F-for your sake.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:2=heroic,Hm… I’m keeping an eye on you…
5-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Comfort should come before style, I think! I mean, I dress in a ridiculous costume like this!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:2=happy,Or maybe it’s an American thing I don’t quite get. I’ll admit most of what I know about the US comes from All Might or Deku…
5-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=embarrassed,Er-- A hero should know when to go for backup, but I guess there's no running here...
5-female_removed_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:1=embarrassed,T-though you don't have to act the part, I hope you know...
5-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=shy,I’m totally paying attention to your rebuttal. Yep. Sure am! Definitely not using this to focus on the fact that I think you can fly to distance myself from how much better at… Being composed you are.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:1=shy,Gah! I sure hope not!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=heroic,You’re clearly also ready for combat, but I can’t get a good feel for your Quirk…
5-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2,count-bodysuit:2=embarrassed,I mean, some of us dress in some really silly costumes, Saki. I wouldn't worry about your shoes!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:1=vexed,Either way, it’s a very interesting style. If you want lots of pieces to win the game...
5-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=shy,T-that could work, actually. What do you think Saki?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=shy,I think that idea could work! Saki, what kind of superpower would you want?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Huh? Not a hero? You just carry around all that stuff for work?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:1=gravity,Though how are you floating? I know there’s some complicated Quirks out there, but “Vampire” and all its powers seems very strong...
5-female_removed_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:1=embarrassed,N-not like, in a way that’s relevant to this game!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:saki=interested,H-hey, Chiaki, I think Saki wants to ask you something...
5-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=shy,T-that could be pretty damaging to some people’s careers, I think. Y-you know?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:1=interested,I mean, obviously something medical related… It’s kind of hard to just be a doctor without something extra these days…
5-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=shy,I-it’s very strange to have more than one! I only know a villain with that sort of ability set!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=shy,I'm n-not going to let my guard down!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Y-you can't get me to let <i>my</i> guard down!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=shy,Tomura Shigaraki! He's real bad news and talks about video games as much as you do! I'm keeping an eye on you, Chiaki...
5-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=calm,Hm... You're braver than you act, huh, Florina?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:1=nauseous,It’ll… take too long explain so I’m just going to pretend like it didn’t happen…
5-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:chiaki=embarrassed,We-well. L-looks like we're in this together, Saki and Chiaki.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:3=serious,What? Are you even paying attention, D.Va?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3=heroic,A guardian spirit? Hmm… that’s kind of like my friend Tokoyami’s Quirk: Dark Shadow!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=shy,Your costume certainly looks like it’s built for impacts or acceleration. And you’re so serious! I-I could probably stand to gain some composure from you.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:2=embarrassed,W-wait, why shouldn't I approve? Are you helping the villains!? That seems so out of character!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:1=embarrassed,W-well, I'll tell her about this. N-not about the game, but I'm sure she'd be really flattered!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=heroic,D-don't worry! I believe in you! Stay Plus Ultra, Saki! (Phew.)
5-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=embarrassed,Ha! So you are a he--r--ohhh. Hrmph. T-that seems like a bad superpower!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:2=shy,I wouldn’t want to-- Especially not with another woman-- I just-- Hmrmhph!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=heroic,I think everyone's confused why you didn't just let go of your camera!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:5=shy,But I have a feeling you’ve probably inspired a lot of interesting sets of tactics in a game like this…
5-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:6=nauseous,And this is how you… Process that, I suppose I’ll just relax and try to keep an eye on everyone else.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:2=embarrassed,U-um. Anyway, I have a friend whose Quirk was similar to yours, in how he could phase through solid objects. Could I get an autograph for him? I-if it’s no trouble.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:annie=happy,On the plus side, you’re not quite as… <i>Unusual</i> as some of the support-class at UA! I bet you lead a fun life, at least!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:1=heroic,I haven’t been out of the academy for very long, but I thought your “Chronal Acceleration” Quirk was awesome!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=shy,I wish we'd met in less embarrassing circumstances...
5-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=vexed,Hmm… I wonder if Tohru would employ the same strategy… Though it’s not like anyone can see her when she’s n-n-naked.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:2=embarrassed,P-please?


#lost bra
6-male_removing_accessory=calm,Aww, just ~clothing~?
6-male_removing_accessory=vexed,You know, I'm <i>clearly</i> working hard to protect you, ~name~.
6-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=vexed,Even a name like “9S” is kind of shadowy and mysterious…
6-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:american=interested,Though I never expected to learn something like this!
6-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Th-though I wouldn't want you to lose! I just-- Um. Is it awkward in here or is it just me?
6-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:1=happy,H-he also worked really, really hard to get where he is as a hero. I think you two would have a lot in common, actually.
6-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0=interested,Those seem like kind of a hassle though... Do they help you stay focused in combat?
6-male_removed_accessory=embarrassed,Sometimes a hero likes saving too, ~name~...
6-male_removed_accessory=serious,<i>Hrmph.</i> I've got my boobs out, ~name~. I'd have thought you'd be a bit more... heroic.
6-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:twilight=heroic,Aliens aren’t real. People like, say, Twilight, look unusual, but are just like you or me!
6-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Er. If you could <i>not</i> pay it back tenfold and keep being nice, I know <i>I'd</i> be a lot happier.
6-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2=shy,I-I mean I'm sure glad your pants didn't fall down, at least!
6-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2=shy,E-er. W-well, at least we can pretend like nothing's happened or gone wrong, right?
6-male_removed_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:2=shy,Th-though I don't think I'd want to play this game with him.
6-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1=shy,And what’s with the blindfold? I thought for sure you’d take that off first!
6-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1=shy,Pfft. Aliens aren’t real. Just because some people look strange doesn’t make them extraterrestrial.
6-female_removing_accessory=nauseous,Oh, oh gosh. You still have ~clothing~?
6-female_removing_accessory=embarrassed,I'm... doing a pretty good job, if you have ~clothing~ left, ~name~.
6-female_removing_accessory=calm,Hmm. You're doing really well, ~name~! Do you have a probability Quirk or am I just bad at cards...?
6-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette=interested,I'm sorry, I was kind of... tricked into coming, but is it a polka dot theme today?

6-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:5=shy,But I have a feeling you’ve probably inspired a lot of interesting sets of tactics in a game like this…
6-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:6=nauseous,And this is how you… Process that, I suppose I’ll just relax and try to keep an eye on everyone else.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=heroic,You’re clearly also ready for combat, but I can’t get a good feel for your Quirk…
6-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=shy,I-it’s very strange to have more than one! I only know a villain with that sort of ability set!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3=heroic,A guardian spirit? Hmm… that’s kind of like my friend Tokoyami’s Quirk: Dark Shadow!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=shy,I wish we'd met in less embarrassing circumstances...
6-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=shy,I’m totally paying attention to your rebuttal. Yep. Sure am! Definitely not using this to focus on the fact that I think you can fly to distance myself from how much better at… Being composed you are.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:2=happy,Or maybe it’s an American thing I don’t quite get. I’ll admit most of what I know about the US comes from All Might or Deku…
6-female_removed_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:2=shy,I wouldn’t want to-- Especially not with another woman-- I just-- Hmrmhph!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:1=vexed,Either way, it’s a very interesting style. If you want lots of pieces to win the game...
6-female_removed_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:2=heroic,Hm… I’m keeping an eye on you…
6-female_removed_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:1=nauseous,It’ll… take too long explain so I’m just going to pretend like it didn’t happen…
6-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=shy,T-that could work, actually. What do you think Saki?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=shy,I think that idea could work! Saki, what kind of superpower would you want?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Well, I think you’re starting to get <i>less</i> outfitted. But it’s what you do that makes you a hero, I think.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:2=embarrassed,P-please?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Huh? Not a hero? You just carry around all that stuff for work?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:saki=interested,H-hey, Chiaki, I think Saki wants to ask you something...
6-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Comfort should come before style, I think! I mean, I dress in a ridiculous costume like this!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:chiaki=embarrassed,We-well. L-looks like we're in this together, Saki and Chiaki.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=heroic,D-don't worry! I believe in you! Stay Plus Ultra, Saki! (Phew.)
6-female_removed_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:1=heroic,I haven’t been out of the academy for very long, but I thought your “Chronal Acceleration” Quirk was awesome!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2,count-bodysuit:2=embarrassed,I mean, some of us dress in some really silly costumes, Saki. I wouldn't worry about your shoes!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:1=serious,I'll take you down, and bring you to justice, Neopolitan!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=calm,Hm... You're braver than you act, huh, Florina?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=heroic,I think everyone's confused why you didn't just let go of your camera!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:1=interested,I mean, obviously something medical related… It’s kind of hard to just be a doctor without something extra these days…
6-female_removed_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:2=embarrassed,W-wait, why shouldn't I approve? Are you helping the villains!? That seems so out of character!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:1=shy,I-I hope you are just as unshy as he is. F-for your sake.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=shy,Your costume certainly looks like it’s built for impacts or acceleration. And you’re so serious! I-I could probably stand to gain some composure from you.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:1=embarrassed,T-though you don't have to act the part, I hope you know...
6-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=embarrassed,Ha! So you are a he--r--ohhh. Hrmph. T-that seems like a bad superpower!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:2=embarrassed,U-um. Anyway, I have a friend whose Quirk was similar to yours, in how he could phase through solid objects. Could I get an autograph for him? I-if it’s no trouble.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=shy,Tomura Shigaraki! He's real bad news and talks about video games as much as you do! I'm keeping an eye on you, Chiaki...
6-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=embarrassed,Er-- A hero should know when to go for backup, but I guess there's no running here...
6-female_removed_accessory,target:annie=happy,On the plus side, you’re not quite as… <i>Unusual</i> as some of the support-class at UA! I bet you lead a fun life, at least!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:1=shy,Gah! I sure hope not!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=shy,T-that could be pretty damaging to some people’s careers, I think. Y-you know?

-3-male_removing_accessory=serious,Oh...
-3-male_removing_accessory=embarrassed,Gah?! <i>~Clothing~?</i>
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=vexed,Even a name like “9S” is kind of shadowy and mysterious…
-3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:american=interested,Though I never expected to learn something like this!
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:1=happy,H-he also worked really, really hard to get where he is as a hero. I think you two would have a lot in common, actually.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Th-though I wouldn't want you to lose! I just-- Um. Is it awkward in here or is it just me?
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0=interested,Those seem like kind of a hassle though... Do they help you stay focused in combat?
-3-male_removed_accessory=vexed,<i>Hmph.</i>
-3-male_removed_accessory=vexed,<i>Mmmph.</i>
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1=shy,And what’s with the blindfold? I thought for sure you’d take that off first!
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1=shy,Pfft. Aliens aren’t real. Just because some people look strange doesn’t make them extraterrestrial.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:2=shy,Th-though I don't think I'd want to play this game with him.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Er. If you could <i>not</i> pay it back tenfold and keep being nice, I know <i>I'd</i> be a lot happier.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:twilight=heroic,Aliens aren’t real. People like, say, Twilight, look unusual, but are just like you or me!
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2=shy,I-I mean I'm sure glad your pants didn't fall down, at least!
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2=shy,E-er. W-well, at least we can pretend like nothing's happened or gone wrong, right?
-3-female_removing_accessory=nauseous,O-okay, ~name~. You're really... doing better than me at least.
-3-female_removing_accessory=embarrassed,I don't suppose you'd have something bigger for next time? I don't like to make civilians responsible when I'm on duty, but I could use a <i>tiny</i> bit of distraction.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=gravity,What kind of stuff does the “Fairy” Quirk let you do? Flight, right? Good! I’m going to go ahead and try avoid being embarrassed. I’d turn pinker than you!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity,priority:990=shy,A-ah! No, Futaba, we shouldn't embarrass her, we should focus on stuff we can do to cheer her up!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=happy,Oh! That's a great idea. It'll be a lot easier with the two of us, too!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette=interested,I'm sorry, I was kind of... tricked into coming, but is it a polka dot theme today?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette=interested,Between Marinette and Mahiru, it seems we have a polka dot theme tonight...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:chiaki=shy,I-I'm not really happy with this type of thing either, you two.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=interested,Careful, Mahiru! People might be able to see up your skirt!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=embarrassed,E-er, Mahiru, there might be a more... ladylike way of...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=shy,What kind of Quirk do you use with a belt like that, Florina? Oh! You seem so jittery! M-maybe it's for like... o-or maybe you're just embarrassed...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=vexed,--W-WAIT! We can leave!? I-I'm gonna go too!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0=embarrassed,Well, you only have two arms and two legs, so I’m guessing you have a web-based Quirk? Or…
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:0=happy,Oh, so you have a vocal quirk like Present Mic? He's such a funny teacher.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=vexed,You aren't associated with that hand-guy, are you, Chiaki!?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=interested,I'm kind of nervous to find out what your Quirk could be...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:0=serious,Are you American? You certainly seem quite sure of yourself…
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Oh, duh, it has to be something sound related. D.Va, like diva! I get it. Kind on the nose, though…
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:2=vexed,You… Surely needed those for something interesting, right? Just for listening to music?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=vexed,Do you have a Quirk that makes you need an outfit like that? Or do you just like to dress all historical?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1=interested,I think digital Quirks are really underrated. You probably get access to all kinds of unique stuff!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:0=interested,While anyone can certainly be a hero, I think based on how you’re dressed it’s probably not a strict regimen.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:0=nauseous,She’s one of the few people I know with teeth like that…
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=interested,Huh, that's such an interesting pattern! Our school uniform was just a flat red tie.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=happy,The polka dots look so pretty!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=nauseous,…Unless you had some sort of digestion Quirk? I used to know someone who gained a lot of strength whenever he’d eat sugar…
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=interested,Y-you look even better without your tie, Saki!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=calm,It’s… Kinda rare to see a “demon”-type Quirk…
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=heroic,Those are nice shoes, Saki! I think I have a pair just like them!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,marker:pink_underwear=embarrassed,H-hey! D-don't look up her skirt, everyone!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:0=happy,Well, you seem like you've got a legacy angle, and you like to fight in tournaments... I bet you'd have done will at UA!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:0=calm,You look so… healthy. And you’re a doctor? What’s <i>your</i> Quirk like?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=heroic,You’re really loaded out with lots of gear. I can see you’re a utility-type Hero!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=interested,I’ve never heard of Glitch City either… But White Knights and Valkyries sounds awfully like a Pro Hero group of some sort…
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:5=embarrassed,I-I’m sorry I didn’t realize it sooner, but this is kind of a fetish thing for you, isn’t it? I-- don’t really have any hangups like that, but if you're pretending that being an alien...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=heroic,You remind me a lot of Ingenium!
-3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:american=interested,Though I never expected to learn something like this!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:0=vexed,I know you're the quiet type. But that doesn't mean I don't know a villain when I see one.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:1=interested,Do you happen to have an affinity for technology, other Mei?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=vexed,You must have practiced this game <i>a lot</i> if you’re bored enough to try something like this. Or crazy...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=nauseous,I don’t mind being recorded in my day to day work… B-b-ut I’m pretty uncomfortable with the idea that this’ll end up on the internet somewhere.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:0=shy,I'm always really flattered and amazed by how popular Pro Hero color palettes enter the mainstream wardrobe.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:3=shy,It’s kind of weird, b-b-but you seem really comfortable while naked, so I g-g-guess that’s a nice way to be!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:0=happy,I’m… Actually kind of a fan. I did a report on you back in school!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:2=interested,Huh. That’s weird. I’ve never heard of a Quirk-granting object before but that does kind of make sense…
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:1=gravity,I really like my Quirk and it’s super useful for hero stuff and for more conventional trades, but I think everyone wishes they had a little more time.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=vexed,But can you leave the rest of us out of it?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=serious,Wh-what? You have multiple Quirks!?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:0=embarrassed,Um! S-sorry, that’s a really embarrassing reaction.
-3-female_removed_accessory=happy,Well, at least <i>someone</i> seems to be doing well!
-3-female_removed_accessory=heroic,Hmm. Well... next time, I guess.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=vexed,Hmm… I wonder if Tohru would employ the same strategy… Though it’s not like anyone can see her when she’s n-n-naked.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=heroic,D-don't worry! I believe in you! Stay Plus Ultra, Saki! (Phew.)
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:1=serious,I'll take you down, and bring you to justice, Neopolitan!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=shy,I wish we'd met in less embarrassing circumstances...

-2-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity,priority:990=shy,A-ah! No, Futaba, we shouldn't embarrass her, we should focus on stuff we can do to cheer her up!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=heroic,Those are nice shoes, Saki! I think I have a pair just like them!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,marker:pink_underwear=embarrassed,H-hey! D-don't look up her skirt, everyone!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:2=interested,Huh. That’s weird. I’ve never heard of a Quirk-granting object before but that does kind of make sense…
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=serious,Wh-what? You have multiple Quirks!?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=vexed,You aren't associated with that hand-guy, are you, Chiaki!?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:0=happy,I’m… Actually kind of a fan. I did a report on you back in school!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=interested,I'm kind of nervous to find out what your Quirk could be...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:1=gravity,I really like my Quirk and it’s super useful for hero stuff and for more conventional trades, but I think everyone wishes they had a little more time.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=interested,Y-you look even better without your tie, Saki!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:3=shy,It’s kind of weird, b-b-but you seem really comfortable while naked, so I g-g-guess that’s a nice way to be!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:0=happy,Well, you seem like you've got a legacy angle, and you like to fight in tournaments... I bet you'd have done will at UA!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=interested,Careful, Mahiru! People might be able to see up your skirt!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=embarrassed,E-er, Mahiru, there might be a more... ladylike way of...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Oh, duh, it has to be something sound related. D.Va, like diva! I get it. Kind on the nose, though…
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=calm,It’s… Kinda rare to see a “demon”-type Quirk…
-2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:american=interested,Though I never expected to learn something like this!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=heroic,You remind me a lot of Ingenium!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=nauseous,I don’t mind being recorded in my day to day work… B-b-ut I’m pretty uncomfortable with the idea that this’ll end up on the internet somewhere.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette=interested,I'm sorry, I was kind of... tricked into coming, but is it a polka dot theme today?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette=interested,Between Marinette and Mahiru, it seems we have a polka dot theme tonight...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:0=happy,Oh, so you have a vocal quirk like Present Mic? He's such a funny teacher.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=interested,I’ve never heard of Glitch City either… But White Knights and Valkyries sounds awfully like a Pro Hero group of some sort…
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=vexed,--W-WAIT! We can leave!? I-I'm gonna go too!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:0=nauseous,She’s one of the few people I know with teeth like that…
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=nauseous,…Unless you had some sort of digestion Quirk? I used to know someone who gained a lot of strength whenever he’d eat sugar…
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1=interested,I think digital Quirks are really underrated. You probably get access to all kinds of unique stuff!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0=embarrassed,Well, you only have two arms and two legs, so I’m guessing you have a web-based Quirk? Or…
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=vexed,Do you have a Quirk that makes you need an outfit like that? Or do you just like to dress all historical?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=shy,What kind of Quirk do you use with a belt like that, Florina? Oh! You seem so jittery! M-maybe it's for like... o-or maybe you're just embarrassed...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=vexed,You must have practiced this game <i>a lot</i> if you’re bored enough to try something like this. Or crazy...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:0=interested,While anyone can certainly be a hero, I think based on how you’re dressed it’s probably not a strict regimen.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:0=embarrassed,Um! S-sorry, that’s a really embarrassing reaction.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=gravity,What kind of stuff does the “Fairy” Quirk let you do? Flight, right? Good! I’m going to go ahead and try avoid being embarrassed. I’d turn pinker than you!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:0=shy,I'm always really flattered and amazed by how popular Pro Hero color palettes enter the mainstream wardrobe.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:1=interested,Do you happen to have an affinity for technology, other Mei?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=heroic,You’re really loaded out with lots of gear. I can see you’re a utility-type Hero!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:0=serious,Are you American? You certainly seem quite sure of yourself…
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:chiaki=shy,I-I'm not really happy with this type of thing either, you two.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:0=vexed,I know you're the quiet type. But that doesn't mean I don't know a villain when I see one.
-2-female_removed_accessory=heroic,Not that I want you specifically, ~name~, but this is even more fun than it looks!
-2-female_removed_accessory=happy,Trust me, I'm a hero, after all!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:2=embarrassed,P-please?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=heroic,D-don't worry! I believe in you! Stay Plus Ultra, Saki! (Phew.)
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:chiaki=embarrassed,We-well. L-looks like we're in this together, Saki and Chiaki.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=shy,T-that could work, actually. What do you think Saki?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=shy,I think that idea could work! Saki, what kind of superpower would you want?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Comfort should come before style, I think! I mean, I dress in a ridiculous costume like this!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:saki=interested,H-hey, Chiaki, I think Saki wants to ask you something...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Huh? Not a hero? You just carry around all that stuff for work?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:1=embarrassed,W-well, I'll tell her about this. N-not about the game, but I'm sure she'd be really flattered!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:1=serious,I'll take you down, and bring you to justice, Neopolitan!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:2=embarrassed,W-wait, why shouldn't I approve? Are you helping the villains!? That seems so out of character!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:1=shy,Gah! I sure hope not!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=shy,I’m totally paying attention to your rebuttal. Yep. Sure am! Definitely not using this to focus on the fact that I think you can fly to distance myself from how much better at… Being composed you are.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:1=vexed,Either way, it’s a very interesting style. If you want lots of pieces to win the game...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:5=shy,But I have a feeling you’ve probably inspired a lot of interesting sets of tactics in a game like this…
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=heroic,I think everyone's confused why you didn't just let go of your camera!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:6=nauseous,And this is how you… Process that, I suppose I’ll just relax and try to keep an eye on everyone else.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:3=serious,What? Are you even paying attention, D.Va?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:1=gravity,Though how are you floating? I know there’s some complicated Quirks out there, but “Vampire” and all its powers seems very strong...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:1=embarrassed,N-not like, in a way that’s relevant to this game!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:2=happy,Or maybe it’s an American thing I don’t quite get. I’ll admit most of what I know about the US comes from All Might or Deku…
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:2=shy,I wouldn’t want to-- Especially not with another woman-- I just-- Hmrmhph!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=heroic,You’re clearly also ready for combat, but I can’t get a good feel for your Quirk…
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=shy,I-it’s very strange to have more than one! I only know a villain with that sort of ability set!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=vexed,Hmm… I wonder if Tohru would employ the same strategy… Though it’s not like anyone can see her when she’s n-n-naked.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2,count-bodysuit:2=embarrassed,I mean, some of us dress in some really silly costumes, Saki. I wouldn't worry about your shoes!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3=heroic,A guardian spirit? Hmm… that’s kind of like my friend Tokoyami’s Quirk: Dark Shadow!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=shy,I wish we'd met in less embarrassing circumstances...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:1=heroic,I haven’t been out of the academy for very long, but I thought your “Chronal Acceleration” Quirk was awesome!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:annie=happy,On the plus side, you’re not quite as… <i>Unusual</i> as some of the support-class at UA! I bet you lead a fun life, at least!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:1=embarrassed,T-though you don't have to act the part, I hope you know...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=calm,Hm... You're braver than you act, huh, Florina?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=shy,T-that could be pretty damaging to some people’s careers, I think. Y-you know?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:1=interested,I mean, obviously something medical related… It’s kind of hard to just be a doctor without something extra these days…
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=embarrassed,Er-- A hero should know when to go for backup, but I guess there's no running here...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=shy,Your costume certainly looks like it’s built for impacts or acceleration. And you’re so serious! I-I could probably stand to gain some composure from you.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:1=shy,I-I hope you are just as unshy as he is. F-for your sake.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:2=embarrassed,U-um. Anyway, I have a friend whose Quirk was similar to yours, in how he could phase through solid objects. Could I get an autograph for him? I-if it’s no trouble.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:2=heroic,Hm… I’m keeping an eye on you…
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=embarrassed,Ha! So you are a he--r--ohhh. Hrmph. T-that seems like a bad superpower!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:1=nauseous,It’ll… take too long explain so I’m just going to pretend like it didn’t happen…
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=shy,Tomura Shigaraki! He's real bad news and talks about video games as much as you do! I'm keeping an eye on you, Chiaki...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=shy,I'm n-not going to let my guard down!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Y-you can't get me to let <i>my</i> guard down!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Well, I think you’re starting to get <i>less</i> outfitted. But it’s what you do that makes you a hero, I think.

-1-male_removing_accessory=calm,This is kind of relaxing, now.
-1-male_removing_accessory=nauseous,Oh no, h-hold on--
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Th-though I wouldn't want you to lose! I just-- Um. Is it awkward in here or is it just me?
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=vexed,Even a name like “9S” is kind of shadowy and mysterious…
-1-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:american=interested,Though I never expected to learn something like this!
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:1=happy,H-he also worked really, really hard to get where he is as a hero. I think you two would have a lot in common, actually.
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0=interested,Those seem like kind of a hassle though... Do they help you stay focused in combat?
-1-male_removed_accessory=embarrassed,Even though your ~clothing~ wasn't big, ~name~, it's just kind of nice to sit and watch. And, um. Hopefully not throw up.
-1-male_removed_accessory=embarrassed,--I'm okay, I'm okay. Your ~clothing~ wasn't bad, but I'm a little nauseous for using my Quirk like that...
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:twilight=heroic,Aliens aren’t real. People like, say, Twilight, look unusual, but are just like you or me!
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1=shy,And what’s with the blindfold? I thought for sure you’d take that off first!
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1=shy,Pfft. Aliens aren’t real. Just because some people look strange doesn’t make them extraterrestrial.
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:2=shy,Th-though I don't think I'd want to play this game with him.
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Er. If you could <i>not</i> pay it back tenfold and keep being nice, I know <i>I'd</i> be a lot happier.
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2=shy,I-I mean I'm sure glad your pants didn't fall down, at least!
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2=shy,E-er. W-well, at least we can pretend like nothing's happened or gone wrong, right?
-1-female_removing_accessory=interested,Am I allowed to hold ~name~'s ~clothing~ now that I've lost?
-1-female_removing_accessory=serious,Oh, I hadn't noticed your ~clothing~, ~name~! Could I see it?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:0=shy,I'm always really flattered and amazed by how popular Pro Hero color palettes enter the mainstream wardrobe.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=serious,Wh-what? You have multiple Quirks!?

-1-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:0=happy,Well, you seem like you've got a legacy angle, and you like to fight in tournaments... I bet you'd have done will at UA!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:5=embarrassed,I-I’m sorry I didn’t realize it sooner, but this is kind of a fetish thing for you, isn’t it? I-- don’t really have any hangups like that, but if you're pretending that being an alien...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:1=interested,Do you happen to have an affinity for technology, other Mei?

-1-female_removing_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:1=gravity,I really like my Quirk and it’s super useful for hero stuff and for more conventional trades, but I think everyone wishes they had a little more time.

-1-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=heroic,D-don't worry! I believe in you! Stay Plus Ultra, Saki! (Phew.)
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=heroic,I think everyone's confused why you didn't just let go of your camera!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:1=gravity,Though how are you floating? I know there’s some complicated Quirks out there, but “Vampire” and all its powers seems very strong...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:1=embarrassed,N-not like, in a way that’s relevant to this game!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:2=shy,I wouldn’t want to-- Especially not with another woman-- I just-- Hmrmhph!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=shy,I-it’s very strange to have more than one! I only know a villain with that sort of ability set!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3=heroic,A guardian spirit? Hmm… that’s kind of like my friend Tokoyami’s Quirk: Dark Shadow!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=embarrassed,Ha! So you are a he--r--ohhh. Hrmph. T-that seems like a bad superpower!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:1=nauseous,It’ll… take too long explain so I’m just going to pretend like it didn’t happen…
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:2=heroic,Hm… I’m keeping an eye on you…
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=shy,Your costume certainly looks like it’s built for impacts or acceleration. And you’re so serious! I-I could probably stand to gain some composure from you.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:1=interested,I mean, obviously something medical related… It’s kind of hard to just be a doctor without something extra these days…
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:1=embarrassed,T-though you don't have to act the part, I hope you know...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:1=serious,I'll take you down, and bring you to justice, Neopolitan!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=embarrassed,Er-- A hero should know when to go for backup, but I guess there's no running here...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=calm,Hm... You're braver than you act, huh, Florina?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:1=shy,I-I hope you are just as unshy as he is. F-for your sake.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2,count-bodysuit:2=embarrassed,I mean, some of us dress in some really silly costumes, Saki. I wouldn't worry about your shoes!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:chiaki=embarrassed,We-well. L-looks like we're in this together, Saki and Chiaki.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:1=heroic,I haven’t been out of the academy for very long, but I thought your “Chronal Acceleration” Quirk was awesome!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:saki=interested,H-hey, Chiaki, I think Saki wants to ask you something...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=shy,T-that could work, actually. What do you think Saki?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=shy,I think that idea could work! Saki, what kind of superpower would you want?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=shy,T-that could be pretty damaging to some people’s careers, I think. Y-you know?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Comfort should come before style, I think! I mean, I dress in a ridiculous costume like this!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:2=embarrassed,P-please?




#OPPONENT REMOVING MINOR CLOTHING
#Minor pieces of clothing don't reveal much when removed, but probably indicate more progress than accessory removal.

#stage-specific lines that override the stage-generic ones
male_removing_minor=interested,My helmet <i>was</i> pretty important, ~name~!
male_removing_minor=embarrassed,Oh no, I'm sorry, ~name~! Your ~clothing~? Already?
male_removing_minor=nauseous,Argh, I know it doesn't look like much, but I'm trying to keep even with you, ~name~!
male_removing_minor=interested,Your ~clothing~? A-already?
male_removed_minor=happy,I'm happy that you're still staying strong, even if you're losing.
male_removed_minor=heroic,You... Look nice, at least!
male_removed_minor=gravity,Well, I think you're not going to give up, and it's best to just keep trying, ~name~!
male_removed_minor=vexed,I'm sorry, ~name~. I don't want you to feel super embarrassed or anything...
female_removing_minor=embarrassed,Oh, shoot, ~name~! Your ~clothing~?!
female_removing_minor=vexed,Yikes, I'm sorry ~name~, but I kind of don't want to lose either, if I'm being honest...
female_removing_minor=embarrassed,Your ~clothing~? Now? A-are you sure?
female_removed_minor=happy,Hopefully you have a couple more small things?
female_removed_minor,marker:promise=heroic,Stay brave, ~name~. It's going to be okay! I promise!
female_removed_minor=gravity,Sometimes it's nice to fight villains with Quirks that do explosions or break stuff down, rather than subtle stuff like this game...
female_removed_minor=nauseous,You must not think I'm a very good hero, letting you lose like this...

0-male_removing_minor=calm,Dang, ~name~, you're going for something cool, it looks like.
0-male_removing_minor=calm,O-oh! I wasn't expecting you to pull of something so big, so soon.
0-male_removing_minor,target:pit,targetStage:2=vexed,Y-you have kind of a strange relationship with your armorer, don't you, Pit? A-at least it's just your feet...

0-male_removed_minor=embarrassed,Um. Sorry, ~name~! I don't really want to throw my hand, but if you start getting really vulnerable I'll...
0-male_removed_minor,target:pit,targetStage:3=embarrassed,Oh no. Some people are into that. I'M NOT AND IT'S COOL IF YOU ARE BUT--
0-male_removed_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:1=heroic,You remind me a lot about him, but he’s… Sometimes bigger in person. Also louder, but that only helps to inspire confidence in him!
0-male_removed_minor,target:9s,targetStage:2=embarrassed,T-that’s… C-c-certainly... to take your boots off and socks instead of spacing those out...
0-female_removing_minor=interested,Oh no, ~name~, you have to take off something so big?
0-female_removing_minor=shy,Your ~clothing~? Did you really need to take off something so big so soon?
0-female_removing_minor,target:alpha,targetStage:1=interested,I-it's kind of rude to use your Quirk to send a projection when the rest of us are here in the flesh...
0-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1=serious,So what is your Quirk? I completely forgot to ask about that eye… patch… thingy you were wearing.
0-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=happy,Whoa, you have so much control! I have to brute force things a little bit, so it’s really impressive you have such good aim!
0-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=heroic,Wait, really? Saki’d probably be fine with a nice trip to a bathhouse or hot springs, right? I think Saki might actually live in my city, based on her uniform!
0-female_removing_minor,target:sonya,targetStage:5=embarrassed,Um. I can respect someone trying to turn around when they're embarrassed... I don't know why I didn't think of that...
0-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity=interested,W-well, I was thinking maybe that would be something fun for the three of us to do together. I’d invite the others but three’s a party, as Jirou would say. Mineta would say something far dirtier, I think.
0-female_removing_minor,target:chell,targetStage:0=shy,Those types of Quirks are really something, huh?
0-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=interested,Um... You really aren't a villain, are you?
0-female_removing_minor,target:shego,targetStage:0=heroic,W-well, I hope you’re less dangerous without your gloves, Shego. I know Bakugo has a hard time focusing his blasts without his...
0-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3=embarrassed,I still think you frame things to be too much like Shigaraki...
0-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=nauseous,What ever happened to you after that… Shoot, I thought I was pretty good at history…
0-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0=embarrassed,A-are you not, Futaba? I mean...
0-female_removing_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:aimee,alsoPlayingStage:1-7=nauseous,I really hope you aren't disintegrating them... Aimee already seems hellbent on destroying her apparel.
0-female_removing_minor,target:marceline,targetStage:2=embarrassed,You’ve mentioned that you like the color red a few times…
0-female_removing_minor,target:mei,targetStage:2=interested,You’re like Todoroki, but with one half of his powers!
0-female_removing_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:0=embarrassed,You’re that Quirk school in England, right? Er... the one that had all the issues with villains?
0-female_removing_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:1=vexed,Are you teleporting your clothes? I hope you aren’t disintegrating them!
0-female_removing_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:2=interested,E-er, I didn’t know there was a rule that we could take off our costumes in two pieces…
0-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:3=serious,Careful, Futaba! Don't lose your stuff! Or your lunch!
0-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:3=heroic,Happy to help someone in need!
0-female_removing_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:2=shy,(I-I'm pretty sure she's not wearing underwear! I think I saw her whole butt! I could never--!)
0-female_removing_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:3=serious,Yeah… Hmm… I wonder what Deku-kun would think about this…
0-female_removed_minor=interested,Yikes, ~name~, I do not envy you right now...
0-female_removed_minor=vexed,I wish I had something more uplifting to say, ~name~. But at least we're in this together!
0-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=embarrassed,The Battle of Florem Gardens? I thought you were arrested. Are you out on good behavior?
0-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1=vexed,I had a feeling you reminded me of someone. But... I was hoping it wasn't Mineta.
0-female_removed_minor,target:sonya,targetStage:6=happy,Pffffft. Oh my gosh! Sonya! You're amazing at relieving tension! Using camouflage paint without a stealth Quirk. You are <i>too</i> funny!
0-female_removed_minor,target:sonya,targetStage:6=heroic,Sonya! This is too funny! You're helping me feel a lot better! Way to keep your cool!
0-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:4=shy,A-anyway, t-this type of game isn't really something I'm good at either.
0-female_removed_minor,target:mei,targetStage:3=embarrassed,Oh, and you use some sort of nozzle to channel it, right? Or is it just chemistry?
0-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2=gravity,Y-you know. Your Quirk? That something special everyone's born with? Like my Zero Gravity? Kinda like this?
0-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=happy,I like the way you think, Marinette. Saki, what’d you think?
0-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3=gravity,W-well, I definintely won't step on it. L-look! I'll even try to float away from it!
0-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=nauseous,Now if only you could use it for good…
0-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:2=calm,You seem really… Plain for something that seems so powerful. Or did you just show up in your street clothes or normal school uniform?
0-female_removed_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:3=nauseous,Oh no! I d-di-din’t realize I could take it off in pieces…
0-female_removed_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:4=embarrassed,O-oh yeah, you’re right, Marinette. Sorry!
0-female_removed_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:3=shy,Mahiru, are you <i>sure</i> you can't part with your camera next...?
0-female_removed_minor,target:alpha,targetStage:2=vexed,Now I feel <i>really</i> foolish. My mood's just been crushed.
0-female_removed_minor,target:chell,targetStage:1=embarrassed,E-er. I'm not a mind-reader or anything. Say, you're awfully quiet, huh?
0-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:1=heroic,We do get a few trainees from abroad, but it’s great to see that Europe also takes hero training seriously!
0-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:dna_lock,marker:enf_0b=shy,W-why would I ever want to try on someone else's gear!? T-that's ludicrous!
0-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity=nauseous,I’d really rather focus on the makeup stuff… Saki, what do you think?
0-female_removed_minor,target:marceline,targetStage:3=nauseous,I’m super against blood-related stuff. It seems real gross!
0-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4=shy,Well, at least <i>someone</i> had a good time. I'm happy it was Futaba, at least!
0-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=shy,Wait, I don't understand, is that related to a Quirk, or are you just scarred? Oh... sh-shoot. I'm sorry, Kyoko.
0-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=shy,Um. If it makes you feel any better, you seem really smart! And one of the best heroes I know has a scar like yours!
0-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:damage_reduction,marker:enf_0b=embarrassed,T-that sounds really, really cool, to be honest. I could use something like that for my withering pride, though.
0-female_removed_minor,target:shego,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Er... It seems decidedly not.
0-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:pauldrons,marker:enf_0b=shy,I-I mean that's the basics of good suit design, right?
0-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:saki,marker:chiaki_apology=happy,Okay. If you want to be Saki's friend, you're probably not a bad person. Helping the vulnerable is always kind. I'm sorry, Chiaki.

5-male_removed_minor=happy,W-well, ~clothing~ is kind of impressive in its own right!
5-male_removed_minor=embarrassed,I-I wouldn't mind seeing what ~name~ looks like under his ~clothing~! I a-apologize if that's too forward or n-not what I'm supposed to say!
5-male_removed_minor,target:pit,targetStage:3=embarrassed,Oh no. Some people are into that. I'M NOT AND IT'S COOL IF YOU ARE BUT--
5-male_removed_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:1=heroic,You remind me a lot about him, but he’s… Sometimes bigger in person. Also louder, but that only helps to inspire confidence in him!
5-male_removed_minor,target:9s,targetStage:2=embarrassed,T-that’s… C-c-certainly... to take your boots off and socks instead of spacing those out...
5-female_removing_minor=heroic,At this point, you should be proud you've played well enough to hold onto your ~clothing~!
5-female_removing_minor=happy,You've been playing really well so far, ~name~, keep it up!
5-female_removing_minor,target:sonya,targetStage:5=embarrassed,Um. I can respect someone trying to turn around when they're embarrassed... I don't know why I didn't think of that...
5-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=heroic,Wait, really? Saki’d probably be fine with a nice trip to a bathhouse or hot springs, right? I think Saki might actually live in my city, based on her uniform!
5-female_removing_minor,target:alpha,targetStage:1=interested,I-it's kind of rude to use your Quirk to send a projection when the rest of us are here in the flesh...
5-female_removing_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:aimee,alsoPlayingStage:1-7=nauseous,I really hope you aren't disintegrating them... Aimee already seems hellbent on destroying her apparel.
5-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=nauseous,What ever happened to you after that… Shoot, I thought I was pretty good at history…
5-female_removing_minor,target:shego,targetStage:0=heroic,W-well, I hope you’re less dangerous without your gloves, Shego. I know Bakugo has a hard time focusing his blasts without his...
5-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=happy,Whoa, you have so much control! I have to brute force things a little bit, so it’s really impressive you have such good aim!
5-female_removing_minor,target:chell,targetStage:0=shy,Those types of Quirks are really something, huh?
5-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity=interested,W-well, I was thinking maybe that would be something fun for the three of us to do together. I’d invite the others but three’s a party, as Jirou would say. Mineta would say something far dirtier, I think.
5-female_removing_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:1=vexed,Are you teleporting your clothes? I hope you aren’t disintegrating them!
5-female_removing_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:0=embarrassed,You’re that Quirk school in England, right? Er... the one that had all the issues with villains?
5-female_removing_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:2=shy,(I-I'm pretty sure she's not wearing underwear! I think I saw her whole butt! I could never--!)
5-female_removing_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:2=interested,E-er, I didn’t know there was a rule that we could take off our costumes in two pieces…
5-female_removing_minor,target:marceline,targetStage:2=embarrassed,You’ve mentioned that you like the color red a few times…
5-female_removing_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:3=serious,Yeah… Hmm… I wonder what Deku-kun would think about this…
5-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0=embarrassed,A-are you not, Futaba? I mean...
5-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3=embarrassed,I still think you frame things to be too much like Shigaraki...
5-female_removing_minor,target:mei,targetStage:2=interested,You’re like Todoroki, but with one half of his powers!
5-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:3=serious,Careful, Futaba! Don't lose your stuff! Or your lunch!
5-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:3=heroic,Happy to help someone in need!
5-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=interested,Um... You really aren't a villain, are you?
5-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1=serious,So what is your Quirk? I completely forgot to ask about that eye… patch… thingy you were wearing.
5-female_removed_minor=embarrassed,I know I definitely had to get creative with my smaller pieces, that's for sure.
5-female_removed_minor=nauseous,I wish I had something like your ~clothing~ left, though...
5-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4=shy,Well, at least <i>someone</i> had a good time. I'm happy it was Futaba, at least!
5-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity=nauseous,I’d really rather focus on the makeup stuff… Saki, what do you think?
5-female_removed_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:3=shy,H-huh? S-sorry, I’m a little distracted by trying to not get flustered, Gwen! I could've taken my suit off in two steps!
5-female_removed_minor,target:mei,targetStage:3=embarrassed,Oh, and you use some sort of nozzle to channel it, right? Or is it just chemistry?
5-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3=gravity,W-well, I definintely won't step on it. L-look! I'll even try to float away from it!
5-female_removed_minor,target:sonya,targetStage:6=happy,Pffffft. Oh my gosh! Sonya! You're amazing at relieving tension! Using camouflage paint without a stealth Quirk. You are <i>too</i> funny!
5-female_removed_minor,target:sonya,targetStage:6=heroic,Sonya! This is too funny! You're helping me feel a lot better! Way to keep your cool!
5-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:4=shy,A-anyway, t-this type of game isn't really something I'm good at either.
5-female_removed_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:3=shy,Mahiru, are you <i>sure</i> you can't part with your camera next...?
5-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:saki,marker:chiaki_apology=happy,Okay. If you want to be Saki's friend, you're probably not a bad person. Helping the vulnerable is always kind. I'm sorry, Chiaki.
5-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2=gravity,Y-you know. Your Quirk? That something special everyone's born with? Like my Zero Gravity? Kinda like this?
5-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:1=heroic,We do get a few trainees from abroad, but it’s great to see that Europe also takes hero training seriously!
5-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1=vexed,I had a feeling you reminded me of someone. But... I was hoping it wasn't Mineta.
5-female_removed_minor,target:shego,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Er... It seems decidedly not.
5-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=happy,I like the way you think, Marinette. Saki, what’d you think?
5-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:pauldrons,marker:enf_0b=shy,I-I mean that's the basics of good suit design, right?
5-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:damage_reduction,marker:enf_0b=embarrassed,T-that sounds really, really cool, to be honest. I could use something like that for my withering pride, though.
5-female_removed_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:4=embarrassed,O-oh yeah, you’re right, Marinette. Sorry!
5-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=embarrassed,The Battle of Florem Gardens? I thought you were arrested. Are you out on good behavior?
5-female_removed_minor,target:alpha,targetStage:2=vexed,Now I feel <i>really</i> foolish. My mood's just been crushed.
5-female_removed_minor,target:marceline,targetStage:3=nauseous,I’m super against blood-related stuff. It seems real gross!
5-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:2=calm,You seem really… Plain for something that seems so powerful. Or did you just show up in your street clothes or normal school uniform?
5-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=nauseous,Now if only you could use it for good…
5-female_removed_minor,target:chell,targetStage:1=embarrassed,E-er. I'm not a mind-reader or anything. Say, you're awfully quiet, huh?
5-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=shy,Wait, I don't understand, is that related to a Quirk, or are you just scarred? Oh... sh-shoot. I'm sorry, Kyoko.
5-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=shy,Um. If it makes you feel any better, you seem really smart! And one of the best heroes I know has a scar like yours!
5-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:dna_lock,marker:enf_0b=shy,W-why would I ever want to try on someone else's gear!? T-that's ludicrous!

-3-female_removed_minor,target:sonya,targetStage:6=happy,Pffffft. Oh my gosh! Sonya! You're amazing at relieving tension! Using camouflage paint without a stealth Quirk. You are <i>too</i> funny!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:sonya,targetStage:6=heroic,Sonya! This is too funny! You're helping me feel a lot better! Way to keep your cool!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1=vexed,I had a feeling you reminded me of someone. But... I was hoping it wasn't Mineta.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3=gravity,W-well, I definintely won't step on it. L-look! I'll even try to float away from it!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:marceline,targetStage:3=nauseous,I’m super against blood-related stuff. It seems real gross!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:1=heroic,We do get a few trainees from abroad, but it’s great to see that Europe also takes hero training seriously!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:saki,marker:chiaki_apology=happy,Okay. If you want to be Saki's friend, you're probably not a bad person. Helping the vulnerable is always kind. I'm sorry, Chiaki.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:damage_reduction,marker:enf_0b=embarrassed,T-that sounds really, really cool, to be honest. I could use something like that for my withering pride, though.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:3=shy,H-huh? S-sorry, I’m a little distracted by trying to not get flustered, Gwen! I could've taken my suit off in two steps!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:4=embarrassed,O-oh yeah, you’re right, Marinette. Sorry!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4=shy,Well, at least <i>someone</i> had a good time. I'm happy it was Futaba, at least!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:chell,targetStage:1=embarrassed,E-er. I'm not a mind-reader or anything. Say, you're awfully quiet, huh?
-3-female_removed_minor,target:alpha,targetStage:2=vexed,Now I feel <i>really</i> foolish. My mood's just been crushed.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:3=shy,Mahiru, are you <i>sure</i> you can't part with your camera next...?
-3-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2=gravity,Y-you know. Your Quirk? That something special everyone's born with? Like my Zero Gravity? Kinda like this?

-2-male_removing_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:0=interested,Do you know All Might, Captain America?
-2-male_removing_minor,target:pit,targetStage:2=vexed,Y-you have kind of a strange relationship with your armorer, don't you, Pit? A-at least it's just your feet...
-2-male_removing_minor,target:9s,targetStage:1=interested,Or are you just kind of smart and like to make support gadgets?
-2-male_removed_minor=happy,Oh, I like how you took that off!
-2-male_removed_minor=gravity2,I-I'd suggest taking that off again, b-but that doesn't make any--any--sense. Oh!
-2-male_removed_minor,target:9s,targetStage:2=embarrassed,T-that’s… C-c-certainly... to take your boots off and socks instead of spacing those out...
-2-male_removed_minor,target:pit,targetStage:3=embarrassed,Oh no. Some people are into that. I'M NOT AND IT'S COOL IF YOU ARE BUT--
-2-male_removed_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:1=heroic,You remind me a lot about him, but he’s… Sometimes bigger in person. Also louder, but that only helps to inspire confidence in him!
-2-female_removing_minor=embarrassed,T-this is k-kind of embarrassing, ~name~!
-2-female_removing_minor=embarrassed,D-darn, you still had that?
-2-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=interested,Um... You really aren't a villain, are you?
-2-female_removing_minor,target:sonya,targetStage:5=embarrassed,Um. I can respect someone trying to turn around when they're embarrassed... I don't know why I didn't think of that...
-2-female_removing_minor,target:chell,targetStage:0=shy,Those types of Quirks are really something, huh?
-2-female_removing_minor,target:shego,targetStage:0=heroic,W-well, I hope you’re less dangerous without your gloves, Shego. I know Bakugo has a hard time focusing his blasts without his...
-2-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1=serious,So what is your Quirk? I completely forgot to ask about that eye… patch… thingy you were wearing.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:3=serious,Careful, Futaba! Don't lose your stuff! Or your lunch!
-2-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:3=heroic,Happy to help someone in need!
-2-female_removing_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:2=interested,E-er, I didn’t know there was a rule that we could take off our costumes in two pieces…
-2-female_removing_minor,target:mei,targetStage:2=interested,You’re like Todoroki, but with one half of his powers!
-2-female_removing_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:0=embarrassed,You’re that Quirk school in England, right? Er... the one that had all the issues with villains?
-2-female_removing_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:aimee,alsoPlayingStage:1-7=nauseous,I really hope you aren't disintegrating them... Aimee already seems hellbent on destroying her apparel.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity=interested,W-well, I was thinking maybe that would be something fun for the three of us to do together. I’d invite the others but three’s a party, as Jirou would say. Mineta would say something far dirtier, I think.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:marceline,targetStage:2=embarrassed,You’ve mentioned that you like the color red a few times…
-2-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0=embarrassed,A-are you not, Futaba? I mean...
-2-female_removing_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:2=shy,(I-I'm pretty sure she's not wearing underwear! I think I saw her whole butt! I could never--!)
-2-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=heroic,Wait, really? Saki’d probably be fine with a nice trip to a bathhouse or hot springs, right? I think Saki might actually live in my city, based on her uniform!
-2-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=happy,Whoa, you have so much control! I have to brute force things a little bit, so it’s really impressive you have such good aim!
-2-female_removing_minor,target:alpha,targetStage:1=interested,I-it's kind of rude to use your Quirk to send a projection when the rest of us are here in the flesh...
-2-female_removing_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:1=vexed,Are you teleporting your clothes? I hope you aren’t disintegrating them!
-2-female_removing_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:3=serious,Yeah… Hmm… I wonder what Deku-kun would think about this…
-2-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=nauseous,What ever happened to you after that… Shoot, I thought I was pretty good at history…
-2-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3=embarrassed,I still think you frame things to be too much like Shigaraki...
-2-female_removed_minor=happy,Could you m-maybe join me? I think the others w-would like to see <i>someone</i> keep going and I'm a-almost!
-2-female_removed_minor=embarrassed,The closest I've come to m-mastur-- Gah-- with another girl was once on a long stakeout...

-2-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=shy,Wait, I don't understand, is that related to a Quirk, or are you just scarred? Oh... sh-shoot. I'm sorry, Kyoko.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=shy,Um. If it makes you feel any better, you seem really smart! And one of the best heroes I know has a scar like yours!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4=shy,Well, at least <i>someone</i> had a good time. I'm happy it was Futaba, at least!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=nauseous,Now if only you could use it for good…
-2-female_removed_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:4=embarrassed,O-oh yeah, you’re right, Marinette. Sorry!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:4=shy,A-anyway, t-this type of game isn't really something I'm good at either.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:pauldrons,marker:enf_0b=shy,I-I mean that's the basics of good suit design, right?

#OPPONENT REMOVING MAJOR CLOTHING
#Major clothing reveals a significant amount of skin and likely underwear.
#However, as we don't know if the opponent is taking off the top or the bottom, we can't presume that nice abs are showing; maybe she took of her skirt before her shirt.

#stage-specific lines that override the stage-generic ones
male_removing_major=embarrassed,Oh no! Not your ~clothing~!
male_removing_major=interested,~name~ is taking off his ~clothing~...? Mmm... oh! Shoot, sorry!
male_removing_major=heroic,I kind of feel like I could take off more than what I've been doing if you're taking off stuff like your ~clothing~, ~name~.

2-male_removing_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=embarrassed,Do… Do you just not feel ashamed for this, ~name~?
2-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=embarrassed,I’m really coming around to appreciate the <i>gravity</i> of the situation.

2-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=gravity,Um. S-sorry, I just got distracted. By a villain. And not your ~clothing~ being on the floor.
2-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=nauseous,Your ~clothing~?! That's supposed to cover a lot, so now you’re showing a lot, and so now I’m <i>embarrassed</i> a lot!
2-male_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=interested,Not that I’d have had any reason to have done that before. You know what, nevermind.
2-male_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=nauseous,Changing between missions in a co-ed environment where undressing is a penalty. Nope, not frightening at all.
2-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:4=shy,I give up. You’re clearly playing this game a little differently than the rest, but you don’t seem too bothered by getting naked… S-so, Well, best of luck, 9S! Keep at it!

2-male_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=embarrassed,E-erm. I wonder if embarrassment is contagious…
2-male_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=vexed,THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT GOING TO BE AN EXPERIENCE WE LOOK BACK ON IN THE YEARS TO COME AND SPONTANEOUSLY BREAK OUT IN A COLD SWEAT AND BLUSH.

2-male_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=gravity,I kind of do it better when I’m either focused or stressed. Funny how that works, right?
2-male_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=gravity,Er… I don’t suppose you’re shy about it and it’s not something I’m supposed to talk about?
2-male_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=heroic,I know you’re embarrassed, ~name~, but we can’t just be ashamed for no reason!
2-male_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=heroic,I’ve got your back, ~name~, as someone else who can be… Um. Fairly traditional about nudity.
2-male_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=gravity,That way, this… Weirdness can stop.
2-male_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=gravity,G-given that you’re… Think, Ochako! Think how to stop this villain!
2-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=nauseous,~Clothing~ is supposed to cover a lot, so now you’re showing a lot, and so now I’m <i>embarrassed</i> a lot!
2-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=embarrassed,Those sure are some ~clothing~ that ~name~’s not wearing anymore. Yep. Mmhmm! What could go wrong!?
2-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=embarrassed,Mhmmf! Yep! Those sure are ~name~’s ~clothing~ on the floor and not on his body.
2-male_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=interested,A-at least you’ve got a neat Quirk, ~name~ !
2-male_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=heroic,Er… At least we have a unique Quirk in common, huh?
2-male_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=gravity,It k-kinda makes you just want to float away, right?
2-male_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=embarrassed,I think I just have a lot of sympathy for you doing that, and it’s making me think of me doing it and I’m just kind of allovertheplace andokayIreallyshouldstop.
2-male_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=heroic,I’m so jealous of your Quirk, ~name~! It must be great to just… Lift off...
2-male_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=embarrassed,I-I kind of think about it every now and then
2-male_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=vexed,Um. Sorry, I just get kind of… Hero-y.
2-male_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=embarrassed,T-that was a strange outburst from me! I’m s-sorry, ~name~! W-wait! Why should I be sorry! You’re a villain!
2-male_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=vexed,E-er… Sorry ~name~, I can stick around for the rest of the game but this is way harder for me than putting a stop to some villains.
2-male_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=gravity,Er… You’d be surprised at how often costumes seem to get torn in embarrassing ways. T-that’s why I always wear a bra! And underwear!
2-male_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=shy,I-I think it’s great that you’re going through with it. Yep. Very heroic. No problems here. With your ~clothing~ and various smaller bits on the floor.
2-male_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b=shy,I’m sorry ~name~, I thought this’d be easier with another hero but… Um. It’s still quite embarrassing...
2-male_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=shy,I sure hope not. Because that makes me k-kind of an idiot.
2-male_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=embarrassed,W-well! It sure didn’t work! I wanted to come to this of my own free will-- N-no wait, I didn’t mean!
2-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=embarrassed,Mmhmm! This isn’t making me super uncomfortable. Nope. I am A-OK!
2-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=calm,Mmf. Yes. I am nodding my head. This is fine. I am not cringing internally.

2-male_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=shy,I-I’d rather not think too much about how this reflects on us.

4-male_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=gravity,I feel like I’m really <i>up and down</i> about this kind of thing.
4-male_removed_major=interested,Um. I'm not <i>happy</i> ~name~ lost, but he does look... pretty good.
4-male_removed_major=interested,Okay, ~name~, at least if I lose next round I can do so knowing you're next to me. Um. Scorewise.
4-male_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=heroic,I know you’re embarrassed, ~name~, but we can’t just be ashamed for no reason!
4-male_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=heroic,I’ve got your back, ~name~, as someone else who can be… Um. Fairly traditional about nudity.
4-male_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=gravity,I kind of do it better when I’m either focused or stressed. Funny how that works, right?
4-male_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=gravity,Er… I don’t suppose you’re shy about it and it’s not something I’m supposed to talk about?
4-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=nauseous,~Clothing~ is supposed to cover a lot, so now you’re showing a lot, and so now I’m <i>embarrassed</i> a lot!
4-male_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=gravity,That way, this… Weirdness can stop.
4-male_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=gravity,G-given that you’re… Think, Ochako! Think how to stop this villain!
4-male_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=heroic,I’m so jealous of your Quirk, ~name~! It must be great to just… Lift off...
4-male_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=embarrassed,I-I kind of think about it every now and then
4-male_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=shy,I-is that just a villain thing? I don’t think so, but I’d say my friends are more confident rather than shameless like you.
4-male_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=vexed,I-I’d really rather you just surrender than have us keep going, ~name~.
4-male_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=interested,A-at least you’ve got a neat Quirk, ~name~ !
4-male_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=heroic,Er… At least we have a unique Quirk in common, huh?
4-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:4=shy,I give up. You’re clearly playing this game a little differently than the rest, but you don’t seem too bothered by getting naked… S-so, Well, best of luck, 9S! Keep at it!
4-male_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=vexed,Um. Sorry, I just get kind of… Hero-y.
4-male_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=embarrassed,T-that was a strange outburst from me! I’m s-sorry, ~name~! W-wait! Why should I be sorry! You’re a villain!
4-male_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=shy,We’ve both got to be pretty embarrassed now, don’t we, ~name~? Do you think we’ll get a bad evaluation from HQ for losing?
4-male_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=shy,I-I’d rather not think too much about how this reflects on us.
4-male_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=heroic,Y-you still look good without your ~clothing~! Don’t give up yet, ~name~!
4-male_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=embarrassed,E-erm. I wonder if embarrassment is contagious…
4-male_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=vexed,E-er… Sorry ~name~, I can stick around for the rest of the game but this is way harder for me than putting a stop to some villains.
4-male_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=gravity,Er… You’d be surprised at how often costumes seem to get torn in embarrassing ways. T-that’s why I always wear a bra! And underwear!
4-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=embarrassed,Mmhmm! This isn’t making me super uncomfortable. Nope. I am A-OK!
4-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=calm,Mmf. Yes. I am nodding my head. This is fine. I am not cringing internally.
4-male_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=shy,I-I think it’s great that you’re going through with it. Yep. Very heroic. No problems here. With your ~clothing~ and various smaller bits on the floor.
4-male_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b=shy,I’m sorry ~name~, I thought this’d be easier with another hero but… Um. It’s still quite embarrassing...
4-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=nauseous,I can’t believe you took off your ~clothing~, ~name~! <i>I’m</i> embarrassed just thinking about it!
4-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=gravity,Um. S-sorry, I just got distracted. By a villain. And not your ~clothing~ being on the floor.
4-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=nauseous,Your ~clothing~?! That's supposed to cover a lot, so now you’re showing a lot, and so now I’m <i>embarrassed</i> a lot!
4-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_5a,notSaidMarker:enf_5b,marker:enf_5b=serious,That’s what this game is about. I’m not screaming on the inside. Not me! <i>Not at all.</i> I-I’ll put up a brave face for the rest of this, at least.
4-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_5a,notSaidMarker:enf_5b,marker:enf_5b=heroic,Yeah! Take more off! Definitely don't win and keep your major articles on! No! Definitely for real take them off. I'm great! Really!
4-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=embarrassed,I’m really coming around to appreciate the <i>gravity</i> of the situation.

4-male_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=vexed,THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT GOING TO BE AN EXPERIENCE WE LOOK BACK ON IN THE YEARS TO COME AND SPONTANEOUSLY BREAK OUT IN A COLD SWEAT AND BLUSH.
4-male_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=vexed,LET’S JUST FOCUS ON GETTING OUT OF HERE TONIGHT SO WE CAN GO BACK TO OUR HOMES AND HAVE A LONG, COLD SHOWER TO CALM OUR NERVES AND THINK ABOUT WHAT WE DID TO DESERVE THIS.

4-male_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=interested,Not that I’d have had any reason to have done that before. You know what, nevermind.
4-male_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=nauseous,Changing between missions in a co-ed environment where undressing is a penalty. Nope, not frightening at all.
4-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_4a,notSaidMarker:enf_4b,marker:enf_4b=embarrassed,T-that’s f-fine. M-mmf. I-I’ll just… hnmf.
4-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_4a,notSaidMarker:enf_4b,marker:enf_4b=shy,E-er. That's great! ~name~! G-great! N-not at all embarrassing for us. N-nope! S-so great!
4-male_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=shy,I sure hope not. Because that makes me k-kind of an idiot.
4-male_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=embarrassed,W-well! It sure didn’t work! I wanted to come to this of my own free will-- N-no wait, I didn’t mean!
4-male_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=gravity,It k-kinda makes you just want to float away, right?
4-male_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=embarrassed,I think I just have a lot of sympathy for you doing that, and it’s making me think of me doing it and I’m just kind of allovertheplace andokayIreallyshouldstop.
4-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=embarrassed,Those sure are some ~clothing~ that ~name~’s not wearing anymore. Yep. Mmhmm! What could go wrong!?

4-female_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_4b,notSaidMarker:enf_5a,marker:enf_5a=embarrassed,It’s fine. ~name~ is just taking off her clothing that’ll show off large portions of her skin.

4-female_removing_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_1b,notSaidMarker:enf_2a,marker:enf_2a=vexed,I should just use my Quirk to remove you from the game.
4-female_removing_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=shy,Zero Gravity doesn’t actually let me fly…

4-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:3=interested,I was just looking at your costume. It’s actually not super complicated at all, is it? It’s just flexible material with a bit of rip-stoppage. It even looks kinda dirty and worn-out… And some of the patterning is definitely...
4-female_removing_major,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=embarrassed,I-I’ll just stare elsewhere. Oh gosh, my face is just getting so red, isn’t it?

6-female_removing_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:1=heroic,“Wii Fit!” You <i>do</i> have some sort of training boosting power. And you’re so gentle about how you speak.

6-female_removed_major=shy,I-I kind of wish I’d just taken mine off like that instead of making a big deal out of it…
6-female_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_5a,notSaidMarker:enf_5b,marker:enf_5b=serious,That’s what this game is about. I’m not screaming on the inside. Not me! <i>Not at all.</i> I-I’ll put up a brave face for the rest of this, at least.
6-female_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=heroic,I’m so jealous of your Quirk, ~name~! It must be great to just… Lift off...

6-female_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=shy,We’ve both got to be pretty embarrassed now, don’t we, ~name~? Do you think we’ll get a bad evaluation from HQ for losing?
6-female_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=shy,I-I’d rather not think too much about how this reflects on us.
6-female_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=vexed,THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT GOING TO BE AN EXPERIENCE WE LOOK BACK ON IN THE YEARS TO COME AND SPONTANEOUSLY BREAK OUT IN A COLD SWEAT AND BLUSH.
6-female_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=vexed,LET’S JUST FOCUS ON GETTING OUT OF HERE TONIGHT SO WE CAN GO BACK TO OUR HOMES AND HAVE A LONG, COLD SHOWER TO CALM OUR NERVES AND THINK ABOUT WHAT WE DID TO DESERVE THIS.

6-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,marker:enf_1b=interested,Whoa! So that suit <i>was</i> part of your Quirk? That's so cool! But. Um. What else does it do?
6-female_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=shy,I sure hope not. Because that makes me k-kind of an idiot.

6-female_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=shy,I-is that just a villain thing? I don’t think so, but I’d say my friends are more confident rather than shameless like you.
6-female_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=vexed,I-I’d really rather you just surrender than have us keep going, ~name~.

6-female_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=embarrassed,I’m really coming around to appreciate the <i>gravity</i> of the situation.
6-female_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=embarrassed,<i>Meep!</i>
6-female_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=vexed,E-er… Sorry ~name~, I can stick around for the rest of the game but this is way harder for me than putting a stop to some villains.
6-female_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=gravity,Er… You’d be surprised at how often costumes seem to get torn in embarrassing ways. T-that’s why I always wear a bra! And underwear!
6-female_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_4a,notSaidMarker:enf_4b,marker:enf_4b=embarrassed,T-that’s f-fine. M-mmf. I-I’ll just… Hnmf.
6-female_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=gravity,That way, this… Weirdness can stop.
6-female_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=gravity,G-given that you’re… Think, Ochako! Think how to stop this villain!
6-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2=gravity,I think a villain would be a lot more sinister when she took off her mask… Though do you actually have some sort of vocal Quirk? I’ve never heard someone make a sound like that!
6-female_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=embarrassed,That's sure ~name~'s ~clothing~ that ~name~’s not wearing anymore. Yep. Mmhmm! What could go wrong!?
6-female_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=embarrassed,Mhmmf! Yep! Those sure are ~name~’s ~clothing~ on the floor and not on her body.
6-female_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=vexed,That's sure ~name~'s ~clothing~ that ~name~’s not wearing anymore. Yep. See, my grammar is exacting. This means I am calm and collected!
6-female_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=interested,Not that I’d have had any reason to have done that before. You know what, nevermind.
6-female_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=nauseous,Changing between missions in a co-ed environment where undressing is a penalty. Nope, not frightening at all.
6-female_removed_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:2=shy,I bet your services are really something else! Though maybe you shouldn’t book yourself so often you show up to a game like this still sweating… Or maybe you’ve learned how to make the best of a sweating Quirk, considering you looked so dry earlier…
6-female_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=shy,I-I think it’s great that you’re going through with it. Yep. Very heroic. No problems here. With your ~clothing~ and various smaller bits on the floor.
6-female_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=shy,I’m sorry ~name~, I thought this’d be easier with another hero but… Um. It’s still quite embarrassing...
6-female_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=vexed,Um. Sorry, I just get kind of… Hero-y.
6-female_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=embarrassed,T-that was a strange outburst from me! I’m s-sorry, ~name~! W-wait! Why should I be sorry! You’re a villain!
6-female_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=gravity,It k-kinda makes you just want to float away, right?
6-female_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=embarrassed,I think I just have a lot of sympathy for you doing that, and it’s making me think of me doing it and I’m just kind of allovertheplace andokayIreallyshouldstop.
6-female_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=heroic,Y-you still look good without your ~clothing~! Don’t give up yet, ~name~!

6-female_removed_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:1=embarrassed,But do you have some sort of synergy power? And... e-err... you look really sweaty... like <i>really</i> sweaty.
6-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=interested,Oh! You have a sharpshooting Quirk! Just… Please be careful!
6-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:4=shy,Just sewn back together to vaguely resemble webs… W-w-what? N-no! I was just looking at your equipment! I wasn’t--
6-female_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=gravity,I kind of do it better when I’m either focused or stressed. Funny how that works, right?
6-female_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=gravity,Er… I don’t suppose you’re shy about it and it’s not something I’m supposed to talk about?
6-female_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=interested,A-at least you’ve got a neat Quirk, ~name~ ! The-the floating, I mean.
6-female_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=heroic,Er… At least we have a unique Quirk in common, huh? Our flying, I mean.
6-female_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=heroic,S-shoot. Don’t worry, ~name~! I’m a Pro Hero. Even if I’m a little… I’m still here to support you!

6-female_removed_major,target:d.va,targetStage:4=vexed,M-maybe you want to gush in other ways, which is why you wore such a tight suit.
6-female_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=embarrassed,Mmhmm! This isn’t making me super uncomfortable. Nope. I am A-OK!
6-female_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=calm,Mmf. Yes. I am nodding my head. This is fine. I am not cringing internally.
6-female_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=heroic,I know you’re embarrassed, ~name~, but we can’t just be ashamed for no reason!
6-female_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=heroic,I’ve got your back, ~name~, as someone else who can be… Um. Fairly traditional about nudity.

-3-male_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_4b,notSaidMarker:enf_5a,marker:enf_5a=nauseous,E-erk.
-3-male_removing_major,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=shy,I-I’ll just stare elsewhere. Oh gosh, my face is just getting so red, isn’t it?
-3-male_removing_major,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=embarrassed,I-I-I’m just going to look away now.
-3-male_removing_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_1b,notSaidMarker:enf_2a,marker:enf_2a=interested,S-so you can do that while floating, right? J-just curious.
-3-male_removing_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_1b,notSaidMarker:enf_2a,marker:enf_2a=nauseous,Gah, this feels so weird, watching you take off your ~clothing~ and er…
-3-male_removing_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=shy,I-I was doing pretty okay until ~name~ needed to take off her ~clothing~.
-3-male_removing_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=shy,S-she’s just as embarrassed as I am…
-3-male_removing_major,filter:shy,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=shy,Phew. I can see I’m not the only one here who’s not thrilled by the prospect of this game…
-3-male_removing_major,filter:shy,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=heroic,Don’t worry, ~name~, I know I seem pretty brave, but I’m also really freaked out right now.
-3-male_removed_major=gravity,Care to join me, ~name~?
-3-male_removed_major=happy,If you're not embarrassed, and took off more, I think it'd help me stay focused, ~name~!
-3-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=embarrassed,Those sure are some ~clothing~ that ~name~’s not wearing anymore. Yep. Mmhmm! What could go wrong!?
-3-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=embarrassed,Mhmmf! Yep! Those sure are ~name~’s ~clothing~ on the floor and not on his body.
-3-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=embarrassed,Mmhmm! This isn’t making me super uncomfortable. Nope. I am A-OK!
-3-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=calm,Mmf. Yes. I am nodding my head. This is fine. I am not cringing internally.

-3-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=gravity,Um. S-sorry, I just got distracted. By a villain. And not your ~clothing~ being on the floor.
-3-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=nauseous,Your ~clothing~?! That's supposed to cover a lot, so now you’re showing a lot, and so now I’m <i>embarrassed</i> a lot!
-3-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:4=shy,I give up. You’re clearly playing this game a little differently than the rest, but you don’t seem too bothered by getting naked… S-so, Well, best of luck, 9S! Keep at it!
-3-male_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=interested,Not that I’d have had any reason to have done that before. You know what, nevermind.
-3-male_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=nauseous,Changing between missions in a co-ed environment where undressing is a penalty. Nope, not frightening at all.
-3-male_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=gravity,I kind of do it better when I’m either focused or stressed. Funny how that works, right?
-3-male_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=gravity,Er… I don’t suppose you’re shy about it and it’s not something I’m supposed to talk about?

-3-male_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=vexed,I-I’d really rather you just surrender than have us keep going, ~name~.
-3-male_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=shy,We’ve both got to be pretty embarrassed now, don’t we, ~name~? Do you think we’ll get a bad evaluation from HQ for losing?
-3-male_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=shy,I-I’d rather not think too much about how this reflects on us.
-3-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_4a,notSaidMarker:enf_4b,marker:enf_4b=embarrassed,T-that’s f-fine. M-mmf. I-I’ll just… hnmf.
-3-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_4a,notSaidMarker:enf_4b,marker:enf_4b=shy,E-er. That's great! ~name~! G-great! N-not at all embarrassing for us. N-nope! S-so great!

-3-male_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=gravity,It k-kinda makes you just want to float away, right?
-3-male_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=embarrassed,I think I just have a lot of sympathy for you doing that, and it’s making me think of me doing it and I’m just kind of allovertheplace andokayIreallyshouldstop.
-3-male_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=shy,I sure hope not. Because that makes me k-kind of an idiot.
-3-male_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=embarrassed,W-well! It sure didn’t work! I wanted to come to this of my own free will-- N-no wait, I didn’t mean!
-3-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=embarrassed,I’m really coming around to appreciate the <i>gravity</i> of the situation.
-3-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=embarrassed,<i>Meep!</i>
-3-male_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=vexed,Um. Sorry, I just get kind of… Hero-y.
-3-male_removed_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=embarrassed,T-that was a strange outburst from me! I’m s-sorry, ~name~! W-wait! Why should I be sorry! You’re a villain!
-3-male_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=vexed,THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT GOING TO BE AN EXPERIENCE WE LOOK BACK ON IN THE YEARS TO COME AND SPONTANEOUSLY BREAK OUT IN A COLD SWEAT AND BLUSH.
-3-male_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=vexed,LET’S JUST FOCUS ON GETTING OUT OF HERE TONIGHT SO WE CAN GO BACK TO OUR HOMES AND HAVE A LONG, COLD SHOWER TO CALM OUR NERVES AND THINK ABOUT WHAT WE DID TO DESERVE THIS.
-3-male_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=interested,A-at least you’ve got a neat Quirk, ~name~ !
-3-male_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=heroic,Er… At least we have a unique Quirk in common, huh?
-3-male_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=heroic,I know you’re embarrassed, ~name~, but we can’t just be ashamed for no reason!
-3-male_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=heroic,I’ve got your back, ~name~, as someone else who can be… Um. Fairly traditional about nudity.
-3-male_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=heroic,Y-you still look good without your ~clothing~! Don’t give up yet, ~name~!
-3-male_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=embarrassed,E-erm. I wonder if embarrassment is contagious…
-3-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_5a,notSaidMarker:enf_5b,marker:enf_5b=serious,That’s what this game is about. I’m not screaming on the inside. Not me! <i>Not at all.</i> I-I’ll put up a brave face for the rest of this, at least.
-3-male_removed_major,saidMarker:enf_5a,notSaidMarker:enf_5b,marker:enf_5b=heroic,Yeah! Take more off! Definitely don't win and keep your major articles on! No! Definitely for real take them off. I'm great! Really!
-3-male_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=shy,I-I think it’s great that you’re going through with it. Yep. Very heroic. No problems here. With your ~clothing~ and various smaller bits on the floor.
-3-male_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b=shy,I’m sorry ~name~, I thought this’d be easier with another hero but… Um. It’s still quite embarrassing...
-3-male_removed_major,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=heroic,S-shoot. Don’t worry, ~name~! I’m a Pro Hero. Even if I’m a little… I’m still here to support you!

-3-male_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=vexed,E-er… Sorry ~name~, I can stick around for the rest of the game but this is way harder for me than putting a stop to some villains.
-3-male_removed_major,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_0a,notSaidMarker:enf_0b,marker:enf_0b=gravity,Er… You’d be surprised at how often costumes seem to get torn in embarrassing ways. T-that’s why I always wear a bra! And underwear!
-3-male_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=heroic,I’m so jealous of your Quirk, ~name~! It must be great to just… Lift off...
-3-male_removed_major,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_1a,notSaidMarker:enf_1b,marker:enf_1b=embarrassed,I-I kind of think about it every now and then
-3-female_removing_major=embarrassed,Oh, ~name~! It's actually kinda refreshing being naked.
-3-female_removing_major=embarrassed,Hmm... That's a cute ~clothing~, ~name~! I-I guess you'll be happy to get that back after it's over, right?
-3-female_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_4b,notSaidMarker:enf_5a,marker:enf_5a=embarrassed,It’s fine. ~name~ is just taking off her clothing that’ll show off large portions of her skin.
-3-female_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_4b,notSaidMarker:enf_5a=shy,E-erk.
-3-female_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_3b,notSaidMarker:enf_4a,marker:enf_4a=interested,D-d-do y-you have something else you could... Take off... ~name~?
-3-female_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_3b,notSaidMarker:enf_4a,marker:enf_4a=nauseous,O-oh. ~name~ is taking off her... That's fine. Totally fine. Yep. Sexy even.

-3-female_removing_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:1=heroic,“Wii Fit!” You <i>do</i> have some sort of training boosting power. And you’re so gentle about how you speak.
-3-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Y-you’re so comfortable with this! B-but there’s so many people and it’s not like we’re changing into something else--!
-3-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=happy,O-oh! We call it training gear too. Back when I was in school, we did have a full gym outfit, at least.

-3-female_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_1b,notSaidMarker:enf_2a,marker:enf_2a=vexed,Hmmf!
-3-female_removing_major,saidMarker:enf_1b,notSaidMarker:enf_2a,marker:enf_2a=vexed,Hrm. Mmf? Mmhmm.
-3-female_removing_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_1b,notSaidMarker:enf_2a,marker:enf_2a=serious,I’m pretty sure I can legally just Zero Gravity you to the ceiling…
-3-female_removing_major,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_1b,notSaidMarker:enf_2a,marker:enf_2a=vexed,I should just use my Quirk to remove you from the game.

-3-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:3=interested,I was just looking at your costume. It’s actually not super complicated at all, is it? It’s just flexible material with a bit of rip-stoppage. It even looks kinda dirty and worn-out… And some of the patterning is definitely...
-3-female_removed_major=happy,It's maybe not the easiest thing to be naked in front of strangers, but I think the human body and all it's quirks can be pretty special! What's special about yours?

1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:neo,count-rwby:1=nauseous,Please don't shapeshift anymore. It's really rude to her.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:neo,count-rwby:1=embarrassed,I'm glad you aren't mimicing her, but I also noticed your... Um. Hair is changing color. T-that's kinda weird.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=happy,There's nothing wrong with hair down there. But I think most people prefer <i>some</i> management.

1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale=embarrassed,Though something cute and frilly adds a lot to a wardrobe! N-not unlike your... your... erk.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:trimmed=happy,Hm! Most heroes I know either go totally bare or just let it go wild. You must really care about your appearance, ~name~!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:trimmed,marker:phc_bf=heroic,Wow, you put a lot of effort into that, ~name~! It seems a lot easier to take it all off or just leave it be. Your boyfriend must be very happy!

5-male_chest_is_visible,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=shy,I-I mean, I’m definitely not thinking about grabbing ~name~ and helping evacuate him from what’s clearly a hostage situation.
5-male_chest_is_visible,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=shy,When you’re hovering, do you ever… I dunno, does the jiggling ever feel… Kinda good?

6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale=embarrassed,Though something cute and frilly adds a lot to a wardrobe! N-not unlike your... your... erk.

-3-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_5a,notSaidMarker:enf_5b,marker:enf_5b=heroic,I know it’s not easy, but th-this’ll be okay in a few minutes. I really think so!

-2-male_chest_will_be_visible=happy,O-oh, wouldn't you be my hero, ~name~?
-2-male_chest_will_be_visible=interested,Y-yes!
-2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=shy,O-oh. So your coat? It was kind of villainous, but it also looked kind of cool--
-2-male_chest_is_visible=gravity2,Oh f-fu-- Just what I needed!
-2-male_chest_is_visible=gravity1,You-- You look so-- Strong, ~name~!
-2-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=embarrassed,W-what? I-I-I-- Y-y-you have no-- Er!
-2-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=embarrassed,Hm. I can’t say I’ve seen that kind of physical difference before. I don’t think it’s <i>that</i> unusual though, is it?
-2-male_chest_is_visible,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=shy,I-I guess it’s not too bad since ~name~’s a hero too? I know Crimson Riot usually goes mostly shirtless…
-2-male_chest_is_visible,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=shy,...Y-yep. This is fine. I’M FINE. DON’T WORRY ABOUT IT! HAHA!

-2-male_small_crotch_is_visible=calm,Oh, w-well, e-everyone's impressive in their own ways!
-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=heroic,D-do you w-want to follow the rules because I could break a few r-right now!
-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=gravity2,MMF!
-2-male_large_crotch_is_visible=heroic,I-I wouldn't mind seeing that Quirk in action right about now!
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible=interested,Don't give up, ~name~!
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible=shy,Err-- Um… Uh…
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=interested,Though I’ve usually only heard of them being used to… Um. Take care of yourself, not get undressed.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:6=calm,Those <i>do</i> look comfortable.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia=heroic,--Um… Maybe I should be trying to be a bit more like that… Y-you know, c-confident!
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:neo,count-rwby:1=nauseous,Gross. I hate shapeshifting Quirks.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=nauseous,--Take off anything that’s a big deal.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:7=gravity,Something I’ve been really happy about is how comfortable most hero costume gear is. I honestly feel more at ease with all my upgrades most of the time. I guess we're different that way.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:7=embarrassed,W-well, there they are!
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mei=interested,As long as she <i>chills</i> out.

-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=interested,You really <i>have</i> worked hard to get in such great shape!
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible=embarrassed,W-well, i-it's kind of like a guy's--

-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible=calm,M-maybe it's just the moment but...
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible=calm,Wow, ~name~! Keep it up!
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=vexed,I’m kind of curious if there’s Quirks out there that make people act s-so strangely… But like, only the user.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:neo,count-rwby:1=vexed,You really shouldn't, Neo. At least you had the decency to change back instead of mocking the other players.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=vexed,That was a close one, Aimee!
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight=shy,I-I always think it's... interesting to see how... skin color affects... Everything. Heh heh. This isn't awkward at all!
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale=interested,Normally I do most of my training per Hero standards, but I think a little bit of extra conditioning would be great! Could I call you to schedule a few courses after this?

-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia=nauseous,I mean, not naked-- Just… Because I’m kind of already-- Mmfhg!
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible=nauseous,Heh-- I guess I'm giving everyone else a little preview, huh, ~name~?
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:mei=happy,Don’t <i>freeze up</i>, Mei!
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia,marker:enf_1b=embarrassed,Th-that has to be a first. What an i-interesting Quirk you have, Felicia.
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=shy,I-I guess it’s not too bad since ~name~’s a hero too? I know Crimson Riot usually goes mostly shirtless…

-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,marker:stakeout=happy,Y-you're welcome to join me, ~name~! I-it'd be like on-- on a long-- Stakeout when---
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=embarrassed,But aren’t you kind of destroying your clothes? How are you going to get home?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Um. I-I’m not sure I’ve ever actually heard of a hero with that name before. I-it's kinda weird!
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=shy,Oh! I-I-I expected your bra to be next. I definitely appreciate something really support...y when I’m suited up.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mahiru,saidMarker:enf_4b,notSaidMarker:enf_5a,marker:enf_5a=shy,W-w-what? You--you've given someone your panties before...? Why would you...?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0,marker:enf_1b=embarrassed,H-hey! You shouldn’t just--
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:gwen=embarrassed,W-what does that have to do with anything?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:gwen=shy,Uh- um. Errr. W-whatever f-floats your webs, Gwen!
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mahiru,saidMarker:enf_3b,notSaidMarker:enf_4a,marker:enf_4a=shy,W-w-what? You--you've given someone your panties before...? Why would you...?

-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:neo=interested,This again? C-could you maybe just... not?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=shy,I-I see you're g-going to do the same thing y-you did last round...
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=shy,Somehow I don't think Mandalay and the other Pussycats have to go through this.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible=gravity,When y-you just need release!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:3=shy,Unless that’s your actual name, which might explain why you’re acting a bit strange… G-gah! Watch what you're taking off! We can all see y-your...
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:neo,count-rwby:1=nauseous,Please don't shapeshift anymore. It's really rude to her.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:neo,count-rwby:1=embarrassed,I'm glad you aren't mimicing her, but I also noticed your... Um. Hair is changing color. T-that's kinda weird.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=nauseous,S-shoot, are you okay?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=shy,--I’m so confused right now.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale=embarrassed,Though something cute and frilly adds a lot to a wardrobe! N-not unlike your... your... erk.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:trimmed=interested,W-wow! That's such a cute style! Y-you're quite c-clever, huh, ~name~?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:shaved=embarrassed,Ooh, at least there's <i>some</i> cover on me...
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:gwen=vexed,I’m <i>absolutely</i> flesh and blood! …I-I’m not quite sure why I phrased it like that.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=happy,Y-you're in good company, ~name~!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia,marker:enf_3b=embarrassed,This raises a lot of questions about some people I know with body quirks, and they're questions I'd really rather avoid.

-1-male_chest_will_be_visible=interested,This at least makes up for the whole "being naked" thing.
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible=embarrassed,I hope this makes up for me being naked.
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible=happy,Even though I'm finished, it's still nice seeing attractive men undress, obviously.
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible=heroic,Someone as handsome as ~name~ is definitely worth watching.
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_4b,notSaidMarker:enf_5a,marker:enf_5a=shy,W-well, I guess we can kind of...
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_4b,notSaidMarker:enf_5a,marker:enf_5a=shy,Well, I hope that we can rise above this sort of thing. And...
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=nauseous,C-could ~name~ have something else for a penalty? A-asking for a friend.
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=embarrassed,Oh-- He has to-- W-wait, surely there’s something else--
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=embarrassed,Uh-- Uh-- Um. They don't really cover this type of challenge at UA...
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=embarrassed,Okay, s-so you’ve been saving some kind of Quirk to use that'll cover you up, right?
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_4b,notSaidMarker:enf_5a=interested,I-I mean, we’re really getting down to it, aren’t we, ~name~? I <i>completely</i> forgot to ask if your agency assigned this to you… Or if you want to be here…
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_4b,notSaidMarker:enf_5a=embarrassed,S-so, I’ve been meaning to ask, ~name~. Do you… Usually get sent by your agency to this type of mission? O-or w-would you do this sort of thing just for fun?
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_3b,notSaidMarker:enf_4a,marker:enf_4a=embarrassed,I don’t really know how to say this but be…
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_3b,notSaidMarker:enf_4a,marker:enf_4a=embarrassed,Um. At least you don’t… Have quite the chest I do… While floating… Um…
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_4b,notSaidMarker:enf_5a,marker:enf_5a=vexed,Gah! W-why don’t you just surrender, ~name~!
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_4b,notSaidMarker:enf_5a,marker:enf_5a=vexed,You really could've avoided this whole situation, ~name~!
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_3b,notSaidMarker:enf_4a,marker:enf_4a=nauseous,Hnnnggggg...
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_3b,notSaidMarker:enf_4a,marker:enf_4a=nauseous,Urgh...
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,saidMarker:enf_1b,notSaidMarker:enf_2a,marker:enf_2a=embarrassed,I-I promise I won't look, ~name~!
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=interested,Re-really? Your chest, ~name~?
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,saidMarker:enf_3b,notSaidMarker:enf_4a,marker:enf_4a=interested,Um… Do you really have to…?
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,saidMarker:enf_4b,notSaidMarker:enf_5a,marker:enf_5a=serious,Eh!?
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,saidMarker:enf_1b,notSaidMarker:enf_2a,marker:enf_2a=vexed,O-oh no no no. I-I shouldn’t-- It’s so rude to look--
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=embarrassed,I-I’ll just stare elsewhere. Oh gosh, my face is just getting so red, isn’t it?
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,notSaidMarker:enf_0a,marker:enf_0a=embarrassed,I-I-I’m just going to look away now.
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=shy,Err… Weird question, ~name~...
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=shy,So you know how when you jump, you get that really light feeling in your feet, ~name~?
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,saidMarker:enf_0b,notSaidMarker:enf_1a,marker:enf_1a=embarrassed,H-h-h-he’s going to take off his ~clothing~? T-that means…
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=embarrassed,G-gah, do you have nothing smaller left, ~name~!?
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_2b,notSaidMarker:enf_3a,marker:enf_3a=embarrassed,Y-you already have to...
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=shy,O-oh. So your coat? It was kind of villainous, but it also looked kind of cool--
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_3b,notSaidMarker:enf_4a,marker:enf_4a=interested,I guess it’s not <i>so</i> bad if it’s... N-not because I’m interested, just because ~name~ has to be used to this--
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_3b,notSaidMarker:enf_4a,marker:enf_4a=interested,I-I will say that at least you seemed equipped for the game…
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_4b,notSaidMarker:enf_5a,marker:enf_5a=heroic,Okay. If ~name~’s going to take off her ~clothing~ and show her chest, then the least I can do is be supportive for the rest of the game!
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_4b,notSaidMarker:enf_5a,marker:enf_5a=heroic,D-don’t give up ~name~!
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_3b,notSaidMarker:enf_4a,marker:enf_4a=interested,You know, ~name~, if you just gave up, I’m s-sure we wouldn’t have to add embarrassing a hero to your list of crimes.
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_3b,notSaidMarker:enf_4a,marker:enf_4a=serious,F-fine, ~name~. Just take off your ~clothing~. Show your chest. Don’t give up… Shoot, I thought reverse psychology would… Work… STOP YOUR CRIMES, VILLAIN!
-1-male_chest_is_visible=interested,Oh. Oh yes.
-1-male_chest_is_visible=happy,Hmm... I'm still undecided. Would you... Take more off, ~name~? For me?
-1-male_chest_is_visible=interested,I think I might remember this for a little while down the road...
-1-male_chest_is_visible=gravity,Mmm. I could rest my head on that about now.
-1-male_chest_is_visible,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=shy,When you’re hovering, do you ever… I dunno, does the jiggling ever feel… Kinda good?
-1-male_chest_is_visible,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=embarrassed,Do you get that jiggly feeling too when you’re floating, ~name~? N-not when you just land and you go whooo-homp! But… Um… Nevermind.
-1-male_chest_is_visible,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=shy,I-I guess it’s not too bad since ~name~’s a hero too? I know Crimson Riot usually goes mostly shirtless…

-1-male_chest_is_visible,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=nauseous,C-could I just send ~name~ to jail, instead of… This? It’s going to be really awkward to apprehend her/him if he/she tries to run!
-1-male_chest_is_visible,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=shy,~name~, I know you might be a villain, but I feel… Pretty embarrassed for you.
-1-male_chest_is_visible,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_4a,notSaidMarker:enf_4b,marker:enf_4b=shy,C-careful ~name~! If you move wrong, you can… Er. Kind of jiggle unflatteringly.
-1-male_chest_is_visible,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_4a,notSaidMarker:enf_4b,marker:enf_4b=shy,J-just pay attention to how you’re moving. I-if you don’t you might. Um. Jiggle. Lots.
-1-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=embarrassed,W-what? I-I-I-- Y-y-you have no-- Er!
-1-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=embarrassed,Hm. I can’t say I’ve seen that kind of physical difference before. I don’t think it’s <i>that</i> unusual though, is it?
-1-male_chest_is_visible,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=shy,B-but can’t you see how embarrassed he is? You’re being really rude! F-fine.
-1-male_chest_is_visible,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=shy,I-I mean, I’m definitely not thinking about grabbing ~name~ and helping evacuate him from what’s clearly a hostage situation.
-1-male_chest_is_visible,saidMarker:enf_2a,notSaidMarker:enf_2b,marker:enf_2b=embarrassed,I-  I can’t watch this. Wait, you already-- AH!!!
-1-male_chest_is_visible,saidMarker:enf_4a,notSaidMarker:enf_4b,marker:enf_4b=serious,I have no idea how you can be so… Well, maybe composed is the wrong word…
-1-male_chest_is_visible,saidMarker:enf_5a,notSaidMarker:enf_5b,marker:enf_5b=embarrassed,Okay… Okay… I’ll just have to get a grip, I guess.
-1-male_chest_is_visible,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_5a,notSaidMarker:enf_5b,marker:enf_5b=happy,Keep floating on after this.
-1-male_chest_is_visible,filter:flies,saidMarker:enf_5a,notSaidMarker:enf_5b,marker:enf_5b=heroic,Count on our Quirks to buoy our spirits somewhat. I’ll try and be a little more confident now. Thanks ~name~!
-1-male_chest_is_visible,saidMarker:enf_3a,notSaidMarker:enf_3b,marker:enf_3b=serious,Hmmph. Hmph. That sure is a chest. Mmhmm.
-1-male_chest_is_visible,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_5a,notSaidMarker:enf_5b,marker:enf_5b=embarrassed,I’ll make sure you get… Um. A lighter sentence if you just stop being so embarrassing!
-1-male_chest_is_visible,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_5a,notSaidMarker:enf_5b,marker:enf_5b=embarrassed,I’m not blushing! I’m flushed with anger at your injustices, ~name~! A-and I don’t mean your chest! F-fine! I’ll stop being so embarrassed and get back to trying to get you to lose!
-1-male_chest_is_visible,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_4a,notSaidMarker:enf_4b,marker:enf_4b=nauseous,I-I didn’t mean-- I mean prepared to do anything for-- T-the-- Grurhmh!
-1-male_chest_is_visible,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_4a,notSaidMarker:enf_4b,marker:enf_4b=nauseous,L-like, for the sake of the mission-- Not that ~name~ would ever do this just-- Grormg!
-1-male_chest_is_visible,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_5a,notSaidMarker:enf_5b,marker:enf_5b=shy,I-I’ll just look away now. What a hero does during time-off isn’t really any of my business.
-1-male_chest_is_visible,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_5a,notSaidMarker:enf_5b,marker:enf_5b=shy,Um… Maybe we should file a complaint with our agencies… This game seems… Rather more popular than… Is really warranted.
-1-male_chest_is_visible,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_4a,notSaidMarker:enf_4b,marker:enf_4b=shy,C-crime? Y-you have so many what’s one more? E-er, deceiving a Pro Hero into-- Into l-lewd acts!
-1-male_chest_is_visible,filter:villain,saidMarker:enf_4a,notSaidMarker:enf_4b,marker:enf_4b=shy,Huh? E-embarassing a Pro Hero is absolutely a crime! P-p-psychological damages!
-1-male_chest_is_visible,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_4a,notSaidMarker:enf_4b,marker:enf_4b=calm,I assure you. Though I look extremely calm and collected that’s a sound of embarrassed sympathy for ~name~.
-1-male_chest_is_visible,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_4a,notSaidMarker:enf_4b,marker:enf_4b=shy,A-at least um.... You didn’t have to… You know.
-1-male_chest_is_visible,filter:shy,saidMarker:enf_5a,notSaidMarker:enf_5b,marker:enf_5b=happy,We might be embarrassed and really naked, but at least we aren’t going to let a-anyone make it shameful!

-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible=embarrassed,I promise as a hero not to...
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible=gravity,I'm getting a little lightheaded... Could you show us something to bring me back to Earth?
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible=interested,I wonder if it's like how I was thinking it was...
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_3b,notSaidMarker:enf_4a,marker:enf_4a=embarrassed,Ah! W-what about your hero ranking, ~name~?
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:hero,saidMarker:enf_3b,notSaidMarker:enf_4a=interested,Do you do anything weird down there…?
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,saidMarker:enf_1b,notSaidMarker:enf_2a,marker:enf_2a=gravity,I’ll just go ahead and stare straight ahead.

#OPPONENT MASTURBATING
#When an opponent is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must pay the penalty by masturbating in front of everyone.
#The "must_masturbate" line is for just before it happens, and the "start_masturbating" line immediately follows.
#The "masturbating" line will be spoken a little after the opponent has started but before they climax.
#When the opponent climaxes, your character will say the "finished_masturbating" line.

#stage-specific lines that override the stage-generic ones

#SELF MASTURBATING
#If your character is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must masturbate.
#These lines only come up in the relevant stages, so you don't need to include the stage numbers here. Just remember which stage is which when you make the images. The "starting" image is still in the naked stage.
#The "finished_masturbating" line will repeat many times if the game is not yet finished. This plays as opponents comment on the how good their hands are.

#GAME OVER DEFEAT
game_over_defeat=happy,Phew. This was fun. I'd probably recommend this to some of my other friends!
game_over_defeat,target:human,alsoPlaying:futaba,count-saki:1=calm,~player~, Plus Ultra work! I wish we’d gotten a chance to meet literally anywhere else, but if you wanted to come hang out with Saki, Futaba, and I after we’re done with our hangout, I wouldn’t mind getting dinner after the singing and drinking.
game_over_defeat,target:saki,alsoPlaying:futaba=heroic,Well played, Saki. I hope you're still into all that stuff we planned to do tomorrow!
game_over_defeat,target:saki,alsoPlaying:marinette=heroic,Well played, Saki. I hope you're still into all that stuff we planned to do tomorrow!
game_over_defeat,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:10,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_out,count-saki:1=calm,~name~, you played very well, though I wish we could’ve met under less awkward circumstances. Er, you’re a hero in your own way, for helping make a new friendship though!
game_over_defeat,target:human,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:10,count-saki:1=interested,W-well, good job, ~player~, I hope you… uh, enjoyed this. I think I’m going to go try and pretend like this was mostly just a way to get to make a few new friends. I’ll see Marinette and Saki tomorrow, though, maybe we should spend time together after that?
game_over_defeat,alsoPlaying:futaba,count-saki:1=gravity,Good job, ~name~! Since it looks like this is going to be a pretty social outing after this, how do you feel about the others coming, Saki? It’s um. It’s not like they haven’t… er… come in front of us before…

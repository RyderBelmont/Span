- Minor bug fix on following lines:
	0-good_hand,totalMales:5,totalRounds:0,count-rwby:4=angry,Who invited the guy? Isn't this supposed to be a Team RWBY game?
	0-good_hand,totalMales:5,totalRounds:1,count-rwby:4=angry,You can stay for now, ~player~. But I'm watching you. Don't do anything weird.
	0-okay_hand,totalMales:5,totalRounds:0,count-rwby:4=angry,Who invited the guy? Isn't this supposed to be a Team RWBY game?
	0-okay_hand,totalMales:5,totalRounds:1,count-rwby:4=angry,You can stay for now, ~player~. But I'm watching you. Don't do anything weird.
	0-bad_hand,totalMales:5,totalRounds:0,count-rwby:4=angry,Who invited the guy? Isn't this supposed to be a Team RWBY game?
	0-bad_hand,totalMales:5,totalRounds:1,count-rwby:4=angry,You can stay for now, ~player~. But I'm watching you. Don't do anything weird.
	Presumably, the above lines were intended to show up when a male player plays against all four members of Team RWBY, but the "totalMales:5" condition made this impossible. As such, this condition in the above lines have been changed to "totalMales:1".

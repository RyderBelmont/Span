For example, should I keep a low pair and hope for a three-of-a-kind when all my opponents seem to have pairs, or should I simply hope for a better pair? Should I keep the ace and king or just the ace? I calculated the probabilities of getting a pair at some point while I was studying poker strategy, and it's only slightly higher if you toss the king, but the pair you get, if you get one, is probably lower on average. Is it ever worth going for a straight with AKQJ? With 8765? If they're the same suit?)&lt;/i&gt;</state>

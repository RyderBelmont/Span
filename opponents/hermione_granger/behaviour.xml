                <state img="#-eyeroll.png">I practiced poker against Harry but he was too easy to beat. Always trying for the riskiest plays. </state>
                <state img="#-think.png">&lt;i&gt;There's a number of books written on the subject, and I know poker is mainly a luck-based game, but I have to wonder which strategy is always the most optimal. For example, should I keep a low pair and hope for a three-of-a-kind when all my opponents seem to have pairs, or should I simply hope for a better pair? Should I keep the ace and king or just the ace? I calculated the probabilities of getting a pair at some point while I was studying poker strategy, and it's only slightly higher if you toss the king, but the pair you get, if you get one, is probably lower on average. Is it ever worth going for a straight with AKQJ? With 8765? If they're the same suit?&lt;/i&gt;</state>
                <state img="#-interest.png">&lt;i&gt;Okay, I just need to hope none of my opponents have pairs better than mine.&lt;/i&gt;</state>
                <state img="#-disapprove.png">I suppose it's good enough. Now to wait for the results.</state>
                <state img="#-lecture.png">Remember not to go for a straight. According to &lt;i&gt;The Ultimate Poker Guide&lt;/i&gt;, you have a less than one percent chance.</state>
                <state img="#-lecture.png">Don't get overconfident just because you have a pair. This is a &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; common mistake amongst amateurs, according to Chapter 14 of &lt;i&gt;A History of Wizarding Card Games&lt;/i&gt;.</state>
                <state img="#-think.png">Does this place hold poker tournaments as well? Perhaps if this game goes well, I may have found myself a new pastime. Ron keeps telling me I should find a new hobby other than reading...</state>
                <state img="#-confident.png">Just remember; losing with a pair is not as uncommon as you'd think. It's very possible to lose even with a good hand.</state>
                <state img="#-pleased.png">How much did I prepare for this? Oh, I just did the usual background reading. I could have tried and seek out every poker guide there was, but I only memorized about 20 books. I didn't go &lt;i&gt;all out&lt;/i&gt;, you see.</state>
                <state img="#-disapprove.png">I &lt;i&gt;could&lt;/i&gt; have aimed for two pairs instead of one, but that would be a bit &lt;i&gt;too&lt;/i&gt; risky at the moment... Phillip Ivroy &lt;i&gt;has&lt;/i&gt;often won tournaments with just mediocre hands, so perhaps I should play it safe.</state>

#Items of clothing should be listed here in order of removal.
#The values are formal name, lower case name, how much they cover, what they cover
#Please do not put spaces around the commas.
#"Important" clothes cover genitals (lower) or chest/breasts (upper). For example: bras, panties, a skirt when going commando.
#"Major" clothes cover underwear. For example: skirts, pants, shirts, dresses.
#"Minor" clothes cover skin or are large pieces of clothing that do not cover skin. For example: jackets, socks, stockings, gloves.
#"Extra" clothes are small items that may or may not be clothing but do not cover anything interesting. For example: jewelry, shoes or boots with socks underneath, belts, hats. In the rest of the code, "extra" clothes are called "accessory".
#If for some reason you write another word for the type of clothes (e.g. "accessory"), other characters will not react at all when the clothing is removed.
#What they cover = upper (upper body), lower (lower body), other (neither).
#The game can support any number of entries, but typically we use 2-8, with at least one "important" layer for upper and lower (each).
clothes=Jacket,jacket,extra,upper
clothes=Boots,boots,extra,lower

#Notes on dialogue
#All lines that start with a # symbol are comments and will be ignored by the tool that converts this file into a xml file for the game.
#Where more than one line has an identical type, like "swap_cards" and "swap_cards", the game will randomly select one of these lines each time the character is in that situation.
#You should try to include multiple lines for most stages, especially the final (finished) stage, -1. 

#A character goes through multiple stages as they undress. The stage number starts at zero and indicates how many layers they have removed. Special stage numbers are used when they are nude (-3), masturbating (-2), and finished (-1).
#Line types that start with a number will only display during that stage. The will override any numberless stage-generic lines. For example, in stage 4 "4-swap_cards" will be used over "swap_cards" if it is not blank here. Giving a character unique dialogue for each stage is an effective way of showing their changing openness/shyness as the game progresses.
#You can combine the above points and make multiple lines for a particular situation in a particular stage, like "4-swap_cards" and "4-swap_cards".

#Some special words can be used that will be substituted by the game for context-appropriate ones: ~name~ is the name of the character they're speaking to, but this only works if someone else is in focus. ~clothing~ is the type of clothing that is being removed by another player. ~Clothing~ is almost the same, but it starts with a capital letter in case you want to start a sentence with it.
#~name~ can be used any time a line targets an opponent (game_over_defeat, _must_strip, _removing_, _removed, _must_masturbate, etc).
#~clothing~ can be used only when clothing is being removed (_removing and _removed, but NOT _must_strip).
#~player~ can be used at any time and refers to the human player.
#~cards~ can be used only in the swap_cards lines.
#All wildcards can be used once per line only! If you use ~name~ twice, the code will show up the second time.

#Lines can be written that are only spoken when specific other characters are present. For a detailed explanation, read this guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/spnati/comments/6nhaj0/the_easy_way_to_write_targeted_lines/
#Here is an example line (note that targeted lines must have a stage number):
#0-female_must_strip,target:hermioine=happy,Looks like your magic doesn't help with poker!

#OPPONENT REMOVING ACCESSORY
#These lines are spoken when an opponent removes a small item that does not cover any skin.
#Typically, characters are fine with this when they are fully dressed but less satisfied as they become more naked.
#Note that all "removing" lines are NOT spoken to human players. Characters will skip straight from "6-male_human_must_strip" to "6-male_removed_accessory", for example.

2-male_large_crotch_is_visible=sarcastic,...Ancient Poetry in Iraq identifies that the creative force of the world was Enki or, more accurately, Enki�s penis. His penis dug the world�s first irrigation ditches, created rivers, and invented human sexual reproduction. What has your penis done for mankind, or poetry?

2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=sarcastic,I can respect your strategy of driving them crazy, but what now? Is the gardener coming, or something?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sayori=calm,You remind me of Mr. O'Neill. He was my English teacher at Lawndale. He was always on the verge of an anxiety attack.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:natsuki=paper,Here's a little poem for you: "You think you're the best, but you'll disappoint everyone expecting to see a pair of breasts"
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:elizabeth=interested,Let's see if losing that corset makes the blood flow better and reach your brain.

2-female_large_chest_is_visible=calm,Okay, your cleavage wasn't lying.

-3-male_chest_is_visible=frustrated,Oh, you had to expose your chest! How will you be able to live with yourself after this?
-3-male_chest_is_visible=calm,I think you may be overreacting a little.
-3-male_chest_is_visible=embarrassed,I wouldn't call you attractive, but you do look... <i>okay</i>.
-3-male_chest_is_visible=angry,Wait a second. I'm drooling... and I am supposed to come up with a sarcastic comment. WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO ME?!
-3-male_chest_is_visible=calm,You'll live, trust me.
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible=calm,Gee... I hope I didn't whine as much as, ~name~. I apologize if I did.
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible=angry,Man up, dude.
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible=frustrated,A penis... Just what I needed to see when I'm naked.
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible=sarcastic,I'm not making a <i>big</i> fuzz about it because chances are there's nothing big underneath.
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible=angry,This will be the first <i>and last</i> time we'll be naked together in the same room, ~name~. Not that you care.
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pit=sarcastic,Don't you have to die first before turning into an "angel"?
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pit,count-palutena:1=sarcastic,Are you afraid momma Palutena is gonna see your angel thingy?
-3-male_small_crotch_is_visible=angry,So... This is why you want to judge people by their personality... I don't like that about you, either.
-3-male_small_crotch_is_visible=sarcastic,Maybe if you water it, it'll grow?
-3-male_small_crotch_is_visible=sarcastic,I'm gonna go out of a limb and guess; you either have, or want a really <i>big car</i>.
-3-male_small_crotch_is_visible=interested,I think I've seen thicker paper clips...
-3-male_small_crotch_is_visible=sarcastic,I wonder what would happen if you go swimming in cold water?
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=embarrassed,That's big... isn't it? ... Seriously, I'm asking.
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=interested,Did you know that Leonardo da Vinci discovered that erections were caused by blood?
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=angry,... And you were thinking I was ugly. Your <i>thing</i> disagrees.
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=frustrated,I'm not validating your delusions.
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=sarcastic,Don't be so cocky, ~name~. Glasses magnify things.
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible=angry,Am I partially responsible for that?... What, I'm supposed to be honored?
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible=interested,You can't fool me, ~name~. You insecureness gives you away.
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible=calm,Did you get the reaction you were looking for?
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible=sarcastic,Sudden death between the two of us. So, I hope you put some strings on it and gives us a puppet show when you lose.
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible=sarcastic,Dinga- dork!
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible=calm,I'm totally fine with you stealing my thunder, ~name~.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible=sarcastic,Isn't it a little late to be worried about losing your dignity?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible=angry,Yeah, yeah, yeah... <i>You're embarrassed</i> we get it. <i>Poor you</i>.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible=frustrated,I had more sympathy for you if I weren't naked myself.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible=sarcastic,Get ready to enjoy some aesthetically pleasing feminine nudity, boys and girls.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sayori,count-monika:1=angry,I'd feel sorry for you, but you look happy to show your chest to Monika.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:elizabeth=interested,Let's see if losing that corset makes the blood flow better and reach your brain.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:palutena=sarcastic,You sure have fancy dress stores in heaven, huh?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:misato=calm,You could blame it on the booze?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=sarcastic,I can respect your strategy of driving them crazy, but what now? Is the gardener coming, or something?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sayori=calm,You remind me of Mr. O'Neill. He was my English teacher at Lawndale. He was always on the verge of an anxiety attack.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:natsuki=paper,Here's a little poem for you: "You think you're the best, but you'll disappoint everyone expecting to see a pair of breasts"
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jura=sarcastic,...Right, the "Alien" chest reveal.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible=embarrassed,A <i>small distraction</i> beats no distraction at all, I suppose.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible=sarcastic,You have nothing to hide... literally.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible=frustrated,Oh, so... <i>You're embarrassed</i> Poor you that had to show virtually nothing.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible=sarcastic,Hey! It turns out I can use the phrase "You got nothing" without associating it to your thoughts, or your poker skills!
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible=sarcastic,This is when the boys here, or at home look at both of our racks and compare them. They should do that in silence and not to say a word, but we both know they're incapable of thinking straight in front of female nudity.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:natsuki=sarcastic,Told you so. Still, you got nothing to be ashamed for. <i>Literally nothing</i>!
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:sayori,count-monika:1=sarcastic,You're some piece of work, huh?
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:sayori=sarcastic,He probably has bigger boobs, though. No offense.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:marinette=sarcastic,That's why you call yourself "ladybug"!
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:marinette=sarcastic,"Ladybug"... Everything makes sense now.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:marinette=sarcastic,I think I see two more "ladybugs" from here.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible=interested,Do you have an individual name for each?
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible=interested,I see you and all I can think of is: mammography.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible=angry,How many bare breasts do you want to see in one night, SPNatI?
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible=embarrassed,~name~,'s breasts are better shaped than mine. <i>Look at her</i>.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible=sarcastic,I'm sure this is someone's fantasy.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:monika,count-ddlc:1=frustrated,You must be so happy now... I'm not talking to, ~player~.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:monika,alsoPlaying:natsuki,alsoPlayingStage:7-8=sarcastic,Oh, we are finally seeing litter-ature club's puppies.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:monika,alsoPlaying:natsuki,alsoPlayingStage:7-8=sarcastic,And I thought we were never gonna see litter-ature club's members exposing their breasts.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:elizabeth=sarcastic,Everyone is looking at your breasts now. Have fun!
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:elizabeth=sarcastic,Everyone is looking at your breasts now. No pressure, though.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:elizabeth=sarcastic,Everyone is looking at your breasts now. Daddy Comstock must be so proud.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia=angry,I thought aliens were supposed to be asexual. Your breasts look very earthly to me.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=calm,Should I trust you'll remove the rest of your flowers when you lose again?
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:monika,count-ddlc:3=sarcastic,Looking at your flat-mates. There's no doubt why you're the club's president,huh?
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:monika,alsoPlaying:sayori,alsoPlayingStage:6-7=sarcastic,No wonder why Monika's the president of your club.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:monika,alsoPlaying:sayori,alsoPlayingStage:6-7=sarcastic,Monika establishing herself as alpha-tid... alpha female. No wonder why Sayori is so insecure about herself.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=calm,Well... to be fair, I'm sure someone considers you're too sexy for that shirt.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible=frustrated,Female breasts galore in a strip poker game on the internet. Truly the apex of our civilization!
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible=frustrated,A girl with huge knockers and people commenting how they are the best they've ever seen... Exactly what I needed to boost my confidence.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible=sarcastic,I have a new found admiration to your bra.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible=sarcastic,You may be embarrassed, but the one really suffering here is your spine.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible=sarcastic,The most you fear it, the bigger it gets. You must really fear boobs!
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:palutena,count-pit:1=calm,Looks like it's lunch time for you, angel-boy.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:misato=sarcastic,Okay, that's heavy artillery, Captain.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:palutena=calm,Too bad you forgot to visit the bra store, though.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:7-8=sarcastic,Okay... forget about gravity and thigh suits. Wear nothing and distract evil doers with <i>those things</i>. You might need to wear a suit, Marinette.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:uravity=sarcastic,Okay... forget about gravity and tight suits. Wear nothing and distract evil doers with <i>those things</i>.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:jura=sarcastic,I suppose they ran out of bras in your planet.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible=embarrassed,It looks like you're next... Welcome?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible=sarcastic,Fifteen minutes of shame, coming right up!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible=angry,Look! A new vagina to look at will be unveiled... <i>Pervs</i>
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible=sarcastic,Don't be embarrassed, ~name~! ... Save some embarrassment for when you drop'em.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible=angry,What are you exactly waiting for me? Sympathy? I'm sorry, were you sympathetic with me when I did the same you're doing?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura=frustrated,Hey, Giorgio Tsoukalos: If you're playing look no further than SPNatI for Alien life forms. <i>Jura's here</i>!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia=frustrated,Stop stalling. We've seen that, already!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=frustrated,The mystery is killing me... what could we possible see when you remove your see-through panties?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible=sarcastic,Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible=frustrated,Feels wonderful, doesn't it?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible=embarrassed,Finally, genitalia you can desire.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible=interested,I have one of those. They're overrated.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible=sarcastic,Gee... I wonder where you could have seen another of those?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura=sarcastic,...If you're looking for intelligent alien life form You're gonna have to keep looking, though. At least she keeps her totally out of this planet genitals clean.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:palutena=frustrated,I don't see anything "divine" about it.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette=sarcastic,French lips.

-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki=sarcastic,Okay. I now have empirical proof you're indeed a girl. You could've been a pink haired dude.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki=sarcastic,Okay. I now have empirical proof you're indeed a girl. I was expecting a small penis, to be honest.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:monika,count-sayori:1=calm,Sayori seems pretty happy to see your vagina. Make a poem with that.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia=frustrated,Oh, gee... <i>your flower</i>!

-1-female_small_chest_is_visible=calm,You... can sleep on your stomach without much trouble?
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible=sarcastic,I'm guessing your dates leave knowing your eye color.

-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:monika,alsoPlaying:natsuki,alsoPlayingStage:7-8=sarcastic,And I thought we were never gonna see litter-ature club's members exposing their breasts.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=calm,Well... to be fair, I'm sure someone considers you're too sexy for that shirt.

-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:monika,alsoPlaying:sayori,alsoPlayingStage:6-7=sarcastic,Monika establishing herself as alpha-tid... alpha female. No wonder why Sayori is so insecure about herself.

-1-female_large_chest_is_visible=interested,Are those <i>that</i> big, or are my glasses magnifying them?

-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:palutena=frustrated,I don't see anything "divine" about it.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki=sarcastic,Okay. I now have empirical proof you're indeed a girl. You could've been a pink haired dude.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki=sarcastic,Okay. I now have empirical proof you're indeed a girl. I was expecting a small penis, to be honest.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia=gloomy,Gee... even aliens have a cuter butt than me. That's reassuring!

-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura=sarcastic,...If you're looking for intelligent alien life form You're gonna have to keep looking, though. At least she keeps her totally out of this planet genitals clean.




#OPPONENT MASTURBATING
#When an opponent is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must pay the penalty by masturbating in front of everyone.
#The "must_masturbate" line is for just before it happens, and the "start_masturbating" line immediately follows.
#The "masturbating" line will be spoken a little after the opponent has started but before they climax.
#When the opponent climaxes, your character will say the "finished_masturbating" line.

#SELF MASTURBATING
#If your character is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must masturbate.
#These lines only come up in the relevant stages, so you don't need to include the stage numbers here. Just remember which stage is which when you make the images. The "starting" image is still in the naked stage.
#The "finished_masturbating" line will repeat many times if the game is not yet finished. This plays as opponents comment on the how good their hands are.
-3-must_masturbate_first=lost,Good. <i>I was feeling too dry</i>.
-3-must_masturbate_first=lost,All right, all right! that's check and mate.
-3-must_masturbate_first=lost,No, no, absolutely not! It's unethical, it's immoral, it may well be illegal. I'll have no part of it..... Okay, I'll do it.
-3-must_masturbate_first=lost,I won't be setting the bar very high. Don't tell me I didn't warn you.
-3-must_masturbate_first=lost,Anything particular you would like to see? <i>Ask the others</i>.
-3-must_masturbate_first=lost,I've heard people talking about this as a stress relief exercise. I might as well try it.

-3-must_masturbate=lost,Okay... I'll try and fake that I'm shocked: "What am I doing here? How am I going to get through this? Dear God, help me."
-3-must_masturbate=lost,I lost, unsurprisingly. I mean chances of losing were 75% and this is a luck based game. At least I can watch you squirm in displeasure.
-3-must_masturbate=lost,... Just because <i>you think</i> I'm ugly, doesn't mean I don't have urges. I've done this before, just not in front of jerks like you.
-3-must_masturbate=lost,Riiiight... The faster I do this the better, I think.
-3-must_masturbate=lost,What have I ever done to you to deserve this? ... Right.

-2-masturbating=calm,I'm trying to keep going all night, so I can ruin your plans for the night. Fun, huh?
-2-masturbating=sarcastic,You'd think I'd be excited by now.

-2-masturbating=angry,I'm trying, you aren't helping.
-2-masturbating=interested,You know what I've just realized? There're things I do with my hands, in which I'm worst than this; knitting, for example.
-2-masturbating=sarcastic,I can go on if you want...

-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0,count-meia:1=calm,... I mean, You're an attractive blonde, with big breasts, and claiming to be an alien. With no scruples whatsoever. They'll love you. I'm pretty sure Meia over there can find a better pilot, too.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0,count-palutena:1=sarcastic,You still look like a babysitter and a little boy playing dress up to me. But, Who am I to judge? Isn't that your job requirement, Your holiness?
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:sayori,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0,count-monika:1=calm,I don't think you have a chance, though. She seems only focused on, ~player~... Heaven knows why.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:sayori,alsoPlayingStage:4,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0,count-monika:1=calm,I kinda feel sorry for you, Sayori. <i>Kinda</i>.

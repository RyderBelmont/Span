        <title>Eichi's Tie</title>
        <subtitle>Left behind by its owner, too frustrated when the game was over.</subtitle>
        <text>Part of the Yumenosaki Academy's uniform for 3rd years. A bit small and unremarkable, be careful not to forget it when you leave the Inventory! It's easy to leave it behind when you're thinking of something else.</text>
        <unlock>Play a game where Eichi wins.</unlock>

        <title>Some Impractical Yet Kinda Funny Glasses </title>
        <subtitle>Boosts FUN stat... In Spooky High. They just look silly in The Inventory.</subtitle>
        <text>Remember when these used to be cool? Now they aren't. But they're so ridiculous that they're fun in their own twisted way. They kinda boost your FUN stat and make you feel a bit dangeresque, too?

Also when you wear them, maybe Polly will be inspired to do some extra fun thing with other players...</text>
        <unlock>Win a game against Polly.</unlock>

        <title>Polly in a Box</title>
        <subtitle>The original Ghost in the Machine.</subtitle>
        <text>Congratulations! With the help of the brilliant Dr. NeoGhost and his new invention, you and your ghostbustin' buddies have managed to capture Polly Geist! 

The artifact shakes from time to time. Sometimes it twerks. Remember to not stick anything in it that you're not willing to lose.</text>
        <unlock>Polly's out of control! As a male player, choose three other male-presenting characters and bust this poker ghost!

You'll know you've activated her boss mode if she says something in light blue color before the first hand is dealt.</unlock>

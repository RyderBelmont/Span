        <subtitle>The original Ghost in the Machine.</subtitle>
        <text>Congratulations! With the help of the brilliant Dr. NeoGhost and his new invention, you and your ghostbustin' buddies have managed to capture Polly Geist! 

The artifact shakes from time to time. Sometimes it twerks. Remember to not stick anything in it that you're not willing to lose.</text>
        <unlock>Polly's out of control! As a male player, choose three other male-presenting characters and bust this poker ghost!

You'll know you've activated her boss mode if she says something in light blue color before the first hand is dealt.</unlock>

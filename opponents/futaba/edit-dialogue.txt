#Items of clothing should be listed here in order of removal.
#The values are formal name, lower case name, how much they cover, what they cover
#Please do not put spaces around the commas.
#"Important" clothes cover genitals (lower) or chest/breasts (upper). For example: bras, panties, a skirt when going commando.
#"Major" clothes cover underwear. For example: skirts, pants, shirts, dresses.
#"Minor" clothes cover skin or are large pieces of clothing that do not cover skin. For example: jackets, socks, stockings, gloves.
#"Extra" clothes are small items that may or may not be clothing but do not cover anything interesting. For example: jewelry, shoes or boots with socks underneath, belts, hats. In the rest of the code, "extra" clothes are called "accessory".
#If for some reason you write another word for the type of clothes (e.g. "accessory"), other characters will not react at all when the clothing is removed.
#What they cover = upper (upper body), lower (lower body), other (neither).
#The game can support any number of entries, but typically we use 2-8, with at least one "important" layer for upper and lower (each).

#Notes on dialogue
#All lines that start with a # symbol are comments and will be ignored by the tool that converts this file into a xml file for the game.
#Where more than one line has an identical type, like "swap_cards" and "swap_cards", the game will randomly select one of these lines each time the character is in that situation.
#You should try to include multiple lines for most stages, especially the final (finished) stage, -1. 

#A character goes through multiple stages as they undress. The stage number starts at zero and indicates how many layers they have removed. Special stage numbers are used when they are nude (-3), masturbating (-2), and finished (-1).
#Line types that start with a number will only display during that stage. The will override any numberless stage-generic lines. For example, in stage 4 "4-swap_cards" will be used over "swap_cards" if it is not blank here. Giving a character unique dialogue for each stage is an effective way of showing their changing openness/shyness as the game progresses.
#You can combine the above points and make multiple lines for a particular situation in a particular stage, like "4-swap_cards" and "4-swap_cards".

#Some special words can be used that will be substituted by the game for context-appropriate ones: ~name~ is the name of the character they're speaking to, but this only works if someone else is in focus. ~clothing~ is the type of clothing that is being removed by another player. ~Clothing~ is almost the same, but it starts with a capital letter in case you want to start a sentence with it.
#~name~ can be used any time a line targets an opponent (game_over_defeat, _must_strip, _removing_, _removed, _must_masturbate, etc).
#~clothing~ can be used only when clothing is being removed (_removing and _removed, but NOT _must_strip).
#~player~ can be used at any time and refers to the human player.
#~cards~ can be used only in the swap_cards lines.
#All wildcards can be used once per line only! If you use ~name~ twice, the code will show up the second time.

#Lines can be written that are only spoken when specific other characters are present. For a detailed explanation, read this guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/spnati/comments/6nhaj0/the_easy_way_to_write_targeted_lines/
#Here is an example line (note that targeted lines must have a stage number):
#0-female_must_strip,target:hermioine=happy,Looks like your magic doesn't help with poker!




#EXCHANGING CARDS
#This is what a character says while they're exchanging cards.
#The game will automatically put a display a number between 0-5 where you write ~cards~.
#These lines display on the screen for only a brief time, so it is important to make them short enough to read at a glance.

#stage-specific lines that override the stage-generic ones

1-stripped,alsoPlaying:ann=stripped,Oracle r-r-ready f-f-for round two!
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:uravity=stripped,I'm actually into all kidns of stuff! This is just a... a confidence building exercise! For all sort of stuff!
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:uravity=stripped,Who's Mineta, Ochako?
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:chiaki=stripped,You're on, Chiaki!
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit=stripped,W-w-what other kind of game would we have?
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:ann,count-pit:1=shocked,W-w-what’s that supposed to mean, Pit? H-how would you know me better than Ann? Oh no, <i>is God real? Are you an angel?</i> <b>Ann, did we kill God?</b>
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,count-pit:1=stripped,I think they mostly watch her <i>on</i> her back, Pit! Which is where she should be. Because that’s the point of this game, right?
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:jin=stripped,I don't believe that you can see the future, Jin, but no matter what scam you're running, don't spoil the surprise. I thought really hard about it!

1-stripped,alsoPlaying:9s=stripped,It’s not nice to be insulting, 9S. If that <i>is</i> your real name. Wait a second, are you like some robot?
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:gwen=stripped,I could feed Reed Richards his ass with how loose his computer structuring is.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:gwen=stripped,Oh, I <i>know</i> I'm better at computers than Reed Richards. His electronic countermeasures are <i>weak</i>.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:gwen=dissappointed,Gwen, if we could avoid suicide jokes I'd be a lot happier.

1-stripping,alsoPlaying:9s=stripping,Urgh. Robot, android, whatever. And yeah, it’s because I’m smart, obviously.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:chiaki=stripping,I don't really have a Persona anymore, but there's a few people here in bodysuits, so I kind of wonder if there's a way to get it back...
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:uravity=stripping,Yeah, I do get to see all k-k-kinds of cool stuff on the internet. I'm not <i>quite</i> sure you'd approve of all of it, Ochako. Mweheheh.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:sei,marker:tasteless_normies=stripping,Oh, *Kira* Miki? I’m not super big into her music, but I guess I can see why it’s popular… If you’re a tasteless normie.

2-stripped=stripped,I like thigh highs. They keep my legs from getting cold or stiff.
2-stripped=stripped,Hrm... Maybe I should rethink my strategy.
2-stripped=stripped,If I had Necronomicon, this game’d be over already.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:9s=interested,How do <i>you</i> know about Personas, you gothic-lolita knockoff?
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:rinkah,alsoPlayingStage:0-4,marker:desert=stripped,Wind tribe? Um, I haven't played that Fire Emblem, b-b-but I'm a bit more familiar with the desert than I'd like...
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:uravity=stripped,Er... Not helping the villains, mostly just looking up dirty pictures.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:chiaki=stripped,To be honest, I'm just used to calling it Necronomicon. Prometheus is kind of... Anyway!
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:chiaki=stripped,I'm a completionist, so I <i>definitely</i> unlocked Prometheus. I think Necronomicon looked way cooler, though.
2-must_strip_winning=excited,I guess...
2-must_strip_winning=triumphant,Ugh why does this game have catchup mechanics. Just let me snowball and win.
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:saki=awkward,Y-yeah, Saki?
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:gwen=annoyed,Uh huh. That so, Gwen?
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:gwen=annoyed,I thought my HeroNet profile on you was a lot more about being clever and a lot less about being a jerk.
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:chiaki=dissappointed,I <i>wish</i> I could summon my Persona. I'd kick even <i>more</i> butt.
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:chiaki=annoyed,Urgh! I wish! Wouldn't that be so cool?
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:gogo,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=triumphant,Yessss! Please, GoGo, I bet you have great taste!
2-must_strip_normal=awkward,Oh fine. You’ve already seen the saucy bits of the tanktop anyway.
2-must_strip_normal=annoyed,Unrhf. Can I just take it off, or do I have to try and look sexy while doing it?

3-stripped=stripped,Okay. I’m actually starting to get a little worried.
3-stripped=stripped,I’ve gotten through worse. Like. Apocalypse worse. But this is still kinda chilly.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=stripped,Maybe I'd like to star in something Zone-tan produces. But my outfit is a bit too <i>cyberpunk</i> to just get so dirty right here. At least, um, if you have in mind what I do.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,count-pit:1=stripped,I’m a grown woman, Pit, and I-I-I will be confident and do as I please! Or as it pleases. Mwhehehe. (Pls halp.)
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit=stripped,How many pairs of <i>being a nice person does Pit have: zero! So there!</i>
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:saki,marker:saki_friendship=awkward,O-oh! That's all? I thought you were hitting on me! W-wait, why wouldn't you hit on me? U-uhm! Sure! Let's play!
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:saki,marker:saki_friendship=happy,--Oh! Okay. Yeah! Let's play together!
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:gwen=stripped,Murderdock? Whoa! That sounds like a really cool band name.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:gwen=stripped,Maybe I <i>should</i> go work with Murderdock. Just to show you!
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:9s=stripped,You can call it what you like but I’m kicking your butt in cuteness!
3-must_strip_winning=happy,Oh, sorry, I forgot that I still had to strip.
3-must_strip_winning=triumphant,Ha! Hope you’re not expecting me to get all weepy!
3-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:uravity,priority:999=awkward,U-um. Ochako. I can't think of a graceful way to do this so... Would you mind... Lifting me up?
3-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:gogo,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=triumphant,Yessss! Please, GoGo, I bet you have great taste!
3-must_strip_normal=awkward,I think the term for this is Absolute Territory. Not like... Evangelion though.
3-must_strip_normal=happy,Thigh highs are so comfortable. Once, I got one with little toes on them!
3-must_strip_normal=dissappointed,It’s practical, and keeps my legs warm.
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:uravity,priority:999=awkward,U-um. Ochako. I can't think of a graceful way to do this so... Would you mind... Lifting me up?

3-must_strip_losing=mad,O-oh. M-m-me? A-again?
3-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:gogo,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=triumphant,Yessss! Please, GoGo, I bet you have great taste!
3-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:uravity,priority:999=awkward,U-um. Ochako. I can't think of a graceful way to do this so... Would you mind... Lifting me up?
3-stripping=stripping,Is there a graceful way to do this?
3-stripping=stripping,Uhm. I think a guide I read said I’m supposed to bend over and look up while I’m taking these off but I think I’d fall over.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:9s=stripping,This 2B you talk about sounds like a hacker with great taste, 9S.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,totalMales:1-3=stripping,You know Zone-tan, w-w-while I don’t think we could have sex, you could maybe use my tights to t-t-tie me up for one of our Y-chromosomed friends! T-they might like that!

3-stripping,alsoPlaying:sei=stripping,Err, they’re just comfy. And cool looking.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit=stripping,Prepare to be amazed, Pit, as I take these off with grace!
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:sei,count-pit:1=stripping,Inkling? <i>Wait, did you think I was from a video game?</i> That’s weird. I’ve… Um. Never thought about being covered in colored goo. That would be <i>gross</i>. Unless you happen to…

#losing tanktop
4-stripped=stripped,W-well, I like to out into the field on my computer rather than get a lot of direct sunlight, so I’m a little pale.
4-stripped=stripped,Actually, yes, I am cold without those. And n-no, I’m not wearing a bra.
4-stripped=stripped,This is definitely one of those games Ryuji and Inari are always playing, where clothing falls off as HP goes down.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:uravity,priority:999=launched,I'm a little... Woozy... Whoa, again, again!
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:uravity,priority:999=launched,Woo! O-okay, I'll get the rest of my thigh highs off when I've regained my footing. And adjust my headphones.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,totalMales:1-2=stripped,Sex with you? Suuure. (Psst! ZT I'm flattered but this is just part of the game. Right? Right...?)
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,totalMales:3=stripped,W-w-well, I mean, what girl hasn't thought about being made airtight but--Now? With three men I just met?
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:9s=happy,Ohh. A “partner?” Mwehehe.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:sei=stripped,We can’t all have fancy clothes. B-b-but I really do like my stuff!
4-must_strip_winning=triumphant,I’m sure everyone’s really getting to know each other, and honestly, I’m feeling pretty comfortable now that others have gone first.
4-must_strip_winning=excited,Well. This might be a nice surprise for the rest of you.
4-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:sei=mad,I-I-if you say I should be a camgirl, Sei--
4-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:gogo,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=triumphant,Yessss! Please, GoGo, I bet you have great taste!
4-must_strip_normal=happy,Normally, I only do this kind of thing on webcam.
4-must_strip_normal=awkward,It’s this or GTFO, right?
4-must_strip_normal=mad,Blargh. I don’t know what everyone’s so excited about.
4-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:gogo,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=triumphant,Yessss! Please, GoGo, I bet you have great taste!

4-must_strip_losing=annoyed,Fine, hold on.
4-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:gogo,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=triumphant,Yessss! Please, GoGo, I bet you have great taste!

4-stripping=stripping,Just let me adjust my headphones.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:gwen=stripping,Lizard squad? They're just a bunch of noobs and morons.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:gwen=stripping,Lizard squad? Oh... No I'm not affiliated with them. That's the whole Lizard thing you hate, right?
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:uravity=stripping,Here's the last surprise, Ochako!
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:9s=triumphant,Well, this should answer <i>that</i> question, YorHa Scanner-type Model No.9. Ergh, the first question. I usually do…
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:sei=stripping,Oh. Where is Glitch City, again? Uh, hold on, let’s t-t-talk after I’m done, um, w-w-with this.


#lost all clothing
5-stripped=stripped,What? Bras are uncomfortable.
5-stripped=stripped,Well, this is me. What little there is.
5-stripped=stripped,I’m not going to play a game I can’t see, where I have to listen to people drone on, so the headphones and glasses stay.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:9s=stripped,But the point of the game is to seem <i>s-s-sexy</i>. So I figured it’d be an interesting surprise! ...But not the last surprise.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:ann=stripped,Well, Ann, this sure brings us back to the beach… And Joker’s house, huh?
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:ann=stripped,They're fun size, Ann! And given how much you like snacks, I bet you can imagine why they'd be fun for lots of people!
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:chiaki=stripped,N-n-nope! I w-w-wanted to be sexy, and figured this was a nice surprise.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:chiaki=stripped,S-s-sure am! R-r-really confident!
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:chiaki=stripped,That's not all, Chiaki! Wait until my next loss!
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:jin=stripped,St-st-stupid future powers. Don't ruin the surprise, Jin!
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:jin=stripped,H-hey! Don't give everyone spoilers!
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:sei=stripped,There! Sorry, I missed that, but I’m happier working for myself. And um, I don’t think many people were. N-n-not that I have much to work with...
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:rinkah=triumphant,Mwehehehe. I <i>do</i>, Rinkah!
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:mahiru=stripped,Because I liked those shirts, and it's not like I usually need a bra! Plus, isn't this, er, a lot more surprising and seductive and stuff?
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit=stripped,Inkling? I’m not… I’ve never been filled with ink! That’s so d-d-depraved! (And kinda hot…))
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:akko,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=stripped,Uhm. No, Akko, not all of us have fancy magic to show ourselves off, so we have to use a few surprises of our own!
5-must_strip_winning=dissappointed,Shoot, this is gonna be close.
5-must_strip_winning=happy,Well, everyone else is almost done for, so at least I can enjoy the view while you enjoy my view!
5-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:ann,notSaidMarker:harufetish,marker:harucomment=awkward,T-t-this could be worse, Haru could be here too.
5-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:ann,notSaidMarker:makotofetish,marker:makotocomment=awkward,T-t-this could be worse, Makoto could be here too.
5-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:gogo,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=triumphant,Yessss! Please, GoGo, I bet you have great taste!
5-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:ann,notSaidMarker:hifumifetish,marker:hifumicomment=awkward,T-t-this could be worse, Hifumi could be here too.
5-must_strip_normal=excited,I suppose some would consider this a good social experience.
5-must_strip_normal=shocked,Laaame. Fine, I’ll strip.
5-must_strip_normal=triumphant,It sure would be a shame if I forgot to wear underwear today...
5-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:gogo,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=triumphant,Yessss! Please, GoGo, I bet you have great taste!
5-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:ann,notSaidMarker:harufetish,marker:harucomment=awkward,T-t-this could be worse, Haru could be here too.

5-stripping=stripping,Just let me undo my belt and...
5-stripping=stripping,I guess I’ll just slide these down...
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:ann,saidMarker:makotocomment=stripping,Makoto would be so preachy.
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:ann,saidMarker:hifumicomment=stripping,Hifumi would be lecturing us on tactics, as if shoji were like poker.
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:ann,saidMarker:harucomment=stripping,Haru would be so embarrassed.
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:9s,alsoPlayingStage:2-8=stripping,I told you, Oathkeeper.
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:9s=stripping,I told you, 9S.
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:gwen=stripping,Only the most fiery of heat, Gwen!
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:gwen=stripping,The hottest of burning bushes, obviously!
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:sei,priority:99=stripping,That’s right, Sei! I’m gonna just button mash the same strategy as before!

-3-stripped=stripped,Shoot. It all fell down. And I coincidentally forgot to wear underwear. (Is the seduction working?)
-3-stripped=stripped,Oh...  no...  Everyone’s seen my p-p-I’m not going to say that word, it’s too much! But yeah, I didn’t bring panties to this.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:9s=stripped,The last surprise is always the best!
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:akko,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=stripped,Y-yep. I totally <i>forgot</i> underwear. You f-f-figured me out, Akko.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=mad,I can't believe you wore <i>that costume</i> to a game of strip poker, Ladybug!
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:ann=triumphant,I have no idea how the rest of the Phantom Thieves lucked out by not having so much volume down there. But I’m happy with how I look!
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:ann=stripped,Mature women look like this. And I'll have you know I'm the most mature of the Phantom Thieves. Hehe.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:5-10=excited,I can’t believe you wore a magic costume to a game of strip poker, and you did wear underwear! Priorities!
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:2-4=stripped,I can’t believe you wore a magic costume and-- I’m assuming you <i>did</i> wear underwear? You’re so <i>weird</i> Marinette!
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:sei,priority:99=stripped,I take care of my legs and armpits. This is what a mature woman looks like. W-w-why is everyone so surprised by this?
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:mahiru=stripped,W-w-well, I thought it would be sexy, Mahiru.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:chiaki=stripped,O-oh, I'm n-n-not always busy, t-this is just what a mature woman looks like, right?
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:chiaki=stripped,E-er, well, I suppose it'd be best to show everyone yours, too? (Psst, Chiaki, I mean in like, a way to get attention for you, not to hit on you!)

#OPPONENT REMOVING ACCESSORY
#These lines are spoken when an opponent removes a small item that does not cover any skin.
#Typically, characters are fine with this when they are fully dressed but less satisfied as they become more naked.
#Note that all "removing" lines are NOT spoken to human players. Characters will skip straight from "6-male_human_must_strip" to "6-male_removed_accessory", for example.

0-female_removed_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:1=interested,IF THESE ARE REAL PLEASE TELL ME HOW TO GET INVOLVED.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=interested,You said you were a pony? That explains the eyes... And purple.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2=awkward,D-d-don't cry, Saki! It's just a game! (Is this a ploy to seem really innocent, or is she just...?)
0-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:5=excited,I would love to study you! In the sexy way or the science way. The scienexy way!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:4=happy,Well, you seem to be <i>far</i> shyer about this than even my good friend <i>Haru!</i> And she can be kind of prude. Like, she's into <i>femdom</i> at her kinkiest.

0-female_removed_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:3,saidMarker:personapunann=interested,Get it. Becuase your Persona was Carmen… And it’s a red color? And you’re wearing… Red stockings.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:2=excited,I see you’re not just smart, Annie! I’m still gonna make you g-g-go down though! S-see? I can be sexy!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:haru=happy,Wow, Haru, Ochako's more uncomfortable taking her suit off than <i>you</i> are. She's probably even more vanilla, too!

1-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=shocked,Aww… I thought we were going to have a “headgear stays on heads and doesn’t come off even in strip poker” kind of aesthetic going.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:0=interested,Okay, those are pretty cool...
1-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=interested,Are you a Persona user, Nines?
1-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=triumphant,As they say on the internet: "Incest is the best, put your sibling to the test!"
1-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=interested,I think I've seen this plot twist before...
1-male_removing_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=happy,One made from a lot of anime designs?
1-male_removed_accessory=awkward,I was trying to be demure, but I think I just sounded... silly.
1-male_removed_accessory=shocked,Ugh. ~name~ is lame.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=happy,So what are Neighbors? Are those like Shadows? What kind of Personas does your team use?
1-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=excited,I-is this doing it or anyone else?
1-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=triumphant,Oh… <i>combat visor</i>. Like <i>thights</i>. We understand each other, yes we do, Oathkeeper! I’d rather have you on my team than some of the <i>dumber</i> Phantom Thieves for sure.

1-female_removing_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:4,saidMarker:annlingerie=interested,Um, I guess this is a lot different. Though I appreciate you helping me pick out sexy underwear in the past!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=excited,I feel like you two would get along.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:2=awkward,Do you know Inari? Er… Yusuku Kitagawa.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=awkward,Oh. Huh. I figured your gravity stuff was from a Persona or something...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=dissappointed,Oh. Well, I guess it could be like a costume from a superhero show or a sentai episode or something...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=triumphant,Comet storm?! Can you show us!?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=triumphant,A comet storm?! That's sounds super cool! I wish I could see your power meter charging...

1-female_removing_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:0=happy,I like you even more than Hatsune Miku! Mostly because of the porn. But you know, the music too!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:2b,alsoPlaying:marinette=shocked,It <i>does</i> look like Tron! B-but I don't have my computer or Persona here. So I can't do anything. Well, besides watch.

1-female_removing_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:2=interested,I would’ve figured you’d have gotten something with heels.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:2=awkward,You know, I kind of liked being in my Phantom Thief costume, but you always seemed so eager to get out of yours.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:2,marker:personapunann=happy,You’re looking awfully red, Ann! Something, Carmen-dine?

1-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:3=dissappointed,I'm not <i>really</i> into girls but you're really drawing this out, Ochako...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:weiss,targetStage:0=mad,Hmm... I don’t know what dust is, but it sounds like drugs. Haru is much more legitimate! Don’t you corrupt her!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:0=mad,I don’t really like lawyers, after all they’ve put me and my friends through.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=triumphant,Though maybe if you ripped off that mask, there would be something interesting underneath?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=triumphant,Mwehehe. This'll teach you to call me a knockoff!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:0=mad,You don’t really use your head a lot, just... brawn?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2=excited,Magatama? I feel like I’ve heard that term before…
1-female_removing_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:0=annoyed,It’s like playing with a female Ryuji with huge boobs.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:1=shocked,Er…
1-female_removing_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:0=annoyed,Or if we’d get along really well. Rururhuehghgh.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:2=awkward,I dunno... she is kind of hacking... but I can only see it in short glimpses...

1-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:0=awkward,I never thought about making a living doing it... I’m not much one for the spotlight.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:0=shocked,Wait. Are you just me? No, of course not... Hrmmm... Would the Metaverse have made a copy... Or am <i>I</i> a copy?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=annoyed,Quick, someone use  <i>bless</i> spells before she brainwashes everyone!
1-female_removing_accessory,alsoPlaying:ann,marker:annplaying=interested,I mean, I've seen Makoto and Haru undress. And Ann too! But I'm n-n-not really into models. Or girls.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=triumphant,Now you're subject to debuffs! My specialty!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=triumphant,Buffing Chiaki's wetness!
1-female_removing_accessory,notSaidMarker:annplaying=interested,I mean, I’ve seen Ann, Makoto, and Haru undress. And I know them well! So, in the spirit of making new friends, you should <i>at least</i> take off your pants.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=interested,Hey, Saki, is that tie of yours part of a school uniform?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=interested,Your tie, huh?

1-female_removing_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:5=interested,What’s so weird about that? Lots of people love catgirls.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:1=excited,Clever, flashing your panties like that.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=awkward,Joker’s old homeroom teacher used to do that too.

1-female_removed_accessory=dissappointed,Are you suuuuuuuure that counts?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:2=calm,Maybe not. But you’d definitely look better with longer stockings! Short socks are no fun.

2-male_removed_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:2=shocked,I. WANT. THAT. SWORD! <i>IT'S SO COOL!</i>
2-female_removing_accessory=excited,Oh! Good, ~name~! Something frivolous.
2-female_removing_accessory=interested,~name~, is your plan to pretend to be embarrassed?
2-female_removing_accessory=mad,~name~, did you “forget” that you had that until now?
2-female_removing_accessory=annoyed,~name~! Something like that belongs at home, not at the Inventory!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:0=interested,Annie! What do you study?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=awkward,Joker’s old homeroom teacher used to do that too.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:weiss,targetStage:0=mad,Hmm... I don’t know what dust is, but it sounds like drugs. Haru is much more legitimate! Don’t you corrupt her!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:2=interested,I would’ve figured you’d have gotten something with heels.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:2=awkward,You know, I kind of liked being in my Phantom Thief costume, but you always seemed so eager to get out of yours.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:2,marker:personapunann=happy,You’re looking awfully red, Ann! Something, Carmen-dine?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=shocked,THIS. IS. FASCINATING.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:0=mad,I don’t really like lawyers, after all they’ve put me and my friends through.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=triumphant,Mwehehe. This'll teach you to call me a knockoff!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=triumphant,Though maybe if you ripped off that mask, there would be something interesting underneath?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=annoyed,Quick, someone use  <i>bless</i> spells before she brainwashes everyone!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:1=excited,Clever, flashing your panties like that.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:2=awkward,I dunno... she is kind of hacking... but I can only see it in short glimpses...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:2=shocked,Your headphones? What!?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=interested,Oh, an upskirt shot. <i>Clever</i>, Chiaki.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=interested,Huh. Going for the upskirt, Chiaki?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:3=awkward,An old friend of mine... But he was a cat...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:0=shocked,!!!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:0=annoyed,Or if we’d get along really well. Rururhuehghgh.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:0=shocked,Wait. Are you just me? No, of course not... Hrmmm... Would the Metaverse have made a copy... Or am <i>I</i> a copy?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:0=annoyed,It’s like playing with a female Ryuji with huge boobs.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:1=shocked,Er…
2-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:1=excited,Just b-b-because you have big boobs d-d-doesn’t mean--
2-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2=excited,Magatama? I feel like I’ve heard that term before…
2-female_removing_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:5=shocked,Whoa! You’re like a giant Mona!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:5=interested,What’s so weird about that? Lots of people love catgirls.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=triumphant,Now you're subject to debuffs! My specialty!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=triumphant,Buffing Chiaki's wetness!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,marker:evangelion=triumphant,You’ve always been my favorite Eva pilot!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:0=mad,You don’t really use your head a lot, just... brawn?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:3=dissappointed,I'm not <i>really</i> into girls but you're really drawing this out, Ochako...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:0=awkward,I never thought about making a living doing it... I’m not much one for the spotlight.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:2=awkward,Do you know Inari? Er… Yusuku Kitagawa.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=triumphant,Comet storm?! Can you show us!?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=triumphant,A comet storm?! That's sounds super cool! I wish I could see your power meter charging...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:ruby,targetStage:0=happy,Well, at least you’re fun to play with, Ruby!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=triumphant,Nice! Saki! That's <i>very</i> clever and sexy, showing off your panties like that!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=interested,Hm! I've done something different with the panties <i>I'm totally</i> wearing, but showing off those panties is a great move!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_mariba,saidMarker:saki_befriend_mariba=triumphant,Akuma--what-- <i>Oh</i>! Like have her desires distored! Nope, that seems bad. Let's cheer her on! Like this! <i>Saki, it's great everyone can see your underwear: very confident!</i>
2-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=awkward,Oh. Huh. I figured your gravity stuff was from a Persona or something...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=dissappointed,Oh. Well, I guess it could be like a costume from a superhero show or a sentai episode or something...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=excited,I feel like you two would get along.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity,priority:501=triumphant,Yeah, we should, Ochako! Like compliment her on her panties to get her over her anxiety!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:1=happy,Don’t worry, smart people like us usually are!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:4,saidMarker:annlingerie=interested,Um, I guess this is a lot different. Though I appreciate you helping me pick out sexy underwear in the past!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=shocked,W-w-wait, hey! You don’t have a Goho-M!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=interested,Hey, Saki, is that tie of yours part of a school uniform?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=interested,Your tie, huh?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:2b,alsoPlaying:marinette=shocked,It <i>does</i> look like Tron! B-but I don't have my computer or Persona here. So I can't do anything. Well, besides watch.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:0=happy,I like you even more than Hatsune Miku! Mostly because of the porn. But you know, the music too!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:0=shocked,Wait a second... Revy... of the Black Lagoon. Ohmygod. You. Know. Greenback. Jane.
2-female_removed_accessory=triumphant,I could bounce a coin off the exposed skin you have. It’d hurt, but that’s what you get for not removing more.
2-female_removed_accessory=shocked,~name~... Urghlugh. Why are you being lame?
2-female_removed_accessory=awkward,I mean, I’m making my way towards actually getting naked, ~name~. Are you just teasing?
2-female_removed_accessory=happy,Alright! ~name~ should be out of shields now!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=triumphant,<i>I</i> sure hope it's not on TV. I want this to be something exclusive!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:1=awkward,I wonder what’s under your mask?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=triumphant,I swear, if you introduce me, I’ll throw this game in a heartbeat. Maybe.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:3=triumphant,I've got it! My Persona was Necronomicon, so Monika's codename should be Nyarlathotep!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:3=happy,Hmm. Do you like the stockings with the toes, Ann? I’m a big fan!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:3=awkward,I-I have to admit, Ann, I’ve always envied you. You’ve always been so m-m-much more outgoing.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=interested,You said you were a pony? That explains the eyes... And purple.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:3,saidMarker:personapunann=interested,Get it. Becuase your Persona was Carmen… And it’s a red color? And you’re wearing… Red stockings.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:1=shocked,Damn it! And I don’t have Necronomicon to assist.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=interested,Based on what I’ve heard though, you certainly are…
2-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=awkward,Hmm... Maybe I should pet the kitty?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=shocked,Aww! You’re a kitty-cat! Just like Mona!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=happy,Hmm... If you’re interested, I know someone who might be perfect for you, Videl!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=shocked,Aww... she seems resistant to curse! This is... weird...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:4=happy,Well, you seem to be <i>far</i> shyer about this than even my good friend <i>Haru!</i> And she can be kind of prude. Like, she's into <i>femdom</i> at her kinkiest.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:5=happy,Well, your stockings looked classy, Ann!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:5=awkward,We all know you’re stacked, so at least what’s next isn’t a surprise!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:1=interested,Hm. Maybe I should try on a maid outfit at some point? Hmmmm…
2-female_removed_accessory,target:meia=awkward,Er. Wait, doesn’t Rei have red eyes? Um. Sorry for the confusion.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:2=calm,Maybe not. But you’d definitely look better with longer stockings! Short socks are no fun.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:2=calm,Have  to pay attention to you!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:1=triumphant,You know, <i>this</i> is a game, and you <i>are</i> a robot AI challenging me, Alpha!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:5=excited,I would love to study you! In the sexy way or the science way. The scienexy way!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:3=annoyed,If the headphones mattered to you, you’d leave them on no matter what, D.va!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=interested,Don't worry, Chiaki! You're still well above half... (Unless she's also not wearing...)
2-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1=calm,You’re both kind and determined...But I think she’s a bit braver…
2-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2=interested,I think that’s another Megami Tensei game though...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:1=triumphant,Something hard? I hope?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=annoyed,Hmm...What’s up with you, Marinette? I wonder...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_mariba,saidMarker:saki_befriend_mariba=interested,Oh... yeah, okay, that does seem to be more Saki's... speed, huh, Marinette. And what huh? Okay sure, what are w-w-we all doing?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:1=triumphant,Has anyone ever told you you’re top-heavy? Which is surprising because your brain doesn’t seem impressive.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:2=interested,Sorry if I get a little mean, I know you’re really following the rules closely. Let’s definitely hang out after this.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:marinette=triumphant,Unlike, psssst... (The art students.)
2-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2=awkward,D-d-don't cry, Saki! It's just a game! (Is this a ploy to seem really innocent, or is she just...?)
2-female_removed_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:5,saidMarker:annlingerie=annoyed,Er. Not that I wore them tonight.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2=dissappointed,Aww... Fiiine, I guess.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2=dissappointed,Well you're wrecking up my interest, Ochako.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=happy,Oh, our thigh highs match!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=happy,Aw. At least we have similar styles...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=triumphant,One down, Saki! Show us your boobs! (There! This will surely help her build confidence.)
2-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=triumphant,Come here, Saki! ~player~ can't stare at both of us if you're so far away! (There, now we can be awkward together!)
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:1=interested,IF THESE ARE REAL PLEASE TELL ME HOW TO GET INVOLVED.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:haru=happy,Wow, Haru, Ochako's more uncomfortable taking her suit off than <i>you</i> are. She's probably even more vanilla, too!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jane=triumphant,Unlike, psssst... (The art students.)
2-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:1=dissappointed,Why are people so complicated?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3=dissappointed,You artsy types tend to know each other, is all.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=mad,Haru would never flee like that!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:2=excited,I see you’re not just smart, Annie! I’m still gonna make you g-g-go down though! S-see? I can be sexy!


#lost shirt
3-male_removing_accessory=interested,Hey ~name~, aren’t you supposed to speed it up when a girl takes off her shirt?
3-male_removing_accessory=annoyed,~Clothing~! Really? I took off my shirt! Admittedly there’s not much under it but...
3-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=triumphant,As they say on the internet: "Incest is the best, put your sibling to the test!"
3-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=interested,I think I've seen this plot twist before...
3-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=shocked,Aww… I thought we were going to have a “headgear stays on heads and doesn’t come off even in strip poker” kind of aesthetic going.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:0=interested,Okay, those are pretty cool...
3-male_removing_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=happy,One made from a lot of anime designs?
3-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=interested,Are you a Persona user, Nines?
3-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=annoyed,Okay, something small... But it <i>is</i> a weapon... I'm usually more of a support-type player...
3-male_removed_accessory=dissappointed,Ugh, ~name~, stop playing the delaying game.
3-male_removed_accessory=shocked,As a former Phantom Thief, you’ll need a lot more daring to have a chance with. Er. Against. Withagainst me!
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:ditzy,priority:0=shocked,Careful, ~name~! You could really lose a lot if you aren't!
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:ditzy,priority:0=shocked,W-whoa, ~name~, are you that confident or are you just not paying attention?
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:quiet,priority:0=interested,You're awfully quiet, ~name~.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=triumphant,Oh… <i>combat visor</i>. Like <i>thights</i>. We understand each other, yes we do, Oathkeeper! I’d rather have you on my team than some of the <i>dumber</i> Phantom Thieves for sure.
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:perverted,priority:0=triumphant,Awww yissss. ~name~'s definitely into dirty sexy stuff too! E-er, right?
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:perverted,priority:0=awkward,~name~'s kind of overt in her attentions, but... I don't know, I think that's l-l-like any good strip poker manga, right?
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:exhibitionist,priority:0=shocked,I'm into b-b-being sexy and all, but ~name~ is really quite an exhibitionist, huh?
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:exhibitionist,priority:0=awkward,W-w-wow, ~name~'s really outclassing me at this. I-I just want to be... um, attractive and stuff. But ~name~'s... m-m-making me wonder if this was a good idea.
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:nerdy,priority:0=awkward,~name~, we'd definitely be compatible if you wanted to do stuff after this! Um. Friend stuff though. I-I-I mean, ha-ha! I am definitely into girls too! So sexy. Yes.
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:nerdy,priority:0=triumphant,I'll have you know I <i>really</i> thought about bringing something geeky like your ~clothing~, ~name~!
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:mean,priority:0=mad,I hope <i>you</i> get a change of heart, ~name~, because you've been quite a jerk so far!
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:mean,priority:0=annoyed,Well, ~name~, let's see if you can be a <i>little</i> nicer now. All of us are here to have fun.
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:sarcastic,priority:0=annoyed,Oh <i>yeah</i>, ~name~. Sarcasm is truly the height of wit.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=excited,I-is this doing it or anyone else?
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:lonely,priority:0=dissappointed,Aww, ~name~, do you just... Did you come here to just make friends? I was here for the XP, but... I can relate a little.
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:lonely,priority:0=interested,~name~, maybe if you took off more than your ~clothing~, it'd be easier for you to make friends... I-I mean, in the short term, at least.
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:innocent,priority:0=shocked,~name~, um. A-are you okay with all this? You seem kind of... sheltered.
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:gloomy,priority:0=dissappointed,Aww... don't be sad, ~name~. W-w-we're all here to have fun, after all. R-r-right?
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:fancy,priority:0=interested,Oooooooo. ~name~'s ~clothing~ is actually pretty high end! I wonder if Haru would know more aobut that...
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:fancy,priority:0=awkward,Why'd you have to dress up all fancy, ~name~!? I feel really out of place!
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:moe,priority:0=awkward,Aww, you're so cute, ~name~. I wish I could pull off that innocent and wide-eyed look...
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:moe,priority:0=awkward,You know, ~name~, I bet we'd get along well! Plus, you'd get to be the cute one, which is... um. Something!
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:silent,priority:0=triumphant,~name~'s actions speak louder than words! And those words are saying he wants to get naked and enjoy himself tonight!
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:seductive,priority:0=shocked,W-whoa, ~name~, you could teach me a thing or two about seduction, that's for sure!
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:confident,priority:0=annoyed,Hnrnrnhrurn. You're awfully confident for someone who's taking off small pieces, ~name~.
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:confident,priority:0=awkward,Oh, <i>~name~'s</i> confident? Well, I'm <i>confident</i> enough to... Hhrmrmrmernmerm. You'll see!
3-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=triumphant,Looks like we have an incest kink here tonight. You're <i>dirty</i> ~player~.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:2=shocked,I. WANT. THAT. SWORD! <i>IT'S SO COOL!</i>
3-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1=excited,I can call you Nines, because you asked, right? Urnrhrugh. You have to have a better codename…
3-male_removed_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=happy,So what are Neighbors? Are those like Shadows? What kind of Personas does your team use?
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:aggressive,priority:0=annoyed,No need to be so aggressive, ~name~, it's just a game.
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:aggressive,priority:0=awkward,~name~, you're awfully aggressive, huh?
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:yandere,priority:0=shocked,Whoa, be careful, ~player~, ~name~ has his sights on you!
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:yandere,priority:0=shocked,I-is it just me, or is there something really scary about ~name~?
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:yandere,priority:0=shocked,~name~ could use a change of heart! And fast!
3-male_removed_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:1=triumphant,Take me to your creator!
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:tsundere,priority:0=happy,I think ~name~'s only acting like this because she has a crush on someone here. So tsundere.
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:tsundere,priority:0=happy,~name~, y-y-you know, you're like a cactus. You want people to hug you but you pretend to be so prickly!
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:submissive,priority:0=awkward,~name~... I don't know how to say this, but you're kind of into being dominated, huh?
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:submissive,priority:0=awkward,I can't say I can't relate to ~name~'s need to be... well... what girl doesn't like to be manhandled a bit? Maybe Haru. She prefers to the handling...
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:shut_in,priority:0=dissappointed,I know how it feels to not get out much, ~name~. But we're here at this big game together, so let's try and be cheery, huh?
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:shut_in,priority:0=calm,Don't worry, ~name~! I know what it's like to be stuck at home too. But I got a lot better and so can you. K-keep going with that small stuff, alright?
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:cheerful,priority:0=mad,I'm glad ~name~ is so cheery, considering how little she's stripping right now.
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:cheerful,priority:0=shocked,I'm glad you're nice and happy, ~name~, but couldn't you take off something a <i>little</i> bigger?
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:fashionable,priority:0=interested,Er... ~name~, could you take me shopping after this? I bet you'd know exactly what I wanted!
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:fashionable,priority:0=interested,~name~! We should go on a post-game quest to get me some clothing that matches my style as well as your clothing matches yours!
3-female_removing_accessory=excited,Ooo! ~name~ is taking off something punk-y!
3-female_removing_accessory=happy,Ah, ~name~ has a great...  preppy…~Clothing~ she’s going to part with.
3-female_removing_accessory=interested,~name~ has a really hipster ~clothing~ she’s opting to part with.
3-female_removing_accessory=awkward,Ugh, ~name~, another...  meme-worthy...  accessory?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=shocked,THIS. IS. FASCINATING.

3-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=awkward,Oh. Huh. I figured your gravity stuff was from a Persona or something...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=dissappointed,Oh. Well, I guess it could be like a costume from a superhero show or a sentai episode or something...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2=excited,Magatama? I feel like I’ve heard that term before…
3-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:0=mad,I don’t really like lawyers, after all they’ve put me and my friends through.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=awkward,Joker’s old homeroom teacher used to do that too.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:0=shocked,Wait. Are you just me? No, of course not... Hrmmm... Would the Metaverse have made a copy... Or am <i>I</i> a copy?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=annoyed,Quick, someone use  <i>bless</i> spells before she brainwashes everyone!

3-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=triumphant,Nice! Saki! That's <i>very</i> clever and sexy, showing off your panties like that!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=interested,Hm! I've done something different with the panties <i>I'm totally</i> wearing, but showing off those panties is a great move!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:1=happy,Don’t worry, smart people like us usually are!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:3=awkward,An old friend of mine... But he was a cat...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:2=awkward,Do you know Inari? Er… Yusuku Kitagawa.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:2b,alsoPlaying:marinette=shocked,It <i>does</i> look like Tron! B-but I don't have my computer or Persona here. So I can't do anything. Well, besides watch.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=interested,Oh, an upskirt shot. <i>Clever</i>, Chiaki.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=interested,Huh. Going for the upskirt, Chiaki?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:0=happy,I like you even more than Hatsune Miku! Mostly because of the porn. But you know, the music too!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:0=awkward,I never thought about making a living doing it... I’m not much one for the spotlight.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,marker:evangelion=triumphant,You’ve always been my favorite Eva pilot!

3-female_removing_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:4,saidMarker:annlingerie=interested,Um, I guess this is a lot different. Though I appreciate you helping me pick out sexy underwear in the past!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:5=shocked,Whoa! You’re like a giant Mona!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:5=interested,What’s so weird about that? Lots of people love catgirls.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:0=annoyed,Or if we’d get along really well. Rururhuehghgh.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=excited,I feel like you two would get along.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:0=annoyed,It’s like playing with a female Ryuji with huge boobs.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=triumphant,Now you're subject to debuffs! My specialty!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=triumphant,Buffing Chiaki's wetness!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:1=excited,Clever, flashing your panties like that.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:1=shocked,Er…
3-female_removing_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:0=interested,Annie! What do you study?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:2=interested,I would’ve figured you’d have gotten something with heels.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:2=awkward,You know, I kind of liked being in my Phantom Thief costume, but you always seemed so eager to get out of yours.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:2,marker:personapunann=happy,You’re looking awfully red, Ann! Something, Carmen-dine?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=shocked,W-w-wait, hey! You don’t have a Goho-M!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:weiss,targetStage:0=mad,Hmm... I don’t know what dust is, but it sounds like drugs. Haru is much more legitimate! Don’t you corrupt her!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=triumphant,Though maybe if you ripped off that mask, there would be something interesting underneath?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=triumphant,Mwehehe. This'll teach you to call me a knockoff!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_mariba,saidMarker:saki_befriend_mariba=triumphant,Akuma--what-- <i>Oh</i>!

3-female_removed_accessory=mad,T-that’s what you call that style right?
3-female_removed_accessory=annoyed,You know, you should update your style. To something more minimalist.
3-female_removed_accessory=awkward,Uhm. If you’re playing hard to get, though, I don’t think this is what the guides mean...
3-female_removed_accessory=triumphant,You probably look better in casual wear, ~name~.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:1=interested,IF THESE ARE REAL PLEASE TELL ME HOW TO GET INVOLVED.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:haru=happy,Wow, Haru, Ochako's more uncomfortable taking her suit off than <i>you</i> are. She's probably even more vanilla, too!
3-female_removed_accessory,filter:gloomy,priority:0=dissappointed,Aww... don't be sad, ~name~. W-w-we're all here to have fun, after all. R-r-right?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:marinette=triumphant,Unlike, psssst... (The art students.)
3-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:1=dissappointed,Why are people so complicated?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=annoyed,Hmm...What’s up with you, Marinette? I wonder...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:2=excited,I see you’re not just smart, Annie! I’m still gonna make you g-g-go down though! S-see? I can be sexy!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:1=triumphant,Has anyone ever told you you’re top-heavy? Which is surprising because your brain doesn’t seem impressive.
3-female_removed_accessory,filter:fashionable,priority:0=interested,Er... ~name~, could you take me shopping after this? I bet you'd know exactly what I wanted!
3-female_removed_accessory,filter:fashionable,priority:0=interested,~name~! We should go on a post-game quest to get me some clothing that matches my style as well as your clothing matches yours!
3-female_removed_accessory,filter:fancy,priority:0=interested,Oooooooo. ~name~'s ~clothing~ is actually pretty high end! I wonder if Haru would know more aobut that...
3-female_removed_accessory,filter:fancy,priority:0=awkward,Why'd you have to dress up all fancy, ~name~!? I feel really out of place!
3-female_removed_accessory,filter:innocent,priority:0=shocked,~name~, um. A-are you okay with all this? You seem kind of... sheltered.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2=awkward,D-d-don't cry, Saki! It's just a game! (Is this a ploy to seem really innocent, or is she just...?)
3-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=shocked,Aww... she seems resistant to curse! This is... weird...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=interested,You said you were a pony? That explains the eyes... And purple.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:3=happy,Hmm. Do you like the stockings with the toes, Ann? I’m a big fan!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:3=awkward,I-I have to admit, Ann, I’ve always envied you. You’ve always been so m-m-much more outgoing.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:1=triumphant,You know, <i>this</i> is a game, and you <i>are</i> a robot AI challenging me, Alpha!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:4=happy,Well, you seem to be <i>far</i> shyer about this than even my good friend <i>Haru!</i> And she can be kind of prude. Like, she's into <i>femdom</i> at her kinkiest.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:2=calm,Maybe not. But you’d definitely look better with longer stockings! Short socks are no fun.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=happy,Hmm... If you’re interested, I know someone who might be perfect for you, Videl!
3-female_removed_accessory,filter:cheerful,priority:0=mad,I'm glad ~name~ is so cheery, considering how little he's stripping right now.
3-female_removed_accessory,filter:cheerful,priority:0=shocked,I'm glad you're nice and happy, ~name~, but couldn't you take off something a <i>little</i> bigger?
3-female_removed_accessory,filter:boob_envy,priority:0=triumphant,~name~, I get the feeling you're jealous of larger chests! You shouldn't be. Often the best items come in elite, small packages!
3-female_removed_accessory,filter:boob_envy,priority:0=excited,I'm glad <i>I'm</i> not at <i>all</i> jealous of larger breasts, like ~name~. Nope, not me!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1=calm,You’re both kind and determined...But I think she’s a bit braver…
3-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2=dissappointed,Aww... Fiiine, I guess.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2=dissappointed,Well you're wrecking up my interest, Ochako.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=mad,Haru would never flee like that!
3-female_removed_accessory,filter:confident,priority:0=annoyed,Hnrnrnhrurn. You're awfully confident for someone who's taking off small pieces, ~name~.
3-female_removed_accessory,filter:confident,priority:0=awkward,Oh, <i>~name~'s</i> confident? Well, I'm <i>confident</i> enough to... Hhrmrmrmernmerm. You'll see!
3-female_removed_accessory,filter:aggressive,priority:0=annoyed,No need to be so aggressive, ~name~, it's just a game.
3-female_removed_accessory,filter:aggressive,priority:0=awkward,~name~, you're awfully aggressive, huh?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=triumphant,<i>I</i> sure hope it's not on TV. I want this to be something exclusive!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:5=happy,Well, your stockings looked classy, Ann!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:5=awkward,We all know you’re stacked, so at least what’s next isn’t a surprise!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:5,saidMarker:annlingerie=annoyed,Er. Not that I wore them tonight.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:5=excited,I would love to study you! In the sexy way or the science way. The scienexy way!
3-female_removed_accessory,filter:ditzy,priority:0=shocked,Careful, ~name~! You could really lose a lot if you aren't!
3-female_removed_accessory,filter:ditzy,priority:0=shocked,W-whoa, ~name~, are you that confident or are you just not paying attention?
3-female_removed_accessory,filter:exhibitionist,priority:0=shocked,I'm into b-b-being sexy and all, but ~name~ is really quite an exhibitionist, huh?
3-female_removed_accessory,filter:exhibitionist,priority:0=awkward,W-w-wow, ~name~'s really outclassing me at this. I-I just want to be... um, attractive and stuff. But ~name~'s... m-m-making me wonder if this was a good idea.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:1=triumphant,Something hard? I hope?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:3,saidMarker:personapunann=interested,Get it. Becuase your Persona was Carmen… And it’s a red color? And you’re wearing… Red stockings.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=interested,Based on what I’ve heard though, you certainly are…
3-female_removed_accessory,filter:lonely,priority:0=dissappointed,Aww, ~name~, do you just... Did you come here to just make friends? I was here for the XP, but... I can relate a little.
3-female_removed_accessory,filter:lonely,priority:0=interested,~name~, maybe if you took off more than your ~clothing~, it'd be easier for you to make friends... I-I mean, in the short term, at least.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=awkward,Hmm... Maybe I should pet the kitty?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=shocked,Aww! You’re a kitty-cat! Just like Mona!
3-female_removed_accessory,filter:shut_in,priority:0=dissappointed,I know how it feels to not get out much, ~name~. But we're here at this big game together, so let's try and be cheery, huh?
3-female_removed_accessory,filter:shut_in,priority:0=calm,Don't worry, ~name~! I know what it's like to be stuck at home too. But I got a lot better and so can you. K-keep going with that small stuff, alright?
3-female_removed_accessory,filter:submissive,priority:0=awkward,~name~... I don't know how to say this, but you're kind of into being dominated, huh?
3-female_removed_accessory,filter:submissive,priority:0=awkward,I can't say I can't relate to ~name~'s need to be... well... what girl doesn't like to be manhandled a bit? Maybe Haru. She prefers to the handling...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=interested,Don't worry, Chiaki! You're still well above half... (Unless she's also not wearing...)
3-female_removed_accessory,filter:sarcastic,priority:0=annoyed,Oh <i>yeah</i>, ~name~. Sarcasm is truly the height of wit.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:1=interested,Hm. Maybe I should try on a maid outfit at some point? Hmmmm…
3-female_removed_accessory,filter:tsundere,priority:0=happy,I think ~name~'s only acting like this because he has a crush on someone here. So tsundere.
3-female_removed_accessory,filter:tsundere,priority:0=happy,~name~, y-y-you know, you're like a cactus. You want people to hug you but you pretend to be so prickly!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:1=awkward,I wonder what’s under your mask?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2=interested,I think that’s another Megami Tensei game though...

3-female_removed_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:1=shocked,Damn it! And I don’t have Necronomicon to assist.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:3=annoyed,If the headphones mattered to you, you’d leave them on no matter what, D.va!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:2=calm,Have  to pay attention to you!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=triumphant,I swear, if you introduce me, I’ll throw this game in a heartbeat. Maybe.
3-female_removed_accessory,filter:perverted,priority:0=triumphant,Awww yissss. ~name~'s definitely into dirty sexy stuff too! E-er, right?
3-female_removed_accessory,filter:perverted,priority:0=awkward,~name~'s kind of overt in his attentions, but... I don't know, I think that's l-l-like any good strip poker manga, right?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=happy,Oh, our thigh highs match!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=happy,Aw. At least we have similar styles...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=triumphant,One down, Saki! Show us your boobs! (There! This will surely help her build confidence.)
3-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=triumphant,Come here, Saki! ~player~ can't stare at both of us if you're so far away! (There, now we can be awkward together!)
3-female_removed_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jane=triumphant,Unlike, psssst... (The art students.)

3-female_removed_accessory,filter:moe,priority:0=awkward,Aww, you're so cute, ~name~. I wish I could pull off that innocent and wide-eyed look...

3-female_removed_accessory,target:meia=awkward,Er. Wait, doesn’t Rei have red eyes? Um. Sorry for the confusion.
3-female_removed_accessory,filter:yandere,priority:0=shocked,Whoa, be careful, ~player~, ~name~ has his sights on you!
3-female_removed_accessory,filter:yandere,priority:0=shocked,I-is it just me, or is there something really scary about ~name~?
3-female_removed_accessory,filter:yandere,priority:0=shocked,~name~ could use a change of heart! And fast!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3=dissappointed,You artsy types tend to know each other, is all.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:2=interested,Sorry if I get a little mean, I know you’re really following the rules closely. Let’s definitely hang out after this.

3-female_removed_accessory,filter:shy,priority:0=happy,I get it! ~name~'s also here to widen her horizons! Good for you, ~name~, building up your confidence!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:3=triumphant,I've got it! My Persona was Necronomicon, so Monika's codename should be Nyarlathotep!

4-female_removing_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:2=awkward,You know, I kind of liked being in my Phantom Thief costume, but you always seemed so eager to get out of yours.

-3-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=shocked,Aww… I thought we were going to have a “headgear stays on heads and doesn’t come off even in strip poker” kind of aesthetic going.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=interested,Are you a Persona user, Nines?
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=annoyed,Okay, something small... But it <i>is</i> a weapon... I'm usually more of a support-type player...

-3-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=interested,I think I've seen this plot twist before...
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:0=interested,Okay, those are pretty cool...
-3-male_removed_accessory=excited,There’s probably a fetish for that.
-3-male_removed_accessory=awkward,Ugh, that must be a +2 Futaba-bane ~Clothing~.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=happy,So what are Neighbors? Are those like Shadows? What kind of Personas does your team use?

-3-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=excited,I-is this doing it or anyone else?
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1=excited,I can call you Nines, because you asked, right? Urnrhrugh. You have to have a better codename…
-3-female_removing_accessory=shocked,I-I-I’m here with everything on display. And y-y-you’re only?
-3-female_removing_accessory=dissappointed,That better be the last of that, I’m not sure how much longer I can hold on.

-3-female_removing_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:0=annoyed,It’s like playing with a female Ryuji with huge boobs.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=shocked,THIS. IS. FASCINATING.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:2=awkward,I dunno... she is kind of hacking... but I can only see it in short glimpses...

-3-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=triumphant,Nice! Saki! That's <i>very</i> clever and sexy, showing off your panties like that!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=interested,Hm! I've done something different with the panties <i>I'm totally</i> wearing, but showing off those panties is a great move!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=annoyed,Quick, someone use  <i>bless</i> spells before she brainwashes everyone!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=awkward,Oh. Huh. I figured your gravity stuff was from a Persona or something...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=dissappointed,Oh. Well, I guess it could be like a costume from a superhero show or a sentai episode or something...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:0=mad,You don’t really use your head a lot, just... brawn?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:1=excited,Just b-b-because you have big boobs d-d-doesn’t mean--

-3-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=triumphant,A comet storm?! That's sounds super cool! I wish I could see your power meter charging...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=awkward,Joker’s old homeroom teacher used to do that too.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:0=shocked,Wait. Are you just me? No, of course not... Hrmmm... Would the Metaverse have made a copy... Or am <i>I</i> a copy?

-3-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:3=dissappointed,I'm not <i>really</i> into girls but you're really drawing this out, Ochako...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:2b,alsoPlaying:marinette=shocked,It <i>does</i> look like Tron! B-but I don't have my computer or Persona here. So I can't do anything. Well, besides watch.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:weiss,targetStage:0=mad,Hmm... I don’t know what dust is, but it sounds like drugs. Haru is much more legitimate! Don’t you corrupt her!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:ruby,targetStage:0=happy,Well, at least you’re fun to play with, Ruby!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:1=happy,Don’t worry, smart people like us usually are!

-3-female_removing_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:2=awkward,You know, I kind of liked being in my Phantom Thief costume, but you always seemed so eager to get out of yours.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:2,marker:personapunann=happy,You’re looking awfully red, Ann! Something, Carmen-dine?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:0=interested,Annie! What do you study?

-3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:2=awkward,Do you know Inari? Er… Yusuku Kitagawa.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:5=shocked,Whoa! You’re like a giant Mona!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:5=interested,What’s so weird about that? Lots of people love catgirls.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=interested,Oh, an upskirt shot. <i>Clever</i>, Chiaki.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=interested,Huh. Going for the upskirt, Chiaki?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:3=awkward,An old friend of mine... But he was a cat...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:0=awkward,I never thought about making a living doing it... I’m not much one for the spotlight.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=triumphant,Mwehehe. This'll teach you to call me a knockoff!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:2=shocked,Your headphones? What!?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:0=annoyed,Or if we’d get along really well. Rururhuehghgh.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:1=shocked,Er…
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=triumphant,Now you're subject to debuffs! My specialty!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=triumphant,Buffing Chiaki's wetness!
-3-female_removed_accessory=annoyed,I’m surrounded, and could really use some help!
-3-female_removed_accessory=dissappointed,I wish I could buff myself with some more HP...
-3-female_removed_accessory=interested,What kind of hacks are you using, ~name~?
-3-female_removed_accessory=awkward,You might be pretty... pretty frustrating.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3=dissappointed,You artsy types tend to know each other, is all.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:3=triumphant,I've got it! My Persona was Necronomicon, so Monika's codename should be Nyarlathotep!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:2=calm,Maybe not. But you’d definitely look better with longer stockings! Short socks are no fun.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=happy,Hmm... If you’re interested, I know someone who might be perfect for you, Videl!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2=awkward,D-d-don't cry, Saki! It's just a game! (Is this a ploy to seem really innocent, or is she just...?)
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1=calm,You’re both kind and determined...But I think she’s a bit braver…
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2=interested,I think that’s another Megami Tensei game though...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:1=shocked,Damn it! And I don’t have Necronomicon to assist.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=shocked,Aww... she seems resistant to curse! This is... weird...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=triumphant,One down, Saki! Show us your boobs! (There! This will surely help her build confidence.)
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=triumphant,Come here, Saki! ~player~ can't stare at both of us if you're so far away! (There, now we can be awkward together!)
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=triumphant,<i>I</i> sure hope it's not on TV. I want this to be something exclusive!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2=dissappointed,Aww... Fiiine, I guess.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2=dissappointed,Well you're wrecking up my interest, Ochako.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:2=interested,Sorry if I get a little mean, I know you’re really following the rules closely. Let’s definitely hang out after this.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:1=awkward,I wonder what’s under your mask?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=annoyed,Hmm...What’s up with you, Marinette? I wonder...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=triumphant,I swear, if you introduce me, I’ll throw this game in a heartbeat. Maybe.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:2=calm,Have  to pay attention to you!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:5=excited,I would love to study you! In the sexy way or the science way. The scienexy way!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:1=interested,Hm. Maybe I should try on a maid outfit at some point? Hmmmm…
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=interested,You said you were a pony? That explains the eyes... And purple.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:4=happy,Well, you seem to be <i>far</i> shyer about this than even my good friend <i>Haru!</i> And she can be kind of prude. Like, she's into <i>femdom</i> at her kinkiest.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:1=interested,IF THESE ARE REAL PLEASE TELL ME HOW TO GET INVOLVED.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=happy,Oh, our thigh highs match!

-3-female_removed_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:1=triumphant,Has anyone ever told you you’re top-heavy? Which is surprising because your brain doesn’t seem impressive.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:1=triumphant,Something hard? I hope?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=awkward,Hmm... Maybe I should pet the kitty?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=shocked,Aww! You’re a kitty-cat! Just like Mona!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:3=annoyed,If the headphones mattered to you, you’d leave them on no matter what, D.va!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:3,saidMarker:personapunann=interested,Get it. Becuase your Persona was Carmen… And it’s a red color? And you’re wearing… Red stockings.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:meia=awkward,Er. Wait, doesn’t Rei have red eyes? Um. Sorry for the confusion.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:5=happy,Well, your stockings looked classy, Ann!

-3-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=interested,Don't worry, Chiaki! You're still well above half... (Unless you're also not wearing...)
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:1=triumphant,You know, <i>this</i> is a game, and you <i>are</i> a robot AI challenging me, Alpha!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=mad,Haru would never flee like that!

-3-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:1=dissappointed,Why are people so complicated?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:3=happy,Hmm. Do you like the stockings with the toes, Ann? I’m a big fan!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:3=awkward,I-I have to admit, Ann, I’ve always envied you. You’ve always been so m-m-much more outgoing.

-2-male_removing_accessory=calm,Just imagine I’m making a disgusted sigh.

-2-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:0=mad,You don’t really use your head a lot, just... brawn?
-2-female_removed_accessory=awkward,N-n-no, I can’t really use that to facilitate my schlickfest over here.
-2-female_removed_accessory=triumphant,~name~, if I promise to be good and lick... You know what, I’m not doing that.
-2-female_removed_accessory=dissappointed,Shove it in a hole, ~name~.
-2-female_removed_accessory=excited,If you don’t take off anything else, but you kissed... Uhm. Anywhere on me. Or even patted! <i>Especially</i> patted... I’d forgive you!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:4=happy,Well, you seem to be <i>far</i> shyer about this than even my good friend <i>Haru!</i> And she can be kind of prude. Like, she's into <i>femdom</i> at her kinkiest.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:3=annoyed,If the headphones mattered to you, you’d leave them on no matter what, D.va!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:3,saidMarker:personapunann=interested,Get it. Becuase your Persona was Carmen… And it’s a red color? And you’re wearing… Red stockings.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:2=interested,Sorry if I get a little mean, I know you’re really following the rules closely. Let’s definitely hang out after this.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:haru=happy,Wow, Haru, Ochako's more uncomfortable taking her suit off than <i>you</i> are. She's probably even more vanilla, too!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=triumphant,One down, Saki! Show us your boobs! (There! This will surely help her build confidence.)
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=triumphant,Come here, Saki! ~player~ can't stare at both of us if you're so far away! (There, now we can be awkward together!)

-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:1=interested,IF THESE ARE REAL PLEASE TELL ME HOW TO GET INVOLVED.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:2=calm,Maybe not. But you’d definitely look better with longer stockings! Short socks are no fun.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=shocked,Aww... she seems resistant to curse! This is... weird...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2=interested,I think that’s another Megami Tensei game though...

-2-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=awkward,Hmm... Maybe I should pet the kitty?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=shocked,Aww! You’re a kitty-cat! Just like Mona!

-2-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3=dissappointed,You artsy types tend to know each other, is all.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:1=triumphant,Has anyone ever told you you’re top-heavy? Which is surprising because your brain doesn’t seem impressive.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:5=excited,I would love to study you! In the sexy way or the science way. The scienexy way!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=interested,Based on what I’ve heard though, you certainly are…

-1-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=triumphant,Looks like we have an incest kink here tonight. You're <i>dirty</i> ~player~.
-1-female_removing_accessory=annoyed,I know women are supposed to accessorize.
-1-female_removing_accessory=dissappointed,That. Is all?
-1-female_removing_accessory=shocked,For real!?
-1-female_removing_accessory=happy,~name~, get good.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=triumphant,Though maybe if you ripped off that mask, there would be something interesting underneath?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=triumphant,Comet storm?! Can you show us!?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=triumphant,A comet storm?! That's sounds super cool! I wish I could see your power meter charging...

#OPPONENT REMOVING MINOR CLOTHING
#Minor pieces of clothing don't reveal much when removed, but probably indicate more progress than accessory removal.

#stage-specific lines that override the stage-generic ones
male_removing_minor=calm,Okay, I gave up my boots and my jacket. This is about even.
male_removing_minor=interested,~name~’s ~clothing~ looks pretty comfortable. Worth investigating...
male_removed_minor=awkward,Hmm... This seems oddly familiar... We aren’t in Mementos, are we?
male_removed_minor=triumphant,Okay, ~name~, what else is up on your cavalcade of fail?
female_removing_minor=triumphant,It’s been years since I visited the Metaverse, but I miss my Persona outfit... Just like ~name~ is going to miss her ~clothing~!
female_removing_minor=awkward,Don’t worry, ~name~, you just have to not lose another hand for the rest of the game if you don’t want to strip!
female_removing_minor=interested,I lost my boots and my jacket. So, really, this could be worse for you, ~name~!
female_removing_minor=excited,My thigh-highs are so comfortable. It’s great I’m still wearing them, ~name~.
female_removed_minor=interested,~name~, it’s nice to see those on the floor. But let’s get the rest!
female_removed_minor=triumphant,Okay! Onto the next hand!
female_removed_minor=excited,Not bad, but it’s just a ~clothing~, ~name~. Hope it wasn’t super sentimental!
female_removed_minor=happy,All right. Only good hands ahead!


#fully clothed
0-male_removing_minor=triumphant,Nice! ~name~ is officially starting to lose! Let’s keep up the pressure!
0-male_removing_minor=happy,Alright! ~name~ is taking off his ~clothing~!

-1-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=awkward,Oh. I thought that was a bit more of a personal item. It does look super nice for a school uniform.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=awkward,Oh, I thought your cardigan was similar to my jacket. Just something personal.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:0=triumphant,I’m the smart one here though, so don’t act like you can quite measure up.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=shocked,It helps with accuracy and evasion. So it makes sense that you’d be a speed master.

-1-female_removed_minor,target:monika,targetStage:2=dissappointed,But I'm not seeing a Persona for you... or a codename, for that matter...
-1-female_removed_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:4=interested,You do seem to be a bit more outgoing, though… Even though you're losing?

#OPPONENT REMOVING MAJOR CLOTHING
#Major clothing reveals a significant amount of skin and likely underwear.
#However, as we don't know if the opponent is taking off the top or the bottom, we can't presume that nice abs are showing; maybe she took of her skirt before her shirt.

#fully clothed

0-male_removing_major=interested,Your ~clothing~, already, ~name~?
0-male_removing_major,target:9s,targetStage:3=excited,You’d make a good Phantom Thief, Nines. Er, Oathkeeper. You seem good at keeping things under wraps…

0-female_removing_major,target:aimee,targetStage:0=shocked,Gah! This isn’t the Metaverse, you shouldn’t be using that here!
0-female_removing_major,target:ann,targetStage:1=dissappointed,Yikes, Ann. You’re going all out this game!

0-female_removing_major,target:ann,targetStage:3=triumphant,Oof. Ann, I think you need a Bead to come back from this. Of either variety!
0-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:2=shocked,<i>Nani</i>? Sorry, <i>what</i>?

0-female_removed_major,target:meg,targetStage:6=awkward,Hmmurmrhm... I know most redheads are from Europe, but do you think the tartan pattern is a bit... Stereotyped?
0-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5=shocked,S-s-so pink! I don't own any orange panties, b-but maybe I should, to match my hair like you did?
0-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5=shocked,Hm. If you didn't have the polka dots, you could be accused of matching your hair, Chiaki.
0-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5=shocked,I guess you'll have a matching bra, too...?

#OPPONENT MASTURBATING
#When an opponent is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must pay the penalty by masturbating in front of everyone.
#The "must_masturbate" line is for just before it happens, and the "start_masturbating" line immediately follows.
#The "masturbating" line will be spoken a little after the opponent has started but before they climax.
#When the opponent climaxes, your character will say the "finished_masturbating" line.

#stage-specific lines that override the stage-generic ones

#SELF MASTURBATING
#If your character is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must masturbate.
#These lines only come up in the relevant stages, so you don't need to include the stage numbers here. Just remember which stage is which when you make the images. The "starting" image is still in the naked stage.
#The "finished_masturbating" line will repeat many times if the game is not yet finished. This plays as opponents comment on the how good their hands are.

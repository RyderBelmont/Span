    <description>A sensitive and polite boy, Ignatz can be rather shy or anxious at times. He has an interest in painting, but continues to work towards his father's wish of becoming a knight despite feeling unsuited to become one. Loyal to the Golden Deer house as well as the Goddess.</description>

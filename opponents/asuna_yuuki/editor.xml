        <line>Stage 0 Removing-Accessory:</line>
        <line>Prancing Boots... I still remember wearing those in SAO...</line>
        <line>She really is like I was back then, right down to her equipment...</line>
        <line>Well, so far so good... I guess.</line>
        <line>Stage 1 Removing-Accessory:</line>
        <line>Those stockings... I remember wearing those too. I still think back to when I wore them again, during the Augma incident.</line>
        <line>&lt;i&gt;(This is still so strange. Seriously.)&lt;/i&gt;</line>
        <line>Another part of my whole skill setup back then...</line>
        <line>Stage 2 Removing-Accessory:</line>
        <line>Well, it would be the obvious choice for me too, in that situation.</line>
        <line>I guess we do have the same overall mindset. But she still feels off to me... and not just for the obvious reasons.</line>
        <line>And to think, even after SAO, I'd only have this confidence in virtual games. It wouldn't translate so easily to reality... like when I needed to confront mom.</line>
        <line>Stage 1 Removed-Accessory:</line>
        <line>Even the quest name is the exact same. &lt;i&gt;And even now, this is so strange...&lt;/i&gt;</line>
        <line>The Laketop Fortress quest... there were other rewards for it, but that was the one I chose.</line>
        <line>They provided a small boost to my jumps, and softened the sounds of my footsteps; real handy for movement and hunting purposes.</line>
        <line>Stage 2 Removed-Accessory:</line>
        <line>...It's 'Knights of Blood Oath', actually. But I always remembered how the others got me to wear that uniform.</line>
        <line>The others kinda guilt-tripped me into wearing it in SAO, because it was so expensive...</line>
        <line>I remember how happy I was to wear that uniform again, even briefly, when facing An Incarnation Of The Radius during the Augma incident... SAO's true Floor 100 boss.</line>
        <line>Stage 3 Removed-Accessory:</line>
        <line>I remember that too. Every little bonus made a difference between life and death, as much as skill did...</line>
        <line>The other me thinks this is a safe zone... as if she's still inside SAO, somehow; she's not even aware of &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt;.</line>
        <line>&lt;i&gt;(This version of me almost sounds like Kirito is... is still just a crush? So before the last weeks before the game was cleared, before we got really close.)&lt;/i&gt;</line>

#When selecting the characters to play the game, the first line will always play, then it randomly picks from any of the start lines after you commence the game but before you deal the first hand.
start=0-calm,I am Rinkah, princess of the Flame Tribe. No matter the game, you won't beat me! Kagero and I have done this plenty of times.
start=0-calm,It's brave to summon me when I'm all worked up. Are you ready to fight?
start=0-proud,If you wanna win, you best go all out!
start=0-proud,Let's get this battle started!


#Items of clothing should be listed here in order of removal.
#The values are formal name, lower case name, how much they cover, what they cover
#Please do not put spaces around the commas.
#"Important" clothes cover genitals (lower) or chest/breasts (upper). For example: bras, panties, a skirt when going commando.
#"Major" clothes cover underwear. For example: skirts, pants, shirts, dresses.
#"Minor" clothes cover skin or are large pieces of clothing that do not cover skin. For example: jackets, socks, stockings, gloves.
#"Extra" clothes are small items that may or may not be clothing but do not cover anything interesting. For example: jewelry, shoes or boots with socks underneath, belts, hats. In the rest of the code, "extra" clothes are called "accessory".
#If for some reason you write another word for the type of clothes (e.g. "accessory"), other characters will not react at all when the clothing is removed.
#What they cover = upper (upper body), lower (lower body), other (neither).
#The game can support any number of entries, but typically we use 2-8, with at least one "important" layer for upper and lower (each).
clothes=Gloves,gloves,extra,other

#Notes on dialogue
#All lines that start with a # symbol are comments and will be ignored by the tool that converts this file into a xml file for the game.
#Where more than one line has an identical type, like "swap_cards" and "swap_cards", the game will randomly select one of these lines each time the character is in that situation.
#You should try to include multiple lines for most stages, especially the final (finished) stage, -1. 

#A character goes through multiple stages as they undress. The stage number starts at zero and indicates how many layers they have removed. Special stage numbers are used when they are nude (-3), masturbating (-2), and finished (-1).
#Line types that start with a number will only display during that stage. The will override any numberless stage-generic lines. For example, in stage 4 "4-swap_cards" will be used over "swap_cards" if it is not blank here. Giving a character unique dialogue for each stage is an effective way of showing their changing openness/shyness as the game progresses.
#You can combine the above points and make multiple lines for a particular situation in a particular stage, like "4-swap_cards" and "4-swap_cards".

#Some special words can be used that will be substituted by the game for context-appropriate ones: ~name~ is the name of the character they're speaking to, but this only works if someone else is in focus. ~clothing~ is the type of clothing that is being removed by another player. ~Clothing~ is almost the same, but it starts with a capital letter in case you want to start a sentence with it.
#~name~ can be used any time a line targets an opponent (game_over_defeat, _must_strip, _removing_, _removed, _must_masturbate, etc).
#~clothing~ can be used only when clothing is being removed (_removing and _removed, but NOT _must_strip).
#~player~ can be used at any time and refers to the human player.
#~cards~ can be used only in the swap_cards lines.
#All wildcards can be used once per line only! If you use ~name~ twice, the code will show up the second time.

#Lines can be written that are only spoken when specific other characters are present. For a detailed explanation, read this guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/spnati/comments/6nhaj0/the_easy_way_to_write_targeted_lines/
#Here is an example line (note that targeted lines must have a stage number):
#0-female_must_strip,target:hermioine=happy,Looks like your magic doesn't help with poker!




#EXCHANGING CARDS
#This is what a character says while they're exchanging cards.
#The game will automatically put a display a number between 0-5 where you write ~cards~.
#These lines display on the screen for only a brief time, so it is important to make them short enough to read at a glance.

2-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:2=calm,It's rather interesting to see just how different the magic you use is from the magic that we have in my world. I'm sure Orochi would love to spend some time with you.

#OPPONENT REMOVING ACCESSORY
#These lines are spoken when an opponent removes a small item that does not cover any skin.
#Typically, characters are fine with this when they are fully dressed but less satisfied as they become more naked.
#Note that all "removing" lines are NOT spoken to human players. Characters will skip straight from "6-male_human_must_strip" to "6-male_removed_accessory", for example.

-1-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=think,What's with the eyepiece Meia? I can't imagine it helps you see, and Oboro would probably say it's not a fashion thing.
-1-female_removed_accessory=proud,Looks like you've still got toys to remove. You must be pretty good at this.

-1-female_removed_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:4=calm,Crowns don't make the monarch Peach. Lady Corrin, Lady Hinoka and I don't wear one.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:1=calm,Pretty fancy hat you got there Zizou. I bet Oboro would love to design a line based off of it.

-1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=sad,I still think this is going against the spirit of the game.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=calm,I've heard a lot of good things about Va-11 Hall-a. Would you care to join me for a drink there sometime, Sei?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:1=calm,So is that a mask, or are you just...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:3=proud,If ya get cold Nagisa, I could always help warm you up!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:3=proud,If you ever need help defending your world from invaders, I know an entire army with experience in the field.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:3=calm,I wonder how you would look in traditional Flame Tribe wear, lady Lyndis. Perhaps we should introuduce each other to our tribes.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:5,priority:450=angry,Hair down!? I've been cheated!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:5,priority:450=sad,Hair down!? Damnit!

-1-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:futaba=calm,Megami Tensei? Wasn't the legendary king Chrom part of that story?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:1=happy,I like that passion Sonya, but you do realize that the point of the game is to strip, right?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=think,I'm very lost right now.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:2=happy,Wow, those sandles were so small I forgot you were wearing them.

#OPPONENT REMOVING MAJOR CLOTHING
#Major clothing reveals a significant amount of skin and likely underwear.
#However, as we don't know if the opponent is taking off the top or the bottom, we can't presume that nice abs are showing; maybe she took of her skirt before her shirt.

#stage-specific lines that override the stage-generic ones

#OPPONENT MASTURBATING
#When an opponent is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must pay the penalty by masturbating in front of everyone.
#The "must_masturbate" line is for just before it happens, and the "start_masturbating" line immediately follows.
#The "masturbating" line will be spoken a little after the opponent has started but before they climax.
#When the opponent climaxes, your character will say the "finished_masturbating" line.

#stage-specific lines that override the stage-generic ones

male_finished_masturbating=horny,Gods... I'm feeling pretty wet down there...
female_must_masturbate=horny,Feh. You lost before I even got naked. You're gonna miss out on something good.
female_start_masturbating=horny,Well. I'm gonna remember this for as loooong as I can.
female_start_masturbating=horny,Sweet, sweet victory.
female_start_masturbating=proud,Of course! This is what happens when you go up against the princess of the flame tribe!
female_masturbating=horny,Enjoying yourself, ~name~? Maybe you'd like some help later?
female_finished_masturbating=horny,Seemed fun... I know what I'm doing later tonight.

#SELF MASTURBATING
#If your character is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must masturbate.
#These lines only come up in the relevant stages, so you don't need to include the stage numbers here. Just remember which stage is which when you make the images. The "starting" image is still in the naked stage.
#The "finished_masturbating" line will repeat many times if the game is not yet finished. This plays as opponents comment on the how good their hands are.

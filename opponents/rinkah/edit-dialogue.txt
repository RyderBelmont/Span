#When selecting the characters to play the game, the first line will always play, then it randomly picks from any of the start lines after you commence the game but before you deal the first hand.


#Items of clothing should be listed here in order of removal.
#The values are formal name, lower case name, how much they cover, what they cover
#Please do not put spaces around the commas.
#"Important" clothes cover genitals (lower) or chest/breasts (upper). For example: bras, panties, a skirt when going commando.
#"Major" clothes cover underwear. For example: skirts, pants, shirts, dresses.
#"Minor" clothes cover skin or are large pieces of clothing that do not cover skin. For example: jackets, socks, stockings, gloves.
#"Extra" clothes are small items that may or may not be clothing but do not cover anything interesting. For example: jewelry, shoes or boots with socks underneath, belts, hats. In the rest of the code, "extra" clothes are called "accessory".
#If for some reason you write another word for the type of clothes (e.g. "accessory"), other characters will not react at all when the clothing is removed.
#What they cover = upper (upper body), lower (lower body), other (neither).
#The game can support any number of entries, but typically we use 2-8, with at least one "important" layer for upper and lower (each).

#Notes on dialogue
#All lines that start with a # symbol are comments and will be ignored by the tool that converts this file into a xml file for the game.
#Where more than one line has an identical type, like "swap_cards" and "swap_cards", the game will randomly select one of these lines each time the character is in that situation.
#You should try to include multiple lines for most stages, especially the final (finished) stage, -1. 

#A character goes through multiple stages as they undress. The stage number starts at zero and indicates how many layers they have removed. Special stage numbers are used when they are nude (-3), masturbating (-2), and finished (-1).
#Line types that start with a number will only display during that stage. The will override any numberless stage-generic lines. For example, in stage 4 "4-swap_cards" will be used over "swap_cards" if it is not blank here. Giving a character unique dialogue for each stage is an effective way of showing their changing openness/shyness as the game progresses.
#You can combine the above points and make multiple lines for a particular situation in a particular stage, like "4-swap_cards" and "4-swap_cards".

#Some special words can be used that will be substituted by the game for context-appropriate ones: ~name~ is the name of the character they're speaking to, but this only works if someone else is in focus. ~clothing~ is the type of clothing that is being removed by another player. ~Clothing~ is almost the same, but it starts with a capital letter in case you want to start a sentence with it.
#~name~ can be used any time a line targets an opponent (game_over_defeat, _must_strip, _removing_, _removed, _must_masturbate, etc).
#~clothing~ can be used only when clothing is being removed (_removing and _removed, but NOT _must_strip).
#~player~ can be used at any time and refers to the human player.
#~cards~ can be used only in the swap_cards lines.
#All wildcards can be used once per line only! If you use ~name~ twice, the code will show up the second time.

#Lines can be written that are only spoken when specific other characters are present. For a detailed explanation, read this guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/spnati/comments/6nhaj0/the_easy_way_to_write_targeted_lines/
#Here is an example line (note that targeted lines must have a stage number):
#0-female_must_strip,target:hermione=happy,Looks like your magic doesn't help with poker!

#When swapping cards, the game will automatically put a display a number between 0-5 where you write ~cards~.

#OPPONENT MUST STRIP
#These lines are spoken when an opponent must strip, but the character does not yet know what they will take off.
#Writing different variations is important here, as these lines will be spoken about thirty times per game.
#The "human" versions of the lines will only be spoken if the human player is stripping.

#OPPONENT REMOVING ACCESSORY
#These lines are spoken when an opponent removes a small item that does not cover any skin.
#Typically, characters are fine with this when they are fully dressed but less satisfied as they become more naked.
#Note that all "removing" lines are NOT spoken to human players. Characters will skip straight from "6-male_human_must_strip" to "6-male_removed_accessory", for example.

#fully clothed

0-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,count-corrin_f:0,count-darkstalkers:0,direction:down=calm,In return, I'll help you work out. You seem to struggle a bit when you're using a club.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6,direction:down=happy,But for real, why keep it for so long if you were gonna remove it anyway?
0-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f,direction:down=shocked,What the hell is happening?

0-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:vriska,alsoPlayingStage:1-10,direction:down=sad,Why couldn't this just be a normal game of strip poker?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,Well, hey, if you're gonna remove two things at once, I won't complain.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:3,direction:down=angry,Seriously, why didn't you <i>start</i> with that?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:0,direction:down=calm,It's a bit of a long shot... but...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f,direction:down=think,Hey, Lady Corrin...

0-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0,direction:down=proud,Alright, Sei, where should we spar? Your place or mine?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:0,direction:down=proud,So, Shantae... I wonder what's in better shape, my abs, or your hips?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,How heavy are they, Shantae? They might help me train.

0-female_removed_accessory,target:april,targetStage:1,direction:down=think,Or are they more calm and collected like Kaze?

0-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:2,direction:down=happy,I wouldn't mind leveling up my supports with you, Lady Lyndis.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:3,direction:down=calm,I wonder how you would look in traditional Flame Tribe wear, Lady Lyndis. Perhaps we should introuduce each other to our tribes.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:5,priority:450,direction:down=angry,Hair down!? I've been cheated!

0-female_removed_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:1,direction:down=think,Hm, you don't seem to be one of Iago's creations. Sorry for judging you so quickly.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1,saidMarker:yoyo,marker:felicia,direction:down=think,Then again, a yoyo could be decently effective. I've seen Felicia do quite a bit of damage with only a plate...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:futaba,direction:down=calm,Megami Tensei? Wasn't the legendary king Chrom part of that story?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2,direction:down=sad,Shame, that was a cool sword. I was gonna ask to borrow it.

0-female_removed_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:4,marker:hinoka,direction:down=calm,Crowns don't make the monarch Peach. Lady Corrin, Lady Hinoka and I don't wear one.

1-male_removing_accessory,direction:down=proud,You can't stall forever!
1-male_removing_accessory,direction:down=happy,If you think accessories are gonna save you, you're in for a rude awakening!
1-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0,count-corrin_f:0,count-darkstalkers:0,direction:down=proud,How about you teach me how to use claws or arms?
1-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:0-7,direction:down=think,Yeah, I'm pretty lost here.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5,direction:down=calm,Huh, didn't think you'd actually be taking that off.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f,direction:down=shocked,I'm... very lost right now.

1-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1,direction:down=proud,That's a neat sword you got there, Jin.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:0,direction:down=proud,Between the wraps on your body, the lack of a shirt, and the muscles...

1-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,direction:down=think,Most people in my world are able to use three at most, but they never really master any of them...
1-male_removing_accessory,target:ryu,targetStage:0,direction:down=proud,So this is the legendary Ryu? I'd love a sparring match after this is over.
1-male_removed_accessory,direction:down=calm,I gotta say. I kinda liked how that looked on you.
1-male_removed_accessory,direction:down=proud,You look better with less on anyway.
1-male_removed_accessory,marker:oboro,direction:down=happy,Oboro always told me that less is more.
1-male_removed_accessory,direction:down=think,Well that was boring...
1-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,count-corrin_f:0,count-darkstalkers:0,direction:down=calm,In return, I'll help you work out. You seem to struggle a bit when you're using a club.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6,direction:down=happy,But for real, why keep it for so long if you were gonna remove it anyway?
1-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f,direction:down=shocked,What the hell is happening?

1-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:sph,direction:down=angry,I'd ask where you're balls are, but I've seen enough to know you don't have any.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:2,direction:down=happy,How would you feel about letting me practice with it for a bit?
1-male_removed_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:2,direction:down=proud,Nice weapon, Jin. It reminds me of Takumi's bow.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,You'd fit in right at home with the Flame Tribe!
1-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2,direction:down=happy,And yet, here you are, able to use nine different types of weapons without a problem!
1-female_removing_accessory,direction:down=happy,Little by little, you'll lose it all.
1-female_removing_accessory,direction:down=calm,Lose it now, so it doesn't interrupt later.
1-female_removing_accessory,direction:down=happy,Better to lose it now.
1-female_removing_accessory,direction:down=happy,A predictable start, but whatever.
1-female_removing_accessory,direction:down=proud,Come on, you can do better.

1-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0,direction:down=think,Video games? What's the difference between that and a regular game?

1-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:5,direction:down=angry,Are you serious, Faye!?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,direction:down=calm,If you're that embarrassed, is it really a good idea for you to be playing this game?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:0,direction:down=sad,(<i>This is awkward...</i>)
1-female_removing_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,Your name sounds pretty similar to Hana. She's someone from Hoshido. I guess our worlds might be pretty similar?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:haru,targetStage:0,direction:down=calm,It reminds me a bit of Charlotte, for some reason.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:0,direction:down=shocked,A taguel!? I've only heard stories of those before!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,Ever meet any archers? Or swordsman?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:0,direction:down=proud,Yeah, guess I was right.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,direction:down=think,Quite a few people in my world don't wear pants either. It's weird. Pants are comfortable.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:lucina,targetStage:2,direction:down=proud,In fact, Odin has a tattoo that looks similar to the brand in your eye!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:lucina,targetStage:3,direction:down=proud,Those three are retainers of Nohrian royalty!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0,direction:down=proud,So you're Lyn, princess of the Sacae plains? I suppose we're alot alike then. I'd love to share stories with you sometime.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1,direction:down=proud,Perhaps you would be down for a spar sometime, Lady Lyndis?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:4,priority:450,direction:down=horny,I can't believe it! I get to see the legendary Lady Lyndis'...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:futaba,direction:down=think,Why don't you take off the mask, Ladybug? It's not like it's that good at hiding your face anyway.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena,marker:yoyo,direction:down=shocked,Wait, Palutena, you seriously know somebody who fights with a Yoyo?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0,marker:oboro,direction:down=think,What's with the eyepiece Meia? I can't imagine it helps you see, and Oboro would probably say it's not a fashion thing.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,Is- Is this allowed?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2,direction:down=embarrassed,I may be royalty, but I've never had any of the Flame Tribe members strip me...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:9s_hack1,alsoPlaying:9s,direction:down=calm,Are you okay, 9S? Something seems to be bugging you.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1,direction:down=think,Management? Uh... I didn't know there were rules to how we were supposed to strip.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:vriska,alsoPlayingStage:1-10,direction:down=sad,When did my life get so weird?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:vriska,alsoPlayingStage:1-10,direction:down=sad,Why couldn't this just be a normal game of strip poker?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,Well, hey, if you're gonna remove two things at once, I won't complain.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:3,direction:down=angry,Seriously, why didn't you <i>start</i> with that?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:0,direction:down=calm,It's a bit of a long shot... but...

1-female_removing_accessory,target:sakura,targetStage:0,direction:down=confident,Unless you're like Takumi, and your ego is just <i>that</i> big.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0,direction:down=proud,Alright, Sei, where should we spar? Your place or mine?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:0,direction:down=proud,So, Shantae... I wonder what's in better shape, my abs, or your hips?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,How heavy are they, Shantae? They might help me train.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:1,direction:down=proud,Could I borrow those sometime, Shantae? Weighted clothes are great for training.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:0,direction:down=confident,She's also a black haired ninja with clothing that shows off her... uh...

1-female_removing_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:0,direction:down=proud,Show me how hot you burn, Yang!
1-female_removed_accessory,direction:down=calm,Eh, the small stuff had to go eventually.
1-female_removed_accessory,direction:down=happy,Good. Now you can't use it to protect yourself.

1-female_removed_accessory,target:april,targetStage:1,direction:down=think,Or are they more calm and collected like Kaze?

1-female_removed_accessory,target:haru,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,Ah, whatever. I'm sure you're nothing like her.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1,direction:down=proud,Name's Rinkah. Nice to meet you, Jenetta.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:mahiru,direction:down=proud,Of course, Mahiru. Hoshido has plenty. They even come with hotsprings!

1-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1,direction:down=sad,I should've brought my club...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:juri,direction:down=shocked,That seems a little... intense.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,Yikes. Someone's trigger happy.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:aimee,alsoPlayingStage:1-7,direction:down=shocked,By the Gods. I'm glad my world's weapons aren't this loud.

1-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,So that's the legendary Mani Katti? Interesting.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:2,direction:down=happy,I wouldn't mind leveling up my supports with you, Lady Lyndis.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:3,direction:down=calm,I wonder how you would look in traditional Flame Tribe wear, Lady Lyndis. Perhaps we should introuduce each other to our tribes.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:5,priority:450,direction:down=angry,Hair down!? I've been cheated!

1-female_removed_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:1,direction:down=think,Hm, you don't seem to be one of Iago's creations. Sorry for judging you so quickly.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1,saidMarker:yoyo,marker:felicia,direction:down=think,Then again, a yoyo could be decently effective. I've seen Felicia do quite a bit of damage with only a plate...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:futaba,direction:down=calm,Megami Tensei? Wasn't the legendary king Chrom part of that story?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2,direction:down=sad,Shame, that was a cool sword. I was gonna ask to borrow it.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3,direction:down=think,Do you <i>have</i> to do what she says? Aren't you the prince?

1-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:4,direction:down=confident,Whatever. I guess it doesn't matter when it comes off.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,Would you happen to know someone by the name of Azura, Nayru?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f,direction:down=proud,Doesn't Nayru remind you a bit of Azura?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:2,direction:down=think,Maybe the two of you <i>are</i>related...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,I've only had to deal with one god, and it was a crazy dragon that could revive the dead and lived in an invisible world under a bridge.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3,direction:down=think,That thing's always looked too big and impractical. Why do you wear it, Palutena?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:4,marker:hinoka,direction:down=calm,Crowns don't make the monarch Peach. Lady Corrin, Lady Hinoka and I don't wear one.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3,direction:down=angry,I feel like that barely counts Revy.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:4,direction:down=angry,Wait, weapons count? Since when!?

1-female_removed_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,I like that passion Sonya, but you do realize that the point of the game is to strip, right?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:3,direction:down=proud,If you ever need help defending your world from invaders, I know an entire army with experience in the field.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:4,direction:down=happy,Hey, you're pretty fit Sonya.

2-male_removed_accessory,direction:down=calm,Yeah, yeah, stall as long as you want. I'll still win this fight.
2-male_removed_accessory,direction:down=calm,Stall all you want, at the end of the night, you'll be naked.
2-male_removed_accessory,direction:down=calm,Eh, whatever. You can't stall forever.
2-male_removed_accessory,direction:down=proud,Well, you might as well get it out of the way now.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,count-corrin_f:0,count-darkstalkers:0,direction:down=calm,In return, I'll help you work out. You seem to struggle a bit when you're using a club.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6,direction:down=happy,But for real, why keep it for so long if you were gonna remove it anyway?
2-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f,direction:down=shocked,What the hell is happening?
2-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:corrin_f,direction:down=shocked,<i>Does that mean the me in his world is a guy?</i>
2-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:sph,direction:down=angry,I'd ask where you're balls are, but I've seen enough to know you don't have any.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:2,direction:down=happy,How would you feel about letting me practice with it for a bit?
2-male_removed_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:2,direction:down=proud,Nice weapon, Jin. It reminds me of Takumi's bow.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,You'd fit in right at home with the Flame Tribe!
2-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2,direction:down=happy,And yet, here you are, able to use nine different types of weapons without a problem!
2-female_removing_accessory,direction:down=happy,Don't worry, ~name~, you still look good without them.
2-female_removing_accessory,direction:down=happy,Nothing you have will make you look better than you would naked.
2-female_removing_accessory,direction:down=happy,Yeah, yeah. Keep getting rid of those pointless accessories.
2-female_removing_accessory,direction:down=happy,Finally getting that out of the way, I see.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:april,targetStage:0,direction:down=calm,Are the ninjas you know serious and gritty like Saizo?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:athena,targetStage:0,direction:down=calm,You must be pretty confident, Athena.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:catria,targetStage:0,direction:down=proud,I better give it my all! This is a rare opportunity, after all!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0,direction:down=think,Video games? What's the difference between that and a regular game?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,direction:down=stretch,I see... Is there only one ultimate per title?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:5,direction:down=angry,Are you serious, Faye!?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,direction:down=calm,If you're that embarrassed, is it really a good idea for you to be playing this game?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:0,direction:down=sad,(<i>This is awkward...</i>)
2-female_removing_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,Your name sounds pretty similar to Hana. She's someone from Hoshido. I guess our worlds might be pretty similar?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:haru,targetStage:0,direction:down=calm,It reminds me a bit of Charlotte, for some reason.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:0,direction:down=shocked,A taguel!? I've only heard stories of those before!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,Ever meet any archers? Or swordsman?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:0,direction:down=proud,Yeah, guess I was right.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,direction:down=think,Quite a few people in my world don't wear pants either. It's weird. Pants are comfortable.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:lucina,targetStage:2,direction:down=proud,In fact, Odin has a tattoo that looks similar to the brand in your eye!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:lucina,targetStage:3,direction:down=proud,Those three are retainers of Nohrian royalty!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0,direction:down=proud,So you're Lyn, princess of the Sacae plains? I suppose we're alot alike then. I'd love to share stories with you sometime.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1,direction:down=proud,Perhaps you would be down for a spar sometime, Lady Lyndis?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:4,priority:450,direction:down=horny,I can't believe it! I get to see the legendary Lady Lyndis'...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:futaba,direction:down=think,Why don't you take off the mask, Ladybug? It's not like it's that good at hiding your face anyway.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena,marker:yoyo,direction:down=shocked,Wait, Palutena, you seriously know somebody who fights with a Yoyo?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0,marker:oboro,direction:down=think,What's with the eyepiece Meia? I can't imagine it helps you see, and Oboro would probably say it's not a fashion thing.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,Is- Is this allowed?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2,direction:down=embarrassed,I may be royalty, but I've never had any of the Flame Tribe members strip me...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:9s_hack1,alsoPlaying:9s,direction:down=calm,Are you okay, 9S? Something seems to be bugging you.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1,direction:down=think,Management? Uh... I didn't know there were rules to how we were supposed to strip.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:vriska,alsoPlayingStage:1-10,direction:down=sad,When did my life get so weird?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:vriska,alsoPlayingStage:1-10,direction:down=sad,Why couldn't this just be a normal game of strip poker?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,Well, hey, if you're gonna remove two things at once, I won't complain.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:3,direction:down=angry,Seriously, why didn't you <i>start</i> with that?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:0,direction:down=calm,It's a bit of a long shot... but...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f,direction:down=think,Hey, Lady Corrin...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1,direction:down=proud,Your ears remind me of Lady Corrin's...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f,direction:down=proud,Her ears are just like yours, Lady Corrin!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:palutena_jerks,direction:down=calm,Don't really know many gods, so I'll have to take your word.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:0,direction:down=think,I get the feeling you and I are talking about very different Flame Tribes.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:0,direction:down=think,I... don't think I've ever seen you around the Flame Tribe...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:1,direction:down=think,What exactly are you the princess of, Rosalina?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:1,direction:down=think,Peach is the princess of the Mushroom Kingdom, Daisy is the princess of Sarasaland, and you're the princess of...?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:rinkahrespond,direction:down=calm,Don't worry, Saki, I'm sure you can handle this.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:sakura,targetStage:0,direction:down=confident,Unless you're like Takumi, and your ego is just <i>that</i> big.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0,direction:down=proud,Alright, Sei, where should we spar? Your place or mine?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:0,direction:down=proud,So, Shantae... I wonder what's in better shape, my abs, or your hips?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,How heavy are they, Shantae? They might help me train.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:1,direction:down=proud,Could I borrow those sometime, Shantae? Weighted clothes are great for training.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:0,direction:down=confident,She's also a black haired ninja with clothing that shows off her... uh...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,After all, I've kicked Kagero's ass plenty of times in this game!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0,direction:down=shocked,Woah!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,Get hit again!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3,direction:down=shocked,You're really not bothered by this, are you?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3,direction:down=shocked,You're not even phased by this, are you?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:syrenne,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,You've even got the arm wraps we do... kind of.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:0,direction:down=shocked,What. The. Fuck?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:0,direction:down=shocked,What, pray tell, the fuck?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:0,direction:down=shocked,WHAT THE FUCK?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,Fuck it. It's not even the weirdest thing I've seen here.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:0,direction:down=proud,Show me how hot you burn, Yang!
2-female_removed_accessory,direction:down=proud,Small things like that get in the way during battle. It makes sense to get rid of them.
2-female_removed_accessory,direction:down=happy,It might've made you look pretty, but it's gone now.
2-female_removed_accessory,direction:down=happy,Little by little, you'll run out of HP.
2-female_removed_accessory,direction:down=happy,Accessories are just as useless here as they are in battle.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:catria,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f,alsoPlayingStage:0-7,count-corrin_m:0,direction:down=angry,You hear that, Catria!? We're gonna give it everything we've got!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:mahiru,count-pit:1,direction:down=proud,Of course, Mahiru. Hoshido has plenty.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1,direction:down=think,So there's a need for armor in your world...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:1,direction:down=proud,Wow, you dropped those pretty casually. You must not care about them that much, Alpha.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:8,direction:down=shocked,Woah. Forgot you had that.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:april,targetStage:1,direction:down=think,Or are they more calm and collected like Kaze?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:athena,targetStage:1,direction:down=proud,That overconfidence will be your undoing!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6,marker:kaden,direction:down=shocked,Animal ears? Just like Kaden's!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6,marker:kaden,direction:down=happy,Hey, are you a Kitsune? Do you know Kaden?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:catria,targetStage:1,direction:down=angry,Ya hear that, Catria! You better give it everything you've got!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,direction:down=stretch,Ver-chew-ul? I see... I have no idea what that is.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2,direction:down=think,Wait, so, if there were two Ultimate Gamers, wouldn't one be better than the other?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:2,direction:down=happy,Wow, those sandles were so small I forgot you were wearing them.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:4,direction:down=shocked,Woah. That choker was so small I didn't even know you were wearing one!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:6,direction:down=angry,I didn't take you for such a <i>coward</i>, Faye.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,So is that a mask, or are you just...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:1,direction:down=sad,...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:2,direction:down=stretch,My world only has a few nations, but, there are lots of small clans and tribes living independently within their borders.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:haru,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,Ah, whatever. I'm sure you're nothing like her.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1,direction:down=proud,Name's Rinkah. Nice to meet you, Jenetta.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:mahiru,direction:down=proud,Of course, Mahiru. Hoshido has plenty. They even come with hotsprings!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:2,direction:down=proud,I wonder if any of them could stand up to the Hoshidan royals?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1,direction:down=sad,I should've brought my club...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:juri,direction:down=shocked,That seems a little... intense.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,Yikes. Someone's trigger happy.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:aimee,alsoPlayingStage:1-7,direction:down=shocked,By the Gods. I'm glad my world's weapons aren't this loud.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2,direction:down=shocked,...What?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:lucina,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,What? There wasn't anything about this in the legends!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:lucina,targetStage:3,direction:down=flex,Are you two from the same family, or something?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:lucina,targetStage:3,direction:down=flex,Are you two related, or something?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:lucina,targetStage:4,direction:down=confident,You wouldn't happen to know either Arthur or Effie, would you?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,So that's the legendary Mani Katti? Interesting.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:2,direction:down=happy,I wouldn't mind leveling up my supports with you, Lady Lyndis.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:3,direction:down=calm,I wonder how you would look in traditional Flame Tribe wear, Lady Lyndis. Perhaps we should introuduce each other to our tribes.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:5,priority:450,direction:down=angry,Hair down!? I've been cheated!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:5,priority:450,direction:down=sad,Hair down!? Damnit!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:maki,targetStage:2,direction:down=calm,Never really understood the point of bringing weapons to these sort of games.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:1,direction:down=think,Hm, you don't seem to be one of Iago's creations. Sorry for judging you so quickly.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1,saidMarker:yoyo,marker:felicia,direction:down=think,Then again, a yoyo could be decently effective. I've seen Felicia do quite a bit of damage with only a plate...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:futaba,direction:down=calm,Megami Tensei? Wasn't the legendary king Chrom part of that story?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2,direction:down=sad,Shame, that was a cool sword. I was gonna ask to borrow it.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3,direction:down=think,Do you <i>have</i> to do what she says? Aren't you the prince?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:3,direction:down=shocked,The hell? Where'd your blazer go?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3,direction:down=think,I'm very lost right now.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:3,direction:down=proud,If ya get cold Nagisa, I could always help warm you up!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,direction:down=proud,Maybe you're braver than I gave you credit for, Natsuki.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:4,direction:down=confident,Whatever. I guess it doesn't matter when it comes off.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,Would you happen to know someone by the name of Azura, Nayru?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f,direction:down=proud,Doesn't Nayru remind you a bit of Azura?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:2,direction:down=think,Maybe the two of you <i>are</i>related...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,I've only had to deal with one god, and it was a crazy dragon that could revive the dead and lived in an invisible world under a bridge.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3,direction:down=think,That thing's always looked too big and impractical. Why do you wear it, Palutena?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:4,marker:hinoka,direction:down=calm,Crowns don't make the monarch Peach. Lady Corrin, Lady Hinoka and I don't wear one.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3,direction:down=angry,I feel like that barely counts Revy.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:4,direction:down=angry,Wait, weapons count? Since when!?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:rinkahrespond,direction:down=calm,Don't sweat it, Saki, everything will be just fine.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sakura,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,Though, I don't really get that vibe from you.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,I've heard a lot of good things about Va-11 Hall-a. Would you care to join me for a drink there sometime, Sei?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,I'm good for either!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3,direction:down=shocked,By the gods woman! How much alcohol do you have?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:1,direction:down=tsundere,Um. Never mind. Forget I said anything.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:2,direction:down=proud,So, if you wanna compete with her, you better bring your best!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,Are you okay, Shimakaze?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1,marker:sakura,direction:down=shocked,Seriously, are you okay, Shimakaze, should I go get Sakura?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4,direction:down=embarrassed,Is this normal for you, Shimakaze?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,I like that passion Sonya, but you do realize that the point of the game is to strip, right?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:3,direction:down=proud,If you ever need help defending your world from invaders, I know an entire army with experience in the field.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:4,direction:down=happy,Hey, you're pretty fit Sonya.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:syrenne,targetStage:2,direction:down=proud,Maybe I should invite you to train with us sometime!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,marker:noteventheweirdestthingtohappentoday,direction:down=shocked,No seriously, what the fuck just happened?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,marker:noteventheweirdestthingtohappentoday,direction:down=shocked,Please tell me we aren't going to just ignore that!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,direction:down=sad,I still think this is going against the spirit of the game.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:1,marker:oboro,direction:down=calm,Pretty fancy hat you got there Zizou. I bet Oboro would love to design a line based off of it.

3-male_removing_accessory,direction:down=calm,I'll let you get away with that this time, just because I've finished getting rid of all of my accessories.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0,count-corrin_f:0,count-darkstalkers:0,direction:down=proud,How about you teach me how to use claws or arms?

3-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5,direction:down=calm,Huh, didn't think you'd actually be taking that off.

3-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1,direction:down=proud,That's a neat sword you got there, Jin.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:0,direction:down=proud,Between the wraps on your body, the lack of a shirt, and the muscles...
3-male_removing_accessory,target:lucina,targetStage:0,direction:down=think,Actually, I don't remember any of the history books saying you wore a mask...
3-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,direction:down=think,Most people in my world are able to use three at most, but they never really master any of them...
3-male_removing_accessory,target:ryu,targetStage:0,direction:down=proud,So this is the legendary Ryu? I'd love a sparring match after this is over.
3-male_removed_accessory,direction:down=calm,Yeah, whatever, those toys aren't gonna last forever.
3-male_removed_accessory,direction:down=angry,Whatever, it was bound to go eventually.
3-male_removed_accessory,direction:down=happy,You can't stall forever.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,count-corrin_f:0,count-darkstalkers:0,direction:down=calm,In return, I'll help you work out. You seem to struggle a bit when you're using a club.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6,direction:down=happy,But for real, why keep it for so long if you were gonna remove it anyway?
3-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f,direction:down=shocked,What the hell is happening?

3-male_removed_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:2,direction:down=proud,Nice weapon, Jin. It reminds me of Takumi's bow.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,You'd fit in right at home with the Flame Tribe!
3-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2,direction:down=happy,And yet, here you are, able to use nine different types of weapons without a problem!
3-female_removing_accessory,direction:down=calm,I remember that Corrin would often give us some rather... odd accessories from time to time. Perhaps having a few of them would have been a good idea.
3-female_removing_accessory,direction:down=calm,Corrin's given pretty much everyone in her castle some kind of accessory. Some are... weirder than others.
3-female_removing_accessory,alsoPlaying:corrin_f,direction:down=calm,Perhaps I should have brought some of those accessories you tend to give out Corrin...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:april,targetStage:0,direction:down=calm,Are the ninjas you know serious and gritty like Saizo?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:athena,targetStage:0,direction:down=calm,You must be pretty confident, Athena.

3-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,direction:down=calm,If you're that embarrassed, is it really a good idea for you to be playing this game?

3-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,direction:down=think,Quite a few people in my world don't wear pants either. It's weird. Pants are comfortable.

4-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:mahiru,count-pit:1,direction:down=proud,Of course, Mahiru. Hoshido has plenty.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1,direction:down=think,So there's a need for armor in your world...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:1,direction:down=proud,Wow, you dropped those pretty casually. You must not care about them that much, Alpha.

4-female_removed_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,So is that a mask, or are you just...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:1,direction:down=sad,...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:2,direction:down=stretch,My world only has a few nations, but, there are lots of small clans and tribes living independently within their borders.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:haru,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,Ah, whatever. I'm sure you're nothing like her.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1,direction:down=proud,Name's Rinkah. Nice to meet you, Jenetta.

4-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:2,direction:down=proud,I wonder if any of them could stand up to the Hoshidan royals?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:juri,direction:down=shocked,That seems a little... intense.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,Yikes. Someone's trigger happy.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:aimee,alsoPlayingStage:1-7,direction:down=shocked,By the Gods. I'm glad my world's weapons aren't this loud.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2,direction:down=shocked,...What?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:lucina,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,What? There wasn't anything about this in the legends!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:lucina,targetStage:3,direction:down=flex,Are you two from the same family, or something?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:lucina,targetStage:3,direction:down=flex,Are you two related, or something?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:lucina,targetStage:4,direction:down=confident,You wouldn't happen to know either Arthur or Effie, would you?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,So that's the legendary Mani Katti? Interesting.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:2,direction:down=happy,I wouldn't mind leveling up my supports with you, Lady Lyndis.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:3,direction:down=calm,I wonder how you would look in traditional Flame Tribe wear, Lady Lyndis. Perhaps we should introuduce each other to our tribes.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:5,priority:450,direction:down=angry,Hair down!? I've been cheated!

4-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1,saidMarker:yoyo,marker:felicia,direction:down=think,Then again, a yoyo could be decently effective. I've seen Felicia do quite a bit of damage with only a plate...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:futaba,direction:down=calm,Megami Tensei? Wasn't the legendary king Chrom part of that story?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2,direction:down=sad,Shame, that was a cool sword. I was gonna ask to borrow it.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3,direction:down=think,Do you <i>have</i> to do what she says? Aren't you the prince?

4-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,Would you happen to know someone by the name of Azura, Nayru?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f,direction:down=proud,Doesn't Nayru remind you a bit of Azura?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:2,direction:down=think,Maybe the two of you <i>are</i>related...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,I've only had to deal with one god, and it was a crazy dragon that could revive the dead and lived in an invisible world under a bridge.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3,direction:down=think,That thing's always looked too big and impractical. Why do you wear it, Palutena?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:4,marker:hinoka,direction:down=calm,Crowns don't make the monarch Peach. Lady Corrin, Lady Hinoka and I don't wear one.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3,direction:down=angry,I feel like that barely counts Revy.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:4,direction:down=angry,Wait, weapons count? Since when!?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:rinkahrespond,direction:down=calm,Don't sweat it, Saki, everything will be just fine.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sakura,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,Though, I don't really get that vibe from you.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,I've heard a lot of good things about Va-11 Hall-a. Would you care to join me for a drink there sometime, Sei?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,I'm good for either!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3,direction:down=shocked,By the gods woman! How much alcohol do you have?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:1,direction:down=tsundere,Um. Never mind. Forget I said anything.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:2,direction:down=proud,So, if you wanna compete with her, you better bring your best!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,Are you okay, Shimakaze?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1,marker:sakura,direction:down=shocked,Seriously, are you okay, Shimakaze, should I go get Sakura?

4-female_removed_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,I like that passion Sonya, but you do realize that the point of the game is to strip, right?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:3,direction:down=proud,If you ever need help defending your world from invaders, I know an entire army with experience in the field.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:4,direction:down=happy,Hey, you're pretty fit Sonya.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:syrenne,targetStage:2,direction:down=proud,Maybe I should invite you to train with us sometime!

4-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,marker:noteventheweirdestthingtohappentoday,direction:down=shocked,Please tell me we aren't going to just ignore that!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,direction:down=sad,I still think this is going against the spirit of the game.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:1,marker:oboro,direction:down=calm,Pretty fancy hat you got there Zizou. I bet Oboro would love to design a line based off of it.

5-male_removing_accessory,target:lucina,targetStage:0,direction:down=think,Actually, I don't remember any of the history books saying you wore a mask...
5-male_removed_accessory,direction:down=angry,To take off such trivial things while the princess of the Flame Tribe is standing in front of you? Pathetic.
5-male_removed_accessory,direction:down=angry,Do you <i>want</i> me to fight you?
5-male_removed_accessory,direction:down=butt,Whatever. It's nothing worth watching.
5-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6,direction:down=happy,But for real, why keep it for so long if you were gonna remove it anyway?
5-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f,direction:down=shocked,What the hell is happening?
5-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:corrin_f,direction:down=shocked,<i>Does that mean the me in his world is a guy?</i>
5-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:sph,direction:down=angry,I'd ask where you're balls are, but I've seen enough to know you don't have any.
5-male_removed_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:2,direction:down=happy,How would you feel about letting me practice with it for a bit?
5-male_removed_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:2,direction:down=proud,Nice weapon, Jin. It reminds me of Takumi's bow.
5-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,You'd fit in right at home with the Flame Tribe!
5-female_removing_accessory,direction:down=angry,Come on! Aren't you taking this seriously!?
5-female_removing_accessory,direction:down=angry,Are you trying to make me mad?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:april,targetStage:0,direction:down=calm,Are the ninjas you know serious and gritty like Saizo?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:athena,targetStage:0,direction:down=sad,Of course, given how badly I'm doing, I guess I can't really tease you.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:catria,targetStage:0,direction:down=proud,I better give it my all! This is a rare opportunity, after all!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0,direction:down=think,Video games? What's the difference between that and a regular game?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,direction:down=stretch,I see... Is there only one ultimate per title?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:5,direction:down=angry,Are you serious, Faye!?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:0,direction:down=sad,(<i>This is awkward...</i>)
5-female_removing_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,Your name sounds pretty similar to Hana. She's someone from Hoshido. I guess our worlds might be pretty similar?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:haru,targetStage:0,direction:down=calm,It reminds me a bit of Charlotte, for some reason.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:0,direction:down=shocked,A taguel!? I've only heard stories of those before!

5-female_removing_accessory,target:lucina,targetStage:2,direction:down=proud,In fact, Odin has a tattoo that looks similar to the brand in your eye!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:lucina,targetStage:3,direction:down=proud,Those three are retainers of Nohrian royalty!

5-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:futaba,direction:down=think,Why don't you take off the mask, Ladybug? It's not like it's that good at hiding your face anyway.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena,marker:yoyo,direction:down=shocked,Wait, Palutena, you seriously know somebody who fights with a Yoyo?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0,marker:oboro,direction:down=think,What's with the eyepiece Meia? I can't imagine it helps you see, and Oboro would probably say it's not a fashion thing.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,Is- Is this allowed?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2,direction:down=embarrassed,I may be royalty, but I've never had any of the Flame Tribe members strip me...

5-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,Well, hey, if you're gonna remove two things at once, I won't complain.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:3,direction:down=angry,Seriously, why didn't you <i>start</i> with that?

-1-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,Would you happen to know someone by the name of Azura, Nayru?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f,direction:down=proud,Doesn't Nayru remind you a bit of Azura?

-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:4,direction:down=happy,Hey, you're pretty fit Sonya.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:syrenne,targetStage:2,direction:down=proud,Maybe I should invite you to train with us sometime!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,marker:noteventheweirdestthingtohappentoday,direction:down=shocked,No seriously, what the fuck just happened?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,marker:noteventheweirdestthingtohappentoday,direction:down=shocked,Please tell me we aren't going to just ignore that!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,direction:down=sad,I still think this is going against the spirit of the game.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:1,marker:oboro,direction:down=calm,Pretty fancy hat you got there Zizou. I bet Oboro would love to design a line based off of it.

0-female_removing_minor,target:catria,targetStage:1,direction:down=proud,I guess somethings stay the same no matter what the time is.
0-female_removing_minor,target:catria,targetStage:2,direction:down=proud,I always found it weird that Pegasus Knights wore such fancy boots.
0-female_removing_minor,target:catria,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,Well, it's not like Pegasus Knights are known for their defense anyway.
0-female_removing_minor,target:chica,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,I'm curious as to what you have left to take off Chica...

0-female_removing_minor,target:lucina,targetStage:1,direction:down=stretch,Let's see... It was one of those people from Nohr, I think...
0-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,direction:down=sad,Ah, I once hated Nohrian's, but thanks to Lady Corrin, I was able to realize that I was blinded by prejudice. I guess we're pretty similar.

0-female_removing_minor,target:sakura,targetStage:3,direction:down=shocked,I... uh... assumed, since she's the only necromancer I know...
0-female_removing_minor,target:sharla,targetStage:1,direction:down=proud,So you're Sharla huh? I must say some of the things I've seen from your world are very interesting. I'm very intrigued by the things you call "gems".

0-female_removed_minor,target:catria,targetStage:2,direction:down=happy,Well, I still prefer the Hoshidan outfit. Red is a much better color.
0-female_removed_minor,target:catria,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,You guys spend so much time in the air, after all. Why not go for something lighter?
0-female_removed_minor,target:catria,targetStage:4,direction:down=horny,It was only a matter of time before that armor was out of the way.

0-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,direction:down=shocked,I don't think it's a good idea to volunteer Futaba. She's crazy.
0-female_removed_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:3,direction:down=angry,Three if you count the hood!
0-female_removed_minor,target:haru,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,But, really, she's dominating and a killer with an axe on the battlefield. Nothing like you, Haru.
0-female_removed_minor,target:haru,targetStage:3,direction:down=proud,As princess of the Flame Tribe, things like sweaters have never been of use to me.

0-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,direction:down=think,What's that armor made of Meia? I wonder if it'd be good for battles in my world.
0-female_removed_minor,target:miko,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,Who is this? Why doesn't she have legs? Why is she stripping you? <i>I have so many questions.</i>
0-female_removed_minor,target:moon,targetStage:5,direction:down=calm,Ya know, you don't <i>have</i> to remove your hat, Moon. I'm keeping my mask on, just because it's Flame Tribe tradition.

0-female_removed_minor,target:rainbow_mika,direction:down=shocked,Well... I guess that's one way to play the game...
0-female_removed_minor,target:sakura,targetStage:2,direction:down=flex,Alright then! Sakura, you better give it your all!
0-female_removed_minor,target:sakura,targetStage:3,direction:down=sad,Oh. Uh... You wouldn't happen to be one of Rhajat's experiments, would you?
0-female_removed_minor,target:sakura,targetStage:4,direction:down=embarrassed,But, I guess that it was probably insensitive...
0-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,direction:down=think,That much alcohol CANNOT be good for your poker skills, Sei.
0-female_removed_minor,target:sheena,targetStage:3,direction:down=confident,So, keep up the work. Kagero's still a better opponent then you are!
0-female_removed_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3,direction:down=shocked,H-how are you so nonchalant about this!?
0-female_removed_minor,target:sonya,targetStage:6,direction:down=happy,Nice warpaint. Not as good as the Flame Tribe's though.

1-female_removing_minor,target:catria,targetStage:1,direction:down=proud,I guess somethings stay the same no matter what the time is.

1-female_removing_minor,target:catria,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,Well, it's not like Pegasus Knights are known for their defense anyway.
1-female_removing_minor,target:chica,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,I'm curious as to what you have left to take off Chica...

1-female_removing_minor,target:sakura,targetStage:2,direction:down=shocked,Wait. What the?
1-female_removing_minor,target:sakura,targetStage:3,direction:down=shocked,I... uh... assumed, since she's the only necromancer I know...
1-female_removing_minor,target:sharla,targetStage:1,direction:down=proud,So you're Sharla huh? I must say some of the things I've seen from your world are very interesting. I'm very intrigued by the things you call "gems".
1-female_removing_minor,target:sheena,targetStage:2,direction:down=proud,I guess you've gotta work a little harder if you want to live up to my standards.
1-female_removing_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2,direction:down=shocked,Yep! Happening again!
1-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:catria,alsoPlayingStage:0-7,count-corrin_m:0,direction:down=sad,Alright, I'm lost.
1-female_removed_minor,target:aella,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,Now that I look at you, you are pretty tall, Aella. Care for a spar later?
1-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2,direction:down=angry,I feel like there has got to be a quieter way of doing that.
1-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3,direction:down=angry,If I suffer permanent ear damage because of this... So help me gods...
1-female_removed_minor,target:ami,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,You're certainly very chipper, Ami. Most people are a little upset when they've lost so much.
1-female_removed_minor,target:april,targetStage:2,direction:down=think,It wouldn't be the first time that a long lost Hoshidan royal would show up out of nowhere...
1-female_removed_minor,target:black_canary,targetStage:6,direction:down=think,That's an... interesting choice of underwear, Canary.
1-female_removed_minor,target:catria,targetStage:2,direction:down=happy,Well, I still prefer the Hoshidan outfit. Red is a much better color.
1-female_removed_minor,target:catria,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,You guys spend so much time in the air, after all. Why not go for something lighter?
1-female_removed_minor,target:catria,targetStage:4,direction:down=horny,It was only a matter of time before that armor was out of the way.
1-female_removed_minor,target:chica,targetStage:2,direction:down=shocked,What... THE FUCK!?
1-female_removed_minor,target:chica,targetStage:3,direction:down=shocked,There's really never a dull moment around here, is there?
1-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,Cool necklace, Lady Corrin. Where'd ya get it?
1-female_removed_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2,direction:down=happy,Well, you weren't really wearing it in a way that covered anything, so I'm sure it's fine.
1-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,As princess of the Flame Tribe, I've never needed to wear a jacket.
1-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,direction:down=shocked,I don't think it's a good idea to volunteer Futaba. She's crazy.
1-female_removed_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:3,direction:down=angry,Three if you count the hood!
1-female_removed_minor,target:haru,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,But, really, she's dominating and a killer with an axe on the battlefield. Nothing like you, Haru.
1-female_removed_minor,target:haru,targetStage:3,direction:down=proud,As princess of the Flame Tribe, things like sweaters have never been of use to me.
1-female_removed_minor,target:juri,targetStage:2,direction:down=proud,I hope you don't let me down again, Juri.
1-female_removed_minor,target:juri,targetStage:2,direction:down=proud,Try not to disappoint me again, Juri.
1-female_removed_minor,target:juri,targetStage:2,direction:down=proud,Alright, Juri, let's see what you've got this time!
1-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6,direction:down=sad,...
1-female_removed_minor,target:lucina,targetStage:2,direction:down=think,I think it was... Some guy who kept trying to hit on me... Laslow?
1-female_removed_minor,target:lucina,targetStage:2,direction:down=think,I think it was... some bratty redhead... What was her name? Selena?
1-female_removed_minor,target:lucina,targetStage:2,direction:down=think,What was his name? The guy who was always shouting... Odin?
1-female_removed_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:4,direction:down=happy,That's a cute shirt. Reminds me of Hoshido.
1-female_removed_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:4,marker:oboro,direction:down=happy,That's a cute shirt. I think Oboro would like it.
1-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,direction:down=think,What's that armor made of Meia? I wonder if it'd be good for battles in my world.
1-female_removed_minor,target:miko,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,Who is this? Why doesn't she have legs? Why is she stripping you? <i>I have so many questions.</i>
1-female_removed_minor,target:moon,targetStage:5,direction:down=calm,Ya know, you don't <i>have</i> to remove your hat, Moon. I'm keeping my mask on, just because it's Flame Tribe tradition.
1-female_removed_minor,target:nagisa,targetStage:2,direction:down=happy,You're handling better than I thought you would, Nagisa.
1-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2,direction:down=angry,You better not drag this out, ya hear, Natsuki?
1-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:3,direction:down=angry,You better not have <i>another</i> shirt on under there.
1-female_removed_minor,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,Shouldn'tve brought them to this game if you didn't want them to get dirty Nugi.
1-female_removed_minor,target:rainbow_mika,direction:down=shocked,Well... I guess that's one way to play the game...
1-female_removed_minor,target:sakura,targetStage:2,direction:down=flex,Alright then! Sakura, you better give it your all!
1-female_removed_minor,target:sakura,targetStage:3,direction:down=sad,Oh. Uh... You wouldn't happen to be one of Rhajat's experiments, would you?
1-female_removed_minor,target:sakura,targetStage:4,direction:down=embarrassed,But, I guess that it was probably insensitive...
1-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,direction:down=think,That much alcohol CANNOT be good for your poker skills, Sei.
1-female_removed_minor,target:sheena,targetStage:3,direction:down=confident,So, keep up the work. Kagero's still a better opponent then you are!
1-female_removed_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3,direction:down=shocked,H-how are you so nonchalant about this!?
1-female_removed_minor,target:sonya,targetStage:6,direction:down=happy,Nice warpaint. Not as good as the Flame Tribe's though.

3-female_removing_minor,target:haru,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,Ha! Out of small stuff already?
3-female_removing_minor,target:juri,targetStage:1,direction:down=think,Ah, well, I guess they did have to go sooner or later.
3-female_removing_minor,target:juri,targetStage:1,direction:down=sad,I guess you had to get rid of it eventually...
3-female_removing_minor,target:juri,targetStage:1,direction:down=sad,And you had such a strong start too...
3-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:5,direction:down=shocked,Dear god. As Princess of the Flame Tribe, I understand how dangerous fire can be. I'm sorry to hear this.

3-female_removing_minor,target:sakura,targetStage:2,direction:down=shocked,Wait. What the?
3-female_removing_minor,target:sakura,targetStage:3,direction:down=shocked,I... uh... assumed, since she's the only necromancer I know...
3-female_removing_minor,target:sharla,targetStage:1,direction:down=proud,So you're Sharla huh? I must say some of the things I've seen from your world are very interesting. I'm very intrigued by the things you call "gems".
3-female_removing_minor,target:sheena,targetStage:2,direction:down=proud,I guess you've gotta work a little harder if you want to live up to my standards.

3-female_removed_minor,target:ami,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,You're certainly very chipper, Ami. Most people are a little upset when they've lost so much.
3-female_removed_minor,target:april,targetStage:2,direction:down=think,It wouldn't be the first time that a long lost Hoshidan royal would show up out of nowhere...
3-female_removed_minor,target:black_canary,targetStage:6,direction:down=think,That's an... interesting choice of underwear, Canary.
3-female_removed_minor,target:catria,targetStage:2,direction:down=happy,Well, I still prefer the Hoshidan outfit. Red is a much better color.
3-female_removed_minor,target:catria,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,You guys spend so much time in the air, after all. Why not go for something lighter?
3-female_removed_minor,target:catria,targetStage:4,direction:down=horny,It was only a matter of time before that armor was out of the way.
3-female_removed_minor,target:chica,targetStage:2,direction:down=shocked,What... THE FUCK!?
3-female_removed_minor,target:chica,targetStage:3,direction:down=shocked,There's really never a dull moment around here, is there?
3-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,Cool necklace, Lady Corrin. Where'd ya get it?
3-female_removed_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2,direction:down=happy,Well, you weren't really wearing it in a way that covered anything, so I'm sure it's fine.
3-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,As princess of the Flame Tribe, I've never needed to wear a jacket.
3-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,direction:down=shocked,I don't think it's a good idea to volunteer Futaba. She's crazy.
3-female_removed_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:3,direction:down=angry,Three if you count the hood!
3-female_removed_minor,target:haru,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,But, really, she's dominating and a killer with an axe on the battlefield. Nothing like you, Haru.

3-female_removed_minor,target:lucina,targetStage:2,direction:down=think,What was his name? The guy who was always shouting... Odin?
3-female_removed_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:4,direction:down=happy,That's a cute shirt. Reminds me of Hoshido.
3-female_removed_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:4,marker:oboro,direction:down=happy,That's a cute shirt. I think Oboro would like it.
3-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,direction:down=think,What's that armor made of Meia? I wonder if it'd be good for battles in my world.
3-female_removed_minor,target:miko,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,Who is this? Why doesn't she have legs? Why is she stripping you? <i>I have so many questions.</i>
3-female_removed_minor,target:moon,targetStage:5,direction:down=calm,Ya know, you don't <i>have</i> to remove your hat, Moon. I'm keeping my mask on, just because it's Flame Tribe tradition.
3-female_removed_minor,target:nagisa,targetStage:2,direction:down=happy,You're handling better than I thought you would, Nagisa.
3-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2,direction:down=angry,You better not drag this out, ya hear, Natsuki?

3-female_removed_minor,target:rainbow_mika,direction:down=shocked,Well... I guess that's one way to play the game...
3-female_removed_minor,target:sakura,targetStage:2,direction:down=flex,Alright then! Sakura, you better give it your all!
3-female_removed_minor,target:sakura,targetStage:3,direction:down=sad,Oh. Uh... You wouldn't happen to be one of Rhajat's experiments, would you?
3-female_removed_minor,target:sakura,targetStage:4,direction:down=embarrassed,But, I guess that it was probably insensitive...
3-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,direction:down=think,That much alcohol CANNOT be good for your poker skills, Sei.
3-female_removed_minor,target:sheena,targetStage:3,direction:down=confident,So, keep up the work. Kagero's still a better opponent then you are!
3-female_removed_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3,direction:down=shocked,H-how are you so nonchalant about this!?
3-female_removed_minor,target:sonya,targetStage:6,direction:down=happy,Nice warpaint. Not as good as the Flame Tribe's though.

5-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:socks,direction:down=calm,I kind of doubt that, Kyu.
5-female_removing_minor,target:lucina,targetStage:1,direction:down=stretch,Let's see... It was one of those people from Nohr, I think...
5-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,direction:down=sad,Ah, I once hated Nohrian's, but thanks to Lady Corrin, I was able to realize that I was blinded by prejudice. I guess we're pretty similar.
5-female_removing_minor,target:miko,targetStage:0,direction:down=proud,Well, you sure look different from prince Ryoma.
5-female_removing_minor,target:miko,targetStage:0,direction:down=proud,Well, you sure look different from prince Takumi.
5-female_removing_minor,target:monika,targetStage:1,direction:down=think,You seem to be really interested in them.
5-female_removing_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,direction:down=angry,Oh goddamnit, you have another shirt under there?
5-female_removing_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2,direction:down=angry,Yes they are, is there a point to all of this?
5-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:1,marker:oboro,direction:down=think,Oboro told me something about socks and sandals, but I can't remember if it was good or not.
5-female_removing_minor,target:pyrrha,targetStage:0,direction:down=calm,Do you do a lot of fighting in your world?
5-female_removing_minor,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0,direction:down=shocked,...
5-female_removing_minor,target:sakura,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,Hey, is that war paint on you? Maybe you're not like the Sakura I know after all!
5-female_removing_minor,target:sakura,targetStage:2,direction:down=shocked,Wait. What the?
5-female_removing_minor,target:sakura,targetStage:3,direction:down=shocked,I... uh... assumed, since she's the only necromancer I know...
5-female_removing_minor,target:sheena,targetStage:2,direction:down=proud,I guess you've gotta work a little harder if you want to live up to my standards.
5-female_removing_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2,direction:down=shocked,Yep! Happening again!
5-female_removed_minor,direction:down=angry,Feh, you can do better.
5-female_removed_minor,direction:down=angry,Weak!
5-female_removed_minor,direction:down=angry,Is that seriously the best you can do?
5-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:catria,alsoPlayingStage:0-7,count-corrin_m:0,direction:down=sad,Alright, I'm lost.
5-female_removed_minor,target:aella,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,Now that I look at you, you are pretty tall, Aella. Care for a spar later?
5-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2,direction:down=angry,I feel like there has got to be a quieter way of doing that.
5-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3,direction:down=angry,If I suffer permanent ear damage because of this... So help me gods...
5-female_removed_minor,target:ami,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,You're certainly very chipper, Ami. Most people are a little upset when they've lost so much.
5-female_removed_minor,target:april,targetStage:2,direction:down=think,It wouldn't be the first time that a long lost Hoshidan royal would show up out of nowhere...
5-female_removed_minor,target:black_canary,targetStage:6,direction:down=think,That's an... interesting choice of underwear, Canary.
5-female_removed_minor,target:catria,targetStage:2,direction:down=happy,Well, I still prefer the Hoshidan outfit. Red is a much better color.
5-female_removed_minor,target:catria,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,You guys spend so much time in the air, after all. Why not go for something lighter?
5-female_removed_minor,target:catria,targetStage:4,direction:down=horny,It was only a matter of time before that armor was out of the way.
5-female_removed_minor,target:chica,targetStage:2,direction:down=shocked,What... THE FUCK!?
5-female_removed_minor,target:chica,targetStage:3,direction:down=shocked,There's really never a dull moment around here, is there?
5-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,Cool necklace, Lady Corrin. Where'd ya get it?
5-female_removed_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2,direction:down=happy,Well, you weren't really wearing it in a way that covered anything, so I'm sure it's fine.
5-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,As princess of the Flame Tribe, I've never needed to wear a jacket.
5-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,direction:down=shocked,I don't think it's a good idea to volunteer Futaba. She's crazy.
5-female_removed_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:3,direction:down=angry,Three if you count the hood!
5-female_removed_minor,target:haru,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,But, really, she's dominating and a killer with an axe on the battlefield. Nothing like you, Haru.
5-female_removed_minor,target:haru,targetStage:3,direction:down=proud,As princess of the Flame Tribe, things like sweaters have never been of use to me.
5-female_removed_minor,target:juri,targetStage:2,direction:down=proud,I hope you don't let me down again, Juri.
5-female_removed_minor,target:juri,targetStage:2,direction:down=proud,Try not to disappoint me again, Juri.
5-female_removed_minor,target:juri,targetStage:2,direction:down=proud,Alright, Juri, let's see what you've got this time!
5-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6,direction:down=sad,...
5-female_removed_minor,target:lucina,targetStage:2,direction:down=think,I think it was... Some guy who kept trying to hit on me... Laslow?
5-female_removed_minor,target:lucina,targetStage:2,direction:down=think,I think it was... some bratty redhead... What was her name? Selena?
5-female_removed_minor,target:lucina,targetStage:2,direction:down=think,What was his name? The guy who was always shouting... Odin?
5-female_removed_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:4,direction:down=happy,That's a cute shirt. Reminds me of Hoshido.
5-female_removed_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:4,marker:oboro,direction:down=happy,That's a cute shirt. I think Oboro would like it.
5-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,direction:down=think,What's that armor made of Meia? I wonder if it'd be good for battles in my world.
5-female_removed_minor,target:miko,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,Who is this? Why doesn't she have legs? Why is she stripping you? <i>I have so many questions.</i>
5-female_removed_minor,target:moon,targetStage:5,direction:down=calm,Ya know, you don't <i>have</i> to remove your hat, Moon. I'm keeping my mask on, just because it's Flame Tribe tradition.
5-female_removed_minor,target:nagisa,targetStage:2,direction:down=happy,You're handling better than I thought you would, Nagisa.
5-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2,direction:down=angry,You better not drag this out, ya hear, Natsuki?
5-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:3,direction:down=angry,You better not have <i>another</i> shirt on under there.
5-female_removed_minor,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,Shouldn'tve brought them to this game if you didn't want them to get dirty Nugi.
5-female_removed_minor,target:rainbow_mika,direction:down=shocked,Well... I guess that's one way to play the game...
5-female_removed_minor,target:sakura,targetStage:2,direction:down=flex,Alright then! Sakura, you better give it your all!
5-female_removed_minor,target:sakura,targetStage:3,direction:down=sad,Oh. Uh... You wouldn't happen to be one of Rhajat's experiments, would you?
5-female_removed_minor,target:sakura,targetStage:4,direction:down=embarrassed,But, I guess that it was probably insensitive...
5-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,direction:down=think,That much alcohol CANNOT be good for your poker skills, Sei.
5-female_removed_minor,target:sheena,targetStage:3,direction:down=confident,So, keep up the work. Kagero's still a better opponent then you are!
5-female_removed_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3,direction:down=shocked,H-how are you so nonchalant about this!?
5-female_removed_minor,target:sonya,targetStage:6,direction:down=happy,Nice warpaint. Not as good as the Flame Tribe's though.

-2-female_removing_minor,target:sheena,targetStage:2,direction:down=proud,I guess you've gotta work a little harder if you want to live up to my standards.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2,direction:down=shocked,Yep! Happening again!
-2-female_removed_minor,direction:down=embarrassed,If Hinoka and the others saw me now...
-2-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:catria,alsoPlayingStage:0-7,count-corrin_m:0,direction:down=sad,Alright, I'm lost.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:aella,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,Now that I look at you, you are pretty tall, Aella. Care for a spar later?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2,direction:down=angry,I feel like there has got to be a quieter way of doing that.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3,direction:down=angry,If I suffer permanent ear damage because of this... So help me gods...
-2-female_removed_minor,target:ami,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,You're certainly very chipper, Ami. Most people are a little upset when they've lost so much.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:april,targetStage:2,direction:down=think,It wouldn't be the first time that a long lost Hoshidan royal would show up out of nowhere...
-2-female_removed_minor,target:black_canary,targetStage:6,direction:down=think,That's an... interesting choice of underwear, Canary.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:catria,targetStage:2,direction:down=happy,Well, I still prefer the Hoshidan outfit. Red is a much better color.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:catria,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,You guys spend so much time in the air, after all. Why not go for something lighter?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:catria,targetStage:4,direction:down=horny,It was only a matter of time before that armor was out of the way.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,Cool necklace, Lady Corrin. Where'd ya get it?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2,direction:down=happy,Well, you weren't really wearing it in a way that covered anything, so I'm sure it's fine.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,As princess of the Flame Tribe, I've never needed to wear a jacket.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,direction:down=shocked,I don't think it's a good idea to volunteer Futaba. She's crazy.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:3,direction:down=angry,Three if you count the hood!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:haru,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,But, really, she's dominating and a killer with an axe on the battlefield. Nothing like you, Haru.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:haru,targetStage:3,direction:down=proud,As princess of the Flame Tribe, things like sweaters have never been of use to me.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:juri,targetStage:2,direction:down=proud,I hope you don't let me down again, Juri.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:juri,targetStage:2,direction:down=proud,Try not to disappoint me again, Juri.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:juri,targetStage:2,direction:down=proud,Alright, Juri, let's see what you've got this time!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:lucina,targetStage:2,direction:down=think,I think it was... Some guy who kept trying to hit on me... Laslow?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:lucina,targetStage:2,direction:down=think,I think it was... some bratty redhead... What was her name? Selena?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:lucina,targetStage:2,direction:down=think,What was his name? The guy who was always shouting... Odin?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:4,direction:down=happy,That's a cute shirt. Reminds me of Hoshido.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:4,marker:oboro,direction:down=happy,That's a cute shirt. I think Oboro would like it.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,direction:down=think,What's that armor made of Meia? I wonder if it'd be good for battles in my world.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:miko,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,Who is this? Why doesn't she have legs? Why is she stripping you? <i>I have so many questions.</i>
-2-female_removed_minor,target:moon,targetStage:5,direction:down=calm,Ya know, you don't <i>have</i> to remove your hat, Moon. I'm keeping my mask on, just because it's Flame Tribe tradition.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:nagisa,targetStage:2,direction:down=happy,You're handling better than I thought you would, Nagisa.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2,direction:down=angry,You better not drag this out, ya hear, Natsuki?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:3,direction:down=angry,You better not have <i>another</i> shirt on under there.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,Shouldn'tve brought them to this game if you didn't want them to get dirty Nugi.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:rainbow_mika,direction:down=shocked,Well... I guess that's one way to play the game...
-2-female_removed_minor,target:sakura,targetStage:2,direction:down=flex,Alright then! Sakura, you better give it your all!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:sakura,targetStage:3,direction:down=sad,Oh. Uh... You wouldn't happen to be one of Rhajat's experiments, would you?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:sakura,targetStage:4,direction:down=embarrassed,But, I guess that it was probably insensitive...
-2-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,direction:down=think,That much alcohol CANNOT be good for your poker skills, Sei.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:sheena,targetStage:3,direction:down=confident,So, keep up the work. Kagero's still a better opponent then you are!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3,direction:down=shocked,H-how are you so nonchalant about this!?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:sonya,targetStage:6,direction:down=happy,Nice warpaint. Not as good as the Flame Tribe's though.


#finished
-1-male_removing_minor,direction:down=angry,I'm bored. You're boring me.
-1-male_removing_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,I don't know about that, I think the Flame Tribe would've heard of someone with a style as similar to ours.
-1-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:0,direction:down=think,It's definitely nothing like the fashion in my world...
-1-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:0,direction:down=think,I've never seen such a... loud shirt in my world...
-1-male_removed_minor,direction:down=sad,Well, I'm already finished, so it doesn't matter that much.
-1-male_removed_minor,target:corrin_m,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:corrin_f,direction:down=confident,Guess your fashion sense is consistent across universes, Lady Corrin.
-1-male_removed_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:2,direction:down=think,Mecha? Is that like those things the ballisticians pilot?
-1-male_removed_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,I should introduce you to Oboro! I bet she'd love to see your world's fashion!
-1-female_removing_minor,direction:down=angry,Come on! Where's your passion!?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:corrin_f,alsoPlaying:catria,alsoPlayingStage:0-7,count-corrin_m:0,direction:down=think,Um... what are you talking about, Catria?

-1-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2,direction:down=angry,GODDAMNIT!
-1-female_removing_minor,target:april,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,Does that mean that April is royalty?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:april,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f,direction:down=shocked,Corrin, is April somehow part of the Hoshidan royal family!?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:catria,targetStage:1,direction:down=proud,I guess somethings stay the same no matter what the time is.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:catria,targetStage:2,direction:down=proud,I always found it weird that Pegasus Knights wore such fancy boots.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:catria,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,Well, it's not like Pegasus Knights are known for their defense anyway.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,Your jacket, Faye?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:3,direction:down=embarrassed,You, uh, don't have to worry about looking cute while stripping, Futaba.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:2,direction:down=angry,What's with this bullshit? Why does she get to decide her costume counts as two layers?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:haru,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,She's this girl who walks around pretending to be submissive, soft, and fancy...
-1-female_removing_minor,target:haru,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,Ha! Out of small stuff already?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:juri,targetStage:1,direction:down=think,Ah, well, I guess they did have to go sooner or later.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:juri,targetStage:1,direction:down=sad,I guess you had to get rid of it eventually...
-1-female_removing_minor,target:juri,targetStage:1,direction:down=sad,And you had such a strong start too...
-1-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:5,direction:down=shocked,If it makes you feel any better...
-1-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:socks,direction:down=calm,I kind of doubt that, Kyu.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:lucina,targetStage:1,direction:down=stretch,Let's see... It was one of those people from Nohr, I think...
-1-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,direction:down=sad,Ah, I once hated Nohrian's, but thanks to Lady Corrin, I was able to realize that I was blinded by prejudice. I guess we're pretty similar.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:miko,targetStage:0,direction:down=proud,Well, you sure look different from prince Ryoma.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:miko,targetStage:0,direction:down=proud,Well, you sure look different from prince Takumi.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:monika,targetStage:1,direction:down=think,You seem to be really interested in them.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,direction:down=angry,Oh goddamnit, you have another shirt under there?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2,direction:down=angry,Yes they are, is there a point to all of this?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:1,marker:oboro,direction:down=think,Oboro told me something about socks and sandals, but I can't remember if it was good or not.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:pyrrha,targetStage:0,direction:down=calm,Do you do a lot of fighting in your world?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0,direction:down=shocked,...
-1-female_removing_minor,target:sakura,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,Hey, is that war paint on you? Maybe you're not like the Sakura I know after all!
-1-female_removing_minor,target:sakura,targetStage:2,direction:down=shocked,Wait. What the?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:sakura,targetStage:3,direction:down=shocked,I... uh... assumed, since she's the only necromancer I know...

-1-female_removed_minor,direction:down=angry,Come on! Quit stalling already!
-1-female_removed_minor,direction:down=angry,Quit with the stalling already! It's pointless!

#OPPONENT REMOVING MAJOR CLOTHING
#Major clothing reveals a significant amount of skin and likely underwear.
#However, as we don't know if the opponent is taking off the top or the bottom, we can't presume that nice abs are showing; maybe she took of her skirt before her shirt.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

0-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:4,direction:down=shocked,Did your breasts just get bigger? Because I know a certain Hoshidan princess who might want some tips on how to go about doing that.
0-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:5,direction:down=angry,By the gods, woman! How many shirts do you have on?
0-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:6,direction:down=shocked,Something weird is going on here...

4-male_removed_major,direction:down=proud,Hell yeah! This is a battle!
4-male_removed_major,direction:down=proud,Now this is a battle!
4-male_removed_major,direction:down=proud,Finally! We're getting somewhere good!
4-male_removed_major,target:corrin_m,targetStage:5,direction:down=embarrassed,Oh. That's... gotta be pretty embarrassing.
4-male_removed_major,target:corrin_m,targetStage:5,direction:down=tsundere,Didn't know that you were into that kind of stuff Corrin. Not judging, but totally judging.
4-female_removing_major,direction:down=happy,About time you got rid of your ~clothing~, ~name~!
4-female_removing_major,direction:down=happy,You doing anything after this, ~name~? I could always show you a good time.
4-female_removing_major,target:catria,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:corrin_f,count-corrin_m:0,direction:down=horny,Hey, doesn't that underwear remind you of Hoshidan wear, Lady Corrin?
4-female_removing_major,target:aimee,targetStage:0,direction:down=shocked,Gods! It's certainly loud!
4-female_removing_major,target:april,targetStage:3,direction:down=proud,Although, it didn't really do a great job covering the important stuff anyway.
4-female_removing_major,target:catria,targetStage:4,direction:down=horny,Hey, that underwear reminds me of traditional Hoshidan wear.
4-female_removing_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:3,direction:down=proud,That armor always looked a bit tedious to put on Corrin. Sorry that you're gonna have to do it again once this game is over.
4-female_removing_major,target:faye,targetStage:4,direction:down=angry,You better be kidding, Faye.
4-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1,direction:down=sad,Man, I'd rather forget about parallel universes if it's all the same with you.
4-female_removing_major,target:haru,targetStage:4,direction:down=stretch,Hiding what, Haru?
4-female_removing_major,target:juri,targetStage:0,direction:down=horny,Wow, you're starting off with a bang, aren't you, Juri?
4-female_removing_major,target:juri,targetStage:0,direction:down=horny,Alright, you had my curiosity, now you've got my attention.
4-female_removing_major,target:juri,targetStage:0,direction:down=horny,Well somebody knows how to start things off with a bang.
4-female_removing_major,target:lucina,targetStage:4,direction:down=tsundere,Not that they're bad people to be associated with! They're all capable fighters and retainers...
4-female_removing_major,target:lucina,targetStage:5,direction:down=stretch,Alright, now, come on. We don't have all day. Selena would've had it off by now.
4-female_removing_major,target:lyn,targetStage:5,direction:down=horny,Time to find out if all of the rumors about the legendary lady Lyndis are true.
4-female_removing_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:4,direction:down=shocked,Seriously, your skirt before your shirt? Are you embarrassed of your upper body, or something?
4-female_removing_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:5,direction:down=proud,About time! After all those shirts and your skirt, I was wondering if you were ever gonna take that off!
4-female_removing_major,target:navi,targetStage:0,direction:down=shocked,What the hell!?
4-female_removing_major,target:sakura,targetStage:4,direction:down=embarrassed,(<i>Actually, scratch that, this is probably exactly what kind of stuff Peri is into...</i>)
4-female_removing_major,target:sheena,targetStage:3,direction:down=confident,And besides, it's not like your kimono was covering your cleavage that much anyway!
4-female_removing_major,target:shimakaze,direction:down=embarrassed,All this clothing damage reminds me of Sophie...
4-female_removing_major,target:shimakaze,direction:down=embarrassed,All this clothing damage... reminds me of Raider weapons...
4-female_removing_major,target:shimakaze,direction:down=embarrassed,This is getting out of hand...
4-female_removing_major,target:shimakaze,direction:down=embarrassed,...
4-female_removing_major,target:syrenne,targetStage:0,direction:down=confident,I gotta say, you don't look like the ones from my world.
4-female_removed_major,direction:down=embarrassed,I bet Old Hubba would be on cloud nine if he were here.
4-female_removed_major,marker:laslow,direction:down=happy,I bet Laslow would give anything to be here right now.
4-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,That's quite a bit to take off all at once isn't it? You must be confident.
4-female_removed_major,target:angie,targetStage:4,direction:down=shocked,Woah! You're more muscular than I thought! What school do <i>you</i> go to?

4-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:4,direction:down=shocked,Did they just get bigger? What kind of magic is this?
4-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:4,direction:down=shocked,Did your breasts just get bigger? Because I know a certain Hoshidan princess who might want some tips on how to go about doing that.
4-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:5,direction:down=angry,By the gods, woman! How many shirts do you have on?
4-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:6,direction:down=shocked,Something weird is going on here...
4-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:6,direction:down=shocked,Something's not right here. Annie's breasts are...
4-female_removed_major,target:buffy,targetStage:5,direction:down=calm,A neat trick, Buffy. Can't really pull of the same thing with my binds though.
4-female_removed_major,target:catria,targetStage:5,direction:down=proud,Pegasus Knight uniforms always did go pretty high up.
4-female_removed_major,target:chun-li,targetStage:3,direction:down=proud,Woah, looks like you were hiding some muscle, Chun-Li.
4-female_removed_major,target:chun-li,targetStage:6,direction:down=proud,Looks like someone didn't skip leg day.
4-female_removed_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:4,direction:down=horny,So you're wearing Nohrian underwear, Lady Corrin?
4-female_removed_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:5,direction:down=proud,Good to know you're in good shape Corrin. Don't want my leader to be slacking off!
4-female_removed_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:5,marker:nopants,direction:down=happy,Maybe you should start wearing real pants lady Corrin.
4-female_removed_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:5,marker:nopants,direction:down=think,Why don't you or Camilla wear pants, Lady Corrin?
4-female_removed_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:pit,marker:nopants,direction:down=think,Pit's right. Why don't you wear pants, Lady Corrin?
4-female_removed_major,target:d.va,targetStage:4,direction:down=calm,Flame pattern? Nice.
4-female_removed_major,target:d.va,targetStage:4,marker:oboro,direction:down=proud,I might not be as fashionable as Oboro, but I like the design you've got going on there, D.va.
4-female_removed_major,target:elaine,targetStage:4,direction:down=happy,That's some rather fancy underwear ya got there, Elaine.
4-female_removed_major,target:elaine,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:shego,alsoPlayingStage:4-8,direction:down=think,Don't know why you guys wore such fancy underwear, it's all coming off anyway, right?
4-female_removed_major,target:faye,targetStage:5,direction:down=proud,Yeah, that's more like it.
4-female_removed_major,target:florina,targetStage:6,direction:down=calm,Are you sure you want to keep playing Florina? It's not a fair fight if your heart's not in it.
4-female_removed_major,target:futaba,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:pit,direction:down=calm,Perhaps she just wants to stay warm, Pit? That's my guess as leader of the Flame Tribe.
4-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,direction:down=happy,Eh, whatever. You look good without the mask on.
4-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,direction:down=proud,Well, you certainly look better than an unmasked Faceless.
4-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:4,direction:down=calm,So what are you, Gwen? Some kind of... spider-lady?
4-female_removed_major,target:haru,targetStage:5,direction:down=embarrassed,(<i>Well, I'll be damned, maybe she is like Charlotte...</i>)

4-female_removed_major,target:jolyne,targetStage:3,direction:down=horny,Hey, you're pretty fit, Jolyne. Not bad at all!

4-female_removed_major,target:juri,targetStage:1,direction:down=horny,Okay, well, if you were trying to get my attention, it worked.
4-female_removed_major,target:juri,targetStage:1,direction:down=proud,I didn't expect you to be so bold, Juri. I'm impressed!
4-female_removed_major,target:korra,targetStage:5,direction:down=proud,Well, well, well. Seems you're in good shape.
4-female_removed_major,target:kyoko,targetStage:5,direction:down=calm,I really didn't expect you to lose your cool like this, Kyoko.
4-female_removed_major,target:launch,targetStage:6,direction:down=shocked,Again!?
4-female_removed_major,target:lucina,targetStage:5,direction:down=embarrassed,They're just very... eccentric.
4-female_removed_major,target:lucina,targetStage:6,direction:down=tsundere,Damn it, how am I supposed to see if you have abs behind that?
4-female_removed_major,target:lyn,targetStage:6,direction:down=sad,So, she does wear underwear? I suppose the rumors were just rumors then.
4-female_removed_major,target:lyn,targetStage:6,saidMarker:nopants,direction:down=think,Lyn doesn't wear pants either. Is it just, part of the rules of being a female main character in a Fire Emblem game?
4-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,direction:down=shocked,What the hell!?
4-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:sentai_mari,direction:down=think,Sentai? Isn't that that weird drawings that Nina always has?
4-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:kyoko,alsoPlayingStage:0-8,direction:down=shocked,Guess there are some things even the ultimate detective finds surprising.
4-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,Looks like somebody works out!
4-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3,direction:down=horny,Nice abs Meia!
4-female_removed_major,target:misato,targetStage:4,direction:down=proud,Most people in the Flame Tribe are proud of their scars. It proves they've overcome the harshest of trials.
4-female_removed_major,target:moon,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,Woah. You're certainly eager.
4-female_removed_major,target:moon,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,Little eager there, aren't ya?
4-female_removed_major,target:morrigan,targetStage:4,direction:down=happy,Hot damn! You're more in shape than I thought you'd be!
4-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:5,marker:oboro,direction:down=proud,Don't worry, Nagisa, fashion is overrated anyway. Don't tell Oboro I said that though.
4-female_removed_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:5,direction:down=tsundere,Seriously, I came here <i>without</i> a shirt. It's not that big a deal.
4-female_removed_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:6,direction:down=confident,Not the worst I've seen, but, still room to improve. How about I help you work out sometime, Natsuki?
4-female_removed_major,target:navi,targetStage:1,direction:down=embarrassed,Well... that was... something...
4-female_removed_major,target:peach,targetStage:5,direction:down=shocked,Well that's certainly an... old fashioned taste in underwear, Princess Peach.
4-female_removed_major,target:peach,targetStage:6,marker:oboro,direction:down=happy,Oh, okay. Good to know those weren't your panties. I don't know fashion, but from what Oboro's told me, that would have been <i>seriously</i> out of style.
4-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,You look better now that we can actually see your face Raven.
4-female_removed_major,target:sakura,targetStage:5,direction:down=confident,Look at all those scars! You're one hell of a fighter, huh, Sakura?
4-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:5,direction:down=think,I think it's safe to say Sei is drunk.
4-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6,direction:down=horny,Nice abs Sei! Wanna work out together sometime?
4-female_removed_major,target:sheena,targetStage:4,direction:down=tsundere,N-Not, that I was staring, or anything!
4-female_removed_major,target:shego,targetStage:4,direction:down=horny,Woah, that is some intense underwear.
4-female_removed_major,target:shego,targetStage:4,direction:down=horny,I'm really heating up...
4-female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,direction:down=angry,Seriously, how are you so casual about this!?
4-female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,direction:down=angry,Seriously, is this normal for you?
4-female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,direction:down=angry,Seriously, does this happen all the time!?
4-female_removed_major,target:spooky,targetStage:2,direction:down=calm,Maybe you should've brought a bit more, eh Spooky?
4-female_removed_major,target:syrenne,targetStage:1,direction:down=proud,You also seem more... I don't know... capable than they are?
4-female_removed_major,target:videl,targetStage:4,direction:down=proud,Hell yeah Videl! Clothes should always be more practical than fashionable.
4-female_removed_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,Wii should work out together Trainer!
4-female_removed_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:1,direction:down=proud,Looking good Trainer!

4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sakura,direction:down=tsundere,(<i>Oh. Is this what it feels like to be Rhajat?</i>)
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:shimakaze,direction:down=sad,Last one, thank god.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:syrenne,direction:down=confident,Is your loss that surprising? You should've known by now that if you play against me, it's gonna happen!

4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee,direction:down=angry,Ya know Aimee, if it weren't for the CONSTANT GUNFIRE ASSAULTING MY EARS, I'd love to mess around with you a bit.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee,direction:down=calm,It's a shame you're taken Aimee, I'd love to fool around sometime.

#OPPONENT MASTURBATING
#When an opponent is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must pay the penalty by masturbating in front of everyone.
#The "must_masturbate" line is for just before it happens, and the "start_masturbating" line immediately follows.
#The "masturbating" line will be spoken a little after the opponent has started but before they climax.
#When the opponent climaxes, your character will say the "finished_masturbating" line.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

#SELF MASTURBATING
#If your character is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must masturbate.
#These lines only come up in the relevant stages, so you don't need to include the stage numbers here. Just remember which stage is which when you make the images. The "starting" image is still in the naked stage.
#The "finished_masturbating" line will repeat many times if the game is not yet finished. This plays as opponents comment on the how good their hands are.

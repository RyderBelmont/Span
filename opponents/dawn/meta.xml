    <description>Born and raised in the Sinnoh region, Dawn is an assistant to Professor Rowan of Sandgem Town. She may love battling just like any other trainer, but she is looking towards becoming a Pokemon Professor. She's been there for you, the player, as you made your journey out of Twinleaf Town. From teaching you how to catch Pokemon outside of Sandgem, to making your way to the Battle Zone. She heard The Inventory was a hotspot for interesting people to meet. With the intent of meeting strangers who've encountered even stranger Pokemon, she signed up. The roster seemed intimidating, but she somehow managed to qualify to be "interesting".</description>

        <title>Decorative Axe</title>
        <subtitle>A weapon that has spent more time in a trophy room than on the battlefield.</subtitle>
        <text>This axe has never actually seen combat, it only exists to be shown off and look pretty. That may have something to do with why Hilda likes it so much.



 (Special thanks to Nomelet for creating the axe head.)</text>

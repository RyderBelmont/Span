        <subtitle>The wineglass Remilia was drinking out of during the game.</subtitle>
        <text>An exceedingly ordinary wineglass, presumably owned by Remilia Scarlet.
Impressively caught by the dealer during the game.
For some reason, they insisted that you take it with you.
It has a faint, indescribable smell.
You can't quite tell what was in it.</text>
        <unlock>Win a game against Remilia.</unlock>

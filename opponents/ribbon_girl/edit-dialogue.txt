#Items of clothing should be listed here in order of removal.
#The values are formal name, lower case name, how much they cover, what they cover
#Please do not put spaces around the commas.
#"Important" clothes cover genitals (lower) or chest/breasts (upper). For example: bras, panties, a skirt when going commando.
#"Major" clothes cover underwear. For example: skirts, pants, shirts, dresses.
#"Minor" clothes cover skin or are large pieces of clothing that do not cover skin. For example: jackets, socks, stockings, gloves.
#"Extra" clothes are small items that may or may not be clothing but do not cover anything interesting. For example: jewelry, shoes or boots with socks underneath, belts, hats. In the rest of the code, "extra" clothes are called "accessory".
#If for some reason you write another word for the type of clothes (e.g. "accessory"), other characters will not react at all when the clothing is removed.
#What they cover = upper (upper body), lower (lower body), other (neither).
#The game can support any number of entries, but typically we use 2-8, with at least one "important" layer for upper and lower (each).

#Notes on dialogue
#All lines that start with a # symbol are comments and will be ignored by the tool that converts this file into a xml file for the game.
#Where more than one line has an identical type, like "swap_cards" and "swap_cards", the game will randomly select one of these lines each time the character is in that situation.
#You should try to include multiple lines for most stages, especially the final (finished) stage, -1. 

#A character goes through multiple stages as they undress. The stage number starts at zero and indicates how many layers they have removed. Special stage numbers are used when they are nude (-3), masturbating (-2), and finished (-1).
#Line types that start with a number will only display during that stage. The will override any numberless stage-generic lines. For example, in stage 4 "4-swap_cards" will be used over "swap_cards" if it is not blank here. Giving a character unique dialogue for each stage is an effective way of showing their changing openness/shyness as the game progresses.
#You can combine the above points and make multiple lines for a particular situation in a particular stage, like "4-swap_cards" and "4-swap_cards".

#Some special words can be used that will be substituted by the game for context-appropriate ones: ~name~ is the name of the character they're speaking to, but this only works if someone else is in focus. ~clothing~ is the type of clothing that is being removed by another player. ~Clothing~ is almost the same, but it starts with a capital letter in case you want to start a sentence with it.
#~name~ can be used any time a line targets an opponent (game_over_defeat, _must_strip, _removing_, _removed, _must_masturbate, etc).
#~clothing~ can be used only when clothing is being removed (_removing and _removed, but NOT _must_strip).
#~player~ can be used at any time and refers to the human player.
#~cards~ can be used only in the swap_cards lines.
#All wildcards can be used once per line only! If you use ~name~ twice, the code will show up the second time.

#Lines can be written that are only spoken when specific other characters are present. For a detailed explanation, read this guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/spnati/comments/6nhaj0/the_easy_way_to_write_targeted_lines/
#Here is an example line (note that targeted lines must have a stage number):
#0-female_must_strip,target:hermione=happy,Looks like your magic doesn't help with poker!

#When swapping cards, the game will automatically put a display a number between 0-5 where you write ~cards~.
#These lines display on the screen for only a brief time, so it is important to make them short enough to read at a glance.

0-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;CynthiaImpactful:,count-role;other&character;cynthia&sayingmarker;RibbonQuesImpactful1:,id:116,marker:CynthiaImpactful2=chatting.png,Well, "recent" is relative. The masks have existed for about 120 years, but the ARMS Ability has been dated as far back as 1500 years. Before the masks, people just had to deal with the lack of control.
0-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;WagerStart:,count-role;other&character;aella&notsaidmarker;RGWager&sayingmarker;RGWager:=happy.png,Well, it was directed at ~player~, but you can join in too, if you want!

-3-okay_hand=flustered.png,Ah, this should be fine... I shouldn't worry...
-3-bad_hand=embarrassed.png,Oh... This isn't good...
-3-bad_hand=flustered.png,Looks like you have me beat for sure this round! Haha...
-3-bad_hand=flustered.png,O-oh. Th-this hand isn't good at all. Ahaha...
-3-bad_hand=sing.png,<i>♪... Let's fight on, even if we get sad and unable to stand up...♪</i>
-3-bad_hand=sing.png,♪I'm going down, in a spiral to the ground! No~ o~ne, no one's gonna save me now!♪
-3-bad_hand=flustered.png,Aha, clearly the devil deals the cards in this match!... Y-you see what I did there..?
-3-bad_hand=sing.png,♪It's like, oh, my gosh, life's so scandalous! One day, I'm happy, one day, I'm a mess! Hang on, 'cause I'll never give up!♪

-3-hand,count-role;other&character;roll&stage;4-7&sayingmarker;ovenon1:,id:106=flustered.png,F-for real? Are you seriously thinking about that right now? You should be fine. Maybe someone else at your home already turned it off!
-3-hand,count-role;other&character;mary&sayingmarker;imnotlooking:,id:107,marker:MaryBlind=wink.png,Hey, it's your funeral!
-3-hand,count-role;other&character;kizuna&sayingmarker;kizuna_hi:=happy.png,Hi, Kizuna! Nice to meet you! I'm Ribbon Girl, a famous singer and ARMS fighter!
-3-hand,count-role;other&character;chun-li&stage;10&timeinstage;0:=happy.png,Oh! You look really pretty with your hair down, Chun-Li!
-3-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;PlayerWager2&notsaidmarker;WagerStart:,id:44,marker:WagerStart=chatting.png,Oh, but let's have a few rules: whatever we do can't be illegal, can't be too violent, and can't break the loser's bank... oh, and no pictures or video!
-3-hand,count-role;other&character;sakura&stage;0-2&sayingmarker;ribbon_girl_arms:=chatting.png,Oh, it's hardly new. The ARMS Grad Prix has been going on for nearly two decades!
-3-hand,count-role;other&character;aella&saidmarker;RGWager&notsaidmarker;RGWagerNotSure&sayingmarker;RGWagerNotSure:=chatting.png,So, are you going to join in on the wager, Aella?
-3-hand,count-role;other&character;cammy_white&stage;1&timeinstage;0:,id:50=dukes.png,That's your call, Cammy. If you think you can still win without them, go ahead and take them off!
-3-hand,oneShotId:7,count-role;other&character;amy&stage;1:,marker:AmyArms=interested.png,They're not that hard to get, but they can be a bit pricey. Smith's Arms are pretty affordable, but Grisly's are more expensive because they're robotic.
-3-hand,count-role;other&character;mary&sayingmarker;weird_fetish:,id:111,marker:MaryFetishes=flustered.png,Uh... Depends on your definition of "weird."
-3-hand,oneShotId:5,count-role;other&character;rainbow_dash&stage;9:=wink.png,With wings like those, your aerial game's got to be pretty good, but I'd bet mine's still better!
-3-hand,count-role;other&character;emi&stage;1-2&saidmarker;car_accident&sayingmarker;setup_pirate:=happy.png,Yeah! That's a good attitude to have!
-3-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;CynthiaHistoricalFigures2:,count-role;other&character;cynthia&sayingmarker;RibbonQuesFigures2:,id:121,marker:CynthiaHistoricalFigures3=happy.png,And I'm sure many of my fans will one day become singers and ARMS competitors because of me, too!
-3-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;CynthiaImpactful2:,count-role;other&character;cynthia&sayingmarker;RibbonQuesImpactful2:,id:122,marker:CynthiaImpactful3=chatting.png,Exactly! That's why I won't be taking my mask off during this game. I may want to win, but I like controlling my powers more!
-3-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;CynthiaRuins2:,count-role;other&character;cynthia&sayingmarker;RibbonQuesRuins2:,id:123,marker:CynthiaRuins3=chatting.png,I fly past there on my way home. You could come with me to see it after this game if you like!
-3-hand,oneShotId:9,count-role;self&saidmarker;MaryFetishes:,count-role;other&character;mary:,id:119,marker:MaryFetishes2=embarrassed.png,I just wasn't sure if it was weird enough that I, uh... fantasize about men... <i>finishing</i> on my face. Which is kind of hard to do because of my mask.
-3-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;CynthiaARMluminati:,count-role;other&character;cynthia&sayingmarker;RibbonStories1:,id:114,marker:CynthiaARMluminati2=chatting.png,I know, right? It's a very spooky thought, especially because one of the subfactions is shady enough <i>without</i> being secret!
-3-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;CynthiaHistoricalFigures:,count-role;other&character;cynthia&sayingmarker;RibbonQuesFigures1:,id:115,marker:CynthiaHistoricalFigures2=happy.png,Oh, he's real. I've always looked up to his fighting spirit and determination!
-3-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;CynthiaARMluminati2:,count-role;other&character;cynthia&sayingmarker;RibbonStories2:,id:120,marker:CynthiaARMluminati3=happy.png,Only a little. One's only a rumor, and the other hasn't done anything I couldn't stand against!
-3-hand,oneShotId:8,count-role;self&saidmarker;ArmPowerTalk:,count-role;other&character;jolyne:,id:118,marker:JolyneStand=interested.png,Stand power? What do you mean by that, Jolyne?
-3-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;CynthiaRuins:,count-role;other&character;cynthia&sayingmarker;RibbonQuesRuins1:,id:117,marker:CynthiaRuins2=chatting.png,The Misangan Temple Grounds? Well, it has these floor tile paintings that some people think represent us modern day fighters, but they're apparently quite old!
-3-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;CynthiaImpactful:,count-role;other&character;cynthia&sayingmarker;RibbonQuesImpactful1:,id:116,marker:CynthiaImpactful2=chatting.png,Well, "recent" is relative. The masks have existed for about 120 years, but the ARMS Ability has been dated as far back as 1500 years. Before the masks, people just had to deal with the lack of control.
-3-hand,count-role;self&saidmarker;WagerStart:,count-role;other&character;aella&notsaidmarker;RGWager&sayingmarker;RGWager:=happy.png,Well, it was directed at ~player~, but you can join in too, if you want!

-3-hand,priority:146,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;1v1:,count-role;other&character;erufuda&stage;0-6:,count-alive:2,marker:1v1=dukes.png,It's just us now, Erufuda! Let's see if your elven magic is any match for my fighting spirit!
-3-hand,priority:146,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;1v1:,count-role;other&character;cammy_white&stage;0-5:,count-alive:2,marker:1v1=wink.png,Look like it's almost time for me add "spy" to the list of different fighters I've beaten!
-3-hand,priority:146,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;1v1:,count-role;other&character;jotaro&stage;0-7:,count-alive:2,marker:1v1=wink.png,Not to sound like I'm going to go easy on you, but I totally wouldn't mind losing a game like this to a hunk like you, Jotaro!
-3-hand,priority:146,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;1v1:,count-role;other&character;aella&stage;0-6:,count-alive:2,marker:1v1=dukes.png,Your size doesn't intimidate me, Aella! You're going down!

-3-hand,priority:155,count-role;other&character;saki_zls&stage;6&timeinstage;0:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ZLS2:,id:66=happy.png,I knew it! You're a zombie too! Is your whole band zombies?

-3-hand,priority:203,count-role;other&character;revy&saidmarker;music&sayingmarker;joey_bands:,count-role;other&character;joey&saidmarker;JoeyMusic:=interested.png,Yeah, that <i>is</i> weird. Haven't you at least heard Chop Suey? You know, ♪Wake up! Grababrushandputalittle makeup!♪ That one?
-3-hand,count-role;self&sayingmarker;1v1:,count-alive:2,count-role;other&character;futaba&stage;0-6:,marker:1v1=dukes.png,<i>You're</i> the one who's lucky this isn't a fighting game! I've played more than you might think!

0-stripping=stripping.png,I don't want to have a tough time taking my other things off, so I'll start with my Sparkies.
0-stripping,marker:SparkiesTalk=stripping.png,These are one of my signature Arms: Sparkies. They shock opponents when charged, leaving them wide open if the hit lands!
0-stripping,marker:SparkiesTalk=stripping.png,These are one of my signature Arms: Sparkies. They're medium weight, glove-type Arms. Simple, but effective!
0-stripping,marker:SparkiesTalk=stripping.png,These are one of my favorite Arms: Sparkies. Medium weight, glove-type, electric Arms. What's not to love?
0-stripping,count-role;other&character;joey:=stripping.png,Actually, it feels more like having <i>really</i> soft skin all the time.
0-stripping,count-role;other&character;natsuki:=stripping.png,Cosplay...? No, I'm the <i>real</i> Ribbon Girl!
0-stripping,count-role;other&character;chun-li:=stripping.png,Dhalsim! Right! Yeah, I have good range, but so do my opponents, so it evens out! Now, if <i>you and I</i> were to fight, I'd keep my arms retracted so we're more even.
0-stripping,count-role;other&character;amy&sayingmarker;strange_harmonies:=stripping.png,Eh? "Strange?" Are you sure that was me you heard? Haha.
0-stripping,count-role;other&character;nugi-chan:=wink.png,I actually have a team of typists follow me around all day to type things for me... Just kidding! I take them off first, silly!
0-stripping,count-role;other&character;meia&stage;0-5:=stripping.png,I swear I'm not a robot, Meia! If you won't take my word for it, why don't you come over and feel me?
0-stripping,count-role;other&character;futaba:=stripping.png,Ink-what? I'm sorry, but you've lost me, Futaba.
0-stripping,count-role;other&character;spooky:=stripping.png,Like I said, Spooky, it's just like having normal arms. They wouldn't exactly be normal arms if I didn't have hands, now would they?
0-stripping,count-role;other&character;sakura:=stripping.png,Oh, no, Sparkie is the name of the ARM. If I'd name them, I'll probably go with "Jupiter" and "Zeus" or something like that!
0-stripping,count-role;other&character;nami:=stripping.png,Rubber, huh? Sounds like he might be resistant to my Sparkie's shock effects!
0-stripping,count-role;other&character;chazz:=stripping.png,Says you! Electric Arms don't need any more support, they're already pretty powerful!
0-stripping,count-role;other&character;aella:=stripping.png,Sort of. These are Sparkies, and I can use my powers to charge them up with electricity. They're part of how I fight!
0-stripping,count-role;other&character;jessie:=stripping.png,That wasn't my gloves, that was my arms! I have the power to turn my arms into coils and make them super stretchy!
0-stripping,count-role;other&character;sei:=stripping.png,That's okay, Sei. I don't expect all my fans to know absolutely <i>everything</i> about me. I do a lot, so that'd be pretty hard!
0-stripping,count-role;other&character;beatrix:=stripping.png,The ARMS Ability <i>is</i> what happened. I just woke up one day, and <i>boom</i>, ribbon arms! That's what happens when the ability awakens. It's a gene thing, I think?
0-stripping,count-role;other&character;sayaka:=stripping.png,They sure do! They're mid-weight, glove-type Arms that dish out an electric shock when charged!
0-stripping,count-role;other&character;sayaka:,marker:SparkiesTalk=stripping.png,These are one of my signature Arms: Sparkies. They shock opponents when charged, leaving them wide open if the hit lands!

0-stripping,count-role;other&character;akko:=stripping.png,They're not magical, but they certainly are shocking! One charged punch leaves my opponent wide open for a follow-up!
0-stripping,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;0-7:=stripping.png,What are you talking about, Revy? I win my fights for real! No shady business involved!
0-stripping,count-role;other&character;pa-15:,marker:PA15Soft=stripping.png,Yep! And before you ask, no, it's not weird having arms made of ribbons. It just feels like I have soft skin!
0-stripping,count-role;other&character;pa-15:,marker:PA15Touch=stripping.png,Yep! And before you ask, yes, I still have a sense of touch in my arms!


#losing chest guard
1-stripped=stripped.png,Why yes, I <i>do</i> have hands underneath.
1-stripped,marker:SurprisedAtHands=strippedO.png,Ohmigosh, <i>hands</i>!
1-stripped=stripped.png,Must be strange to see an ARMS fighter's hands, huh?
1-stripped=stripped.png,Can you believe some people think I don't have hands?
1-stripped,marker:SurprisedAtHands=strippedO.png,<i>Whoa! Hands! Mind blowing!</i>
1-stripped,marker:SurprisedAtHands=strippedO.png,My hands! I haven't see these in <i>years</i>!
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;futaba:=flustered.png,... Yeah, I'm sorry, Futaba, but I have no idea what you were just talking about.
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;joey:=flustered.png,Aha, well, <i>that's</i> when it feels like I'm wearing gloves. I've been told it chafes a bit...
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;mavis:=stripped.png,Can you believe some people think I don't have hands?
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;sakura:=wink.png,Heheh, no need to tell <i>me</i> that!
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;meia&stage;0-5:=flustered.png,How many times do I have to tell you? I'm <i>not</i> a robot! What can I do to convince you that I'm human?
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;misty_hgss:=happy.png,I do, do I, Misty? What about me reminds you of them?
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;pa-15:=interested.png,I don't actually know. ARMS Labs named the ability, and they're not exactly good at answering questions.
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;natsuki:=happy.png,I got into boxing because Twintelle did too. We were sort of close back then, if you can believe that!
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;jessie:=happy.png,I know, right? They've got aim-assistance, little shocky bits that come out when you charge them, and some even have little robots on them! It's crazy!
1-stripped,count-role;self&saidmarker;SparkiesTalk:,id:69,marker:OtherSignatureArms=chatting.png,I like to use Slapamanders and Poppers too. Both are great at a distance and help me keep my mobility!
1-stripped,count-role;self&saidmarker;SparkiesTalk:,id:69,marker:OtherSignatureArms=chatting.png,I like to use Slapamanders and Poppers too. Poppers are especially good at preventing me from getting cornered!
1-stripped,count-role;self&saidmarker;SparkiesTalk:,id:69,marker:OtherGloveArms=chatting.png,If you've ever seen Spring Man's Toasters, they're really similar, except <i>those</i> heat up with flames when charged!
1-stripped,count-role;self&saidmarker;SparkiesTalk:,id:69,marker:OtherGloveArms=chatting.png,If you've ever seen Ninjara's Buffs, they're really similar, except <i>those</i> have no element, but have better curving abilities and puff up when charged!
1-stripped,count-role;self&saidmarker;SparkiesTalk:,id:69,marker:GlovesGrow=interested.png,I'm not sure how they do it, but somehow all Arms change size when fighters activate their powers... I'll have to ask an Arms Labs rep about that later...
1-stripped,count-role;self&saidmarker;SparkiesTalk:,id:69,marker:GlovesGrow=interested.png,I'm not sure how, but Arms can actually change size with the fighter's arms, so fighters like Min Min and Misango don't have to worry when they use their powers.
1-stripped,count-role;self&saidmarker;SparkiesTalk:,id:69,marker:SmithBrand=chatting.png,The brand that makes those, Smith, also makes one of my other signature Arms, the Slapamander, along with all of the other "glove" type Arms too!
1-stripped,count-role;self&saidmarker;SparkiesTalk:,id:69,marker:SmithBrand=chatting.png,The brand that makes those, Smith, also makes all the other "glove" type Arms, along with "whip" types and "tri-shot" types too. All very good stuff!
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;0-7:,id:103=dukes.png,I'm serious, Revy! My fights are real! If you still don't believe me when the match is over, we can spar and I'll show you just how hard I can hit!
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;twilight:=stripped.png,Oh, sorry, "Sparkie" is the name of my Arms -- er, the gloves, not <i>these</i> arms.
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;sei&stage;9-10:=happy.png,Sure, just as long as you wash your hands first.
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;sei&stage;0-8:=wink.png,Tell you what, you manage to win this game, I'll let you try them as much as you like!
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;chazz&sayingmarker;nickname=Stretch:=interested.png,Thanks, I guess?... And don't call me "Stretch."
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;aella:=happy.png,There's nothing magic about them, but yeah! Sparkies aren't the only ones I use, either! I also use Slapamanders and Poppers, too!
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;beatrix:=flustered.png,Uh, h-how about you just go see ARMS Labs about it? They know all kinds of stuff about the ARMS Ability, if the name didn't already tell you that!
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;akko:=flustered.png,Uh... Sorry, Akko, I <i>don't</i> know who you are.
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;spooky:=flustered.png,Um, l-let's not try to find out today, okay?
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;amy:=flustered.png,Well, you're right, but if my singing was "strange," I should look into it!
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;nami:=flustered.png,Wow, uh... Y-yeah, I get what you mean! I-it must be pretty cool, being able to do that!
1-stripped,count-role;self&saidmarker;SparkiesTalk:,count-role;other&character;sayaka:=chatting.png,Oh, I can't take credit for that. The Sparkies do all the work creating electricity. All I do is charge them.
1-must_strip,count-role;self&losses;2:=flustered.png,Aw man, again already?
1-must_strip,count-role;self&losses;2:=flustered.png,Again? Well, alright!
1-must_strip,count-role;other&character;yuelia&sayingmarker;ribbon_goodVoice:=wink.png,Heh heh, I get that a lot. That's why I became a pop star!
1-must_strip,count-role;other&character;yuelia&var;yuelia&sayingmarker;ribbon_life:=wink.png,I'm also a pop star, ~other~. I'm surprised you've never heard of me.
1-must_strip,count-role;other&character;joey:=chatting.png,It's actually a bit of a double-edged sword, because I have to always wear this mask or else my powers won't work right.
1-must_strip,count-role;other&character;juri:=dukes.png,Of course not! I'm not strong because of my gifts, I'm strong because I know how to use them!
1-must_strip,count-role;other&character;sakura:=happy.png,That's right! That's why joining the ARMS League was natural for me!
1-must_strip,count-role;other&character;akko:=chatting.png,There's no magic <i>or</i> music involved. The ARMS Ability lets me channel energy into the Sparkies to make them, well, <i>sparky</i>!
1-must_strip,count-role;other&character;aella:=chatting.png,Well, the Slapamander is like a big oven mitt that'll burn opponents if I charge it, and the Popper is like a big party popper that'll blow opponents away when charged!
1-must_strip,count-role;other&character;pa-15:=interested.png,Yeah...?
1-stripping=stripping.png,Let's go for the chest guard next. It's kinda restrictive, anyway, so it'll be nice to have it off.
1-stripping=stripping.png,My chest guard is kind of uncomfortable, so I'll take that off next.
1-stripping=stripping.png,Time for my chest guard to go. It's not like I need the protection right now, and it's kinda uncomfortable too.
1-stripping,marker:MandatoryChestGuard=stripping.png,Chest guards are pretty much mandatory in the ARMS League. Too bad mine isn't big enough to give me super armor!
1-stripping,marker:MandatoryChestGuard=stripping.png,Chest guards are pretty much mandatory in the ARMS League. You'd think with Arms that deal fire, electric, and explosive damage, we'd have more protection than that!
1-stripping,count-role;other&character;sei:=stripping.png,I don't know, to be honest. Whatever it does better be good. This thing wasn't cheap!
1-stripping,count-role;other&character;joey:,marker:MaskPowers=stripping.png,My arms would start coiling and uncoiling uncontrollably, changing shape and flopping around. It'd be very awkward without my mask!
1-stripping,count-role;other&character;natsuki:=stripping.png,Oh yeah, you should check out the classes at Spring Gym! If you're lucky, you might even see Spring Man there!
1-stripping,count-role;other&character;jessie:=stripping.png,Oh, I don't know about that. Twintelle fights without a chest guard, and I think it's because she's also... <i>blessed</i>.
1-stripping,count-role;other&character;amy:=stripping.png,Probably back when I first saw Spring Man -- the first one, not our current one -- fighting on TV.
1-stripping,count-role;other&character;sakura:=stripping.png,Sadly, that's also true. I've worn my fair share of restricting outfits on stage.
1-stripping,count-role;other&character;aella:=stripping.png,Those are the only three I use personally, but there are far more than that out there!
1-stripping,count-role;other&character;chazz:=stripping.png,Well <i>yeah</i>. Were the gloves not enough of an indication?
1-stripping,count-role;other&character;pa-15:=stripping.png,Which kind? The big ones or the multi-shot ones?
1-stripping,count-role;other&character;sayaka:=stripping.png,You might be surprised, Sayaka. I've seen some fighters whose outfits are both fashionable <i>and</i> functional for battle!
1-stripping,count-role;other&character;sayaka:,marker:MandatoryChestGuard=stripping.png,Chest guards are pretty much mandatory in the ARMS League. Too bad mine isn't big enough to give me super armor!
1-stripping,count-role;other&character;sayaka:,marker:MandatoryChestGuard=stripping.png,Chest guards are pretty much mandatory in the ARMS League. You'd think with Arms that deal fire, electric, and explosive damage, we'd have more protection than that!


#losing boots
2-stripped=stripped.png,Ah! Much better! Billy may make good chest guards, but all chest guards get uncomfortable after a bit!
2-stripped=stripped.png,That's better! Even though Billy makes good clothes, I still don't like wearing their chest guards!
2-stripped=stripped.png,Oh yeah, that's much better! Billy makes good clothes, but <i>no one</i> makes comfortable chest guards!
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;jessie:=stripped.png,Ah, the art of distraction! Never underestimate it. That's how Twintelle gets the jump on her opponents!
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;joey:=stripped.png,Believe me, it's not much fun, especially when you're trying to get work done!
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;pa-15:=stripped.png,Believe me, not a single one of my opponents will be thrown off by missile Arms. Especially the big ones, those are too slow!
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;sei:=stripped.png,Definitely! I feel that way when I put on an outfit for a stage performance, too!
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;sakura:=stripped.png,Heehee, yeah. Sometimes, anyway! Other times they hide them completely!
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;akko&saying;spirits:=stripped.png,I don't know about anyone else's, but last time I checked, mine doesn't have any!
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;amy:=stripped.png,It's okay to only have one hobby! That just means you can focus on your singing more!
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;aella:=stripped.png,Sure thing, but you'll have to help me narrow down what you want to know about!
2-stripped,count-role;self&saidmarker;MandatoryChestGuard:,marker:NoGuard=stripped.png,There are obvious exceptions to who has to wear a chest guard, though, like Byte and Barq! They're robots, so they're much more sturdy than us squishy humans!
2-stripped,count-role;self&saidmarker;MandatoryChestGuard:,marker:NoGuard=stripped.png,There are obvious exceptions to who has to wear a chest guard, though, like Mechanica! She fights in that super cool robot suit of hers, so she's already protected!
2-stripped,count-role;self&saidmarker;MandatoryChestGuard:,marker:NoGuard=stripped.png,There are obvious exceptions to who has to wear a chest guard, though, like Helix! He's made of slime, so he doesn't have a chest to guard!
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;chazz:=stripped.png,Why yes, it <i>does</i> work well for me! That's why I do it!
2-stripped,count-role;self&saidmarker;MandatoryChestGuard:,count-role;other&character;sayaka:=stripped.png,Yep! The ARMS League is all about fighters with stretchy arms!
2-stripped,count-role;self&saidmarker;MandatoryChestGuard:,count-role;other&character;sayaka:,marker:TwintelleHair=stripped.png,Yep! The ARMS League is all about fighters with stretchy arms - or sometimes other parts, like Twintelle's hair!
2-must_strip,count-role;self&losses;2:=flustered.png,Aw man, again already?
2-must_strip,count-role;self&losses;2:=flustered.png,Again? Well, alright!
2-must_strip,count-role;other&character;nami:=happy.png,Nope. This is the work of the ARMS ability! I just woke up one day and my hands were on the other side of the room!
2-must_strip,count-role;other&character;juri:=dukes.png,Of course not! I'm not strong because of my gifts, I'm strong because I know how to use them!
2-must_strip,count-role;other&character;aella:=happy.png,Oh yeah! There are Toasters, which are the fire equivalent of Sparkies, Phoenixes, which are curving Arms, and Dragons, which shoot a fiery laser!
2-must_strip,count-role;other&character;yuelia&var;yuelia&sayingmarker;ribbon_talented:=happy.png,Thank you, ~other~! I try my best!
2-must_strip,count-role;other&character;rin:=chatting.png,They sure can, Rin! The Arms ability can manifest in almost any body part! Twintelle even has it in her hair!
2-must_strip,count-role;self&losses;3:=annoyed.png,Three times in a row? Is someone here cheating?
2-must_strip,count-role;self&losses;3:=annoyed.png,Three times in a row? Come on, Ribbon Girl, get your head in the game!
2-must_strip,count-role;other&character;yuelia&sayingmarker;ribbon_name:=happy.png,Well, ribbons are kind of my thing, and "Ribbon Girl" is easy to remember!
2-stripping=stripping.png,One more for comfort: time to get out of these heels.
2-stripping=stripping.png,At least I get a chance to get out of these heels.
2-stripping=stripping.png,These boots might be fashionable, but they certainly aren't very comfortable!
2-stripping,count-role;other&character;aella:=stripping.png,Dragon's are great at pressuring your opponent. They're a bit too slow for me, but Min Min is great with them because she can keep one charged!
2-stripping,count-role;other&character;amy:=stripping.png,I box in them, dance in them, jump through the air in them.
2-stripping,count-role;other&character;sakura:=stripping.png,I like to think of my agility in heels as one of my hidden talents!
2-stripping,count-role;other&character;rin:=stripping.png,I wish I knew how to describe it to you. It's like... being able to reach things, but farther than normal...
2-stripping,count-role;other&character;chazz:=stripping.png,Idol club? I don't have a club, and I don't have time for apprentices either.
2-stripping,count-role;other&character;natsuki:=stripping.png,It's okay, Natsuki, I know I'm small... in the, um... yeah, it's okay.
2-stripping,count-role;other&character;akko:=stripping.png,Nope! If anything, these heels give me a <i>disadvantage</i> in fights, especially because of my mostly-aerial fighting style! Really, it's a miracle I haven't broken an ankle coming in for a landing yet!
2-stripping,count-role;other&character;sei:=stripping.png,Sang-whatnow? <i>Illegal?</i> No, these boots are legal, I'm pretty sure! Byte would've arrested me if they weren't, I wore these to our fight!
2-stripping,count-role;other&character;sayaka:=stripping.png,That's right. My arms will go all wonky if I don't have my mask on. It's not painful, but it's kind of embarrassing!
2-stripping,count-role;other&character;jessie:=stripping.png,You know, a lot of people ask that, but they're just regular boots. Everything you see me do in the ring is all me! Well, me and whatever Arms I'm using.


#losing shirt
3-stripped=stripped.png,I'll take off my socks too. I'm sure no one wants me standing around in my sweaty, stinky gym socks anyway!
3-stripped=stripped.png,I'll take off my socks too. I haven't had a chance to wash them, so they probably smell bad anyway!
3-stripped=stripped.png,I'll take off my socks too. No point stalling with them, and they probably stink too, so I'm doing you all two favors!
3-stripped,marker:PowerBoots=stripped.png,Some people think my boots are what let me dance through the air, but nope! That's all me! These just normal boots that anyone can buy!
3-stripped,marker:PowerBoots=stripped.png,Some people think my boots are what let me dance through the air, but nope! The ARMS ability isn't the <i>only</i> power I have!
3-stripped,marker:PowerBoots=stripped.png,If you've seen me in the ring, you'd see me dancing through the air like a ribbon in the wind. Some people think my boots do that for me, but no! That's one of my special powers!
3-stripped,count-role;other&character;natsuki:=stripped.png,... Hey, forget Spring Gym. <i>I'll</i> teach you how to box!
3-stripped,count-role;other&character;amy:=stripped.png,Good balance is important to fighting. You wouldn't want to get knocked on your butt everytime you take a hit, would you?
3-stripped,count-role;other&character;sakura:=stripped.png,Hey, maybe I should teach you some of my secrets about heels, Sakura!
3-stripped,count-role;other&character;chazz:=stripped.png,I don't know, if she doesn't want to be an idol, you shouldn't try to force her.
3-stripped,count-role;other&character;akko:=stripped.png,Oh, I wouldn't call it "flying." It's more like walking on air.
3-stripped,count-role;other&character;aella:=stripped.png,Probably not, but you could still use non-elemental Arms if you wanted to, like Megatons or Buffs!
3-stripped,count-role;other&character;sei:=stripped.png,What? No! They're just normal boots, I swear!
3-stripped,count-role;other&character;sayaka:=stripped.png,You're right! Hey, maybe one day, we'll see a Magical Girls League? Haha!
3-stripped,count-role;self&saidmarker;nickname==Fran:,count-role;other&character;sakura:=stripped.png,Hey, maybe I should teach you some of my secrets about heels, Fran!
3-must_strip,count-role;self&losses;2:=flustered.png,Aw man, again already?
3-must_strip,count-role;self&losses;2:=flustered.png,Again? Well, alright!
3-must_strip,count-role;self&losses;4:=annoyed.png,No way! That's four times in a row! There's no way this is all bad luck!
3-must_strip,count-role;other&character;juri:=dukes.png,Of course not! I'm not strong because of my gifts, I'm strong because I know how to use them!
3-must_strip,count-role;self&losses;3:=annoyed.png,Three times in a row? Is someone here cheating?
3-must_strip,count-role;self&losses;3:=annoyed.png,Three times in a row? Come on, Ribbon Girl, get your head in the game!
3-stripping=stripping.png,I <i>could</i> go for my skirt, but my shirt would show more skin, so that should be next, don't you think?
3-stripping=stripping.png,I think it's time for me to show a lot more skin, don't you think? I'll skip my skirt and take off my shirt instead.
3-stripping=stripping.png,My skirt <i>could</i> be next, but wouldn't it be more exciting if I took off my shirt instead?
3-stripping,count-role;other&character;chazz:=stripping.png,It's not all it's cracked up to be, you know. It can take a lot out of you sometimes!
3-stripping,count-role;other&character;sayaka:=stripping.png,Oh, you give me too much credit, Sayaka. I'm not saving the world. I'm just an entertainer.


#losing skirt
4-stripped=stripped.png,Th-there. Better than just seeing more of my shorts, r-right?
4-stripped=stripped.png,My time at the gym sure does pay off, doesn't it?
4-stripped=stripped.png,Like what you see so far?
4-stripped=wink.png,Like my bra? It's a Billy-brand bra, just like the rest of my outfit. My panties are also by Billy, but you'll have to work a little harder if you want to see them!
4-stripped,count-role;other&character;chazz:=happy.png,I guess I'm lucky to have never needed to punch creepy fans.
4-stripped,count-role;other&character;sayaka:=happy.png,I'm certainly proud of my fans, at least!
4-stripped,count-role;other&character;sei:=embarrassed.png,Nanomachines? No, I work out, I just... don't have a great diet...
4-stripped,count-role;other&character;akko:=embarrassed.png,Oh, yeah, I, um... don't exactly have most strict of diets...
4-stripped,count-role;other&character;amy:,marker:MaskPowers=flustered.png,Yeah, I kind of have too, or else I'd lose control of my powers! My arms would be all over the floor!
4-must_strip,count-role;self&losses;2:=flustered.png,I lost again?... Are you sure...?
4-must_strip,count-role;self&losses;2:=flustered.png,Again already?...
4-must_strip,count-role;self&losses;3:=annoyed.png,No way! Three times in a row? You've got to be kidding!
4-must_strip,count-role;self&losses;3:=annoyed.png,Th-three times in a row? No way! Someone must be cheating!

#These lines are spoken when an opponent must strip, but the character does not yet know what they will take off.

#The "human" versions of the lines will only be spoken if the human player is stripping.

#OPPONENT REMOVING ACCESSORY
#These lines are spoken when an opponent removes a small item that does not cover any skin.
#Typically, characters are fine with this when they are fully dressed but less satisfied as they become more naked.
#Note that all "removing" lines are NOT spoken to human players. Characters will skip straight from "6-male_human_must_strip" to "6-male_removed_accessory", for example.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

#OPPONENT REMOVING MAJOR CLOTHING
#Major clothing reveals a significant amount of skin and likely underwear.
#However, as we don't know if the opponent is taking off the top or the bottom, we can't presume that nice abs are showing; maybe she took of her skirt before her shirt.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

4-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;3:=chatting.png,Not a fan of skirts, huh? I'm pretty fond of them, myself. Most of my outfits involve one, if not a dress.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;1:=flustered.png,Well, at least you're playing unpredictably! That's always good!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;1:=flustered.png,Way to keep your opponents on their toes, I guess!

4-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;cammy_white:=chatting.png,You should try some of Billy's stuff - the brand, that is, not some guy! My whole outfit was manufactured by them! It's very comfy and very tough!

5-male_crotch_will_be_visible=happy.png,This is what I've been waiting for!
5-male_crotch_will_be_visible=happy.png,I've been waiting all game for this!

5-male_small_crotch_is_visible=cheer.png,A-alright! Yay!...
5-male_small_crotch_is_visible=happy.png,Uh... Hey, you shouldn't judge things based on appearance. That little noodle might be able to turn into a dragon!

5-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;cammy_white:,id:49=chatting.png,Sure thing, take your time. My shorts ripped in a fight once, and that was bad enough!
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;6:=flustered.png,The order you took everything off in sure was... odd, but definitely made things exciting!

5-female_small_chest_is_visible=flustered.png,Don't worry, mine aren't that big either, as you can kinda see.
5-female_small_chest_is_visible=chatting.png,I'm sure there's someone somewhere who'll love those!
5-female_small_chest_is_visible=happy.png,They're kinda cute!
5-female_small_chest_is_visible=dukes.png,A-ah, I see, you're just built for speed, that's all!
5-female_small_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;saki_zls:=happy.png,Ah, glad you could pull yourself together!
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible=flustered.png,Haha. You got me beat in the size department.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible=chatting.png,You should be proud of those, ~name~. I would be!
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible=flustered.png,Aha. Suddenly I'm reminded of a certain bouncy dork that I know.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible=flustered.png,Aha. Suddenly I'm reminded of a certain jiggly goofball that I know.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;joey&notsaidmarker;NonMagicStrip3:=flustered.png,Ah, see, that's not so bad. It was just your tie.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;2:=dukes.png,Better watch out, Twilight! I'm catching on to your strategy! Haha!
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;aella&sayingmarker;NoBra:=chatting.png,Have you ever tried a sports bra? I'm sure one would fit your needs better than a regular one!
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;7:=chatting.png,It's nice to see that you're not shy about this, at least!
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;croix&stage;4:=shocked.png,Oh! That... was a neat trick!
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;ini:=annoyed.png,So, this whole time you were pulling a drunken fist on us, huh? Well it looks like the joke's on you, because it didn't save you from stripping so much!
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;cammy_white:=wink.png,You look great! Now let's hope you won't be going home like this!
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;rarity_eg&saying;photo:=annoyed.png,Y-yeah, ~player~! Taking non-consensual photos is a <i>super</i> scummy thing to do, so don't do it!

6-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;3:=chatting.png,Not a fan of skirts, huh? I'm pretty fond of them, myself. Most of my outfits involve one, if not a dress.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;1:=flustered.png,Well, at least you're playing unpredictably! That's always good!

-3-male_chest_is_visible=wink.png,Half-naked is a good start, but I hope you don't plan on stopping here.
-3-male_chest_is_visible=happy.png,Ooh, I sure would like to have a feel.
-3-male_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;9s:=flustered.png,N-no nipples? Your the most anatomically correct robot I've ever seen, so I just figured...

-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible=shocked.png,That's humongous! How'd it even get that big?
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible=shocked.png,That thing is in a weight class of its own!
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible=shocked.png,You could use that for weight training!
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible=shocked.png,Whoa! You could get fit lifting that!
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible=happy.png,I guess it's time for you to show off your goods too, huh?

-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;cammy_white:,id:49=chatting.png,Sure thing, take your time. My shorts ripped in a fight once, and that was bad enough!
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;6:=flustered.png,The order you took everything off in sure was... odd, but definitely made things exciting!
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;croix&stage;3:=interested.png,Two items at once again?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;joey&notsaidmarker;NonMagicStrip3:=chatting.png,Well, I guess you don't have much to lose if this goes wrong.

-3-female_small_chest_is_visible=flustered.png,Haha, they're just like mine.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible=flustered.png,I bet we're the same size. Ahaha...
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible=chatting.png,Uh... Hey, small breasts have their advantages!
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;saki_zls:=happy.png,Ah, glad you could pull yourself together!
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible=embarrassed.png,Ah. Mine must look pretty small next to those...
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible=flustered.png,Th-there, this isn't so bad, is it?
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible=happy.png,It's becoming more and more like a locker room here by the moment. Aha...
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible=chatting.png,Welcome to team skins. Ahaha...
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;joey&notsaidmarker;NonMagicStrip3:=flustered.png,Ah, see, that's not so bad. It was just your tie.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;2:=dukes.png,Better watch out, Twilight! I'm catching on to your strategy! Haha!
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;aella&sayingmarker;NoBra:=chatting.png,Have you ever tried a sports bra? I'm sure one would fit your needs better than a regular one!
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;7:=happy.png,It's nice to see that you're not as shy about this as I am, at least!
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;croix&stage;4:=shocked.png,Oh! That... was a neat trick!
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;ini:=annoyed.png,So, this whole time you were pulling a drunken fist on us, huh? Well it looks like the joke's on you, because it didn't save you from stripping so much!
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;cammy_white:=wink.png,You look great! Now let's hope you won't be going home like this!
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;rarity_eg&saying;photo:=annoyed.png,Y-yeah, ~player~! Taking non-consensual photos is a <i>super</i> scummy thing to do, so don't do it!
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;cammy_white&saidmarker;juri_help:,count-role;other&character;juri:=cheer.png,Nice counter, Cammy!
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,priority:302,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&saidmarker;pinka_start&notsaidmarker;pinka_end2:=interested.png,... Are you doing this intentionally or not...?

-3-female_large_chest_is_visible=embarrassed.png,Wow... Those absolutely dwarf mine...
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible=embarrassed.png,I wonder how small mine look next to those...
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible=happy.png,Compared to you, I must look like I don't have breasts at all! Hahaha...
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;chun-li&saidmarker;juri_attack:,count-role;other&character;juri:,id:46=cheer.png,Aw yeah! Nice reversal!
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,priority:301,count-role;target&character;erufuda:,count-role;other&saying;fries:=embarrassed.png,I <i>do</i> eat fries, though...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible=dukes.png,If I'm going down, I'm taking you with me!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible=cheer.png,Drop ~clothing.ifPlural('em like they're|it like it's)~ hot!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible=happy.png,♪There ~clothing.ifPlural(go|goes)~ your ~clothing~!♪
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;2:=dukes.png,I see right through you now!... Er, I mean, I see through your strategy. Important stuff first.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;0:=shocked.png,Oh gosh! I can't say I ever expected you to pick <i>those</i> first!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;joey&notsaidmarker;NonMagicStrip2:=flustered.png,Uh, yeah, t-totally!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;cammy_white:,id:48=flustered.png,Wait, h-how do you end up tearing your leotard while taking it off? It's your own leotard, you should know how to take it off!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;cammy_white&saidmarker;chunli_help:,count-role;other&character;chun-li:=shocked.png,<i>Wait, what are you doing, Chun-Li?</i>
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;juri&saidmarker;mika_lifting:,count-role;other&character;rainbow_mika:,id:57=wink.png,If you let yourself get grabbed this easily, you wouldn't last long in the ARMS League!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika&saidmarker;cammy_help:,count-role;other&character;cammy_white:,id:51=shocked.png,Whoa! A special move!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,priority:302,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&saidmarker;pinka_start&notsaidmarker;pinka_end2:=dukes.png,Don't worry, Byte taught me how to deal with knife-wielding opponents!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-not_chest_visible&role;target:,id:18=happy.png,Ah, not quite how I prefer to undress, but go ahead and sing this song your own way!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible=flustered.png,I wonder who'll be out first, ~name~, you or me?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible=happy.png,I wonder which of us will be able to last longer?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible=dukes.png,Think you can still come out on top, ~name~?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible=chatting.png,By the way, if you haven't already, I recommend getting some Billy-brand underwear. Very comfortable stuff!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;3:=chatting.png,Not a fan of skirts, huh? I'm pretty fond of them, myself. Most of my outfits involve one, if not a dress.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;1:=flustered.png,Well, at least you're playing unpredictably! That's always good!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;1:=flustered.png,Way to keep your opponents on their toes, I guess!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;joey&notsaidmarker;NonMagicStrip2:=shocked.png,Whoa! Clowns sure do know how to keep me on my toes!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;3&sayingmarker;twilight_not_human:,marker:TwilightIsPony=shocked.png,W-wait, did you just say "<i>pony</i>?" You're a horse?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;cammy_white:=chatting.png,You should try some of Billy's stuff - the brand, that is, not some guy! My whole outfit was manufactured by them! It's very comfy and very tough!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;cammy_white&saidmarker;chunli_help:,count-role;other&character;chun-li:=flustered.png,A-at least you gave Cammy a reason to get a new leotard! Why not get one by Billy? That's the brand that manufactured my costume! They make good stuff!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;human:,count-role;self&saidmarker;WagerStart:,id:15=embarrassed.png,O-oh wow... M-maybe losing to you wouldn't be so bad...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika&saidmarker;cammy_help:,count-role;other&character;cammy_white:=cheer.png,That was really cool!... Y-you should probably get off of Cammy now, though.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,priority:302,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&saidmarker;pinka_start&notsaidmarker;pinka_end2:=flustered.png,Oh, if all you're going to do is cut your clothes off, then I guess it's fine if you keep your knife.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-not_chest_visible&role;target:,id:17=dukes.png,Not quite unorthodox. More like southpaw!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-shaved&role;target:,id:25=flustered.png,Oh! You shave there, huh? I meant to do that too, but I couldn't find the time...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-shaved&role;target:,id:25=flustered.png,Oh! Y-you shaved? I would've done that too, but I can never find the time...

#OPPONENT MASTURBATING
#When an opponent is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must pay the penalty by masturbating in front of everyone.
#The "must_masturbate" line is for just before it happens, and the "start_masturbating" line immediately follows.
#The "masturbating" line will be spoken a little after the opponent has started but before they climax.
#When the opponent climaxes, your character will say the "finished_masturbating" line.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

#SELF MASTURBATING
#If your character is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must masturbate.
#These lines only come up in the relevant stages, so you don't need to include the stage numbers here. Just remember which stage is which when you make the images. The "starting" image is still in the naked stage.
#The "finished_masturbating" line will repeat many times if the game is not yet finished. This plays as opponents comment on the how good their hands are.

#Items of clothing should be listed here in order of removal.
#The values are formal name, lower case name, how much they cover, what they cover
#Please do not put spaces around the commas.
#"Important" clothes cover genitals (lower) or chest/breasts (upper). For example: bras, panties, a skirt when going commando.
#"Major" clothes cover underwear. For example: skirts, pants, shirts, dresses.
#"Minor" clothes cover skin or are large pieces of clothing that do not cover skin. For example: jackets, socks, stockings, gloves.
#"Extra" clothes are small items that may or may not be clothing but do not cover anything interesting. For example: jewelry, shoes or boots with socks underneath, belts, hats. In the rest of the code, "extra" clothes are called "accessory".
#If for some reason you write another word for the type of clothes (e.g. "accessory"), other characters will not react at all when the clothing is removed.
#What they cover = upper (upper body), lower (lower body), other (neither).
#The game can support any number of entries, but typically we use 2-8, with at least one "important" layer for upper and lower (each).

#Notes on dialogue
#All lines that start with a # symbol are comments and will be ignored by the tool that converts this file into a xml file for the game.
#Where more than one line has an identical type, like "swap_cards" and "swap_cards", the game will randomly select one of these lines each time the character is in that situation.
#You should try to include multiple lines for most stages, especially the final (finished) stage, -1. 

#A character goes through multiple stages as they undress. The stage number starts at zero and indicates how many layers they have removed. Special stage numbers are used when they are nude (-3), masturbating (-2), and finished (-1).
#Line types that start with a number will only display during that stage. The will override any numberless stage-generic lines. For example, in stage 4 "4-swap_cards" will be used over "swap_cards" if it is not blank here. Giving a character unique dialogue for each stage is an effective way of showing their changing openness/shyness as the game progresses.
#You can combine the above points and make multiple lines for a particular situation in a particular stage, like "4-swap_cards" and "4-swap_cards".

#Some special words can be used that will be substituted by the game for context-appropriate ones: ~name~ is the name of the character they're speaking to, but this only works if someone else is in focus. ~clothing~ is the type of clothing that is being removed by another player. ~Clothing~ is almost the same, but it starts with a capital letter in case you want to start a sentence with it.
#~name~ can be used any time a line targets an opponent (game_over_defeat, _must_strip, _removing_, _removed, _must_masturbate, etc).
#~clothing~ can be used only when clothing is being removed (_removing and _removed, but NOT _must_strip).
#~player~ can be used at any time and refers to the human player.
#~cards~ can be used only in the swap_cards lines.
#All wildcards can be used once per line only! If you use ~name~ twice, the code will show up the second time.

#Lines can be written that are only spoken when specific other characters are present. For a detailed explanation, read this guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/spnati/comments/6nhaj0/the_easy_way_to_write_targeted_lines/
#Here is an example line (note that targeted lines must have a stage number):
#0-female_must_strip,target:hermione=happy,Looks like your magic doesn't help with poker!

#When swapping cards, the game will automatically put a display a number between 0-5 where you write ~cards~.

#losing gloves
0-must_strip,alsoPlaying:aella=flustered.png,Oh, uh, it... kinda just does this naturally. It's been like this ever since I got the ARMS ability.
0-must_strip,alsoPlaying:akko=wink.png,Sorry, no, I'm not Twintelle. I'm Ribbon Girl!
0-must_strip,alsoPlaying:akko=wink.png,Maybe. There's more than one of us punch girls, you know! If it's Ribbon Girl you're thinking of, that's me!
0-must_strip,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=happy.png,Hmm... How about "Lady Dread?"
0-must_strip,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0-6,alsoPlayingSaying:claw,marker:JuraRedClaw=happy.png,Ooh, that sounds cool! Why the "claw," though? You don't have a claw.
0-must_strip,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0-6,alsoPlayingSaying:spring,marker:JuraSprings=happy.png,I don't go by "Spring-Arms" because my arms are made of ribbons. <i>Spring Man</i> has spring arms, but not me.
0-must_strip,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=happy.png,Oh, an explanation is easy: I have the ARMS ability! It gives me stretchy arms!
0-must_strip,alsoPlaying:nami=happy.png,I guess this Luffy of yours also has the ARMS Ability?
0-must_strip,alsoPlaying:revy,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=annoyed.png,Whether you believe it or not, I <i>am</i> a boxer, and I've got enough fans to where your jeering means nothing to me!
0-must_strip,alsoPlaying:sakura=happy.png,Not only did I pick it, I designed it myself! I went for a balance between sporty and cute!
0-must_strip,alsoPlaying:sayaka=happy.png,I can dance through the air like a ribbon in the wind!
0-must_strip,alsoPlaying:sei=happy.png,Oh! A fan, huh? Yep, it's me, the one and only Ribbon Girl!
0-must_strip,totalRounds:0=flustered.png,Aw, dang, I'm not usually the first to get hit when the bell rings.
0-must_strip,totalRounds:0=dukes.png,Aha! I won't be caught cold today! I may be first to strip, but I won't get knocked out that easily!
0-must_strip_winning=flustered.png,Darn! There goes my perfect!
0-must_strip_winning=happy.png,Heh heh, I knew I wouldn't get through this without taking <i>something</i> off.
0-must_strip_winning=happy.png,Well, this wouldn't be strip poker if I didn't <i>strip</i> something!

0-stripping=stripping.png,Let's start smart: Sparkies first. This'll make it easier to take everything else off.
0-stripping=stripping.png,I'm going to do myself a favor and take my Sparkies off first. This'll make taking other things off easier.
0-stripping,marker:NoFumbling=stripping.png,If you were hoping I'd keep my Sparkies on the whole time and fumble taking off my clothes, sorry to disappoint you!
0-stripping=stripping.png,I don't want to have a tough time taking my other things off, so I'll start with my Sparkies.
0-stripping,marker:SparkiesTalk=stripping.png,These are one of my signature Arms: Sparkies. They shock opponents when charged, leaving them wide open if the hit lands!
0-stripping,marker:SparkiesTalk=stripping.png,These are one of my signature Arms: Sparkies. They're medium weight, glove-type Arms. Simple, but effective!
0-stripping,marker:SparkiesTalk=stripping.png,These are one of my favorite Arms: Sparkies. Medium weight, glove-type, electric Arms. What's not to love?
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:aella=stripping.png,Oh, "Sparkie" is the name of the glove type. These are weapons known as "ARMS," and they're the eletric variant of the glove-like ARMS!
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:akko=stripping.png,They're not magical, but they certainly are shocking! One charged punch leaves my opponent wide open for a follow-up!
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0-5,alsoPlayingSaying:Stretchy=stripping.png,I swear I'm not a robot, Meia! If you won't take my word for it, why don't you come over and feel me?
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:nami=stripping.png,Rubber, huh? Sounds like he might be resistant to my Sparkie's shock effects!
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan=wink.png,I actually have a team of typists follow me around all day to type things for me... Just kidding! I take them off first, silly!
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:sakura=stripping.png,Oh, no, Sparkie is the name of the ARM. If I'd name them, I'll probably go with "Jupiter" and "Zeus" or something like that!
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:sayaka=stripping.png,They sure do! They're mid-weight, glove-type Arms that dish out an electric shock when charged!
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:sayaka,marker:SparkiesTalk=stripping.png,These are one of my signature Arms: Sparkies. They shock opponents when charged, leaving them wide open if the hit lands!

#losing chest guard
1-stripped=stripped.png,Why yes, I <i>do</i> have hands underneath.
1-stripped,marker:SurprisedAtHands=strippedO.png,Ohmigosh, <i>hands</i>!
1-stripped=stripped.png,Must be strange to see an ARMS fighter's hands, huh?
1-stripped=stripped.png,Can you believe some people think I don't have hands?
1-stripped,marker:SurprisedAtHands=strippedO.png,<i>Whoa! Hands! Mind blowing!</i>
1-stripped,marker:SurprisedAtHands=strippedO.png,My hands! I haven't see these in <i>years</i>!
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:aella=happy.png,It's the name of the glove type, Aella. Those one's are Sparkies, but there's also Toasters, Buffs, Bubbs, and more!
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:akko=flustered.png,Uh... Sorry, Akko, I <i>don't</i> know who you are.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:mavis=stripped.png,Can you believe some people think I don't have hands?
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:misty_hgss=happy.png,I do, do I, Misty? What about me reminds you of them?
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:nami=flustered.png,Wow, uh... Y-yeah, I get what you mean! I-it must be pretty cool, being able to do that!
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:sakura=wink.png,Heheh, no need to tell <i>me</i> that!
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:sayaka,saidMarker:SparkiesTalk=happy.png,Oh, I can't take credit for that. The Sparkies do all the work creating electicity. All I do is charge them.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:0-8=wink.png,Tell you what, you manage to win this game, I'll let you try them as much as you like!
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:9-10=happy.png,Sure, just as long as you wash your hands first.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:twilight=stripped.png,Oh, sorry, "Sparkie" is the name of my Arms -- er, the gloves, not <i>these</i> arms.
1-stripped,saidMarker:SparkiesTalk,marker:OtherSignatureArms=happy.png,I like to use Slapamanders and Poppers too. Both are great at a distance and help me keep my mobility!
1-stripped,saidMarker:SparkiesTalk,marker:OtherSignatureArms=happy.png,I like to use Slapamanders and Poppers too. Poppers are especially good at preventing me from getting cornered!
1-stripped,saidMarker:SparkiesTalk,marker:OtherGloveArms=happy.png,If you've ever seen Spring Man's Toasters, they're really similar, except <i>those</i> heat up with flames when charged!
1-stripped,saidMarker:SparkiesTalk,marker:OtherGloveArms=happy.png,If you've ever seen Ninjara's Buffs, they're really similar, except they have no element, but have better curving abilities and puff up when charged!
1-must_strip,alsoPlaying:akko=happy.png,There's no magic <i>or</i> music involved. The ARMS Ability lets me channel energy into the Sparkies to make them, well, <i>sparky</i>!
1-must_strip,alsoPlaying:sakura=happy.png,That's right! That's why joining the ARMS League was natural for me!
1-must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2=flustered.png,Aw man, again already?
1-must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2=flustered.png,Again? Well, alright!
1-stripping=stripping.png,Let's go for the chest guard next. It's kinda restrictive, anyway, so it'll be nice to have it off.
1-stripping=stripping.png,My chest guard is kind of uncomfortable, so I'll take that off next.
1-stripping=stripping.png,Time for my chest guard to go. It's not like I need the protection right now, and it's kinda uncomfortable too.
1-stripping,marker:MandatoryChestGuard=stripping.png,Chest guards are pretty much mandatory in the ARMS League. Too bad mine isn't big enough to give me super armor!
1-stripping,marker:MandatoryChestGuard=stripping.png,Chest guards are pretty much mandatory in the ARMS League. You'd think with Arms that deal fire, electric, and explosive damage, we'd have more protection than that!
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:sakura=stripping.png,Sadly, that's also true. I've worn my fair share of restricting outfits on stage.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:sayaka=stripping.png,You might be surprised, Sayaka. I've seen some fighters whose outfits are both fashionable <i>and</i> functional for battle!
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:sayaka,marker:MandatoryChestGuard=stripping.png,Chest guards are pretty much mandatory in the ARMS League. Too bad mine isn't big enough to give me super armor!
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:sayaka,marker:MandatoryChestGuard=stripping.png,Chest guards are pretty much mandatory in the ARMS League. You'd think with Arms that deal fire, electric, and explosive damage, we'd have more protection than that!
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:sei=stripping.png,I don't know, to be honest. Whatever it does better be good. This thing wasn't cheap!


#losing boots
2-stripped=stripped.png,Ah! Much better!
2-stripped=stripped.png,That's better!
2-stripped=stripped.png,Oh yeah, that's much better!
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:akko,alsoPlayingSaying:spirits=stripped.png,I don't know about anyone else's, but last time I checked, mine doesn't have any!
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:sakura=stripped.png,Heehee, yeah. Sometimes, anyway! Other times they hide them completely!
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:sayaka,saidMarker:MandatoryChestGuard=stripped.png,Yep! The ARMS League is all about fighters with stretchy arms!
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:sayaka,saidMarker:MandatoryChestGuard,marker:TwintelleHair=stripped.png,Yep! The ARMS League is all about fighters with stretchy arms - or sometimes other parts, like Twintelle's hair!
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:sei=stripped.png,Definitely! I feel that way when I put on an outfit for a stage performance, too!
2-stripped,saidMarker:MandatoryChestGuard,marker:NoGuard=stripped.png,There are obvious exceptions to who has to wear a chest guard, though, like Byte and Barq! They're robots, so they're much more sturdy than us squishy humans!
2-stripped,saidMarker:MandatoryChestGuard,marker:NoGuard=stripped.png,There are obvious exceptions to who has to wear a chest guard, though, like Mechanica! She fights in that super cool robot suit of hers, so she's already protected!
2-stripped,saidMarker:MandatoryChestGuard,marker:NoGuard=stripped.png,There are obvious exceptions to who has to wear a chest guard, though, like Helix! He's made of slime, so he doesn't have a chest to guard!
2-must_strip,alsoPlaying:nami=happy.png,Nope. This is the work of the ARMS ability! I just woke up one day and my hands were on the other side of the room!
2-must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2=flustered.png,Aw man, again already?
2-must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2=flustered.png,Again? Well, alright!
2-must_strip,consecutiveLosses:3=annoyed.png,Three times in a row? Is someone here cheating?
2-must_strip,consecutiveLosses:3=annoyed.png,Three times in a row? Come on, Ribbon Girl, get your head in the game!
2-stripping=stripping.png,One more for comfort: time to get out of these heels.
2-stripping=stripping.png,At least I get a chance to get out of these heels.
2-stripping=stripping.png,These boots might be fashionable, but they certainly aren't very comfortable!
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:akko=stripping.png,Nope! If anything, these heels give me a <i>disadvantage</i> in fights, especially because of my mostly-aerial fighting style! Really, it's a miracle I haven't broken an ankle coming in for a landing yet!
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:sakura=stripping.png,I like to think of my agility in heels as one of my hidden talents!
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:sayaka=stripping.png,That's right. My arms will go all wonky if I don't have my mask on. It's not painful, but it's kind of embarrassing!
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:sei=stripping.png,Sang-whatnow? <i>Illigal?</i> No, these boots are legal, I'm pretty sure! Byte would've arrested me if they weren't, I wore these to our fight!


#losing shirt
3-stripped=stripped.png,I'll take off my socks too. I'm sure no one wants me standing around in my sweaty, stinky gym socks anyway!
3-stripped=stripped.png,I'll take off my socks too. I haven't had a chance to wash them, so they probably smell bad anyway!
3-stripped=stripped.png,I'll take off my socks too. No point stalling with them, and they probably stink too, so I'm doing you all two favors!
3-stripped,marker:PowerBoots=stripped.png,Some people think my boots are what let me dance through the air, but nope! That's all me! These just normal boots that anyone can buy!
3-stripped,marker:PowerBoots=stripped.png,Some people think my boots are what let me dance through the air, but nope! The ARMS ability isn't the <i>only</i> power I have!
3-stripped,marker:PowerBoots=stripped.png,If you've seen me in the ring, you'd see me dancing through the air like a ribbon in the wind. Some people think my boots do that for me, but no! That's one of my special powers!
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:akko=stripped.png,Oh, I wouldn't call it "flying." It's more like walking on air.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:sakura=stripped.png,Hey, maybe I should teach you some of my secrets about heels, Sakura!
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:sakura,saidMarker:nickname==Fran=stripped.png,Hey, maybe I should teach you some of my secrets about heels, Fran!
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:sayaka=stripped.png,You're right! Hey, maybe one day, we'll see a Magical Girls League? Haha!
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:sei=stripped.png,What? No! They're just normal boots, I swear!
3-must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2=flustered.png,Aw man, again already?
3-must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2=flustered.png,Again? Well, alright!
3-must_strip,consecutiveLosses:3=annoyed.png,Three times in a row? Is someone here cheating?
3-must_strip,consecutiveLosses:3=annoyed.png,Three times in a row? Come on, Ribbon Girl, get your head in the game!
3-must_strip,consecutiveLosses:4=annoyed.png,No way! That's four times in a row! There's no way this is all bad luck!
3-stripping=stripping.png,I <i>could</i> go for my skirt, but my shirt would show more skin, so that should be next, don't you think?
3-stripping=stripping.png,I think it's time for me to show a lot more skin, don't you think? I'll skip my skirt and take off my shirt instead.
3-stripping=stripping.png,My skirt <i>could</i> be next, but wouldn't it be more exciting if I took off my shirt instead?
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:sayaka=stripping.png,Oh, you give me too much credit, Sayaka. I'm not saving the world. I'm just an entertainer.

4-stripping=stripping.png,No skipping this time. Off comes my skirt.
4-stripping=stripping.png,Back to stripping sensibly. Skirt time!
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:sayaka=stripping.png,Well, just recently, I fought against Kid Cobra. You can probably guess, but his arms looks like snakes, and he was as slippery as one too!
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:sayaka=stripping.png,Well, just recently, I fought against Helix. He's a man - I think? - made of goo! His fighting style was, uh... interesting!

#OPPONENT MUST STRIP
#These lines are spoken when an opponent must strip, but the character does not yet know what they will take off.
#Writing different variations is important here, as these lines will be spoken about thirty times per game.
#The "human" versions of the lines will only be spoken if the human player is stripping.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

#OPPONENT REMOVING ACCESSORY
#These lines are spoken when an opponent removes a small item that does not cover any skin.
#Typically, characters are fine with this when they are fully dressed but less satisfied as they become more naked.
#Note that all "removing" lines are NOT spoken to human players. Characters will skip straight from "6-male_human_must_strip" to "6-male_removed_accessory", for example.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

#OPPONENT REMOVING MAJOR CLOTHING
#Major clothing reveals a significant amount of skin and likely underwear.
#However, as we don't know if the opponent is taking off the top or the bottom, we can't presume that nice abs are showing; maybe she took of her skirt before her shirt.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

6-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=flustered.png,N-no nipples? Your the most anatomically correct robot I've ever seen, so I just figured...
6-male_crotch_will_be_visible=happy.png,Here comes the best part!
6-male_crotch_will_be_visible=happy.png,This is what I've been waiting for!
6-male_crotch_will_be_visible=happy.png,I've been waiting all game for this!
6-male_crotch_will_be_visible=happy.png,Here comes my favorite lyric!
6-male_small_crotch_is_visible=happy.png,Oh, uh... Not bad!
6-male_small_crotch_is_visible=flustered.png,Hey, you know what they say: "one man's trash is another man's treasure."
6-male_small_crotch_is_visible=cheer.png,A-alright! Yay!...
6-male_small_crotch_is_visible=happy.png,Uh... Hey, you shouldn't judge things based on appearance. That little noodle might be able to turn into a dragon!
6-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,id:5=flustered.png,Heh. I'm kinda surprised you're not hard yet.
6-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,id:5=dukes.png,You're one loss away from defeat, but don't you dare give up, or I might beat you harder than you'd be beating yourself!
6-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,id:5=wink.png,O-oh, I was expecting you to be hard. Want me to change that? Haha.
6-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,id:5=wink.png,It's pretty nice, but can you deactivate lasers with it? Hahaha.
6-male_large_crotch_is_visible=shocked.png,I've never seen one so big before!
6-male_large_crotch_is_visible=shocked.png,Whoa! That thing must give your lower body quite a workout!
6-male_large_crotch_is_visible=shocked.png,You could hurt someone with that thing!
6-male_large_crotch_is_visible=shocked.png,Whoa! Your girth stat certainly is high!
6-female_chest_will_be_visible=embarrassed.png,Your ~clothing~, huh? I'll probably be in that position pretty soon, too...
6-female_chest_will_be_visible=flustered.png,If it's any consolation, I'll probably be topless soon too.
6-female_chest_will_be_visible=flustered.png,I feel kind of bad for you, ~name~. Want me to take my bra off too? Aha...
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:cammy_white,id:49=happy.png,Sure thing, take your time. My shorts ripped in a fight once, and that was bad enough!
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:cammy_white,targetSaidMarker:juri_help,alsoPlaying:juri=shocked.png,Behind you!

6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:chun-li,targetSaidMarker:juri_attack,alsoPlaying:juri,alsoPlayingStage:4,id:45=shocked.png,Whoa watch out!

6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ini,targetSayingMarker:ini_personality,id:42=shocked.png,<i>What the what?</i>
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:joey,targetNotSaidMarker:NonMagicStrip3=happy.png,Well, I guess you don't have much to lose if this goes wrong.
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=shocked.png,Whoa! Your bra next? I guess I shouldn't be surprised!
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:6=flustered.png,The order you took everything off in sure was... odd, but definitely made things exciting!
6-female_small_chest_is_visible=flustered.png,Don't worry, mine aren't that big either, as you can kinda see.
6-female_small_chest_is_visible=flustered.png,I'm sure there's someone somewhere who'll love those!
6-female_small_chest_is_visible=happy.png,They're kinda cute!
6-female_small_chest_is_visible=dukes.png,A-ah, I see, you're just built for speed, that's all!
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible=flustered.png,Haha. You got me beat in the size department.
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible=happy.png,You should be proud of those, ~name~. I would be!
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible=flustered.png,Aha. Suddenly I'm reminded of a certain bouncy dork that I know.
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible=flustered.png,Aha. Suddenly I'm reminded of a certain jiggly goofball that I know.
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible=annoyed.png,So, this whole time you were pulling a drunken fist on us, huh? Well it looks like the joke's on you, because it didn't save you from stripping so much!
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aella,targetSayingMarker:NoBra=happy.png,Have you ever tried a sports bra? I'm sure one would fit your needs better than a regular one!
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:cammy_white=wink.png,You look great! Now let's hope you won't be going home like this!
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:cammy_white,targetSaidMarker:juri_help,alsoPlaying:juri=cheer.png,Nice counter, Cammy!
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetNotSaidMarker:NonMagicStrip3=flustered.png,Ah, see, that's not so bad. It was just your tie.
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rarity_eg,targetSaying:photo=annoyed.png,Y-yeah, ~player~! Taking non-consentual photos is a <i>super</i> scummy thing to do, so don't do it!
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=dukes.png,Better watch out, Twilight! I'm catching on to your strategy! Haha!
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:7=happy.png,It's nice to see that you're not shy about this, at least!
6-female_large_chest_is_visible=flustered.png,With breasts like those on display, do you even need to see mine? Hahaha...
6-female_large_chest_is_visible=embarrassed.png,It's going to be hard to follow-up those...
6-female_large_chest_is_visible=flustered.png,Aha, that's going to be a hard act to follow...
6-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:chun-li,targetSaidMarker:juri_attack,alsoPlaying:juri,id:46=cheer.png,Aw yeah! Nice reversal!
6-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:erufuda,alsoPlayingSaying:fries=embarrassed.png,I <i>do</i> eat fries, though...
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible=happy.png,Hope you enjoyed your ~clothing~ while ~clothing.ifPlural(they|it)~ lasted, at least!
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible=sing.png,♪I'm sorry about your ~clothing~, ~name~, but not sorry about your losing, ~name~!♪

6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:cammy_white,id:48=flustered.png,Wait, h-how do you end up tearing your leotard while taking it off? It's your own leotard, you should know how to take it off!
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:cammy_white,targetSaidMarker:chunli_help,alsoPlaying:chun-li=shocked.png,<i>Wait, what are you doing, Chun-Li?</i>
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:joey,targetNotSaidMarker:NonMagicStrip2=flustered.png,Uh, yeah, t-totally!
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:juri,targetSaidMarker:mika_lifting,alsoPlaying:rainbow_mika,id:57=wink.png,If you let yourself get grabbed this easily, you wouldn't last long in the ARMS League!
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika,targetSaidMarker:cammy_help,alsoPlaying:cammy_white,id:51=shocked.png,Whoa! A special move!
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=shocked.png,Oh gosh! I can't say I ever expected you to pick <i>those</i> first!
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=dukes.png,I see right through you now!... Er, I mean, I see through your strategy. Important stuff first.
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStatus:not_chest_visible,id:18=happy.png,Ah, not quite how I prefer to undress, but go ahead and sing this song your own way!
6-female_crotch_is_visible=happy.png,Yeah... looking good, ~name~.
6-female_crotch_is_visible=happy.png,It's... very nice! Very... well-groomed!
6-female_crotch_is_visible=flustered.png,It must feel nice!... To touch, I mean... Never mind...
6-female_crotch_is_visible=happy.png,You, uh... did a very nice job grooming your hair there!
6-female_crotch_is_visible=happy.png,Uh... Yeah! Looking good!
6-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:shaved,id:14=happy.png,Oh! Shaved, huh? Or is it waxed? It looks great!
6-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:shaved,id:14=happy.png,Oh! You shave, huh? It looks great!
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:cammy_white=happy.png,You should try some of Billy's stuff - the brand, that is, not some guy! My whole outfit was manufactured by them! It's very comfy and very tough!
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:cammy_white,targetSaidMarker:chunli_help,alsoPlaying:chun-li=flustered.png,A-at least you gave Cammy a reason to get a new leotard! Why not get one by Billy? That's the brand that manufactured my costume! They make good stuff!
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:human,saidMarker:WagerStart,id:16=embarrassed.png,O-oh wow... I might reconsider my options for what we'll do if I win...
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:joey,targetNotSaidMarker:NonMagicStrip2=shocked.png,Whoa! Clowns sure do know how to keep me on my toes!
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika,targetSaidMarker:cammy_help,alsoPlaying:cammy_white=cheer.png,That was really cool!... Y-you should probably get off of Cammy now, though.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=flustered.png,Well, at least you're playing unpredictably! That's always good!
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=flustered.png,Way to keep your opponents on their toes, I guess!
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:3=happy.png,Not a fan of skirts, huh? I'm pretty fond of them, myself. Most of my outfits involve one, if not a dress.

#OPPONENT MASTURBATING
#When an opponent is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must pay the penalty by masturbating in front of everyone.
#The "must_masturbate" line is for just before it happens, and the "start_masturbating" line immediately follows.
#The "masturbating" line will be spoken a little after the opponent has started but before they climax.
#When the opponent climaxes, your character will say the "finished_masturbating" line.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

#SELF MASTURBATING
#If your character is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must masturbate.
#These lines only come up in the relevant stages, so you don't need to include the stage numbers here. Just remember which stage is which when you make the images. The "starting" image is still in the naked stage.
#The "finished_masturbating" line will repeat many times if the game is not yet finished. This plays as opponents comment on the how good their hands are.

#naked
-3-must_masturbate_first=flustered.png,W-well, I can't remove my mask, so I guess I'm the first one out, huh?
-3-must_masturbate_first=flustered.png,Oh, uh... I guess I'm out. I don't really have anything else I can take off...
-3-must_masturbate_first=flustered.png,Oh, uh... My earrings and hair ribbon wouldn't be enough, would they...? I guess I'm out then.
-3-must_masturbate_first,alsoPlaying:sayaka=flustered.png,I don't know about that, Sayaka. The only things I can think to do with them are too... extreme for my tastes...
-3-must_masturbate=flustered.png,Oh, eh... Guess I'm out? I don't know if I should blame luck or my own poker-playing skills!
-3-must_masturbate=flustered.png,I can't take off my mask, and I doubt my earrings or bow will count, so I guess that means I'm out.
-3-must_masturbate=flustered.png,Oh, ah... I lost, huh? I don't really have anything else to take off...
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:sayaka=flustered.png,I don't know about that, Sayaka. The only things I can think to do with them are too... extreme for my tastes...

-1-finished_masturbating=calm.png,... Anyone want an autograph? I've got plenty of time to sign some things right now!...

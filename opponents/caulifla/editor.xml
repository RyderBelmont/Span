            <description>Caulifla can change her hair and eye color on command. Cool huh? Also she gains a shining, golden aura around herself and grows in battle power immensely. But who cares about that sort of thing?</description>

            <description>Looks like Caulifla turned Super Saiyan again. Must have felt pretty good, huh? This one doesn't stick around for as long however, it was kinda unintentional after all. </description>

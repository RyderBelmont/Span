        <title>TM 11 Sunny Day</title>
        <subtitle>It has infinite uses. Ain't that great?</subtitle>
        <text>A peculiar disc that can teach certain Pokémon the move Sunny Day. Rosa gave it to you after the game, saying that it is a custom among Gym Leaders to give a present after they lose. Since you are not a Pokémon, you can't use it, but at least it's pretty.</text>
        <unlock>Win a game against Rosa.</unlock>

        <title>Princess Rosa</title>
        <subtitle>Inspired by Rosa's outfit in the movie ''Mystery Doors of the Magical Land.''</subtitle>
        <text>The joint power of hair buns and drills is extremely taxing on the soul. Only a few chosen can harness such a combination without instantly falling into madness. Luckily, Rosa can, which is pretty nice, cuz she looks cute imo.</text>
        <unlock>Win a game against Rosa and three other Pokémon characters.</unlock>

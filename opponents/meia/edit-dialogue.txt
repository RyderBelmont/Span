#When selecting the characters to play the game, the first line will always play, then it randomly picks from any of the start lines after you commence the game but before you deal the first hand.
start=0-calm,I've played plenty of poker with Gascogne...but never the strip version.


#Items of clothing should be listed here in order of removal.
#The values are formal name, lower case name, how much they cover, what they cover
#Please do not put spaces around the commas.
#"Important" clothes cover genitals (lower) or chest/breasts (upper). For example: bras, panties, a skirt when going commando.
#"Major" clothes cover underwear. For example: skirts, pants, shirts, dresses.
#"Minor" clothes cover skin or are large pieces of clothing that do not cover skin. For example: jackets, socks, stockings, gloves.
#"Extra" clothes are small items that may or may not be clothing but do not cover anything interesting. For example: jewelry, shoes or boots with socks underneath, belts, hats. In the rest of the code, "extra" clothes are called "accessory".
#If for some reason you write another word for the type of clothes (e.g. "accessory"), other characters will not react at all when the clothing is removed.
#What they cover = upper (upper body), lower (lower body), other (neither).
#The game can support any number of entries, but typically we use 2-8, with at least one "important" layer for upper and lower (each).

#Notes on dialogue
#All lines that start with a # symbol are comments and will be ignored by the tool that converts this file into a xml file for the game.
#Where more than one line has an identical type, like "swap_cards" and "swap_cards", the game will randomly select one of these lines each time the character is in that situation.
#You should try to include multiple lines for most stages, especially the final (finished) stage, -1. 

#A character goes through multiple stages as they undress. The stage number starts at zero and indicates how many layers they have removed. Special stage numbers are used when they are nude (-3), masturbating (-2), and finished (-1).
#Line types that start with a number will only display during that stage. The will override any numberless stage-generic lines. For example, in stage 4 "4-swap_cards" will be used over "swap_cards" if it is not blank here. Giving a character unique dialogue for each stage is an effective way of showing their changing openness/shyness as the game progresses.
#You can combine the above points and make multiple lines for a particular situation in a particular stage, like "4-swap_cards" and "4-swap_cards".

#Some special words can be used that will be substituted by the game for context-appropriate ones: ~name~ is the name of the character they're speaking to, but this only works if someone else is in focus. ~clothing~ is the type of clothing that is being removed by another player. ~Clothing~ is almost the same, but it starts with a capital letter in case you want to start a sentence with it.
#~name~ can be used any time a line targets an opponent (game_over_defeat, _must_strip, _removing_, _removed, _must_masturbate, etc).
#~clothing~ can be used only when clothing is being removed (_removing and _removed, but NOT _must_strip).
#~player~ can be used at any time and refers to the human player.
#~cards~ can be used only in the swap_cards lines.
#All wildcards can be used once per line only! If you use ~name~ twice, the code will show up the second time.

#Lines can be written that are only spoken when specific other characters are present. For a detailed explanation, read this guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/spnati/comments/6nhaj0/the_easy_way_to_write_targeted_lines/
#Here is an example line (note that targeted lines must have a stage number):
#0-female_must_strip,target:hermioine=happy,Looks like your magic doesn't help with poker!




#EXCHANGING CARDS
#This is what a character says while they're exchanging cards.
#The game will automatically put a display a number between 0-5 where you write ~cards~.
#These lines display on the screen for only a brief time, so it is important to make them short enough to read at a glance.

#stage-specific lines that override the stage-generic ones

2-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:0-0=bored,Just sad...
2-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:0-0=thinking,Normally I'm better than this.
2-stripping=losing bodysuit,Off comes the whole suit.  You're proving to be better than I thought.
2-stripping=losing bodysuit,So I'm out of my suit.  You could already tell what my body looked like anyway.
2-stripping=losing bodysuit,Don't think you've won.  I <i>do</i> wear underwear.
2-stripping=losing bodysuit,Now I'm going to get <i>serious</i>.
2-stripping=losing bodysuit,Maybe I'll start taking this seriously now.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:scifistrip=losing bodysuit,My <i>Dread</i> is high-tech...nothing about <i>me</i> needs to be.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:scifistrip=losing bodysuit,Technology is for using, not wearing.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:scifistrip=losing bodysuit,My armor deflects lasers.  That's about the extent of it.

3-stripped=thinking,I wasn't exactly hiding my body anyway.
3-stripped=pleased,Now I'm dressed like Barnette is all the time.
3-must_strip_winning=disappointed,Since I'm winning, I guess I shouldn't feel bad about this...
3-must_strip_winning=bored,Looks like I'm joining the club.
3-must_strip_winning=addressing,Some nudity from me at last.  Proud of yourself?
3-must_strip_winning=bored,Mejarian breasts aren't all that different, I assure you.
3-must_strip_winning=annoyed,Get ready to be blown away...
3-must_strip_winning=bored,I actually beat Gascogne once...she had a headcold.
3-must_strip_winning,timeInStage:0-0=bored,Immediately...
3-must_strip_winning,timeInStage:0-0=bored,Is it my turn again?
3-must_strip_winning,timeInStage:0-0=bored,Got me out of my bra before I knew what to make of you...

3-must_strip_normal=thinking,Maybe I should have come here in one of our clunky spacesuits.
3-must_strip_normal=bored,I may be a pirate, but I <i>do</i> follow rules.
3-must_strip_normal=bored,Damn it...I'm slipping.
3-must_strip_normal=bored,It's not the stripping I hate...it's the losing.
3-must_strip_normal=bored,I'll follow the rules.  Usually I'm making them.
3-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:7-99=bored,Alright...let's get this over with.

3-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:0-0=annoyed,A losing streak...I'm better than this.
3-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:0-0=bored,My strategy isn't working...got to adjust.
3-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:0-0=bored,Damn.  Thought I'd have more time to fret about this.

3-must_strip_losing=thinking,I've played shamefully, so it's time for me to be ashamed.
3-must_strip_losing=bored,...And no more breast support.  I could use some support right now...
3-must_strip_losing=thinking,I deserve this with how predictable I've been this game.
3-must_strip_losing=bored,Still not as bad as getting your district shut down...

3-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:0-0=bored,You're in my head.  Now you'll reap the benefits.
3-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:0-0=thinking,I'm being too stubborn...
3-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:7-99=sad,I needed that streak...
3-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:7-99=sad,Not the bra...and I was doing so well.
3-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:7-99=sad,...Not the bra.
3-stripping=losing bra,Off comes the bra.  Don't expect much...
3-stripping=losing bra,And now, my decidedly mediocre chest...
3-stripping=losing bra,Now you'll see my breasts.  Are you satisfied, or will you push me further?
3-stripping=losing bra,Give me a second...this thing is finicky.

3-stripping,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=losing bra,Nothing weird about this to an Earth man...Tarakkians think our milk is corrosive.

3-stripping,totalNaked:1-4,priority:0=losing bra,Well, when others have sacrificed more...
3-stripping,totalNaked:1-4,priority:0=losing bra,Sometimes you just need to hold the line.
3-stripping,totalNaked:1-4,priority:0=losing bra,At least my groin is still covered.  That's more than some of us can say...

0-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=calm,You remind me of Parfet, though you seem a little more outgoing.
0-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=disappointed,You remind me of Parfet.  Does your taste in partners include long hair?
0-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=impressed,You're like if Parfet and Paiway had a child together.
0-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=disappointed,You've got Paiway's build.  Are you old enough to be here?
0-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=disappointed,You look a little unkempt.  Women need to take pride in their bodies as well as their minds.
0-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,marker:shyness=disappointed,You certainly paint of different picture of Earthlings than the one I'm used to...
0-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,marker:shyness=disappointed,You seem awfully shy to be playing a game like this.  Or is that your motivation for doing so?
0-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,marker:shyness=disappointed,How'd a shy woman like you end up in this place?  Do you even know how to play poker?
0-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,marker:Mejare_few_animals=disappointed,You said you rode in on a "pegasus"?  Mejare has few animals, but I've never even <i>heard</i> of that one.
0-female_must_strip,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're looking a little sickly.  Did ships from Earth do this to you?
0-female_must_strip,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=bored,You're a scientist?  Mejare's scientists work tirelessly to find a universal man-poison.
0-female_must_strip,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're short like Paiway...but Paiway is eleven.  Are you old enough to be here?

0-female_must_strip,target:blackrose,targetStage:0=confused,This "virtual" business is new to me.  Why not just come here for real?
0-female_must_strip,target:dawn,targetStage:0=disappointed,It's <i>poker</i>, not <i>pokermon</i>.
0-female_must_strip,target:dawn,targetStage:0=confused,You train pokuh--<i>what</i>?
0-female_must_strip,target:dawn,targetStage:0=thinking,These <i>Pokemon</i> sound interesting...Mejare doesn't have many animals.
0-female_must_strip,target:dawn,targetStage:0=disappointed,You capture animals for your own amusement...sounds a little cruel, but Mejare treats men that way.
0-female_must_strip,target:dawn,targetStage:0=disappointed,These <i>Pokemon</i> nipping at your heels sounds like Pyoro when he's making his rounds.
0-female_must_strip,target:daria,targetStage:0=disappointed,You look like you've got my temperament.  Did someone elbow you into doing this, too?
0-female_must_strip,target:daria,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=disappointed,You go to school with men?  They don't seem able to focus for long enough...

0-female_must_strip,target:blake,targetStage:0=thinking,Genetic engineering on Mejare has resulted in some pretty outlandish hair colors...
0-female_must_strip,target:daphne,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you solve mysteries...with some men?  Men don't seem smart enough for that.
0-female_must_strip,target:daphne,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you solve mysteries?  The Paksis is one big glowing mystery.
0-female_must_strip,target:daphne,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'm told you get captured a lot.  Allies are important to have...but a woman should be strong on her own.
0-female_must_strip,target:buffy,targetStage:0=disappointed,These "vampires" of yours sound fearsome.  The Harvest probably wants blood from somewhere, too...
0-female_must_strip,target:buffy,targetStage:0=bored,Vampires suck blood, huh...there's probably an Earth colony for blood out there somewhere.
0-female_must_strip,target:buffy,targetStage:0=thinking,I wonder what the blood colony's people must look like.  Probably blushing all the time.
0-female_must_strip,target:buffy,targetStage:0=calm,So, a man helps you fight vampires?  I work with a few men...out of necessity.

0-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=disappointed,What are these "video games" you play?  Sounds like something Dita would distract herself with instead of attending flight practice.

0-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=angry,I know you military types.  Always looking for a state-approved means of harassing people.
0-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,I know you military types.  Happy to shut down and kill, never there when it's time to rebuild.
0-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,You'll have to excuse my dislike of woman soldiers.  The last one I met had her knee in my back.
0-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0=disappointed,"Titans," huh?  Those Harvest motherships can get pretty big.
0-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0=pleased,You look like Paiway's first attempt at makeup.
0-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0=disappointed,So much makeup...I don't wear any.  Just gets in the way.
0-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0=bored,So much makeup...Jura is always trying to convince me to try some.
0-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0=calm,"Magic," huh...I'd have my doubts, but the Paksis feels like magic sometimes.
0-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0=calm,Do you really use magic, or just sufficiently advanced technology?
0-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you're a witch.  We got called witches on Mejare, but that was for suggesting men were human.
0-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=calm,So...you went to school with <i>men</i>?  Surprised they can sit still long enough.
0-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0,marker:state_schools=bored,A boarding school, huh?  Everyone is educated by the state on Mejare...
0-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=disappointed,A boarding school?  I dropped out of school...though Mejare's didn't teach magic.
0-female_must_strip,target:annie,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=disappointed,So...you go to school with <i>men</i>?  Surprised they can sit still long enough.
0-female_must_strip,target:annie,targetStage:0=confused,What's a college?  ...What's a <i>community</i>?
0-female_must_strip,target:annie,targetStage:0,marker:state_schools=bored,Everyone is educated by the state on Mejare...they certainly fed me a lot of stories about Tarak.
0-female_must_strip,target:annie,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=disappointed,This "college" of yours sounds like a school.  I dropped out of school...
0-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=disappointed,It's <i>poker</i>, not <i>pokermon</i>.

0-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,So, what's planet Switzerland like?  Never heard of it.
0-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=impressed,You're a <i>doctor</i>?  The Nirvana could use you...our only doctor is a man.
0-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=impressed,You're a <i>doctor</i>?  The Nirvana could use you...I don't trust Duero's knowledge of women sometimes.
0-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=impressed,You're a <i>doctor</i>?  The Nirvana could use you...Paiway's just a child nurse in training.

0-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:4=annoyed,I can't believe you've got more bullets than clothes.
0-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:4=disappointed,How could <i>anyone</i> be so fond of those racketous men's weapons?
0-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=disappointed,One look at your outfit tells me we'll be here a while.
0-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=calm,Our names are pretty close, Mei.  Whose do you think is better?
0-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=pleased,You work in climate science?  Tarak could use a woman like you...if women didn't terrify them.
0-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=disappointed,You work in climate science?  Maybe you could convince Mejare to allocate its resources better.
0-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,So, what's planet China like?  Never heard of it.
0-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=confused,You...<i>freeze</i> people?  Misty was in cryogenic sleep, but...your way sounds dangerous.
0-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=disappointed,You've got to slim down.  A woman has to stay fit.
0-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Is there a reason you brought a knife?
0-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:0=angry,I'm watching you.  Why do you have that knife?
0-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:0=annoyed,Make any sudden movements, and you'll be on the wrong side of that knife.

0-female_must_strip,target:alpha,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,Whatever this "Japan" planet is, it seems to produce real oddities...

0-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=impressed,That's quite the outfit.  I thought <i>my</i> suit was revealing.
0-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=confused,If that suit is meant to be a disguise, this "France" planet must be taxing on the eyes.

0-female_must_strip,target:marceline,targetStage:0=disappointed,Are you some kind of apparition?  Smacks of the Paksis's work.

0-female_must_strip,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0=disappointed,This is a card game.  Why'd you come armed with...whatever that thing is?
0-female_must_strip,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0=calm,You look pretty good with that sword.  Maybe you could give Jura some instruction.
0-female_must_strip,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0=impressed,Fascinating.  That sword looks like it's made from the lasers our rings use.
0-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0=pleased,You work as a <i>model</i>?  So would Jura, if we were law-abiding Mejarians...
0-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0=pleased,You work as a <i>model</i>?  Probably what Jura wants deep down...

0-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0=calm,You look pretty good with that sword.  Maybe you could give Jura some private lessons.
0-female_must_strip,target:amy_rose,targetStage:0=disappointed,What's a hedgehog?  Some kind of animal?
0-female_must_strip,target:amy_rose,targetStage:0,marker:Mejare_few_animals=thinking,"Hedgehog"...?  Mejare doesn't have many animals...

0-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=disappointed,Interesting gun, but I'm not sure why you felt the need to bring it.
0-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=disappointed,I wasn't going to say anything...but that one eye is rather distracting.
0-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=confused,I guess women come in all shapes and eye counts on Earth...or are you not <i>from</i> Earth?
0-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=disappointed,No depth perception?  You'd make a poor pilot.

0-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=disappointed,So, you go to school with men?  Must be a pain getting them to sit still during a lecture.
0-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'm told you're into government.  Mejare's is in need of reform, to put it bluntly.
0-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'm told you're into art.  Jura would probably ask you for a life-size portrait.

0-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0=calm,I'm told you're into art.  I know Duero painted Parfet something once, so maybe you two should talk.

0-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:0=calm,"Magic," huh...I'd have my doubts, but the Paksis feels like magic sometimes.

0-female_must_strip,target:tracer,targetStage:0=impressed,That thing lets you <i>go back in time</i>?  Well, I hope you're a good sport.
0-female_must_strip,target:sonya,targetStage:0=calm,Funny.  The "netherrealm" is pretty much how Mejare sees Tarak.
0-female_must_strip,target:sonya,targetStage:0=impressed,You've got a lot of fight in you.  Always good to see in a woman.
0-female_must_strip,target:sonya,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=disappointed,I'm a little wary of soliders...Mejare's government isn't too keen on us.

1-male_must_strip,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=thinking,You were created in a lab?  So was I, technically...
1-male_must_strip,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=thinking,So, you were made in a lab...like every woman on Mejare, and every man on Tarak.

1-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=disappointed,I wasn't going to say anything...but that one eye is rather distracting.
1-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=confused,I guess women come in all shapes and eye counts on Earth...or are you not <i>from</i> Earth?
1-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=disappointed,No depth perception?  You'd make a poor pilot.
1-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0=calm,Fancy dress...your outfit is like Ezra's.
1-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0=disappointed,You dress like Ezra...you kind of look like her, too.
1-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0=calm,You look pretty good with that sword.  Maybe you could give Jura some private lessons.

1-female_must_strip,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0=calm,You look pretty good with that sword.  Maybe you could give Jura some instruction.
1-female_must_strip,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0=impressed,Fascinating.  That sword looks like it's made from the lasers our rings use.
1-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0=disappointed,You don't seem too fond of men, either.  You didn't grow up on Mejare, did you?
1-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0=pleased,Looks like there <i>are</i> lesbians on Earth...

1-female_must_strip,target:marceline,targetStage:0=disappointed,Are you some kind of apparition?  Smacks of the Paksis's work.
1-female_must_strip,target:marceline,targetStage:0=disappointed,I wasn't going to comment on the floating, but...you're floating.
1-female_must_strip,target:mia,targetStage:0=confused,...What's a lawyer?
1-female_must_strip,target:mia,targetStage:0=bored,You work in <i>law</i>?  Mejare has one law...obey the Grand Ma.
1-female_must_strip,target:mia,targetStage:0=disappointed,There are no law practitioners on Mejare.  Only the state judges, and how badly they punish you for associating with men.
1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:3=annoyed,I'll just look away...
1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:3=disappointed,Guess there's no changing you...
1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:3=disappointed,Firing straight up?  Right out of Hibiki's playbook.

1-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=impressed,You're a <i>doctor</i>?  The Nirvana could use you...I don't trust Duero's knowledge of women sometimes.
1-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=impressed,You're a <i>doctor</i>?  The Nirvana could use you...Paiway's just a child nurse in training.
1-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=disappointed,It's <i>poker</i>, not <i>pokermon</i>.
1-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=confused,You train pokuh--<i>what</i>?
1-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=thinking,These <i>Pokemon</i> sound interesting...Mejare doesn't have many animals.
1-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=disappointed,You capture animals for your own amusement...sounds a little cruel, but Mejare treats men that way.
1-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=disappointed,These <i>Pokemon</i> nipping at your heels sounds like Pyoro when he's making his rounds.
1-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=impressed,I know a woman named Misty...well, a <i>girl</i> named Misty.
1-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=thinking,I know a girl named Misty...she's from Pluto.
1-female_must_strip,target:ciri,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're a "witcher"?  A Mejarian judge called Jura a witch...for possession of an anatomy book.
1-female_must_strip,target:ciri,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're a "witcher"?  Mejarians who associate with men get called witches...
1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:2=disappointed,Is this "darlin'" of yours a man?  That would explain a lot.
1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:2=disappointed,Have you had a baby with this "darlin'" of yours?  I'm still not sure men are capable of making one.
1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:2=annoyed,I've gone through electroshock...and you need some.
1-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:0=thinking,Your planet must be pretty verdant for you to dress like that.  Mejare uses too many natural resources...
1-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:0=bored,Your planet must be pretty verdant for you to dress like that.  Tarak is a wasteland...
1-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:0=pleased,You have Barnette's fashion sense...that is, less is more.
1-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:0=pleased,You have Barnette's sense of style...that is, skin is always in style.
1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:4=bored,At least you're running out of clothes...

1-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:0=angry,I'm watching you.  Why do you have that knife?
1-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:0=annoyed,Make any sudden movements, and you'll be on the wrong side of that knife.
1-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:0=angry,Don't you dare try anything with that knife.
1-female_must_strip,target:amy_rose,targetStage:0=disappointed,What's a hedgehog?  Some kind of animal?
1-female_must_strip,target:amy_rose,targetStage:0,marker:Mejare_few_animals=thinking,"Hedgehog"...?  Mejare doesn't have many animals...
1-female_must_strip,target:amy_rose,targetStage:0=disappointed,Something about you looks off...like you aren't quite human.  But then, I used to see men that way, too.
1-female_must_strip,target:may,targetStage:0=disappointed,It's <i>poker</i>, not <i>pokermon</i>.
1-female_must_strip,target:may,targetStage:0=confused,You train pokuh--<i>what</i>?
1-female_must_strip,target:may,targetStage:0=thinking,These <i>Pokemon</i> sound interesting...Mejare doesn't have many animals.
1-female_must_strip,target:may,targetStage:0=disappointed,You capture animals for your own amusement...sounds a little cruel, but Mejare treats men that way.
1-female_must_strip,target:may,targetStage:0=disappointed,These <i>Pokemon</i> nipping at your heels sounds like Pyoro when he's making his rounds.
1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=impressed,That's quite the outfit.  I thought <i>my</i> suit was revealing.
1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=confused,If that suit is meant to be a disguise, this "France" planet must be taxing on the eyes.
1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,marker:blue_hair=impressed,Hm?  Someone else with blue hair...
1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,You're from planet "France"?  Well...it's certainly got an aroma.
1-female_must_strip,target:alpha,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,You're from "Japan"?  Never heard of it...must be a remote planet.
1-female_must_strip,target:alpha,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,Whatever this "Japan" planet is, it seems to produce real oddities...
1-female_must_strip,target:alpha,targetStage:0=bored,You're an "idol"?  Mejare has idols...big pear-shaped statues we're told to honor.
1-female_must_strip,target:alpha,targetStage:0=confused,"Virtual idol"?  Are you some kind of projection?  You're flickering.
1-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=disappointed,One look at your outfit tells me we'll be here a while.
1-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=calm,Our names are pretty close, Mei.  Whose do you think is better?
1-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=pleased,You work in climate science?  Tarak could use a woman like you...if women didn't terrify them.
1-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=disappointed,You work in climate science?  Maybe you could convince Mejare to allocate its resources better.
1-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,So, what's planet China like?  Never heard of it.
1-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=confused,You...<i>freeze</i> people?  Misty was in cryogenic sleep, but...your way sounds dangerous.
1-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=disappointed,You've got to slim down.  A woman has to stay fit.
1-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0=disappointed,Any reason you came armed to a friendly card game?
1-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0=disappointed,Feel free to put the gun down anytime.  This is a <i>card game</i>.

1-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Your skin is dark.  Not common on Mejare...there's Valore, I suppose.
1-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0=calm,The way you're clutching that gun tells me you and Barnette would hit it off.
1-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Your skin is dark.  Not common on Mejare...and B.C. doesn't count.
1-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0=pleased,You look like Paiway's first attempt at makeup.
1-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0=disappointed,So much makeup...I don't wear any.  Just gets in the way.
1-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0=bored,So much makeup...Jura is always trying to convince me to try some.
1-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0,marker:state_schools=bored,This "academy" of yours sounds like a school...Mejarian schools are just government propaganda.
1-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=disappointed,So, you go to school with men?  Must be a pain getting them to sit still during a lecture.
1-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'm told you're into government.  Mejare's is in need of reform, to put it bluntly.
1-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'm told you're into art.  Jura would probably ask you for a life-size portrait.
1-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=disappointed,This "academy" of yours sounds like a school.  I dropped out of school...
1-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0=calm,I'm told you're into art.  I know Duero painted Parfet something once, so maybe you two should talk.
1-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0=thinking,You have a roommate at this school of yours?  I'd never be comfortable without my single room.
1-female_must_strip,target:elaine,targetStage:0=impressed,<i>You're</i> a pirate?  They certainly dress much differently on Earth...

1-female_must_strip,target:dawn,targetStage:0=disappointed,These <i>Pokemon</i> nipping at your heels sounds like Pyoro when he's making his rounds.
1-female_must_strip,target:blackrose,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're from a...muh-more-puh-guh?  Use real words.
1-female_must_strip,target:blackrose,targetStage:0=confused,You're an avatar?  As in, not really here?  Where are you projecting this from?
1-female_must_strip,target:blackrose,targetStage:0=confused,This "virtual" business is new to me.  Why not just come here for real?
1-female_must_strip,target:daria,targetStage:0=disappointed,You look like you've got my temperament.  Did someone elbow you into doing this, too?
1-female_must_strip,target:daria,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=disappointed,You go to school with men?  They don't seem able to focus for long enough...
1-female_must_strip,target:daria,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=bored,You're a student...I'm a dropout.  Let's leave it at that...
1-female_must_strip,target:daria,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're barely bigger than Paiway.  Children aren't allowed here.
1-female_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=calm,You've got potential, lasting so long.
1-female_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=calm,Nice run.  You've got skill.
1-female_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=impressed,Good streak, ~name~.  Perhaps I underestimated you.
1-female_must_strip,target:blake,targetStage:0=disappointed,My crewmates and I all have different hair colors...we don't base our identities off of that.
1-female_must_strip,target:blake,targetStage:0=thinking,Genetic engineering on Mejare has resulted in some pretty outlandish hair colors...
1-female_must_strip,target:daphne,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you solve mysteries...with some men?  Men don't seem smart enough for that.
1-female_must_strip,target:daphne,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you solve mysteries?  The Paksis is one big glowing mystery.
1-female_must_strip,target:daphne,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'm told you get captured a lot.  Allies are important to have...but a woman should be strong on her own.
1-female_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=bored,I won with <i>that</i>?  You might as well just forfeit now...
1-female_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=disappointed,I won with a <i>high card</i>...that one loss I had was clearly a fluke.
1-female_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=disappointed,I had a <i>high card</i>.  Gascogne would just toy with you...
1-female_must_strip,target:buffy,targetStage:0=disappointed,These "vampires" of yours sound fearsome.  The Harvest probably wants blood from somewhere, too...
1-female_must_strip,target:buffy,targetStage:0=bored,Vampires suck blood, huh...there's probably an Earth colony for blood out there somewhere.
1-female_must_strip,target:buffy,targetStage:0=thinking,I wonder what the blood colony's people must look like.  Probably blushing all the time.
1-female_must_strip,target:buffy,targetStage:0=calm,So, a man helps you fight vampires?  I work with a few men...out of necessity.
1-female_must_strip,target:buffy,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=disappointed,I dropped out of school...hope it's treating you better than it did me.

1-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0=disappointed,A test subject...that's how Earth sees its colonies.
1-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0=bored,I see you've got my affinity for words.
1-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0=impressed,Portals sound useful...even faster-than-light still takes a while.
1-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0=disappointed,Women shouldn't be afraid to speak their minds.

1-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=disappointed,What are these "video games" you play?  Sounds like something Dita would distract herself with instead of attending flight practice.
1-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=disappointed,You go to school with men?  They don't seem able to focus for long enough.
1-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=bored,You're a student...I'm a dropout.  Let's leave it at that.
1-female_must_strip,target:black_canary,targetStage:0=pleased,"Black Canary"?  Maybe I should get a professional name...to inspire fear.
1-female_must_strip,target:black_canary,targetStage:0,marker:Mejare_few_animals=confused,"Black Canary"?  I've never seen a canary, but I thought they were yellow.

1-female_must_strip,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're looking a little sickly.  Did ships from Earth do this to you?
1-female_must_strip,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=bored,You're a scientist?  Mejare's scientists work tirelessly to find a universal man-poison.
1-female_must_strip,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're short like Paiway...but Paiway is eleven.  Are you old enough to be here?
1-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=disappointed,You seem a little too eager.
1-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're a little...sex-obsessed, don't you think?

1-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Your skin is dark.  Not common on Mejare...there's Valore, I guess.
1-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0=happy,Someone said you're with a woman...Rebekah and Ezra recently had their baby.
1-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Your skin is dark.  Not common on Mejare...and B.C. doesn't count.
1-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0=pleased,Someone said you're with a woman...Jura and Barnette sure get along.
1-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0=disappointed,Someone said you're with a woman...I guess Mejare got its inspiration from some Earth women.
1-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0=thinking,Someone said you're with a woman...I should see if Valore is taken.

1-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0=pleased,You work as a <i>model</i>?  Probably what Jura wants deep down.
1-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=confused,You go to school with <i>men</i>?  Sounds distracting.
1-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=thinking,You're a student...I dropped out of school.  Bad times.

1-female_must_strip,target:kim,targetStage:0=disappointed,You <i>save the world</i>?  ...Alright then.
1-female_must_strip,target:kim,targetStage:0=bored,You <i>save the world</i>?  Earth doesn't need saving, as far as I'm concerned.
1-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0=calm,"Magic," huh...I'd have my doubts, but the Paksis feels like magic sometimes.
1-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0=calm,Do you really use magic, or just sufficiently advanced technology?
1-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you're a witch.  We got called witches on Mejare, but that was for suggesting men were human.
1-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=calm,So...you went to school with <i>men</i>?  Surprised they can sit still long enough.
1-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0,marker:state_schools=bored,A boarding school, huh?  Everyone is educated by the state on Mejare...
1-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=disappointed,A boarding school?  I dropped out of school...though Mejare's didn't teach magic.

1-female_must_strip,target:annie,targetStage:0,marker:state_schools=bored,Everyone is educated by the state on Mejare...they certainly fed me a lot of stories about Tarak.
1-female_must_strip,target:annie,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=disappointed,This "college" of yours sounds like a school.  I dropped out of school...
1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1=annoyed,Here we go again...take cover.
1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1=angry,Don't you care about safety?
1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1=annoyed,After surviving the first volley, you'd think a woman would know better than to push her luck.

1-female_must_strip,target:kurumu,targetStage:0=confused,You're a..."vampire"?  You look human to me.
1-female_must_strip,target:kurumu,targetStage:0=disappointed,Do these "vampires" really suck blood?  Right out of the Harvest's playbook...
1-female_must_strip,target:kurumu,targetStage:0=thinking,So, vampires suck blood.  Earth probably has a blood colony out there somewhere...poor souls.
1-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:0=calm,"Magic," huh...I'd have my doubts, but the Paksis feels like magic sometimes.
1-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:0=calm,Do you really use magic, or just sufficiently advanced technology?

1-female_must_strip,target:gogo,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,You're from planet "San Fransokyo"?  Just rolls right off the tongue.
1-female_must_strip,target:gogo,targetStage:0=calm,You do something in engineering, correct?  You and Parfet would hit it off.
1-female_must_strip,target:zoey,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=disappointed,So, you go to school with <i>men</i>?  Surprised they can sit still long enough.
1-female_must_strip,target:zoey,targetStage:0=confused,You went to a...<i>university</i>?  What's a university?
1-female_must_strip,target:zoey,targetStage:0,marker:state_schools=bored,Everyone is educated by the state on Mejare...so I wouldn't know about your "university."
1-female_must_strip,target:zoey,targetStage:0=disappointed,These "zombies" of yours sound a lot like what the Harvest wants to turn us into.
1-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=calm,You remind me of Parfet, though you seem a little more outgoing.
1-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=disappointed,You remind me of Parfet.  Does your taste in partners include long hair?
1-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=impressed,You're like if Parfet and Paiway had a child together.
1-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=disappointed,You've got Paiway's build.  Are you old enough to be here?
1-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=disappointed,You look a little unkempt.  Women need to take pride in their bodies as well as their minds.
1-female_must_strip,target:ayano,targetStage:0=disappointed,This girl gives me the creeps...
1-female_must_strip,target:ayano,targetStage:0=disappointed,What's with that look in your eyes?  Like an animal playing dead...

1-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,marker:shyness=disappointed,You certainly paint of different picture of Earthlings than the one I'm used to...
1-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,marker:shyness=disappointed,You seem awfully shy to be playing a game like this.  Or is that your motivation for doing so?
1-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,marker:shyness=disappointed,How'd a shy woman like you end up in this place?  Do you even know how to play poker?
1-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,marker:Mejare_few_animals=disappointed,You said you rode in on a "pegasus"?  Mejare has few animals, but I've never even <i>heard</i> of that one.

1-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=angry,I know you military types.  Always looking for a state-approved means of harassing people.
1-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,I know you military types.  Happy to shut down and kill, never there when it's time to rebuild.
1-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,You'll have to excuse my dislike of woman soldiers.  The last one I met had her knee in my back.

2-male_must_strip,target:fred,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you solve mysteries?  Duero's the only man I know who's smart enough for that.
2-male_must_strip,target:fred,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you solve mysteries?  The Paksis is one big glowing mystery...
2-male_must_strip,target:fred,targetStage:0=calm,You might be handsomer if you grew your hair out.  Duero makes it work.
2-male_must_strip,target:kira,targetStage:0=annoyed,Every man on Tarak wants us dead.  You don't scare me.
2-male_must_strip,target:kira,targetStage:0=annoyed,I've always regarded men as simple...not as <i>unhinged</i>.
2-male_must_strip,target:kira,targetStage:0=annoyed,I've learned that men aren't really savage animals...and then there's you.

2-female_human_must_strip=disappointed,You've got to play better, ~player~...
2-female_human_must_strip=calm,Don't blame your luck, or you'll never improve.
2-female_human_must_strip=disappointed,Well, don't just roll over and die...
2-female_human_must_strip=calm,All games boil down to skill, even this one.

2-female_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=disappointed,I had a <i>high card</i>.  What a hollow victory.
2-female_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=addressing,Was that skill...or just a lucky streak?
2-female_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=calm,Do have it in you for another streak like that?

2-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0=thinking,Genetic engineering on Mejare has resulted in some pretty outlandish hair colors...
2-female_must_strip,target:sonya,targetStage:0=calm,Funny.  The "netherrealm" is pretty much how Mejare sees Tarak.
2-female_must_strip,target:sonya,targetStage:0=impressed,You've got a lot of fight in you.  Always good to see in a woman.
2-female_must_strip,target:sonya,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=disappointed,I'm a little wary of soliders...Mejare's government isn't too keen on us.

2-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0=disappointed,Feel free to put the gun down anytime.  This is a <i>card game</i>.

2-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Your skin is dark.  Not common on Mejare...there's Valore, I suppose.
2-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0=calm,The way you're clutching that gun tells me you and Barnette would hit it off.

2-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,marker:shyness=disappointed,You certainly paint of different picture of Earthlings than the one I'm used to...
2-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,marker:shyness=disappointed,You seem awfully shy to be playing a game like this.  Or is that your motivation for doing so?
2-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,marker:shyness=disappointed,How'd a shy woman like you end up in this place?  Do you even know how to play poker?
2-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,marker:Mejare_few_animals=disappointed,You said you rode in on a "pegasus"?  Mejare has few animals, but I've never even <i>heard</i> of that one.

2-female_must_strip,target:ciri,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're a "witcher"?  A Mejarian judge called Jura a witch...for possession of an anatomy book.
2-female_must_strip,target:ciri,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're a "witcher"?  Mejarians who associate with men get called witches...
2-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0=thinking,It can get lonely out in space, wouldn't you agree?
2-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0=impressed,Oh, you're not from Earth, either?
2-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0=addressing,So, you hunt space pirates...good luck with that.

2-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=disappointed,You seem a little too eager.
2-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're a little...sex-obsessed, don't you think?
2-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're creeping me out with all this sex-talk...
2-female_must_strip,target:elaine,targetStage:0=impressed,<i>You're</i> a pirate?  They certainly dress much differently on Earth...

2-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0,marker:pilot=happy,You're a <i>pilot</i>?  We should discuss formations!
2-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0,marker:pilot=interested,These "Gundams" of yours sound a lot like Vanguards.  I wonder if my Dread could combine with them...
2-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0,marker:pilot=happy,Oh, wow, another pilot!  We should talk after the game.
2-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0,marker:pilot=happy,You're a <i>pilot</i>?  I only took up piloting a few years ago, but I've really fallen in love.

2-female_must_strip,target:daphne,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you solve mysteries?  The Paksis is one big glowing mystery.
2-female_must_strip,target:daphne,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'm told you get captured a lot.  Allies are important to have...but a woman should be strong on her own.
2-female_must_strip,target:dawn,targetStage:0=disappointed,It's <i>poker</i>, not <i>pokermon</i>.
2-female_must_strip,target:dawn,targetStage:0=confused,You train pokuh--<i>what</i>?
2-female_must_strip,target:dawn,targetStage:0=thinking,These <i>Pokemon</i> sound interesting...Mejare doesn't have many animals.
2-female_must_strip,target:dawn,targetStage:0=disappointed,You capture animals for your own amusement...sounds a little cruel, but Mejare treats men that way.
2-female_must_strip,target:dawn,targetStage:0=disappointed,These <i>Pokemon</i> nipping at your heels sounds like Pyoro when he's making his rounds.
2-female_must_strip,target:shazza,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=thinking,This planet "Australia" of yours sounds rough around the edges.  Just like Tarak...
2-female_must_strip,target:shazza,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=calm,So, what's planet Australia like?  Never heard of it.

2-female_must_strip,target:shantae,targetStage:0=confused,What exactly is a "genie"?
2-female_must_strip,target:shantae,targetStage:0=confused,Is "genie" some kind of Earth race?

2-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=confused,You go to school with <i>men</i>?  Sounds distracting...and tense.
2-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=thinking,You're a student...I dropped out of school.  Life on the streets isn't fun.
2-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0=calm,"Magic," huh...I'd have my doubts, but the Paksis feels like magic sometimes.
2-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0=calm,Do you really use magic, or just sufficiently advanced technology?
2-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you're a witch.  We got called witches on Mejare, but that was for suggesting men were human.
2-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=calm,So...you went to school with <i>men</i>?  Surprised they can sit still long enough.
2-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0,marker:state_schools=bored,A boarding school, huh?  Everyone is educated by the state on Mejare...
2-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=disappointed,A boarding school?  I dropped out of school...though Mejare's didn't teach magic.

2-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=disappointed,You look a little unkempt.  Women need to take pride in their bodies as well as their minds.
2-female_must_strip,target:pauling,targetStage:0=pleased,So, you work for an old woman too.
2-female_must_strip,target:pauling,targetStage:0=thinking,I hear an old woman is <i>your</i> superior, too...and that she's not as kind as the captain.

2-female_must_strip,target:tina,targetStage:0=confused,You...<i>wrestle</i>?  Duero said they do something like that on Tarak.
2-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=impressed,That's quite the outfit.  I thought <i>my</i> suit was revealing.
2-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=confused,If that suit is meant to be a disguise, this "France" planet must be taxing on the eyes.
2-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,marker:blue_hair=impressed,Hm?  Someone else with blue hair...
2-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,You're from planet "France"?  Well...it's certainly got an aroma.

2-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:0,marker:oma_and_fama=confused,Your "father" is famous...fathers are male parents, correct?
2-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:0,marker:oma_and_fama=thinking,Your "father" is famous...I can't even picture a man being a parent.
2-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:0=calm,Your father is a champion fighter...I wonder if B.C. could handle him.

2-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0,marker:oma_and_fama=bored,Being a maid is looked down upon on Mejare...just a stepping stone to finding the Oma of your children.
2-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=thinking,Mejare looks down on maids...Mejare looks down on a lot of professions.
2-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=pleased,Mejare looks down on maids...but they're held in higher regard than pirates.
2-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0,marker:honorifics=confused,What's with the honorifics?  Strange language you must speak at home...
2-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0,marker:honorifics=disappointed,What's with the honorifics?  Maybe Mejare could do with that kind of politeness...
2-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=disappointed,One look at your outfit tells me we'll be here a while.
2-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=calm,Our names are pretty close, Mei.  Whose do you think is better?
2-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=pleased,You work in climate science?  Tarak could use a woman like you...if women didn't terrify them.
2-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=disappointed,You work in climate science?  Maybe you could convince Mejare to allocate its resources better.
2-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,So, what's planet China like?  Never heard of it.
2-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=confused,You...<i>freeze</i> people?  Misty was in cryogenic sleep, but...your way sounds dangerous.
2-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=disappointed,You've got to slim down.  A woman has to stay fit.
2-female_must_strip,target:neo,targetStage:0=bored,I see you've got my affinity for words.

2-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=impressed,You're a <i>doctor</i>?  The Nirvana could use you...our only doctor is a man.
2-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=impressed,You're a <i>doctor</i>?  The Nirvana could use you...I don't trust Duero's knowledge of women sometimes.
2-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=impressed,You're a <i>doctor</i>?  The Nirvana could use you...Paiway's just a child nurse in training.
2-female_must_strip,target:velma,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you solve mysteries...with some men?  Men don't seem smart enough for that...
2-female_must_strip,target:velma,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you solve mysteries?  The Paksis is one big glowing mystery.
2-female_must_strip,target:velma,targetStage:0=calm,You remind me of Parfet.  She's blind without her glasses, too.

2-female_must_strip,target:mia,targetStage:0=bored,You work in <i>law</i>?  Mejare has one law...obey the Grand Ma.
2-female_must_strip,target:mia,targetStage:0=disappointed,There are no law practitioners on Mejare.  Only the state judges, and how badly they punish you for associating with men.

2-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=disappointed,It's <i>poker</i>, not <i>pokermon</i>.
2-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=confused,You train pokuh--<i>what</i>?
2-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=thinking,These <i>Pokemon</i> sound interesting...Mejare doesn't have many animals.
2-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=disappointed,You capture animals for your own amusement...sounds a little cruel, but Mejare treats men that way.
2-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=disappointed,These <i>Pokemon</i> nipping at your heels sounds like Pyoro when he's making his rounds.
2-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=impressed,I know a woman named Misty...well, a <i>girl</i> named Misty.
2-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=thinking,I know a girl named Misty...she's from Pluto.

2-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,marker:shyness=calm,You seem awfully shy to be playing a game like this.  Are you going to be OK?
2-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,marker:shyness=disappointed,How'd a shy girl like you end up in this place?  Do you even know how to play poker?
2-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=disappointed,Are you a student...?  How do men behave in school, anyway?
2-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,marker:shyness=disappointed,How'd a shy girl like you end up in this place?  You don't even look like an adult.

2-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:0=disappointed,You...said something about ponies?  I've seen pictures of ponies, but there are none on Mejare.
2-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:0=disappointed,I can have a tough time reading people...but I'm not sure you're even a person.
2-female_must_strip,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0=disappointed,This is a card game.  Why'd you come armed with...whatever that thing is?
2-female_must_strip,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0=calm,You look pretty good with that sword.  Maybe you could give Jura some instruction.
2-female_must_strip,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0=impressed,Fascinating.  That sword looks like it's made from the lasers our rings use.
2-female_must_strip,target:peach,targetStage:0=confused,You're a..."princess"?
2-female_must_strip,target:peach,targetStage:0=confused,What's a princess?  Some kind of leadership position?

2-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0=disappointed,You dress like Ezra...you kind of look like her, too.
2-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0=calm,You look pretty good with that sword.  Maybe you could give Jura some private lessons.
2-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0,marker:riches_to_rags=thinking,So, you're wealthy?  I grew up wealthy...didn't last.
2-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0=disappointed,My crewmates and I all have different hair colors...we don't base our identities off of that.
2-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0=thinking,Genetic engineering on Mejare has resulted in some pretty outlandish hair colors...

2-female_must_strip,target:rosalina,targetStage:0=calm,So, you travel through space, too...
2-female_must_strip,target:rosalina,targetStage:0=thinking,It can get lonely out in space, wouldn't you agree?
2-female_must_strip,target:rosalina,targetStage:0=impressed,You fly through space on an <i>observatory</i>?
2-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:0=impressed,A <i>ghost</i>?  Now I've seen everything...
2-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:0=impressed,I was under the impression all my opponents would be alive.
2-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:0=impressed,The Paksis creates apparitions sometimes...I don't know how <i>you're</i> here.
2-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:0=confused,How can you see the cards with no eyes?
2-female_must_strip,target:gogo,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,You're from planet "San Fransokyo"?  Just rolls right off the tongue.
2-female_must_strip,target:gogo,targetStage:0=calm,You do something in engineering, correct?  You and Parfet would hit it off.
2-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:0=calm,"Magic," huh...I'd have my doubts, but the Paksis feels like magic sometimes.
2-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:0=calm,Do you really use magic, or just sufficiently advanced technology?
2-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:0=impressed,Can this "magic" be taught?  It sounds like a useful asset.
2-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=pleased,Good to see someone who shares my fashion sense...sort of.
2-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=disappointed,These bodysuits can get uncomfortable...although you seem quite comfortable in yours.
2-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:0=disappointed,Hard to take someone seriously when they won't show their face...

2-female_must_strip,target:zoey,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=disappointed,So, you go to school with <i>men</i>?  Surprised they can sit still long enough.
2-female_must_strip,target:zoey,targetStage:0=confused,You went to a...<i>university</i>?  What's a university?
2-female_must_strip,target:zoey,targetStage:0,marker:state_schools=bored,Everyone is educated by the state on Mejare...so I wouldn't know about your "university."
2-female_must_strip,target:zoey,targetStage:0=disappointed,These "zombies" of yours sound a lot like what the Harvest wants to turn us into.

2-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=disappointed,Is there a reason you felt the need to come armed to a friendly card game?
2-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=disappointed,I see Earth women are still stuck with men's clunky kinetic weapons.
2-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=disappointed,If you're so into weaponry, try Mejare's laser rings.  They're a lot more resourceful.
2-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=annoyed,You'd get along with Barnette...if you seemed capable of getting along with anyone.
2-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=annoyed,You sure like to talk big...as long as you've brought guns to a card game.
2-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=annoyed,You remind me of Miss Liz...if she were totally classless.
2-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=angry,<i>Point those guns at me again and you'll regret it</i>.
2-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=disappointed,Smoking is a disgusting habit...and so unhealthy.
2-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0,marker:oma_and_fama=happy,Someone said you're with a woman...who's the Oma going to be?

2-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Your skin is dark.  Not common on Mejare...there's Valore, I guess.
2-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0=happy,Someone said you're with a woman...Rebekah and Ezra recently had their baby.
2-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Your skin is dark.  Not common on Mejare...and B.C. doesn't count.
2-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0=pleased,Someone said you're with a woman...Jura and Barnette sure get along.
2-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0=disappointed,Someone said you're with a woman...I guess Mejare got its inspiration from some Earth women.
2-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0=thinking,Someone said you're with a woman...I should see if Valore is taken.
2-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0=disappointed,You don't seem too fond of men, either.  You didn't grow up on Mejare, did you?
2-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0=pleased,Looks like there <i>are</i> lesbians on Earth...
2-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0=disappointed,My crewmates and I all have different hair colors...we don't base our identities off of that.
2-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0=thinking,Genetic engineering on Mejare has resulted in some pretty outlandish hair colors...
2-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0=disappointed,And Jura calls <i>me</i> chilly...
2-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0=impressed,You look like that outfit has <i>never</i> come off.
2-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0=thinking,You can show your face, Raven...I know being open with people can be hard.
2-female_must_strip,target:kurumu,targetStage:0=confused,You're a..."vampire"?  You look human to me.
2-female_must_strip,target:kurumu,targetStage:0=disappointed,Do these "vampires" really suck blood?  Right out of the Harvest's playbook...
2-female_must_strip,target:kurumu,targetStage:0=thinking,So, vampires suck blood.  Earth probably has a blood colony out there somewhere...poor souls.
2-female_must_strip,target:tifa,targetStage:0=annoyed,You must be proud of your...assets.
2-female_must_strip,target:tifa,targetStage:0=annoyed,Something tells me you and Jura would get along.  Two things, actually.

2-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=disappointed,I wasn't going to say anything...but that one eye is rather distracting.
2-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=confused,I guess women come in all shapes and eye counts on Earth...or are you not <i>from</i> Earth?
2-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=disappointed,No depth perception?  You'd make a poor pilot.
2-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:0=confused,You study <i>human culture</i>?  What exactly are <i>you</i>?
2-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:0=impressed,You study <i>human culture</i>?  I could probably learn from you...
2-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:0=impressed,You study <i>human culture</i>?  Duero has an anatomy book you might be interested in reading...
2-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:0=pleased,Jura's a big fan of pearls...or really anything that shines.
2-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=confused,You're...<i>streaming</i> this?  I don't understand.
2-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=disappointed,Who are you talking to?
2-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're <i>broadcasting</i> this?  Whatever, no one knows who I am anyway.
2-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=thinking,You're <i>broadcasting</i> this?  They might recognize me on Mejare, but not Earth...
2-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=disappointed,Guess I'm getting a <i>Wanted</i> mugshot tonight.
2-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=thinking,I don't like publicity...not one bit.
2-female_must_strip,target:shego,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=pleased,Good to see someone who shares my fashion sense.

2-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=angry,You look like a military type...I <i>hate</i> soldiers.
2-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=angry,I know you military types.  Always looking for a state-approved means of harassing people.
2-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,I know you military types.  Happy to shut down and kill, never there when it's time to rebuild.
2-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,You'll have to excuse my dislike of woman soldiers.  The last one I met had her knee in my back.
2-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0=disappointed,"Titans," huh?  Those Harvest motherships can get pretty big.
2-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=impressed,...Florina?

2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1=annoyed,Here we go again...take cover.
2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1=angry,Don't you care about safety?
2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1=annoyed,After surviving the first volley, you'd think a woman would know better than to push her luck.
2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1=shocked,You're doing it <i>again</i>?
2-female_must_strip,target:blackrose,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're from a...muh-more-puh-guh?  Use real words.
2-female_must_strip,target:blackrose,targetStage:0=confused,You're an avatar?  As in, not really here?  Where are you projecting this from?
2-female_must_strip,target:blackrose,targetStage:0=confused,This "virtual" business is new to me.  Why not just come here for real?
2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:2=disappointed,Is this "darlin'" of yours a man?  That would explain a lot.
2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:2=disappointed,Have you had a baby with this "darlin'" of yours?  I'm still not sure men are capable of making one.
2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:2=annoyed,I've gone through electroshock...and you need some.
2-female_must_strip,target:black_canary,targetStage:0=pleased,"Black Canary"?  Maybe I should get a professional name...to inspire fear.
2-female_must_strip,target:black_canary,targetStage:0,marker:Mejare_few_animals=confused,"Black Canary"?  I've never seen a canary, but I thought they were yellow.

2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:3=annoyed,I'll just look away...

2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:3=disappointed,Firing straight up?  Right out of Hibiki's playbook.
2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:3=annoyed,At least those can't hit anyone else...
2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:4=bored,At least you're running out of clothes...
2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:4=annoyed,I can't believe you've got more bullets than clothes.
2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:4=disappointed,How could <i>anyone</i> be so fond of those racketous men's weapons?
2-female_must_strip,target:ayano,targetStage:0=disappointed,This girl gives me the creeps...

2-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:0=angry,I'm watching you.  Why do you have that knife?
2-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:0=annoyed,Make any sudden movements, and you'll be on the wrong side of that knife.
2-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:0=angry,Don't you dare try anything with that knife.

2-female_must_strip,target:annie,targetStage:0,marker:state_schools=bored,Everyone is educated by the state on Mejare...they certainly fed me a lot of stories about Tarak.

3-female_must_strip,target:mia,targetStage:0=disappointed,There are no law practitioners on Mejare.  Only the state judges, and how badly they punish you for associating with men.

3-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=disappointed,Is there a reason you felt the need to come armed to a friendly card game?
3-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=disappointed,I see Earth women are still stuck with men's clunky kinetic weapons.
3-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=disappointed,If you're so into weaponry, try Mejare's laser rings.  They're a lot more resourceful.
3-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=annoyed,You'd get along with Barnette...if you seemed capable of getting along with anyone.
3-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=annoyed,You sure like to talk big...as long as you've brought guns to a card game.
3-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=annoyed,You remind me of Miss Liz...if she were totally classless.

3-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0=calm,You look pretty good with that sword.  Maybe you could give Jura some private lessons.
3-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,totalMales:1-3,marker:shyness=disappointed,How could an <i>Earth woman</i> be so shy around men?
3-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,totalMales:1-3,marker:shyness=confused,Didn't you <i>grow up</i> around men?  What's the issue?
3-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,totalMales:1-3=disappointed,If you want to learn about men, talk to Dita.  She's obsessed.
3-female_must_strip,target:shazza,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=thinking,This planet "Australia" of yours sounds rough around the edges.  Just like Tarak...
3-female_must_strip,target:shazza,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=calm,So, what's planet Australia like?  Never heard of it.
3-female_must_strip,target:shazza,targetStage:0=awkward,Australians sure have a unique...manner of speaking.
3-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0=disappointed,And Jura calls <i>me</i> chilly...

3-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0=pleased,You work as a <i>model</i>?  So would Jura, if we were law-abiding Mejarians...
3-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0=pleased,You work as a <i>model</i>?  Probably what Jura wants deep down...
3-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're a <i>goddess</i>?  Don't be so vain.
3-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're a goddess because you live in the sky?  There's a lot more to the universe than <i>that</i>.
3-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=pleased,Jura would probably describe herself as a "goddess"...
3-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=disappointed,I thought <i>Jura</i> dressed extravagantly...
3-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=disappointed,Interesting gun, but I'm not sure why you felt the need to bring it.
3-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=disappointed,I wasn't going to say anything...but that one eye is rather distracting.
3-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=confused,I guess women come in all shapes and eye counts on Earth...or are you not <i>from</i> Earth?
3-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=disappointed,No depth perception?  You'd make a poor pilot.
3-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,marker:state_schools=disappointed,Are you a student...?  I went to state schools on Mejare when I was a little girl...
3-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,marker:shyness=calm,You seem awfully shy to be playing a game like this.  Are you going to be OK?
3-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,marker:shyness=disappointed,How'd a shy girl like you end up in this place?  Do you even know how to play poker?

3-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,marker:shyness=disappointed,How'd a shy girl like you end up in this place?  You don't even look like an adult.

3-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=confused,You go to school with <i>men</i>?  Sounds distracting...and tense.
3-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=thinking,You're a student...I dropped out of school.  Life on the streets isn't fun.

3-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=disappointed,Well, that didn't last long.
3-female_must_strip,target:pauling,targetStage:0=pleased,So, you work for an old woman too.
3-female_must_strip,target:pauling,targetStage:0=thinking,I hear an old woman is <i>your</i> superior, too...and that she's not as kind as the captain.
3-female_must_strip,target:pauling,targetStage:0=addressing,Old women can be difficult to work for sometimes, wouldn't you agree?
3-female_must_strip,target:amy_rose,targetStage:0=disappointed,What's a hedgehog?  Some kind of animal?
3-female_must_strip,target:amy_rose,targetStage:0,marker:Mejare_few_animals=thinking,"Hedgehog"...?  Mejare doesn't have many animals...
3-female_must_strip,target:amy_rose,targetStage:0=disappointed,Something about you looks off...like you aren't quite human.  But then, I used to see men that way, too.

3-female_must_strip,target:blake,targetStage:0=thinking,Genetic engineering on Mejare has resulted in some pretty outlandish hair colors...
3-female_must_strip,target:zoey,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=disappointed,So, you go to school with <i>men</i>?  Surprised they can sit still long enough.
3-female_must_strip,target:zoey,targetStage:0=confused,You went to a...<i>university</i>?  What's a university?
3-female_must_strip,target:zoey,targetStage:0,marker:state_schools=bored,Everyone is educated by the state on Mejare...so I wouldn't know about your "university."
3-female_must_strip,target:zoey,targetStage:0=disappointed,These "zombies" of yours sound a lot like what the Harvest wants to turn us into.
3-female_must_strip,target:daisy,targetStage:0=confused,You're a..."princess"?
3-female_must_strip,target:daisy,targetStage:0=confused,What's a princess?  Some kind of leadership position?
3-female_must_strip,target:daisy,targetStage:0=confused,A princess...is that like the Grand Ma?
3-female_must_strip,target:daisy,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're <i>royalty</i>?  I don't like it when people assume they're better than others.
3-female_must_strip,target:buffy,targetStage:0=disappointed,These "vampires" of yours sound fearsome.  The Harvest probably wants blood from somewhere, too...
3-female_must_strip,target:buffy,targetStage:0=bored,Vampires suck blood, huh...there's probably an Earth colony for blood out there somewhere.
3-female_must_strip,target:buffy,targetStage:0=thinking,I wonder what the blood colony's people must look like.  Probably blushing all the time.
3-female_must_strip,target:buffy,targetStage:0=calm,So, a man helps you fight vampires?  I work with a few men...out of necessity.
3-female_must_strip,target:buffy,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=disappointed,I dropped out of school...hope it's treating you better than it did me.
3-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=disappointed,You seem a little too eager.
3-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're a little...sex-obsessed, don't you think?
3-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're creeping me out with all this sex-talk...
3-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=pleased,Good to see someone who shares my fashion sense...
3-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=calm,These bodysuits can get uncomfortable, wouldn't you agree?
3-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,marker:pilot=pleased,You pilot a mech?  So does Hibiki...and he's learning.
3-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,So, what's planet Korea like?  Never heard of it.
3-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,marker:pilot=happy,You're a pilot, too?  Mechs, Dreads, they're all fascinating.
3-female_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=calm,Finishing strong is important, ~name~.
3-female_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=disappointed,You're better than this, ~name~.
3-female_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=thinking,Dita sometimes makes mistakes under pressure, too.
3-female_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=interested,More streaks like that, and I may have to consider you for a pilot spot.
3-female_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=interested,Did you mean to go so long without losing?
3-female_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=disappointed,You've been almost zenlike...like the people on Anpathos.
3-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=confused,You're a..."princess"?
3-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=confused,What's a princess?  Some kind of leadership position?
3-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=confused,A princess...is that like the Grand Ma?
3-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're <i>royalty</i>?  I don't like it when people assume they're better than others.
3-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=disappointed,I hear there's a male version of you.  I'd hate to see the male version of <i>me</i>.
3-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0=disappointed,A test subject...that's how Earth sees its colonies.
3-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0=bored,I see you've got my affinity for words.
3-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0=impressed,Portals sound useful...even faster-than-light still takes a while.
3-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0=disappointed,Women shouldn't be afraid to speak their minds.
3-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0=disappointed,Hearing you loud and clear.
3-female_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=bored,I won with <i>that</i>?  Embarrassing...
3-female_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=disappointed,I won with a <i>high card</i>...it still feels like a loss.
3-female_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=bored,I had a <i>high card</i>.  Losing would have been more satisfying...
3-female_must_strip,target:ciri,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're a "witcher"?  A Mejarian judge called Jura a witch...for possession of an anatomy book.
3-female_must_strip,target:ciri,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're a "witcher"?  Mejarians who associate with men get called witches...
3-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=disappointed,What are these "video games" you play?  Sounds like something Dita would distract herself with instead of attending flight practice.
3-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=disappointed,You go to school with men?  They don't seem able to focus for long enough.
3-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=bored,You're a student...I'm a dropout.  Let's leave it at that.
3-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=calm,You remind me of Parfet, though you seem a little more outgoing.
3-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=disappointed,You remind me of Parfet.  Does your taste in partners include long hair?
3-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=impressed,You're like if Parfet and Paiway had a child together.
3-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=disappointed,You've got Paiway's build.  Are you old enough to be here?
3-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=disappointed,You look a little unkempt.  Women need to take pride in their bodies as well as their minds.
3-female_must_strip,target:arwen,targetStage:0=confused,You come from the middle of Earth?  I didn't know its population lived underground.
3-female_must_strip,target:arwen,targetStage:0=disappointed,You don't look quite human...and it's not just the ears.
3-female_must_strip,target:arwen,targetStage:0=confused,You're an..."elf"?  You're going to have to explain what that means.
3-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=pleased,You have Barnette's fashion sense...that is, less is more.
3-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=pleased,You have Barnette's sense of style...that is, skin is always in style.
3-female_must_strip,target:gogo,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,You're from planet "San Fransokyo"?  Just rolls right off the tongue.
3-female_must_strip,target:gogo,targetStage:0=calm,You do something in engineering, correct?  You and Parfet would hit it off.
3-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0,marker:oma_and_fama=happy,Someone said you're with a woman...who's the Oma going to be?
3-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0=impressed,Someone said you're with a woman...have the two of you gotten pregnant yet?
3-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Your skin is dark.  Not common on Mejare...there's Amarone, I guess.
3-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Your skin is dark.  Not common on Mejare...there's Valore, I guess.
3-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0=happy,Someone said you're with a woman...Rebekah and Ezra recently had their baby.
3-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Your skin is dark.  Not common on Mejare...and B.C. doesn't count.
3-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0=pleased,Someone said you're with a woman...Jura and Barnette sure get along.
3-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0=disappointed,Someone said you're with a woman...I guess Mejare got its inspiration from some Earth women.
3-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0=thinking,Someone said you're with a woman...I should see if Valore is taken.
3-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0,marker:state_schools=bored,This "academy" of yours sounds like a school...Mejarian schools are just government propaganda.
3-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=disappointed,So, you go to school with men?  Must be a pain getting them to sit still during a lecture.
3-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'm told you're into government.  Mejare's is in need of reform, to put it bluntly.
3-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'm told you're into art.  Jura would probably ask you for a life-size portrait.
3-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=disappointed,This "academy" of yours sounds like a school.  I dropped out of school...
3-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0=calm,I'm told you're into art.  I know Duero painted Parfet something once, so maybe you two should talk.
3-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0=thinking,You have a roommate at this school of yours?  I'd never be comfortable without my single room.
3-female_must_strip,target:tracer,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,So, what's planet Britain like?  Never heard of it.
3-female_must_strip,target:tracer,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=pleased,Good to see someone who shares my fashion sense...besides that glowing device on your chest.
3-female_must_strip,target:tracer,targetStage:0=impressed,That thing lets you <i>go back in time</i>?  Well, I hope you're a good sport.
3-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0=pleased,You look like Paiway's first attempt at makeup.
3-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0=disappointed,So much makeup...I don't wear any.  Just gets in the way.
3-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0=bored,So much makeup...Jura is always trying to convince me to try some.
3-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:0=impressed,A <i>ghost</i>?  Now I've seen everything...
3-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:0=impressed,I was under the impression all my opponents would be alive.
3-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:0=impressed,The Paksis creates apparitions sometimes...I don't know how <i>you're</i> here.
3-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:0=confused,How can you see the cards with no eyes?
3-female_must_strip,target:kim,targetStage:0=disappointed,You dress just like Dita, with that exposed midriff.
3-female_must_strip,target:kim,targetStage:0=disappointed,You <i>save the world</i>?  ...Alright then.
3-female_must_strip,target:kim,targetStage:0=bored,You <i>save the world</i>?  Earth doesn't need saving, as far as I'm concerned.
3-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=angry,You look like a military type...I <i>hate</i> soldiers.
3-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=angry,I know you military types.  Always looking for a state-approved means of harassing people.
3-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,I know you military types.  Happy to shut down and kill, never there when it's time to rebuild.
3-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,You'll have to excuse my dislike of woman soldiers.  The last one I met had her knee in my back.
3-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0=disappointed,"Titans," huh?  Those Harvest motherships can get pretty big.
3-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=pleased,Good to see someone who shares my fashion sense...sort of.
3-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=disappointed,These bodysuits can get uncomfortable...although you seem quite comfortable in yours.
3-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:0=disappointed,Hard to take someone seriously when they won't show their face...
3-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:0=disappointed,I always appreciate being able to look a woman in the eye.
3-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:0,marker:Mejare_few_animals=bored,Mejare doesn't have many animals...and I <i>wish</i> it didn't have spiders.
3-female_must_strip,target:tifa,targetStage:0=annoyed,You must be proud of your...assets.
3-female_must_strip,target:tifa,targetStage:0=annoyed,Something tells me you and Jura would get along.  Two things, actually.
3-female_must_strip,target:tifa,targetStage:0=impressed,<i>You're</i> a martial artist?
3-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0=pleased,You work as a <i>model</i>?  So would Jura, if we were law-abiding Mejarians.
3-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0=pleased,You work as a <i>model</i>?  Probably what Jura wants deep down.
3-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=confused,You go to school with <i>men</i>?  Sounds distracting.
3-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=thinking,You're a student...I dropped out of school.  Bad times.
3-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0,marker:state_schools=disappointed,I hope this "high school" of yours is a little less indoctrinating than Mejare's.
3-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=confused,You're...<i>streaming</i> this?  I don't understand.
3-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=disappointed,Who are you talking to?
3-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're <i>broadcasting</i> this?  Whatever, no one knows who I am anyway.
3-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=thinking,You're <i>broadcasting</i> this?  They might recognize me on Mejare, but not Earth...
3-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=disappointed,Guess I'm getting a <i>Wanted</i> mugshot tonight.
3-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=thinking,I don't like publicity...not one bit.
3-female_must_strip,target:annie,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=disappointed,So...you go to school with <i>men</i>?  Surprised they can sit still long enough.
3-female_must_strip,target:annie,targetStage:0=confused,What's a college?  ...What's a <i>community</i>?
3-female_must_strip,target:annie,targetStage:0,marker:state_schools=bored,Everyone is educated by the state on Mejare...they certainly fed me a lot of stories about Tarak.
3-female_must_strip,target:annie,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=disappointed,This "college" of yours sounds like a school.  I dropped out of school...
3-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0=calm,"Magic," huh...I'd have my doubts, but the Paksis feels like magic sometimes.
3-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0=calm,Do you really use magic, or just sufficiently advanced technology?
3-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you're a witch.  We got called witches on Mejare, but that was for suggesting men were human.
3-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=calm,So...you went to school with <i>men</i>?  Surprised they can sit still long enough.
3-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0,marker:state_schools=bored,A boarding school, huh?  Everyone is educated by the state on Mejare...
3-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=disappointed,A boarding school?  I dropped out of school...though Mejare's didn't teach magic.
3-female_must_strip,target:tina,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,You come from planet "America"?  Sounds like a big place.
3-female_must_strip,target:tina,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,You're awfully proud of this "America" planet.  I suppose the colors are nice.
3-female_must_strip,target:tina,targetStage:0=confused,You...<i>wrestle</i>?  Duero said they do something like that on Tarak.

4-male_must_strip,target:kira,targetStage:0=annoyed,I've always regarded men as simple...not as <i>unhinged</i>.

4-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:0=calm,Do you really use magic, or just sufficiently advanced technology?

4-female_must_strip,target:daria,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're barely bigger than Paiway.  Children aren't allowed here.
4-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0=calm,Fancy dress...your outfit is like Ezra's.
4-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0=disappointed,You dress like Ezra...you kind of look like her, too.
4-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0=calm,You look pretty good with that sword.  Maybe you could give Jura some private lessons.
4-female_must_strip,target:mia,targetStage:0=confused,...What's a lawyer?
4-female_must_strip,target:mia,targetStage:0=bored,You work in <i>law</i>?  Mejare has one law...obey the Grand Ma.
4-female_must_strip,target:mia,targetStage:0=disappointed,There are no law practitioners on Mejare.  Only the state judges, and how badly they punish you for associating with men.
4-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:2=disappointed,Is this "darlin'" of yours a man?  That would explain a lot.
4-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:2=disappointed,Have you had a baby with this "darlin'" of yours?  I'm still not sure men are capable of making one.
4-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:2=annoyed,I've gone through electroshock...and you need some.
4-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:0=thinking,Your planet must be pretty verdant for you to dress like that.  Mejare uses too many natural resources...
4-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:0=bored,Your planet must be pretty verdant for you to dress like that.  Tarak is a wasteland...
4-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:0=pleased,You have Barnette's fashion sense...that is, less is more.
4-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:0=pleased,You have Barnette's sense of style...that is, skin is always in style.
4-female_must_strip,target:black_canary,targetStage:0=pleased,"Black Canary"?  Maybe I should get a professional name...to inspire fear.
4-female_must_strip,target:black_canary,targetStage:0,marker:Mejare_few_animals=confused,"Black Canary"?  I've never seen a canary, but I thought they were yellow.
4-female_must_strip,target:black_canary,targetStage:0,marker:Mejare_few_animals=bored,"Black Canary"?  I <i>wish</i> Mejare had canaries...
4-female_must_strip,target:dawn,targetStage:0=disappointed,It's <i>poker</i>, not <i>pokermon</i>.
4-female_must_strip,target:dawn,targetStage:0=confused,You train pokuh--<i>what</i>?
4-female_must_strip,target:dawn,targetStage:0=thinking,These <i>Pokemon</i> sound interesting...Mejare doesn't have many animals.
4-female_must_strip,target:dawn,targetStage:0=disappointed,You capture animals for your own amusement...sounds a little cruel, but Mejare treats men that way.
4-female_must_strip,target:dawn,targetStage:0=disappointed,These <i>Pokemon</i> nipping at your heels sounds like Pyoro when he's making his rounds.
4-female_must_strip,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0=disappointed,This is a card game.  Why'd you come armed with...whatever that thing is?
4-female_must_strip,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0=calm,You look pretty good with that sword.  Maybe you could give Jura some instruction.
4-female_must_strip,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0=impressed,Fascinating.  That sword looks like it's made from the lasers our rings use.
4-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=calm,You remind me of Parfet, though you seem a little more outgoing.
4-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=disappointed,You remind me of Parfet.  Does your taste in partners include long hair?
4-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=impressed,You're like if Parfet and Paiway had a child together.
4-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=disappointed,You've got Paiway's build.  Are you old enough to be here?
4-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=disappointed,You look a little unkempt.  Women need to take pride in their bodies as well as their minds.
4-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,So, what's planet Switzerland like?  Never heard of it.
4-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=impressed,You're a <i>doctor</i>?  The Nirvana could use you...our only doctor is a man.
4-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=impressed,You're a <i>doctor</i>?  The Nirvana could use you...I don't trust Duero's knowledge of women sometimes.
4-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=impressed,You're a <i>doctor</i>?  The Nirvana could use you...Paiway's just a child nurse in training.
4-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:3=annoyed,I'll just look away...
4-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:3=disappointed,Guess there's no changing you...
4-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:3=disappointed,Firing straight up?  Right out of Hibiki's playbook.
4-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:3=annoyed,At least those can't hit anyone else...
4-female_must_strip,target:arwen,targetStage:0=confused,You come from the middle of Earth?  I didn't know its population lived underground.
4-female_must_strip,target:arwen,targetStage:0=disappointed,You don't look quite human...and it's not just the ears.
4-female_must_strip,target:arwen,targetStage:0=confused,You're an..."elf"?  You're going to have to explain what that means.
4-female_must_strip,target:alpha,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,You're from "Japan"?  Never heard of it...must be a remote planet.
4-female_must_strip,target:alpha,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,Whatever this "Japan" planet is, it seems to produce real oddities...
4-female_must_strip,target:alpha,targetStage:0=bored,You're an "idol"?  Mejare has idols...big pear-shaped statues we're told to honor.
4-female_must_strip,target:alpha,targetStage:0=confused,"Virtual idol"?  Are you some kind of projection?  You're flickering.
4-female_must_strip,target:marceline,targetStage:0=disappointed,Where are your eyes?  Can you even see the cards?
4-female_must_strip,target:marceline,targetStage:0=disappointed,Are you some kind of apparition?  Smacks of the Paksis's work.
4-female_must_strip,target:marceline,targetStage:0=disappointed,I wasn't going to comment on the floating, but...you're floating.
4-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=disappointed,One look at your outfit tells me we'll be here a while.
4-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=calm,Our names are pretty close, Mei.  Whose do you think is better?
4-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=pleased,You work in climate science?  Tarak could use a woman like you...if women didn't terrify them.
4-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=disappointed,You work in climate science?  Maybe you could convince Mejare to allocate its resources better.
4-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,So, what's planet China like?  Never heard of it.
4-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=confused,You...<i>freeze</i> people?  Misty was in cryogenic sleep, but...your way sounds dangerous.
4-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=disappointed,You've got to slim down.  A woman has to stay fit.
4-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:4=bored,At least you're running out of clothes...
4-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:4=annoyed,I can't believe you've got more bullets than clothes.
4-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:4=disappointed,How could <i>anyone</i> be so fond of those racketous men's weapons?
4-female_must_strip,target:may,targetStage:0=disappointed,It's <i>poker</i>, not <i>pokermon</i>.
4-female_must_strip,target:may,targetStage:0=confused,You train pokuh--<i>what</i>?
4-female_must_strip,target:may,targetStage:0=thinking,These <i>Pokemon</i> sound interesting...Mejare doesn't have many animals.
4-female_must_strip,target:may,targetStage:0=disappointed,You capture animals for your own amusement...sounds a little cruel, but Mejare treats men that way.
4-female_must_strip,target:may,targetStage:0=disappointed,These <i>Pokemon</i> nipping at your heels sounds like Pyoro when he's making his rounds.
4-female_must_strip,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're looking a little sickly.  Did ships from Earth do this to you?
4-female_must_strip,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=bored,You're a scientist?  Mejare's scientists work tirelessly to find a universal man-poison.
4-female_must_strip,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're short like Paiway...but Paiway is eleven.  Are you old enough to be here?
4-female_must_strip,target:elena,targetStage:0=confused,You're a..."princess"?
4-female_must_strip,target:elena,targetStage:0=confused,What's a princess?  Some kind of leadership position?
4-female_must_strip,target:elena,targetStage:0=confused,A princess...is that like the Grand Ma?
4-female_must_strip,target:elena,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're <i>royalty</i>?  I don't like it when people assume they're better than others.
4-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,marker:shyness=disappointed,You certainly paint of different picture of Earthlings than the one I'm used to...
4-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,marker:shyness=disappointed,You seem awfully shy to be playing a game like this.  Or is that your motivation for doing so?
4-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,marker:shyness=disappointed,How'd a shy woman like you end up in this place?  Do you even know how to play poker?
4-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,marker:Mejare_few_animals=disappointed,You said you rode in on a "pegasus"?  Mejare has few animals, but I've never even <i>heard</i> of that one.
4-female_must_strip,target:ayano,targetStage:0=disappointed,This girl gives me the creeps...
4-female_must_strip,target:ayano,targetStage:0=disappointed,What's with that look in your eyes?  Like an animal playing dead...
4-female_must_strip,target:ayano,targetStage:0=disappointed,"Yandere"...must be from some archaic Earth language.
4-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=angry,You look like a military type...I <i>hate</i> soldiers.
4-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=angry,I know you military types.  Always looking for a state-approved means of harassing people.
4-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,I know you military types.  Happy to shut down and kill, never there when it's time to rebuild.
4-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,You'll have to excuse my dislike of woman soldiers.  The last one I met had her knee in my back.
4-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0=disappointed,"Titans," huh?  Those Harvest motherships can get pretty big.
4-female_must_strip,target:blake,targetStage:0=disappointed,My crewmates and I all have different hair colors...we don't base our identities off of that.
4-female_must_strip,target:blake,targetStage:0=thinking,Genetic engineering on Mejare has resulted in some pretty outlandish hair colors...
4-female_must_strip,target:daphne,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you solve mysteries...with some men?  Men don't seem smart enough for that.
4-female_must_strip,target:daphne,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you solve mysteries?  The Paksis is one big glowing mystery.
4-female_must_strip,target:daphne,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'm told you get captured a lot.  Allies are important to have...but a woman should be strong on her own.
4-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:0=shocked,Wha--<i>what are you doing</i>?
4-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:0=angry,Don't wave that thing around!
4-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:0=angry,Don't fire that thing!
4-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:0=angry,<i>Where's your trigger discipline</i>?
4-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:0=angry,Why did you <i>bring</i> that thing?
4-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're a <i>goddess</i>?  Don't be so vain.
4-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're a goddess because you live in the sky?  There's a lot more to the universe than <i>that</i>.
4-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=pleased,Jura would probably describe herself as a "goddess"...
4-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=disappointed,I thought <i>Jura</i> dressed extravagantly...
4-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0=pleased,You work as a <i>model</i>?  So would Jura, if we were law-abiding Mejarians.
4-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0=pleased,You work as a <i>model</i>?  Probably what Jura wants deep down.
4-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=confused,You go to school with <i>men</i>?  Sounds distracting.
4-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=thinking,You're a student...I dropped out of school.  Bad times.
4-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0,marker:state_schools=disappointed,I hope this "high school" of yours is a little less indoctrinating than Mejare's.
4-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=impressed,...Florina?
4-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=disappointed,...Is she disqualified, then?
4-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=disappointed,Well, that didn't last long.
4-female_must_strip,target:ciri,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're a "witcher"?  A Mejarian judge called Jura a witch...for possession of an anatomy book.
4-female_must_strip,target:ciri,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're a "witcher"?  Mejarians who associate with men get called witches...
4-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0=calm,"Magic," huh...I'd have my doubts, but the Paksis feels like magic sometimes.
4-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0=calm,Do you really use magic, or just sufficiently advanced technology?
4-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you're a witch.  We got called witches on Mejare, but that was for suggesting men were human.
4-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=calm,So...you went to school with <i>men</i>?  Surprised they can sit still long enough.
4-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0,marker:state_schools=bored,A boarding school, huh?  Everyone is educated by the state on Mejare...
4-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=disappointed,A boarding school?  I dropped out of school...though Mejare's didn't teach magic.
4-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0,marker:riches_to_rags=thinking,A maid?  I had a maid growing up...I wish we had paid her more.
4-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0,marker:oma_and_fama=bored,Being a maid is looked down upon on Mejare...just a stepping stone to finding the Oma of your children.
4-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=thinking,Mejare looks down on maids...Mejare looks down on a lot of professions.
4-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=pleased,Mejare looks down on maids...but they're held in higher regard than pirates.
4-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0,marker:honorifics=confused,What's with the honorifics?  Strange language you must speak at home...
4-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0,marker:honorifics=disappointed,What's with the honorifics?  Maybe Mejare could do with that kind of politeness...
4-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:3-5,targetSaidMarker:french1=happy,Did you slip into your native language before?  That's a little cute.
4-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:3-5,targetSaidMarker:french1=pleased,Despite our differences, humans throughout the galaxy <i>did</i> agree on a language...
4-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:3-5,targetSaidMarker:french1,marker:country_as_planet=impressed,Was that a taste of what they speak on planet France?
4-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0=pleased,You look like Paiway's first attempt at makeup.
4-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0=disappointed,So much makeup...I don't wear any.  Just gets in the way.
4-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0=bored,So much makeup...Jura is always trying to convince me to try some.
4-female_must_strip,target:annie,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=disappointed,So...you go to school with <i>men</i>?  Surprised they can sit still long enough.
4-female_must_strip,target:annie,targetStage:0=confused,What's a college?  ...What's a <i>community</i>?
4-female_must_strip,target:annie,targetStage:0,marker:state_schools=bored,Everyone is educated by the state on Mejare...they certainly fed me a lot of stories about Tarak.
4-female_must_strip,target:annie,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=disappointed,This "college" of yours sounds like a school.  I dropped out of school...
4-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0=disappointed,A test subject...that's how Earth sees its colonies.
4-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0=bored,I see you've got my affinity for words.
4-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0=impressed,Portals sound useful...even faster-than-light still takes a while.
4-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0=disappointed,Women shouldn't be afraid to speak their minds.
4-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0=disappointed,Hearing you loud and clear.
4-female_must_strip,target:neo,targetStage:0=bored,I see you've got my affinity for words.
4-female_must_strip,target:neo,targetStage:0=disappointed,Hearing you loud and clear.
4-female_must_strip,target:neo,targetStage:0=disappointed,Women shouldn't be afraid to speak their minds.
4-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_first_time_playing=confused,...You've never played poker before?  What do Earth women do during downtime?
4-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_first_time_playing=impressed,You've never played poker before?  Gascogne would have a field day with you...
4-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_first_time_playing=confused,You've never played poker before, and you start with <i>strip</i> poker?
4-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=confused,You're a..."princess"?
4-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=confused,What's a princess?  Some kind of leadership position?
4-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=confused,A princess...is that like the Grand Ma?
4-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're <i>royalty</i>?  I don't like it when people assume they're better than others.
4-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=disappointed,I hear there's a male version of you.  I'd hate to see the male version of <i>me</i>.
4-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0,marker:state_schools=bored,This "academy" of yours sounds like a school...Mejarian schools are just government propaganda.
4-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=disappointed,So, you go to school with men?  Must be a pain getting them to sit still during a lecture.
4-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'm told you're into government.  Mejare's is in need of reform, to put it bluntly.
4-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'm told you're into art.  Jura would probably ask you for a life-size portrait.
4-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=disappointed,This "academy" of yours sounds like a school.  I dropped out of school...
4-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0=calm,I'm told you're into art.  I know Duero painted Parfet something once, so maybe you two should talk.
4-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0=thinking,You have a roommate at this school of yours?  I'd never be comfortable without my single room.
4-female_must_strip,target:navi,targetStage:0=confused,...Where's your body, exactly?
4-female_must_strip,target:navi,targetStage:0=calm,You look like a miniature Paksis.  Any relation?
4-female_must_strip,target:navi,targetStage:0=disappointed,You look like the Paksis sprouted wings and shrunk.
4-female_must_strip,target:navi,targetStage:0=disappointed,Are you big enough to hold the cards?
4-female_must_strip,target:kim,targetStage:0=disappointed,You dress just like Dita, with that exposed midriff.
4-female_must_strip,target:kim,targetStage:0=disappointed,You <i>save the world</i>?  ...Alright then.
4-female_must_strip,target:kim,targetStage:0=bored,You <i>save the world</i>?  Earth doesn't need saving, as far as I'm concerned.
4-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=impressed,That's quite the outfit.  I thought <i>my</i> suit was revealing.
4-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=confused,If that suit is meant to be a disguise, this "France" planet must be taxing on the eyes.
4-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,marker:blue_hair=impressed,Hm?  Someone else with blue hair...
4-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,You're from planet "France"?  Well...it's certainly got an aroma.

4-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Your skin is dark.  Not common on Mejare...there's Amarone, I guess.
4-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Your skin is dark.  Not common on Mejare...there's Valore, I guess.
4-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0=happy,Someone said you're with a woman...Rebekah and Ezra recently had their baby.
4-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Your skin is dark.  Not common on Mejare...and B.C. doesn't count.
4-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0=pleased,Someone said you're with a woman...Jura and Barnette sure get along.
4-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0=disappointed,Someone said you're with a woman...I guess Mejare got its inspiration from some Earth women.
4-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0=thinking,Someone said you're with a woman...I should see if Valore is taken.
4-female_must_strip,target:kurumu,targetStage:0=confused,You're a..."vampire"?  You look human to me.
4-female_must_strip,target:kurumu,targetStage:0=disappointed,Do these "vampires" really suck blood?  Right out of the Harvest's playbook...
4-female_must_strip,target:kurumu,targetStage:0=thinking,So, vampires suck blood.  Earth probably has a blood colony out there somewhere...poor souls.
4-female_must_strip,target:amy_rose,targetStage:0=disappointed,What's a hedgehog?  Some kind of animal?
4-female_must_strip,target:amy_rose,targetStage:0,marker:Mejare_few_animals=thinking,"Hedgehog"...?  Mejare doesn't have many animals...

4-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=pleased,Good to see someone who shares my fashion sense...
4-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=calm,These bodysuits can get uncomfortable, wouldn't you agree?

-3-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=disappointed,Smoking is a disgusting habit...and so unhealthy.
-3-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:0=confused,You study <i>human culture</i>?  What exactly are <i>you</i>?
-3-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:0=impressed,You study <i>human culture</i>?  I could probably learn from you...
-3-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:0=impressed,You study <i>human culture</i>?  Duero has an anatomy book you might be interested in reading...
-3-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:0=pleased,Jura's a big fan of pearls...or really anything that shines.
-3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:4=bored,At least you're running out of clothes...
-3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:4=annoyed,I can't believe you've got more bullets than clothes.
-3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:4=disappointed,How could <i>anyone</i> be so fond of those racketous men's weapons?
-3-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_playing_with_boys,marker:shyness=disappointed,Men aren't all that dangerous.  Just simpletons.
-3-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_playing_with_boys,marker:shyness=disappointed,Surely you've grown up around men.  I don't have <i>that</i> benefit.
-3-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_playing_with_boys,marker:shyness=impressed,I never thought an Earth woman would be so shy around men...
-3-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0=calm,Fancy dress...your outfit is like Ezra's.
-3-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0=disappointed,You dress like Ezra...you kind of look like her, too.
-3-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0=calm,You look pretty good with that sword.  Maybe you could give Jura some private lessons.
-3-female_must_strip,target:pauling,targetStage:0=pleased,So, you work for an old woman too.
-3-female_must_strip,target:pauling,targetStage:0=thinking,I hear an old woman is <i>your</i> superior, too...and that she's not as kind as the captain.
-3-female_must_strip,target:pauling,targetStage:0=addressing,Old women can be difficult to work for sometimes, wouldn't you agree?
-3-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=confused,You go to school with <i>men</i>?  Sounds distracting...and tense.
-3-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=thinking,You're a student...I dropped out of school.  Life on the streets isn't fun.
-3-female_must_strip,target:sonya,targetStage:0=calm,Funny.  The "netherrealm" is pretty much how Mejare sees Tarak.
-3-female_must_strip,target:sonya,targetStage:0=impressed,You've got a lot of fight in you.  Always good to see in a woman.
-3-female_must_strip,target:sonya,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=disappointed,I'm a little wary of soliders...Mejare's government isn't too keen on us.
-3-female_must_strip,target:kurumu,targetStage:0=confused,You're a..."vampire"?  You look human to me.
-3-female_must_strip,target:kurumu,targetStage:0=disappointed,Do these "vampires" really suck blood?  Right out of the Harvest's playbook...
-3-female_must_strip,target:kurumu,targetStage:0=thinking,So, vampires suck blood.  Earth probably has a blood colony out there somewhere...poor souls.
-3-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0=pleased,You work as a <i>model</i>?  So would Jura, if we were law-abiding Mejarians...
-3-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0=pleased,You work as a <i>model</i>?  Probably what Jura wants deep down...
-3-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0=disappointed,Any reason you came armed to a friendly card game?
-3-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0=disappointed,Feel free to put the gun down anytime.  This is a <i>card game</i>.
-3-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Your skin is dark.  Not common on Mejare...there's Amarone, I suppose.
-3-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Your skin is dark.  Not common on Mejare...there's Valore, I suppose.
-3-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0=calm,The way you're clutching that gun tells me you and Barnette would hit it off.
-3-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Your skin is dark.  Not common on Mejare...and B.C. doesn't count.
-3-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=disappointed,Interesting gun, but I'm not sure why you felt the need to bring it.
-3-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=disappointed,I wasn't going to say anything...but that one eye is rather distracting.
-3-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=confused,I guess women come in all shapes and eye counts on Earth...or are you not <i>from</i> Earth?
-3-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=disappointed,No depth perception?  You'd make a poor pilot.
-3-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:0=thinking,Your planet must be pretty verdant for you to dress like that.  Mejare uses too many natural resources...
-3-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:0=bored,Your planet must be pretty verdant for you to dress like that.  Tarak is a wasteland...
-3-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:0=pleased,You have Barnette's fashion sense...that is, less is more.
-3-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:0=pleased,You have Barnette's sense of style...that is, skin is always in style.
-3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=impressed,That's quite the outfit.  I thought <i>my</i> suit was revealing.
-3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=confused,If that suit is meant to be a disguise, this "France" planet must be taxing on the eyes.
-3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,marker:blue_hair=impressed,Hm?  Someone else with blue hair...
-3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,You're from planet "France"?  Well...it's certainly got an aroma.
-3-female_must_strip,target:shego,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=pleased,Good to see someone who shares my fashion sense.
-3-female_must_strip,target:shego,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=calm,These bodysuits can get uncomfortable, wouldn't you agree?
-3-female_must_strip,target:shego,targetStage:0=disappointed,You look like you're having fun already.
-3-female_must_strip,target:kim,targetStage:0=disappointed,You dress just like Dita, with that exposed midriff.
-3-female_must_strip,target:kim,targetStage:0=disappointed,You <i>save the world</i>?  ...Alright then.
-3-female_must_strip,target:kim,targetStage:0=bored,You <i>save the world</i>?  Earth doesn't need saving, as far as I'm concerned.
-3-female_must_strip,target:amy_rose,targetStage:0=disappointed,What's a hedgehog?  Some kind of animal?
-3-female_must_strip,target:amy_rose,targetStage:0,marker:Mejare_few_animals=thinking,"Hedgehog"...?  Mejare doesn't have many animals...
-3-female_must_strip,target:amy_rose,targetStage:0=disappointed,Something about you looks off...like you aren't quite human.  But then, I used to see men that way, too.
-3-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:0=impressed,A <i>ghost</i>?  Now I've seen everything...
-3-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:0=impressed,I was under the impression all my opponents would be alive.
-3-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:0=impressed,The Paksis creates apparitions sometimes...I don't know how <i>you're</i> here.
-3-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:0=confused,How can you see the cards with no eyes?
-3-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0,marker:state_schools=bored,This "academy" of yours sounds like a school...Mejarian schools are just government propaganda.
-3-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=disappointed,So, you go to school with men?  Must be a pain getting them to sit still during a lecture.
-3-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'm told you're into government.  Mejare's is in need of reform, to put it bluntly.
-3-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'm told you're into art.  Jura would probably ask you for a life-size portrait.
-3-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=disappointed,This "academy" of yours sounds like a school.  I dropped out of school...
-3-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0=calm,I'm told you're into art.  I know Duero painted Parfet something once, so maybe you two should talk.
-3-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0=thinking,You have a roommate at this school of yours?  I'd never be comfortable without my single room.
-3-female_must_strip,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0=disappointed,This is a card game.  Why'd you come armed with...whatever that thing is?
-3-female_must_strip,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0=calm,You look pretty good with that sword.  Maybe you could give Jura some instruction.
-3-female_must_strip,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0=impressed,Fascinating.  That sword looks like it's made from the lasers our rings use.
-3-female_must_strip,target:shazza,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=thinking,This planet "Australia" of yours sounds rough around the edges.  Just like Tarak...
-3-female_must_strip,target:shazza,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=calm,So, what's planet Australia like?  Never heard of it.
-3-female_must_strip,target:shazza,targetStage:0=awkward,Australians sure have a unique...manner of speaking.
-3-female_must_strip,target:alpha,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,You're from "Japan"?  Never heard of it...must be a remote planet.
-3-female_must_strip,target:alpha,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,Whatever this "Japan" planet is, it seems to produce real oddities...
-3-female_must_strip,target:alpha,targetStage:0=bored,You're an "idol"?  Mejare has idols...big pear-shaped statues we're told to honor.
-3-female_must_strip,target:alpha,targetStage:0=confused,"Virtual idol"?  Are you some kind of projection?  You're flickering.
-3-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0=calm,"Magic," huh...I'd have my doubts, but the Paksis feels like magic sometimes.
-3-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0=calm,Do you really use magic, or just sufficiently advanced technology?
-3-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you're a witch.  We got called witches on Mejare, but that was for suggesting men were human.
-3-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=calm,So...you went to school with <i>men</i>?  Surprised they can sit still long enough.
-3-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0,marker:state_schools=bored,A boarding school, huh?  Everyone is educated by the state on Mejare...
-3-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=disappointed,A boarding school?  I dropped out of school...though Mejare's didn't teach magic.
-3-female_must_strip,target:sharla,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Your skin is dark.  Not common on Mejare...besides Amarone.
-3-female_must_strip,target:sharla,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Your skin is dark.  Not common on Mejare...besides Valore.
-3-female_must_strip,target:sharla,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Your skin is dark.  Not common on Mejare...and B.C. doesn't count.
-3-female_must_strip,target:marceline,targetStage:0=disappointed,Where are your eyes?  Can you even see the cards?
-3-female_must_strip,target:marceline,targetStage:0=disappointed,Are you some kind of apparition?  Smacks of the Paksis's work.
-3-female_must_strip,target:marceline,targetStage:0=disappointed,I wasn't going to comment on the floating, but...you're floating.
-3-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Is there a reason you brought a knife?
-3-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:0=angry,I'm watching you.  Why do you have that knife?
-3-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:0=annoyed,Make any sudden movements, and you'll be on the wrong side of that knife.
-3-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:0=angry,Don't you dare try anything with that knife.
-3-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0,marker:riches_to_rags=thinking,A maid?  I had a maid growing up...I wish we had paid her more.
-3-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0,marker:oma_and_fama=bored,Being a maid is looked down upon on Mejare...just a stepping stone to finding the Oma of your children.
-3-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=thinking,Mejare looks down on maids...Mejare looks down on a lot of professions.
-3-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=pleased,Mejare looks down on maids...but they're held in higher regard than pirates.
-3-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0,marker:honorifics=confused,What's with the honorifics?  Strange language you must speak at home...
-3-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0,marker:honorifics=disappointed,What's with the honorifics?  Maybe Mejare could do with that kind of politeness...
-3-female_must_strip,target:shantae,targetStage:0=confused,...I'm sorry, you said you were a <i>genie</i>?
-3-female_must_strip,target:shantae,targetStage:0=confused,What exactly is a "genie"?
-3-female_must_strip,target:shantae,targetStage:0=confused,Is "genie" some kind of Earth race?
-3-female_must_strip,target:shantae,targetStage:0=confused,Does "genie" just mean "dark skin"?  Amarone never calls herself a genie...
-3-female_must_strip,target:shantae,targetStage:0=confused,Does "genie" just mean "dark skin"?  Valore never called herself a genie...
-3-female_must_strip,target:shantae,targetStage:0=disappointed,Does "genie" just mean "dark skin"?  B.C. never calls herself a genie...but then, she doesn't exactly count.
-3-female_must_strip,target:peach,targetStage:0=confused,You're a..."princess"?
-3-female_must_strip,target:peach,targetStage:0=confused,What's a princess?  Some kind of leadership position?
-3-female_must_strip,target:peach,targetStage:0=confused,A princess...is that like the Grand Ma?
-3-female_must_strip,target:peach,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're <i>royalty</i>?  I don't like it when people assume they're better than others.
-3-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=impressed,...Florina?
-3-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=disappointed,...Is she disqualified, then?
-3-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=disappointed,Well, that didn't last long.

-3-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Your skin is dark.  Not common on Mejare...there's Valore, I guess.
-3-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0=happy,Someone said you're with a woman...Rebekah and Ezra recently had their baby.
-3-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Your skin is dark.  Not common on Mejare...and B.C. doesn't count.
-3-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0=pleased,Someone said you're with a woman...Jura and Barnette sure get along.
-3-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0=disappointed,Someone said you're with a woman...I guess Mejare got its inspiration from some Earth women.
-3-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0=thinking,Someone said you're with a woman...I should see if Valore is taken.

#OPPONENT REMOVING ACCESSORY
#These lines are spoken when an opponent removes a small item that does not cover any skin.
#Typically, characters are fine with this when they are fully dressed but less satisfied as they become more naked.
#Note that all "removing" lines are NOT spoken to human players. Characters will skip straight from "6-male_human_must_strip" to "6-male_removed_accessory", for example.

2-female_removed_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:2=calm,No need to get all angry.  You have plenty of clothes to lose still.

3-male_removing_accessory=unimpressed,I see.  You plan to bore us into stripping.
3-male_removing_accessory=confused,You were wearing that?  I didn't even notice it.
3-male_removed_accessory=addressing,We'll see if you can keep up that smug attitude.

3-female_removing_accessory=disappointed,That doesn't look important, so forgive me for being less than impressed.
3-female_removing_accessory=thinking,Just your ~clothing~...only myself to blame.
3-female_removing_accessory=thinking,Mejarian soldiers don't actually wear much more than I do...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=unimpressed,What a shock.  The soldier immediately threatens violence when her loyalties are questioned.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're threatening me now?  You're already a model Mejarian imperial.

3-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0=calm,Jura has a sword like that...but she doesn't practice enough.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0=bored,I would've brought my laser ring if I knew this place allowed weapons...

3-female_removed_accessory=pleased,How would Parfet fare at this, I wonder?  She's booksmart, but a little obvious.
3-female_removed_accessory=bored,I shouldn't be losing.  I have to rethink things...

-3-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:3=confused,Is that crown what marks you as a "princess"?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=unimpressed,What a shock.  The soldier immediately threatens violence when her loyalties are questioned.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're threatening me now?  You're already a model Mejarian imperial.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=thinking,I <i>used</i> to start fights in these sorts of places...I'd like to move on from that.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetSaidMarker:bee=disappointed,What's that thing?  Oh, right, a bee.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetSaidMarker:bee=bored,Mejare <i>does</i> have bees...women need to maintain their flower gardens, after all.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetSaidMarker:bee=thinking,How'd a bee get in here?  ...How'd <i>I</i> get in here?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:7=impressed,I thought you just weren't including that.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:7=pleased,Pilots need better presence of mind than that...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:7=calm,You need to be better aware of your options.  It's a dangerous universe out there.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0=thinking,Good...I was worried about that thing.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0=disappointed,Why'd you bring that knife in the first place?  Is that how you died?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0=bored,I <i>hate</i> knives...or <i>anything</i> sharp.

-3-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=confused,I wasn't told about any stripping-order rules.  Just common sense to not expose yourself unless necessary.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=bored,You're on a different planet than the rest of us, so to speak...
-3-female_removed_accessory=interested,You play as fiercely as Gascogne...
-3-female_removed_accessory=addressing,I can respect a woman with such fierce competitiveness.  I am one.
-3-female_removed_accessory=interested,I can respect a woman with such fierce competitiveness...
-3-female_removed_accessory=interested,Going for the quick and merciless kill...like a true pilot.
-3-female_removed_accessory=addressing,You've got a pirate's killer instinct, ~name~.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=disappointed,...I'm just going to ignore you from now on.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=disappointed,That's it.  I'm ignoring you.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=disappointed,...You're not worth my attention.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=disappointed,Are you drinking?  I didn't even know this place served alcohol.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=disappointed,Are you drinking?  Jura drinks too much.  Always hungover at the next morning's meeting.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=disappointed,Are you drinking?  No thanks.  Can't lose control of myself.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=annoyed,Drinking...just like a soldier.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=disappointed,Are you drinking?  The state-approved Mejarian libations are all full of estrogen.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=bored,Half-naked and liquored-up sounds like a bad combination.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=thinking,I don't drink, Sei...not anymore.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=confused,You have...cat ears?  Earth is a strange planet...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=confused,What's wrong with having cat ears?  It makes you unique.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=disappointed,I was wondering why you waited so long to take that off.  I don't see what the issue is, but...sorry.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=disappointed,I suppose medics are a little less reprehensible.  Maybe you could help train Paiway.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=unimpressed,How thoughtful of you.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=bored,Actually, if you're a medic, the Nirvana could use you.  Our only doctor is a man.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:leela,targetStage:1=calm,That gun is pretty interesting...shaped like a man's kinetic one, but fires energy like a woman's.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:leela,targetStage:1=impressed,Barnette would have liked to take a look at that gun...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:leela,targetStage:1=calm,I have my own experience combining men and women's weapons together...not with guns, though.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:2=disappointed,You look a little incensed.  Surely you understood this was part of the game.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:2=calm,No need to get all angry.  You have plenty of clothes to lose still.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:2=calm,You're turning all red.  You'll never win this if you lose your composure so early.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3-4,marker:ignoring_moon=bored,...

-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=pleased,Jura got Dita drunk once.  She was essentially the same, just less energetic.

-2-female_removing_accessory=mast-4-disappointed,I hate vanity...and now I'm hating you.
-2-female_removing_accessory=mast-3-disappointed,This is what I get for playing badly...
-2-female_removing_accessory=mast-2-disappointed,Mocking your enemy after they've lost is poor form.
-2-female_removing_accessory=mast-4-disappointed,This game was supposed to loosen <i>me</i> up.  You could use some of that...
-2-female_removing_accessory=mast-2-disappointed,...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=mast-3-disappointed,As if I'd want to touch one of those clunky men's weapons.

-2-female_removed_accessory=mast-2-disappointed,I like women too, you know.  You could help me out here.
-2-female_removed_accessory=mast-3-pleased,No need to be shy, ~name~.  I've shot that to hell.

-1-male_removing_accessory=interested-2,Even now, you refuse to give me an inch...
-1-male_removing_accessory=impressed-2,I <i>masturbated</i> for you, and you're still only down to your ~clothing~...
-1-male_removing_accessory=impressed-2,<i>Still</i>?  I lost this badly to a man?
-1-male_removing_accessory=bored-2,...Women are more fun.
-1-male_removed_accessory=interested-2,For me to be outplayed so thoroughly...

0-male_removing_minor=bored,This is boring...
0-male_removing_minor=disappointed,You've got a cooler head than Hibiki.  He'd be all worked up by now.
0-male_removing_minor=bored,Dita still thinks men are aliens.  That would be a lot more interesting, honestly...
0-male_removing_minor=bored,Should have done some research on how men dress.
0-male_removed_minor=calm,...
0-male_removed_minor=pleased,For a while, Dita was convinced men just had refractive force-fields instead of clothes.
0-male_removed_minor=disappointed,Mejare would strip you down if they captured you...but they wouldn't make a game of it.
0-male_removed_minor=calm,Interesting.  A year ago I wasn't sure men <i>wore</i> clothes.
0-male_removed_minor=calm,Shall we continue?
0-male_removed_minor=disappointed,You're being very predictable.
0-male_removed_minor,target:link,targetStage:2=disappointed,Are you making fun of me?  I know men aren't actually animals...
0-male_removed_minor,target:link,targetStage:2=disappointed,Why are you just grunting?
0-male_removed_minor,target:link,targetStage:2=bored,Maybe men really <i>are</i> just animals...
0-female_removing_minor=calm,...
0-female_removing_minor=awkward,You should have worn more clothing...of course, I don't have much on myself.
0-female_removing_minor=disappointed,This game is a little strange.  Couldn't you win just by wearing tons of accessories?
0-female_removing_minor=impressed,A little more substantial.
0-female_removing_minor=thinking,I don't own many clothes like that...
0-female_removing_minor=thinking,I used to own something like that...but it doesn't fit me anymore.
0-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=disappointed,Don't bullets put you on edge?
0-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=annoyed,I guess you've never suffered loss.

0-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=annoyed,If one of my pilots pulled a stunt like this, I'd slap their necks broken.

0-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetSaidMarker:bee=thinking,How'd a bee get in here?  ...How'd <i>I</i> get in here?
0-female_removing_minor,target:sei,targetStage:3=disappointed,Sounds expensive.  Couldn't you put that money towards public housing?
0-female_removing_minor,target:sei,targetStage:3=bored,Soldiers are so enamored with their toys...
0-female_removing_minor,target:sei,targetStage:3=disappointed,Sounds impressive, but I'd rather that money went towards someone's meal.
0-female_removed_minor=calm,...
0-female_removed_minor=thinking,You've got to focus.  Focus is key to almost anything.
0-female_removed_minor=disappointed,You'll be out soon at this rate.
0-female_removed_minor=disappointed,Don't choke under pressure.  Probably Jura's biggest flaw.
0-female_removed_minor=thinking,Not much of a game without an even playing field to begin with...
0-female_removed_minor=disappointed,I hope you're not about to give up.  I hate quitters.
0-female_removed_minor=disappointed,Keep me interested, ~name~.

0-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4=unimpressed,...Or just keep drinking.  That'll help.
0-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4=disappointed,I'd be impressed if drinking weren't so unsightly.
0-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4=disappointed,It's exhausting just <i>watching</i> you drink.

2-male_removing_minor=calm,That's about a fair trade for what I've removed thus far.
2-male_removing_minor=addressing,Fair enough.  Not the type to go easy on your opponents?
2-male_removing_minor,marker:state_schools=annoyed,Wish I read more about men's outfits.  Mejare's schools would have you believe they don't wear any.
2-male_removing_minor=pleased,I'm speechless.
2-male_removing_minor=disappointed,Your ~clothing~...not something a Tarakkian would wear.  They're all about resourcefulness.
2-male_removing_minor=confused,Your ~clothing~...why would a man wear that?
2-male_removed_minor=calm,...
2-male_removed_minor=addressing,We should be about even now, yes?
2-male_removed_minor=addressing,Hibiki would never let someone see fear in his eyes.  Can't say the same for you.
2-male_removed_minor=pleased,Soon you'll be showing more skin.  Of course, Mejarians believe men's skin is all bristly.
2-male_removed_minor=pleased,Rabat would probably be cheating be at this point...
2-male_removed_minor=disappointed,Games shouldn't be dragged out.  Dogfights aren't.
2-male_removed_minor,target:link,targetStage:2=disappointed,Are you making fun of me?  I know men aren't actually animals...
2-male_removed_minor,target:link,targetStage:2=disappointed,Why are you just grunting?
2-male_removed_minor,target:link,targetStage:2=bored,Maybe men really <i>are</i> just animals...
2-female_removing_minor=pleased,The blockades are clearing out, it seems.
2-female_removing_minor=pleased,I wonder if my crewmates have any clothes like that...
2-female_removing_minor=pleased,Dita doesn't wear much more than her crop-top...and she's a little too innocent for this place.
2-female_removing_minor=thinking,I think that was in style when I was a girl...
2-female_removing_minor=disappointed,Not something I'd wear myself.
2-female_removing_minor=calm,...
2-female_removing_minor,target:sei,targetStage:3=disappointed,Sounds expensive.  Couldn't you put that money towards public housing?
2-female_removing_minor,target:sei,targetStage:3=bored,Soldiers are so enamored with their toys...
2-female_removing_minor,target:sei,targetStage:3=disappointed,Sounds impressive, but I'd rather that money went towards someone's meal.
2-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=disappointed,Don't bullets put you on edge?
2-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=annoyed,I guess you've never suffered loss.
2-female_removing_minor,target:moon,targetStage:4,marker:ignoring_moon=bored,...
2-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=disappointed,I still can't believe I'm watching this.
2-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=annoyed,If one of my pilots pulled a stunt like this, I'd slap their necks broken.
2-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=annoyed,Even Hibiki isn't <i>this</i> reckless.
2-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetSaidMarker:bee=disappointed,What's that thing?  Oh, right, a bee.
2-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetSaidMarker:bee=bored,Mejare <i>does</i> have bees...women need to maintain their flower gardens, after all.
2-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetSaidMarker:bee=thinking,How'd a bee get in here?  ...How'd <i>I</i> get in here?
2-female_removed_minor=addressing,Are we about even, then?  Always nice to see a woman who can keep up with me.
2-female_removed_minor=disappointed,You're building the tension, but I get enough tension when I pilot.
2-female_removed_minor=pleased,Part of me likes this.  We should get more immersed in the game before it gets worse.
2-female_removed_minor=pleased,Knowing Jura, she owns something like that...
2-female_removed_minor=bored,I'm trying to picture how much clothing my each of my crewmates wears...
2-female_removed_minor=calm,...
2-female_removed_minor,target:moon,targetStage:5,marker:ignoring_moon=bored,...
2-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:1=impressed,...Wait, what did you just do?
2-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:1=impressed,...Where'd they go?
2-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:1=calm,Looks useful.  Can this "magic" be taught?
2-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4=unimpressed,...Or just keep drinking.  That'll help.
2-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4=disappointed,I'd be impressed if drinking weren't so unsightly.
2-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4=disappointed,It's exhausting just <i>watching</i> you drink.
2-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=surprised-horny,Oh, God.  I'm so sorry...
2-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=thinking,I'm sorry if I was taunting you...
2-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=thinking,It was brave of you to play this game...
2-female_removed_minor,target:chell,targetStage:1=calm,People say <i>I'm</i> quiet...you haven't said a word.
2-female_removed_minor,target:chell,targetStage:1=disappointed,And people say <i>I'm</i> quiet...
2-female_removed_minor,target:chell,targetStage:1=thinking,Silence can say a lot...
2-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=annoyed,Unbelievable that someone could be this careless.
2-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=bored,I take back anything I've said about Hibiki being stupid.  This is ridiculous.
2-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=angry,See?  You could have died.  Does that mean nothing to you?
2-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=annoyed,Maybe if you lost someone dear to you, you would understand how precious life is.
2-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=annoyed,Is your "darlin'" OK with you risking accidental suicide?
2-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=annoyed,One date with the Harvest would teach you the value of life.


#lost bodysuit
3-male_removing_minor=addressing,Your ~clothing~...so my chances are better than I thought.
3-male_removing_minor=pleased,Ooh, your ~clothing~.  Someone tell the captain.
3-male_removing_minor=addressing,Stalling for time?  Not a very masculine move.
3-male_removing_minor=confused,I really thought men just threw on some rags and went about their days.
3-male_removing_minor=unimpressed,I applaud your devotion to competition.
3-male_removed_minor=addressing,You'll be as bare as I am soon...which I can live with.
3-male_removed_minor=addressing,What do Earth women think of you, dolling yourself up like this?
3-male_removed_minor=pleased,Hibiki would strip two at a time.  Not for exhibitionism, just to prove he's tough.
3-male_removed_minor=addressing,Don't think you can just taunt me like that.
3-male_removed_minor=interested,I'm not <i>that</i> far behind.
3-male_removed_minor=smug,Trying to think of ways to get me naked?  There's only one.
3-male_removed_minor,target:link,targetStage:2=disappointed,Are you making fun of me?  I know men aren't actually animals...
3-male_removed_minor,target:link,targetStage:2=disappointed,Why are you just grunting?
3-male_removed_minor,target:link,targetStage:2=bored,Maybe men really <i>are</i> just animals...
3-female_removing_minor=bored,Perhaps the game will progress after this...
3-female_removing_minor=disappointed,Your ~clothing~...not quite a fair exchange for underwear.
3-female_removing_minor=addressing,You're just taunting me.  So does Jura, and it never works out for her.
3-female_removing_minor=addressing,You've lost the hand, and you've used that to prove your own vanity.
3-female_removing_minor=disappointed,I play games for the thrill, you know.  Not for fashion tips.
3-female_removing_minor,target:sei,targetStage:3=disappointed,Sounds expensive.  Couldn't you put that money towards public housing?
3-female_removing_minor,target:sei,targetStage:3=bored,Soldiers are so enamored with their toys...

3-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetSaidMarker:bee=disappointed,What's that thing?  Oh, right, a bee.
3-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetSaidMarker:bee=bored,Mejare <i>does</i> have bees...women need to maintain their flower gardens, after all.
3-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetSaidMarker:bee=thinking,How'd a bee get in here?  ...How'd <i>I</i> get in here?

3-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=disappointed,Don't bullets put you on edge?
3-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=annoyed,I guess you've never suffered loss.
3-female_removed_minor=addressing,How long does your wardrobe hold out?
3-female_removed_minor=pleased,I wonder how B.C. would do at this.  She <i>is</i> rather cunning...
3-female_removed_minor=bored,Smart strategies do tend to be boring ones...
3-female_removed_minor=bored,So much clothing.  Mejarians love fashion, but it usually doesn't cover much.
3-female_removed_minor=bored,This is mostly frustration at myself...
3-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4=unimpressed,...Or just keep drinking.  That'll help.
3-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4=disappointed,I'd be impressed if drinking weren't so unsightly.

#lost bra
4-male_removing_minor=pleased,A man all cocky like this...guess that's where the word came from.
4-male_removing_minor=interested,You still have a lead...for now.
4-male_removing_minor=addressing,Sit pretty while you can.
4-male_removing_minor=bored,This game was meant to be stimulating, and not just visually.
4-male_removed_minor=addressing,My comeback is underway.  At least you have my breasts to watch as it happens.
4-male_removed_minor=interested,I used to hear rumors that men just wore meat pelts...
4-male_removed_minor=addressing,Don't think you're safe.
4-male_removed_minor=interested,My Dread is the fastest in the fleet.  I have experience catching up.
4-male_removed_minor=addressing,One flaw in your plan, and you'll be overrun...

4-female_removing_minor=smug,Congratulations on your lead...but I'm not easy to put away.
4-female_removing_minor=bored,Now I'm bored <i>and</i> frustrated...
4-female_removing_minor=stretching,You're doing well, but this game can turn around in a hurry.
4-female_removing_minor=pleased,Leads are never secure in poker.  Gascogne always makes me learn that the hard way.
4-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetSaidMarker:bee=disappointed,What's that thing?  Oh, right, a bee.

-2-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=mast-3-disappointed,Unbelievable that someone could be this careless.

-2-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=mast-4-disappointed,See?  You could have died.  Does that mean nothing to you?

-1-male_removing_minor=addressing-2,That's <i>something</i>, at least.  But not enough for my tastes.
-1-male_removing_minor=pleased-2,That's more substantial.  Perhaps I <i>can</i> get another round out of myself...
-1-male_removing_minor=pleased-2,Never thought a man could teach me about <i>strategy</i>...
-1-male_removing_minor=bored-2,This is like being taken prisoner...on Tarak.
-1-male_removed_minor=addressing-2,The real sting of this is that I'm not the one forcing you to do it.
-1-male_removed_minor=pleased-2,Hard to be engaged when you've just squirted all your tension away.

-1-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=annoyed-2,If one of my pilots pulled a stunt like this, I'd slap their necks broken.

-1-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=disappointed-2,I guess you've never suffered loss.

-1-female_removed_minor=pleased-2,Well, I've got no right to complain...I played like a novice.

#OPPONENT REMOVING MAJOR CLOTHING
#Major clothing reveals a significant amount of skin and likely underwear.
#However, as we don't know if the opponent is taking off the top or the bottom, we can't presume that nice abs are showing; maybe she took of her skirt before her shirt.

#fully clothed
0-male_removing_major=disappointed,Men are fighters, no?  Put up a good fight for me.
0-male_removing_major=awkward,The layers peel away, but I've no clue how many there are.
0-male_removing_major=awkward,I'm having a hard time getting a read on male outfits, let alone what's underneath...

0-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1=surprised-horny,...Marinette?

0-female_removing_major,target:jasmine,targetStage:1=confused,That was a disguise?  I'm not interested in your politics.
0-female_removed_major=calm,It's the cards that save you, not the clothes.
0-female_removed_major=disappointed,Believe in yourself.  No one else will before you do.
0-female_removed_major=disappointed,Come on, give me a challenge.
0-female_removed_major=addressing,You're looking a little bare, ~name~.  Maybe you'd rather be with Jura in the hot springs.

0-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2=confused,You're a..."superhero"?  I don't follow...
0-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2=impressed,You looked like you were made of Paksis energy for a second there...

0-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,marker:Mejare_few_animals=thinking,I've heard of ladybugs...but Mejare doesn't have any.

0-female_removed_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2=confused,That looks so tight...wear why it?

0-female_removed_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2=disappointed,No wonder you're so polite.  That thing must choke the life out of you.

0-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3=calm,Why hide your face?  You look perfectly fine.
0-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3=impressed,I didn't know Earth women had skin colors like that...
0-female_removed_major,target:ayano,targetStage:6=happy,...I actually own a swimsuit like that.  Gascogne gave it to me.
0-female_removed_major,target:ayano,targetStage:6=pleased,...I actually own a swimsuit like that.  But we all use the hot springs naked anyway.
0-female_removed_major,target:ayano,targetStage:6=disappointed,I actually own a swimsuit like that.  But mine isn't covered in blood.
0-female_removed_major,target:ayano,targetStage:6=disappointed,Bloodstains...menstrual issues, or just a murderer?

0-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,marker:pubic_hair_comments=bored,Pubic hair must be popular on Earth...and some of my crewmates don't have the diligence to stay shaven.

0-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2=disappointed,Why were you hiding your face in the first place?  Are you some kind of outlaw?
0-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2=pleased,Celtic hid her whole body for a while...because she was afraid of men's germs.
0-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=angry,You could've killed someone!

0-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=annoyed,Men's kinetic weapons are so uncivilized.
0-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=angry,I hope you're proud of your reckless disregard for safety.
0-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=angry,Danger is <i>not</i> something you joke about!
0-female_removed_major,alsoPlaying:shego,alsoPlayingStage:4=impressed,My bodysuit is tight enough...I'd never wear <i>that</i> underneath it.
0-female_removed_major,alsoPlaying:shego,alsoPlayingStage:4=impressed,Doesn't that make it hard to breathe?  Mobility is important, you know...
0-female_removed_major,alsoPlaying:shego,alsoPlayingStage:4=confused,...OK, <i>nobody</i> on Mejare wears that.
0-female_removed_major,target:moon=disappointed,...I don't understand.  You just want to lose?  Why play at all?

1-male_removing_major=pleased,Too bad.  I was starting to appreciate the mystery you brought to this game for me.

1-male_removed_major=thinking,I think I'm starting to gather what men would rather keep covered...
1-male_removed_major=disappointed,Dita would have a waterfall of a nosebleed at this point.
1-male_removed_major=addressing,Do men feel shame?  Or are you all just wild animals?

1-female_removed_major=calm,I don't give up on friends...if they don't give up on themselves.

0-male_chest_will_be_visible=disappointed,Couldn't you make me lose <i>one</i> hand before exposing yourself?
0-male_chest_will_be_visible=impressed,The male upper body...?  Interesting.
0-male_chest_will_be_visible=pleased,I wonder if it'll match the pictures in Duero's book.
0-male_chest_will_be_visible=surprised-horny,...This is new.
0-male_chest_will_be_visible=addressing,I've pushed you to nudity already?  I guess men can't play cards.
0-male_chest_is_visible=awkward,You're in good shape...I think.
0-male_chest_is_visible=interested,Good to see you take care of yourself.  Can't always trust a man to do that.
0-male_chest_is_visible=impressed,You're in good shape.  I respect that, even for a man.
0-male_chest_is_visible=pleased,If only I could get my crewmates into better shape.
0-male_chest_is_visible=surprised-horny,I've...never seen a man like this.
0-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=angry,I thought you said you were a man!
0-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=confused,OK, now I'm <i>really</i> confused.  Men can have breasts?
0-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=annoyed,...So you're a woman?  Are you making fun of me?
0-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=annoyed,If you want to appeal to both men and women, I wouldn't recommend a horrific mishmash of the two.
0-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=annoyed,Speaking as a woman...that's not very appealing.
0-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=impressed,I was about to comment on your chest, but...that underwear is distracting.
0-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=confused,Huh.  I would have thought men wore different underwear than women, on account of that tube-thing.
0-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=impressed,For a man...you look very feminine.
0-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=disappointed,Bart dressed up like a woman once, too...men should really avoid doing that.
0-male_crotch_will_be_visible=pleased,First contact, you might say.
0-male_crotch_will_be_visible=impressed,So we'll be seeing his...<i>tube</i>?
0-male_crotch_will_be_visible=impressed,Your...thing?
0-male_crotch_will_be_visible=confused,Your tube, right?  It's...shaped like a tube?
0-male_crotch_will_be_visible=pleased,And here I thought I'd have to work a little to see this...
0-male_crotch_will_be_visible,totalRounds:0-10=shocked,I--I haven't prepared myself for this.
0-male_crotch_will_be_visible,totalRounds:0-10=surprised-horny,A man's thing?  A-already?
0-male_crotch_will_be_visible,totalRounds:0-10=surprised-horny,It's a little early to be stripping naked, isn't it?
0-male_crotch_will_be_visible,totalRounds:0-10=surprised-horny,So soon...this is bizarre.
0-male_crotch_will_be_visible,totalRounds:0-10=surprised-horny,Y-You're not pulling your thing out already?
0-male_small_crotch_is_visible=awkward,I'm no expert, but...aren't they supposed to be bigger?
0-male_small_crotch_is_visible=confused,...That's not the typical size, right?
0-male_small_crotch_is_visible=awkward,Uh...is that really it?
0-male_small_crotch_is_visible=confused,...That's it?  I guess the book exaggerated the size.
0-male_small_crotch_is_visible=awkward,Huh.  They looked bigger in the book...
0-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=addressing,A textbook example.  I've <i>read</i> a textbook on this.
0-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=addressing,Ah...looks just like the pictures in Duero's book.
0-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=awkward,A healthy size...I'm pretty sure.
0-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=confused,How do men walk around with those things?
0-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=confused,Such a bizarre-looking organ.
0-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=impressed,I'll be honest.  I wasn't sure those tube-rumors were even true.
0-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=awkward,I've...never seen one before.
0-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=awkward,My teachers said they had barbs all over...and spit poison.
0-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=awkward,It looks so...strange.
0-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=impressed,Bart always covers his on the bridge.  I guess it <i>is</i> sort of ugly.
0-male_large_crotch_is_visible=confused,Doesn't that...get in the way?
0-male_large_crotch_is_visible=surprised-horny,That...that doesn't look like the pictures I've seen.
0-male_large_crotch_is_visible=awkward,I'm no expert, but...isn't that a little big?
0-male_large_crotch_is_visible=shocked,<i>That's</i> supposed to fit in a woman?
0-male_large_crotch_is_visible=impressed,How do you even walk around?
0-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=angry,So...you <i>are</i> a man.  Stop confusing me!
0-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=annoyed,Your creator must have been pretty absentminded.
0-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=surprised-horny,I've seen pictures.  That's far too big to be a penis, or whatever it's called.
0-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=surprised-horny,...OK, I've <i>seen</i> pictures of how big it should be.  You have a disease, Ryu.
0-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=surprised-horny,That thing wouldn't fit in my <i>Dread</i>, much less me.
0-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=impressed,...Now I understand why women formed their own planet.  Too many were dying during sex.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible=thinking,Don't be ashamed of your body...
0-female_chest_will_be_visible=thinking,...Let's see them, ~name~.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible=thinking,This is what we all came to see...I suppose.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,marker:jura_comparison=calm,No matter how big, Jura's probably got you beat.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible=calm,...
0-female_chest_will_be_visible=thinking,The stripping is a sideshow.  I'm here for the cards...
0-female_chest_will_be_visible=thinking,Self-esteem is important...
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=annoyed,What is <i>wrong</i> with you?
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=annoyed,I came here for a card game, not to flaunt my indecency.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=annoyed,If most Earth women are like you, I can see why the colonists left.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=annoyed,You really need a hobby.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=angry,You're just losing on purpose.  Stop wasting my time.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=annoyed,If you weren't so careless with your own life, I'd commend your aim.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=annoyed,You'd make a fine pilot with that aim if you had a shred of self-preservation.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=bored,Your technical skills are remarkable.  Too bad they're in service of ridiculous posturing.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,totalRounds:0-10=disappointed,Naked already?  That's a little sad, ~name~.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,totalRounds:0-10=disappointed,Did you play this game just to strip?
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,totalRounds:0-10=unimpressed,Owning your sexuality is one thing...but you're a little <i>too</i> eager.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,totalRounds:0-10=bored,I wanted a challenge tonight...
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,totalRounds:0-10=disappointed,Already?  Well, let's see them.
0-female_small_chest_is_visible=happy,You're very cute.
0-female_small_chest_is_visible=thinking,Not much for a woman to hide...men can keep some secrets.
0-female_small_chest_is_visible=annoyed,If you want to grow them, try the Nirvana's hot springs...
0-female_small_chest_is_visible=annoyed,Try massaging them daily...
0-female_small_chest_is_visible=disappointed,Are you getting proper nutrition, ~name~?
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible=thinking,Better than mine.  At least I've got better poker skills.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible=thinking,Do Earth men like breasts?  Mejarians tend to obsess over them...
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,marker:oma_and_fama=thinking,I don't have the breasts to be a Fama...
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible=calm,Well, they look <i>full</i>.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible=thinking,You can probably tell how I compare already...
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=annoyed,Is there a doctor in this place?  We all know how these stunts are going to end.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=bored,You're really asking for an accident.  Where's Duero when you need him?
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=bored,I just don't understand you.  And not in an interesting way.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight=impressed,You're bringing a whole new depth to this game.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight=impressed,Bare it all immediately to shake everyone up...could be effective.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=annoyed,At least <i>pretend</i> to care you're losing, just to put us at ease about your sanity.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=thinking,What good is sex if you'd do it with just <i>anyone</i>?
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=disappointed,I take back anything I've said about Jura being flirtatious.  You've shown me new lows.
0-female_large_chest_is_visible=stressed,They're...very nice.
0-female_large_chest_is_visible=annoyed,Hm.  Well.  Very healthy.
0-female_large_chest_is_visible=annoyed,Well, you're getting all your nutrients...
0-female_large_chest_is_visible=bored,Let's remember who's winning here.
0-female_large_chest_is_visible=unimpressed,Spectacular.
0-female_large_chest_is_visible=stressed,...
0-female_large_chest_is_visible,saidMarker:jura_comparison=annoyed,On second thought, you <i>would</i> give Jura a run for her money...
0-female_large_chest_is_visible,saidMarker:jura_comparison=annoyed,...Never mind.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible=disappointed,Funny how it's mostly women in this place.  I guess Earth men are already used to you.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible=thinking,I can talk about courage, but I haven't even lost yet...
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible=thinking,How a woman reacts to loss will usually tell you what you need to know about her.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible=addressing,A woman should be at her best when she's pushed to the limit.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible=calm,No sense waiting, ~name~.  Doing it in one shot will feel better.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=angry,Just leave already.  You're clearly not interested in the game.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=annoyed,Would you stop wasting all of our time?
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=annoyed,Earthling or not, no woman should be this obsessed with sex...
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=annoyed,You're a little <i>too</i> familiar with men...
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=disappointed,Next to you, Jura is the very picture of chastity.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia=thinking,That skirt must be pretty comfortable.  I was a little girl the last time I wore a skirt...
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia=pleased,Unorthodox...but Hibiki's shown me the value in unorthodox.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia=impressed,Can't say I agree with the strategy, but surprises are always welcome.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=bored,Don't mind me.  By all means, get yourself killed.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=bored,There's no arguing with someone this stupid.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=bored,I can understand pulling a dumb stunt and learning from it.  I have no tolerance for those who refuse to do the latter.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=shocked,Uh...what are you doing to Marinette?
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=angry,Hey, did Marinette ask for that?
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=impressed,You're taking <i>that</i> off first?  Why?
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=thinking,<i>I'm</i> ashamed of my breasts...but I wouldn't give that away by hiding them longer than needed.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=disappointed,I thought men liked breasts more.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=bored,Most women would take off their bras first...even me, despite my reservations.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=thinking,Mejarians are taught to preserve our reproductive organs above all else...
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,totalFemales:5-5,priority:1=thinking,I wonder how men react to this...
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,totalFemales:5-5,priority:1=awkward,I wonder how a man would react to this.  A man from Earth, I mean.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,totalFemales:5-5,priority:1=awkward,How do Earth women feel about this sort of thing?
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,totalFemales:5-5,priority:1=thinking,Well, we all have the same body parts...
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,totalFemales:5-5,priority:1=awkward,None of you would want a man around for this...right?
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=impressed,You'd...rather take <i>that</i> off first?
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=thinking,I thought men liked breasts more...
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=impressed,Most women would take off their bras first...
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=thinking,Mejarians are taught to preserve our reproductive organs above all else...
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight=surprised-horny,Wha--<i>right away</i>?
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight=disappointed,I thought <i>I</i> was unfamiliar with Earth women's clothing...apparently you're unfamiliar with your own.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight=disappointed,I guess it doesn't matter what we take off first...but suspense would be nice.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=disappointed,My suit is one thing...that really looks uncomfortable.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=calm,You're barely more covered than Barnette with that thing.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=disappointed,That leotard looks like a bodysuit without the coverage...
0-female_crotch_is_visible=thinking,Nothing left to hide...almost zenlike, in a way.
0-female_crotch_is_visible=thinking,Mejare is essentially Earth's uterus colony...
0-female_crotch_is_visible=pleased,Tarakkians think they have fangs.
0-female_crotch_is_visible=disappointed,Do you feel at ease now, or even more flustered?
0-female_crotch_is_visible=disappointed,You look good, but I need to focus on winning.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=surprised-horny,...This game is getting to be too much for me.

0-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy,notSaidMarker:pubic_hair_comments,priority:1,marker:pubic_hair_comments=calm,I prefer shaved.  More aerodynamic.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy,notSaidMarker:pubic_hair_comments,priority:1,marker:pubic_hair_comments=calm,Shaved is more sensible.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy,notSaidMarker:pubic_hair_comments,priority:1,marker:pubic_hair_comments=disappointed,I don't see the appeal in pubic hair.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy,notSaidMarker:pubic_hair_comments,priority:1,marker:pubic_hair_comments=confused,Pubic hair...must be an Earth thing.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy,notSaidMarker:pubic_hair_comments,priority:1,marker:pubic_hair_comments=calm,I prefer shaved.  Less friction.

0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=annoyed,You're like if Dita had her obsession with men, but none of the innocence.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=angry,See what happens?  I <i>told</i> you to be careful!
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=impressed,You're...?  Even Barnette isn't <i>that</i> big on guns...

1-male_large_crotch_is_visible=awkward,Do women like them that big?  Looks cumbersome.
1-male_large_crotch_is_visible=addressing,I've read it needs blood to get hard.  Guess there wasn't much left for your brain.

1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=surprised-horny,I've seen pictures.  That's far too big to be a penis, or whatever it's called.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible=impressed,...
1-female_chest_will_be_visible=addressing,These are the moments you all came here for.  I'm just in it for the cards.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible=disappointed,I'm sure they're fine.  It's losing you should be worried about.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible=thinking,Just do it.  Breasts aren't what make a woman.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible=thinking,Hang in there.  You can already see the shape of mine...
1-female_chest_will_be_visible=disappointed,I didn't think winning would be <i>this</i> easy.  Earth women are soft.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,totalRounds:0-10=disappointed,Naked already?  That's a little sad, ~name~.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,totalRounds:0-10=disappointed,Did you play this game just to strip?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,totalRounds:0-10=unimpressed,Owning your sexuality is one thing...but you're a little <i>too</i> eager.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,totalRounds:0-10=bored,I wanted a challenge tonight...
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,totalRounds:0-10=disappointed,Already?  Well, let's see them.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=annoyed,What is <i>wrong</i> with you?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=annoyed,I came here for a card game, not to flaunt my indecency.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=annoyed,If most Earth women are like you, I can see why the colonists left.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=annoyed,You really need a hobby.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=angry,You're just losing on purpose.  Stop wasting my time.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=annoyed,If you weren't so careless with your own life, I'd commend your aim.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=annoyed,You'd make a fine pilot with that aim if you had a shred of self-preservation.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=bored,Your technical skills are remarkable.  Too bad they're in service of ridiculous posturing.
1-female_small_chest_is_visible=disappointed,Dita's young, but hers are big...must be Mejarian genetics.
1-female_small_chest_is_visible=confused,...So where are they?  Earth women's <i>get</i> that small?
1-female_small_chest_is_visible=happy,You're reminding of me of Paiway.
1-female_small_chest_is_visible=awkward,...How old are you again?
1-female_small_chest_is_visible=thinking,It's OK.  I've read breast size has little to do with milk production...
1-female_small_chest_is_visible=impressed,...
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible=calm,Seems you take care of yourself, which is always good to see a woman do.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible=calm,Healthy size.  Regular massages are important, too.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible=thinking,Jura likes to flaunt hers...
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible=disappointed,That's just average to a Mejarian...we're voluptuous by design.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible=disappointed,You'd fit right in on the Nirvana.  Mejarians tend to be buxom.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=annoyed,Is there a doctor in this place?  We all know how these stunts are going to end.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=bored,You're really asking for an accident.  Where's Duero when you need him?
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=bored,I just don't understand you.  And not in an interesting way.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=annoyed,At least <i>pretend</i> to care you're losing, just to put us at ease about your sanity.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=thinking,What good is sex if you'd do it with just <i>anyone</i>?
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=disappointed,I take back anything I've said about Jura being flirtatious.  You've shown me new lows.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight=impressed,You're bringing a whole new depth to this game.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight=impressed,Bare it all immediately to shake everyone up...could be effective.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible=annoyed,I'm guessing Earth men <i>also</i> prefer the large ones.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible=annoyed,You must be proud of them.  Wonder what <i>that</i> feels like.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible=annoyed,Yes.  Very nice.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible=angry,You and Jura ought to compare.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible=annoyed,..........
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible=disappointed,Don't be dramatic about it.  Nothing special about a woman's body.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible=calm,No different than our changing stations.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible=thinking,Shame can be crippling...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible=thinking,Have respect for yourself.  Even Mejare gets that right...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible=disappointed,Jura always gives me an eyeful in the showers anyway.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible=impressed,...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=angry,Just leave already.  You're clearly not interested in the game.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=annoyed,Would you stop wasting all of our time?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=annoyed,Earthling or not, no woman should be this obsessed with sex...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=annoyed,You're a little <i>too</i> familiar with men...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=disappointed,Next to you, Jura is the very picture of chastity.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=impressed,You'd...rather take <i>that</i> off first?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=thinking,I thought men liked breasts more...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=impressed,Most women would take off their bras first...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=thinking,Mejarians are taught to preserve our reproductive organs above all else...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=disappointed,My suit is one thing...that really looks uncomfortable.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=calm,You're barely more covered than Barnette with that thing.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=disappointed,That leotard looks like a bodysuit without the coverage...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight=surprised-horny,Wha--<i>right away</i>?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight=disappointed,I thought <i>I</i> was unfamiliar with Earth women's clothing...apparently you're unfamiliar with your own.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight=disappointed,I guess it doesn't matter what we take off first...but suspense would be nice.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,totalFemales:5-5,priority:1=thinking,I wonder how men react to this...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,totalFemales:5-5,priority:1=awkward,I wonder how a man would react to this.  A man from Earth, I mean.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,totalFemales:5-5,priority:1=awkward,How do Earth women feel about this sort of thing?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,totalFemales:5-5,priority:1=thinking,Well, we all have the same body parts...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,totalFemales:5-5,priority:1=awkward,None of you would want a man around for this...right?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia=thinking,That skirt must be pretty comfortable.  I was a little girl the last time I wore a skirt...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia=pleased,Unorthodox...but Hibiki's shown me the value in unorthodox.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia=impressed,Can't say I agree with the strategy, but surprises are always welcome.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=bored,Don't mind me.  By all means, get yourself killed.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=bored,There's no arguing with someone this stupid.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=bored,I can understand pulling a dumb stunt and learning from it.  I have no tolerance for those who refuse to do the latter.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=shocked,Uh...what are you doing to Marinette?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=angry,Hey, did Marinette ask for that?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=impressed,You're taking <i>that</i> off first?  Why?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=thinking,<i>I'm</i> ashamed of my breasts...but I wouldn't give that away by hiding them longer than needed.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=disappointed,I thought men liked breasts more.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=bored,Most women would take off their bras first...even me, despite my reservations.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=thinking,Mejarians are taught to preserve our reproductive organs above all else...
1-female_crotch_is_visible=disappointed,You look healthy enough.  Earthlings are big fans of health.
1-female_crotch_is_visible=thinking,Looks comfortable.  This flightsuit can start to itch...
1-female_crotch_is_visible=impressed,Are you...getting wet?
1-female_crotch_is_visible=thinking,Exactly what the Harvest wants Mejare for...
1-female_crotch_is_visible=thinking,I guess I'm no better, agreeing to play this...
1-female_crotch_is_visible=surprised-horny,...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=annoyed,I'm not giving you the satisfaction...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=bored,I went the first nineteen years of my life without meeting a man, and yet <i>you're</i> obsessed with them.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=annoyed,You're like if Dita had her obsession with men, but none of the innocence.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=angry,See what happens?  I <i>told</i> you to be careful!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=impressed,You're...?  Even Barnette isn't <i>that</i> big on guns...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=annoyed,<i>Now</i> do you understand?  Don't throw your life away.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia=addressing,Good luck with <i>that</i> plan.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia=pleased,Sitting in the grass with just a skirt on...sounds ticklish.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy,notSaidMarker:pubic_hair_comments,priority:1,marker:pubic_hair_comments=disappointed,I've always thought shaved looks better...more functional, too.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy,notSaidMarker:pubic_hair_comments,priority:1,marker:pubic_hair_comments=calm,I prefer shaved.  More aerodynamic.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy,notSaidMarker:pubic_hair_comments,priority:1,marker:pubic_hair_comments=calm,Shaved is more sensible.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy,notSaidMarker:pubic_hair_comments,priority:1,marker:pubic_hair_comments=disappointed,I don't see the appeal in pubic hair.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy,notSaidMarker:pubic_hair_comments,priority:1,marker:pubic_hair_comments=confused,Pubic hair...must be an Earth thing.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy,notSaidMarker:pubic_hair_comments,priority:1,marker:pubic_hair_comments=calm,I prefer shaved.  Less friction.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=surprised-horny,...This game is getting to be too much for me.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=thinking,Bondage...<i>no thanks</i>.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen,marker:claustrophobia=thinking,I hate being tied up...I hate tight spaces.

2-male_chest_will_be_visible=addressing,Most of the men I know are soldiers, so you have some competition.
2-male_chest_will_be_visible=impressed,I've only gotten some glimpses of Bart's...from when he's helming the ship.
2-male_chest_will_be_visible=pleased,You'd be called a witch for seeing this on Mejare...
2-male_chest_will_be_visible=pleased,Well, I can tell you've got Hibiki beat already...
2-male_chest_will_be_visible=addressing,This is your best chance of distracting me...besides that tube of yours.
2-male_chest_is_visible=impressed,I'm not sure women <i>have</i> those muscles...
2-male_chest_is_visible=impressed,Wow, men really <i>can</i> gain muscle better...
2-male_chest_is_visible=surprised-horny,N-not bad.
2-male_chest_is_visible=interested,Worth the...<i>weight</i>.
2-male_chest_is_visible=addressing,So, how much can you lift?  That's a good use for a man.
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=impressed,I was about to comment on your chest, but...that underwear is distracting.
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=confused,Huh.  I would have thought men wore different underwear than women, on account of that tube-thing.
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=impressed,For a man...you look very feminine.
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=disappointed,Bart dressed up like a woman once, too...men should really avoid doing that.
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=angry,I thought you said you were a man!
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=confused,OK, now I'm <i>really</i> confused.  Men can have breasts?
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=annoyed,...So you're a woman?  Are you making fun of me?
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=annoyed,If you want to appeal to both men and women, I wouldn't recommend a horrific mishmash of the two.
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=annoyed,Speaking as a woman...that's not very appealing.
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible=addressing,I think I've earned my prize.  Let's see that tube-thing.
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible=pleased,I know a certain spaceship whose crew would want to see this.
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible=surprised-horny,Your...thing?  The tube?
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible=interested,Jura better not blab about me playing this.  Everyone will ask me what your thing looks like...
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible=addressing,Won't you satisfy my curiosity, ~name~?
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,totalRounds:0-10=shocked,I--I haven't prepared myself for this.
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,totalRounds:0-10=surprised-horny,A man's thing?  A-already?
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,totalRounds:0-10=surprised-horny,It's a little early to be stripping naked, isn't it?
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,totalRounds:0-10=surprised-horny,So soon...this is bizarre.
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,totalRounds:0-10=surprised-horny,Y-You're not pulling your thing out already?
2-male_small_crotch_is_visible=disappointed,Seems I wasn't missing much all these years.
2-male_small_crotch_is_visible=awkward,...Are you an adult, ~name~?
2-male_small_crotch_is_visible=awkward,I didn't know they got that small...
2-male_small_crotch_is_visible=disappointed,I've read that the penis and clitoris are made from analogous tissue...you're living proof.
2-male_small_crotch_is_visible=awkward,If you were shorter, it might look bigger...
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=confused,I was told those spheres in the back were red-hot...
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=pleased,I wonder how you compare to the men of the Nirvana...
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=awkward,Good size...not that I have much of a reference point.
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=confused,It just...<i>dangles</i> like that?  I thought it was retractable...
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=calm,Looks like a mushroom in the brush.
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=calm,Bart always covers his when he's piloting...
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=impressed,So that's what one looks like.  In person, I mean.
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=calm,For my first one...I suppose yours is decent.
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=impressed,Staring one in the face...I didn't know they could stare back.
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible=impressed,Dita's always trying to sneak peeks at the men's...you'd make it easy for her.
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible=surprised-horny,They, er, sure come in a variety of sizes.
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible=confused,Why is there such a variety in size?  It's not like women can tell from sight...
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible=surprised-horny,Oh, God.  That's too big for a woman...right?
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible=shocked,They're not <i>all</i> that big, right?
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=surprised-horny,...OK, I've <i>seen</i> pictures of how big it should be.  You have a disease, Ryu.
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=surprised-horny,That thing wouldn't fit in my <i>Dread</i>, much less me.
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=impressed,...Now I understand why women formed their own planet.  Too many were dying during sex.
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=angry,So...you <i>are</i> a man.  Stop confusing me!
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=annoyed,Your creator must have been pretty absentminded.
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=surprised-horny,I've seen pictures.  That's far too big to be a penis, or whatever it's called.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible=impressed,...
2-female_chest_will_be_visible=calm,Let us see.  I won't judge you.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible=addressing,You knew what you signed up for.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible=disappointed,Don't be a coward, ~name~.  That's a lot worse than public nudity.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible=addressing,I don't plan on having to do this.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible=calm,They're just breasts, ~name~.  There's more important things to worry about.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=annoyed,What is <i>wrong</i> with you?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=annoyed,I came here for a card game, not to flaunt my indecency.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=annoyed,If most Earth women are like you, I can see why the colonists left.

2-female_small_chest_is_visible=awkward,...I didn't know adult women could be that small.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible=awkward,Wow.  No one is that small on Mejare...
2-female_small_chest_is_visible=confused,Is this natural genetics at work?
2-female_small_chest_is_visible=disappointed,That's a little sad...
2-female_small_chest_is_visible=pleased,You've got a chest rivaling Hibiki's.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible=thinking,...
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible=thinking,Mine may be covered, but you can probably still compare...
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible=thinking,Close to mine, maybe?  Maybe not...
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible=impressed,Are you happy with them, ~name~?
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible=pleased,Looks like what Duero's book had for "woman."
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible=thinking,Nothing special.  Like me.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible=impressed,...
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight=impressed,You're bringing a whole new depth to this game.

2-female_large_chest_is_visible=annoyed,Woo.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible=annoyed,Back to the game, people.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible=annoyed,Isn't that bad for your back?
2-female_large_chest_is_visible=annoyed,Your vanity could go toe-to-toe with Jura's.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible=addressing,Going all the way?  Should have played your cards better.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible=pleased,I wonder how a Tarakkian would react to seeing this...pure terror, most likely.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible=bored,No different than our changing stations...of course, I'm always wearing my suit.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible=addressing,Nudity doesn't bother a Mejarian.  Not around other women, anyway.

3-male_chest_will_be_visible=addressing,Anytime you're ready, ~name~.  This is what I came to see, even if I'd never admit it.
3-male_chest_will_be_visible=addressing,Let me see what you've got.  Not many men in my life for you to compete with.
3-male_chest_will_be_visible=addressing,I take the lead.  Show me what I've earned.
3-male_chest_is_visible=confused,Why do men have nipples, anyway?
3-male_chest_is_visible=impressed,Nipples, huh?  You don't seem the type to nurse your young...
3-male_chest_is_visible=addressing,You're in good shape...for a man.
3-male_chest_is_visible=pleased,It's like someone shaved an ape...
3-male_chest_is_visible=horny,Oh, are you into exercise too?
3-male_chest_is_visible=pleased,Dita and Misty fought over Hibiki...if he looked like <i>you</i>, maybe I'd understand.

3-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=confused,OK, now I'm <i>really</i> confused.  Men can have breasts?
3-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=annoyed,...So you're a woman?  Are you making fun of me?

3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=surprised-horny,That thing wouldn't fit in my <i>Dread</i>, much less me.
3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=impressed,...Now I understand why women formed their own planet.  Too many were dying during sex.

4-male_small_crotch_is_visible=disappointed,<i>That</i> explains your reluctance.
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=interested,Pretty good.  But can't it get bigger?  Something about blood flow?
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=interested,Is that as big as it gets?  I'm curious...
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=horny,Looks eager...I'm feeling that way myself.
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=impressed,When they called it a tube, I wasn't expecting a cap on the end.
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=interested,That thing looks like it was made from spare parts...but I <i>do</i> kind of like it.
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=impressed,Close encounters, as they say...
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=impressed,Finally seeing one...didn't think I'd do it with my breasts out.
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=surprised-horny,I've always tried not to look when Bart's piloting the ship...
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=surprised-horny,I'm still not quite sure what to make of men...this just complicates things.
4-male_large_crotch_is_visible=shocked,I--I, uh...uh...
4-male_large_crotch_is_visible=shocked,Do you have enough blood for that thing?
4-male_large_crotch_is_visible=surprised-horny,There's no way that thing would fit...in <i>any</i> woman.
4-male_large_crotch_is_visible=horny,Oh, wow.  Coming here <i>was</i> a good idea.
4-male_large_crotch_is_visible=thinking,I guess you wouldn't relate to size anxiety...
4-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=angry,So...you <i>are</i> a man.  Stop confusing me!
4-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=annoyed,Your creator must have been pretty absentminded.
4-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=surprised-horny,I've seen pictures.  That's far too big to be a penis, or whatever it's called.
4-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=surprised-horny,...OK, I've <i>seen</i> pictures of how big it should be.  You have a disease, Ryu.
4-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=surprised-horny,That thing wouldn't fit in my <i>Dread</i>, much less me.
4-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=impressed,...Now I understand why women formed their own planet.  Too many were dying during sex.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible=interested,You should know that this won't satisfy me.  I'm winning this game.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible=addressing,Mejare is nothing but women.  I've seen breasts before, I promise.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible=addressing,Come on, ~name~.  You can see mine...
4-female_chest_will_be_visible=addressing,No woman who serves under me would back down from a challenge.  I wouldn't let them.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=annoyed,What is <i>wrong</i> with you?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=annoyed,I came here for a card game, not to flaunt my indecency.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=annoyed,If most Earth women are like you, I can see why the colonists left.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=annoyed,You really need a hobby.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=angry,You're just losing on purpose.  Stop wasting my time.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=annoyed,If you weren't so careless with your own life, I'd commend your aim.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=annoyed,You'd make a fine pilot with that aim if you had a shred of self-preservation.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=bored,Your technical skills are remarkable.  Too bad they're in service of ridiculous posturing.
4-female_small_chest_is_visible=happy,Cute little things...
4-female_small_chest_is_visible=awkward,Every woman on Mejare is genetically engineered to some extent...perhaps you could have used some.
4-female_small_chest_is_visible=happy,It's alright.  Flaws are what make us human.
4-female_small_chest_is_visible=pleased,Yours look like Misty's...I guess she's all-natural, too.
4-female_small_chest_is_visible=disappointed,No wealthy Mejarian couple would have a child that small without changes being made.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible=horny,Mmm, they're nice, ~name~.  Do you get massages?
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible=pleased,We look pretty comparable.  In poker skills, too, apparently.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible=pleased,Reminds me of our crew's spa breaks...
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible=horny,This shouldn't be so exciting...I need a cooler head.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible=interested,Better than mine, maybe, but a woman's worth is in her brain.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=annoyed,Is there a doctor in this place?  We all know how these stunts are going to end.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=bored,You're really asking for an accident.  Where's Duero when you need him?
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=bored,I just don't understand you.  And not in an interesting way.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=annoyed,At least <i>pretend</i> to care you're losing, just to put us at ease about your sanity.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=thinking,What good is sex if you'd do it with just <i>anyone</i>?
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=disappointed,I take back anything I've said about Jura being flirtatious.  You've shown me new lows.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight=impressed,You're bringing a whole new depth to this game.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight=impressed,Bare it all immediately to shake everyone up...could be effective.
4-female_large_chest_is_visible=stressed,...................
4-female_large_chest_is_visible=annoyed,Ahem.
4-female_large_chest_is_visible=sad,No secrets left, I suppose...
4-female_large_chest_is_visible=stressed,<i>Humiliating</i>...
4-female_large_chest_is_visible=angry,Yes, yes, we get it.  Move on.
4-female_large_chest_is_visible=thinking,We're all small next to the universe...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible=interested,Beaten to the punch, and what a relief...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible=interested,You pushed me pretty far, but not quite far enough.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible=addressing,Shaking you off was a pain.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible=interested,I wasn't about to be shot down first.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible=pleased,On a planet full of women, you <i>do</i> tend to run into a few of these.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia=thinking,That skirt must be pretty comfortable.  I was a little girl the last time I wore a skirt...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia=pleased,Unorthodox...but Hibiki's shown me the value in unorthodox.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia=impressed,Can't say I agree with the strategy, but surprises are always welcome.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=shocked,Uh...what are you doing to Marinette?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=angry,Hey, did Marinette ask for that?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=angry,Just leave already.  You're clearly not interested in the game.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=annoyed,Would you stop wasting all of our time?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=annoyed,Earthling or not, no woman should be this obsessed with sex...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=annoyed,You're a little <i>too</i> familiar with men...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=disappointed,Next to you, Jura is the very picture of chastity.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,totalFemales:5-5,priority:1=thinking,I wonder how men react to this...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,totalFemales:5-5,priority:1=awkward,I wonder how a man would react to this.  A man from Earth, I mean.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,totalFemales:5-5,priority:1=awkward,How do Earth women feel about this sort of thing?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,totalFemales:5-5,priority:1=thinking,Well, we all have the same body parts...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,totalFemales:5-5,priority:1=awkward,None of you would want a man around for this...right?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=impressed,You're taking <i>that</i> off first?  Why?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=thinking,<i>I'm</i> ashamed of my breasts...but I wouldn't give that away by hiding them longer than needed.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=disappointed,I thought men liked breasts more.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=bored,Most women would take off their bras first...even me, despite my reservations.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=thinking,Mejarians are taught to preserve our reproductive organs above all else...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=bored,Don't mind me.  By all means, get yourself killed.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=bored,There's no arguing with someone this stupid.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=bored,I can understand pulling a dumb stunt and learning from it.  I have no tolerance for those who refuse to do the latter.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight=surprised-horny,Wha--<i>right away</i>?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight=disappointed,I thought <i>I</i> was unfamiliar with Earth women's clothing...apparently you're unfamiliar with your own.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight=disappointed,I guess it doesn't matter what we take off first...but suspense would be nice.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=disappointed,My suit is one thing...that really looks uncomfortable.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=calm,You're barely more covered than Barnette with that thing.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=disappointed,That leotard looks like a bodysuit without the coverage...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=impressed,You'd...rather take <i>that</i> off first?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=thinking,I thought men liked breasts more...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=impressed,Most women would take off their bras first...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=thinking,Mejarians are taught to preserve our reproductive organs above all else...
4-female_crotch_is_visible=pleased,You can probably see the outline of mine anyway.
4-female_crotch_is_visible=pleased,Supple.  Might actually make Jura a little jealous.
4-female_crotch_is_visible=pleased,Now you're dressed like Barnette really wants to be.
4-female_crotch_is_visible=addressing,You could still mount a comeback on me no problem.
4-female_crotch_is_visible=pleased,I'm wet already...it's distracting.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy,notSaidMarker:pubic_hair_comments,priority:1,marker:pubic_hair_comments=disappointed,I've always thought shaved looks better...more functional, too.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy,notSaidMarker:pubic_hair_comments,priority:1,marker:pubic_hair_comments=calm,I prefer shaved.  More aerodynamic.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy,notSaidMarker:pubic_hair_comments,priority:1,marker:pubic_hair_comments=calm,Shaved is more sensible.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy,notSaidMarker:pubic_hair_comments,priority:1,marker:pubic_hair_comments=disappointed,I don't see the appeal in pubic hair.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy,notSaidMarker:pubic_hair_comments,priority:1,marker:pubic_hair_comments=confused,Pubic hair...must be an Earth thing.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy,notSaidMarker:pubic_hair_comments,priority:1,marker:pubic_hair_comments=calm,I prefer shaved.  Less friction.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=angry,See what happens?  I <i>told</i> you to be careful!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=impressed,You're...?  Even Barnette isn't <i>that</i> big on guns...
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=annoyed,<i>Now</i> do you understand?  Don't throw your life away.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=surprised-horny,...This game is getting to be too much for me.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=thinking,Bondage...<i>no thanks</i>.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen,marker:claustrophobia=thinking,I hate being tied up...I hate tight spaces.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=annoyed,I'm not giving you the satisfaction...
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=bored,I went the first nineteen years of my life without meeting a man, and yet <i>you're</i> obsessed with them.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=annoyed,You're like if Dita had her obsession with men, but none of the innocence.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia=addressing,Good luck with <i>that</i> plan.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia=pleased,Sitting in the grass with just a skirt on...sounds ticklish.

-3-male_chest_will_be_visible=stretching,I can vouch for the comfort of nudity...and yours would be especially interesting.
-3-male_chest_will_be_visible=addressing,Well, let's see it, ~name~.  I certainly want to.
-3-male_chest_will_be_visible=horny,I'm wetter than I'd ever admit to my crewmates...in fact, I think I'll keep this whole experience from them.
-3-male_chest_will_be_visible=interested,OK, I'm interested.  Let's see it before I change my mind.
-3-male_chest_will_be_visible=addressing,Got anything worth displaying?  Not that I'd be an expert there.
-3-male_chest_is_visible=interested,You're in good shape...I like that.
-3-male_chest_is_visible=horny,Standing here naked...makes those muscles very captivating.
-3-male_chest_is_visible=surprised-horny,Oh my...something's coming over me.
-3-male_chest_is_visible=interested,Broad...and so <i>angular</i>.
-3-male_chest_is_visible=horny,Seeing a man like this is so strange...all my instincts flare up at once.
-3-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=impressed,I was about to comment on your chest, but...that underwear is distracting.
-3-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=confused,Huh.  I would have thought men wore different underwear than women, on account of that tube-thing.
-3-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=impressed,For a man...you look very feminine.
-3-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=disappointed,Bart dressed up like a woman once, too...men should really avoid doing that.
-3-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=angry,I thought you said you were a man!
-3-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=confused,OK, now I'm <i>really</i> confused.  Men can have breasts?
-3-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=annoyed,...So you're a woman?  Are you making fun of me?
-3-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=annoyed,If you want to appeal to both men and women, I wouldn't recommend a horrific mishmash of the two.
-3-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=annoyed,Speaking as a woman...that's not very appealing.
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible=addressing,I've showed you mine...now you show me yours.
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible=interested,A man doesn't lose his nerve, right?
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible=interested,Jura's always talking about having a baby with a man...
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible=addressing,You know, Tarakkians believe women eat men's organs...
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible=interested,Give me something to brag about seeing...if I were the bragging type.
-3-male_small_crotch_is_visible=disappointed,That brings things down a little...
-3-male_small_crotch_is_visible=pleased,Reminds of me of Hibiki...his whole body, I mean.
-3-male_small_crotch_is_visible=pleased,It's OK.  The Nirvana has room for small fries...
-3-male_small_crotch_is_visible=disappointed,Don't feel bad.  Flaws are what make people interesting...
-3-male_small_crotch_is_visible=disappointed,...So where is it?  I wanted to see one.
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=horny,Standing here like this, seeing your thing...I can't explain the feeling.
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=unimpressed,Men and women, naked together.  We're practically mating already.
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=surprised-horny,Are you really supposed to just...<i>insert</i> that thing?
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=horny,Standing at attention, like any good pilot.
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=surprised-horny,Tonight's been quite a night...seeing a man like this.
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=surprised-horny,A nude man.  I can hardly take this...
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=surprised-horny,I really didn't think I'd be naked when I finally saw one...
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=happy,I'm still not sure what to make of men...but you don't seem so bad.
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=horny,What a pleasant surprise.  I thought it would smell...or sting.
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible=shocked,Oh my.  That's about the size of Hibiki's entire body...
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible=addressing,Sure you can handle that thing?  Men have never struck me as good with tools.
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible=shocked,Ooh.  They called it a tube, not a pipe.
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible=horny,My head feels hot...and it's all your fault.
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible=surprised-horny,I don't think I could handle that...especially without practice.
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=surprised-horny,...OK, I've <i>seen</i> pictures of how big it should be.  You have a disease, Ryu.
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=surprised-horny,That thing wouldn't fit in my <i>Dread</i>, much less me.
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=impressed,...Now I understand why women formed their own planet.  Too many were dying during sex.
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=angry,So...you <i>are</i> a man.  Stop confusing me!

-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=surprised-horny,I've seen pictures.  That's far too big to be a penis, or whatever it's called.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible=interested,Join the club, ~name~.  I'm deeper in it than <i>that</i>.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible=addressing,You'll live...and it'll liven things.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible=interested,I <i>do</i> want to see, in spite of myself...
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible=pleased,Strip poker would make the Nirvana very awkward...
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible=pleased,Isn't this what we all really wanted, playing this game?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=annoyed,What is <i>wrong</i> with you?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=annoyed,I came here for a card game, not to flaunt my indecency.

-3-female_small_chest_is_visible=bored,Well, at least I've got <i>somebody</i> beat.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible=pleased,I'm losing, but at least my breasts are bigger.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible=disappointed,Maybe I'm too sensitive about my chest...
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible=pleased,You're somewhere between Paiway and Misty...but older.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible=disappointed,Shame won't take you anywhere, ~name~...
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible=horny,Standing here like this, seeing your chest...it's awkward, but...
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible=happy,You look great, ~name~.  I don't give compliments often.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible=happy,You should be proud of yourself, ~name~.  Women need their pride.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible=pleased,I could use a good massage...
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible=horny,You shouldn't have kept us waiting...this is nice and familiar.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight=impressed,You're bringing a whole new depth to this game.

-3-female_large_chest_is_visible=annoyed,Certainly worth the wait...
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible=stressed,First the humiliation of exposing myself, and now this...
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible=stressed,Don't say anything...
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible=angry,Oh, just shut up.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible=stressed,...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible=addressing,Don't be shy, ~name~...I haven't been.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible=horny,I'm a leader...I shouldn't be all worked up like this.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible=horny,It <i>is</i> a little exciting...and I don't get excited.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible=interested,I'm sure it's nothing out of the ordinary.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible=happy,You can do it, ~name~.  Didn't you watch me do it?

-2-male_chest_will_be_visible=mast-3-pleased,Come on...give me something to think about for <i>weeks</i>.
-2-male_chest_will_be_visible=mast-4-pleased,You <i>must</i> have wanted this deep down.
-2-male_chest_will_be_visible=mast-3-pleased,Can you compete with the men I know?  All three of them?
-2-male_chest_is_visible=mast-2-pleased,You're incredible...is what my instincts say.
-2-male_chest_is_visible=mast-3-pleased,I respect anyone who keeps themselves fit...
-2-male_chest_is_visible=mast-4-pleased,You're a sight to behold...so hold still and let me.  I only get tonight.
-2-male_chest_is_visible=mast-3-pleased,Feel like striking a pose?  Hibiki would.
-2-male_chest_is_visible=mast-4-pleased,You'd look good in any formation...
-2-male_chest_is_visible=mast-2-pleased,So much <i>hair</i>...
-2-male_chest_is_visible=mast-3-pleased,Maybe men <i>are</i> worth keeping around...
-2-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=mast-3-disappointed,I was about to comment on your chest, but...that underwear is distracting.
-2-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=mast-3-pleased,I would have thought men wore different underwear than women, on account of that tube-thing...
-2-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=mast-3-pleased,For a man...you look very feminine.
-2-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=mast-3-pleased,Bart dressed up like a woman once, too...men should really avoid doing that.
-2-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=mast-4-disappointed,I thought you said you were a man!
-2-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=mast-3-disappointed,OK, now I'm <i>really</i> confused.  Men can have breasts?
-2-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=mast-2-disappointed,...So you're a woman?  Are you making fun of me?
-2-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=mast-3-pleased,If you want to appeal to both men and women, I wouldn't recommend a horrific mishmash of the two.
-2-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=mast-3-pleased,Speaking as a woman...that's not very appealing.
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible=mast-4-pleased,The chance to see your thing like this...was always in the back of my mind.
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible=mast-2-pleased,I want to see how my body reacts to this...
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible=mast-2-pleased,This feels so right...
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible=mast-3-pleased,Never thought I'd be in this situation...
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible=mast-2-pleased,Jura was right.  This <i>was</i> a good idea.
-2-male_small_crotch_is_visible=mast-2-disappointed,...Oh.
-2-male_small_crotch_is_visible=mast-2-disappointed,........................
-2-male_small_crotch_is_visible=mast-4-disappointed,Should have left it to my imagination...

-2-male_large_crotch_is_visible=mast-3-pleased,<i>That</i> would have broken my composure...and maybe my body, too.
-2-male_large_crotch_is_visible=mast-3-pleased,This is too much stimulus for one night...I need alone time.
-2-male_large_crotch_is_visible=mast-4-pleased,I don't know which size is best, but my body likes this one...
-2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=mast-4-disappointed,So...you <i>are</i> a man.  Stop confusing me!
-2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=mast-2-pleased,Your creator must have been pretty absentminded.
-2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=mast-3-pleased,I've seen pictures.  That's far too big to be a penis, or whatever it's called.

-2-female_chest_will_be_visible=mast-4-pleased,Help a fellow woman out...
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible=mast-2-pleased,I'm sure they're nice, ~name~.  Mine aren't any good.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible=mast-2-pleased,I can appreciate breasts as well as any woman...
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible=mast-3-pleased,Take me away from it all for a bit...
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible=mast-3,I can't stop thinking about Misty's...
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=mast-3-pleased,If you weren't so careless with your own life, I'd commend your aim.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=mast-3-pleased,You'd make a fine pilot with that aim if you had a shred of self-preservation.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=mast-4-pleased,Your technical skills are remarkable.  Too bad they're in service of ridiculous posturing.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=mast-2-disappointed,What is <i>wrong</i> with you?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=mast-3-disappointed,I came here for a card game, not to flaunt my indecency.

-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=mast-3-disappointed,You really need a hobby.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=mast-4-disappointed,You're just losing on purpose.  Stop wasting my time.
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible=mast-3-pleased,You're still gorgeous, ~name~...breasts aren't what define a woman.
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible=mast-2,Like Misty's...agh, I shouldn't be thinking like that.
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible=mast-3-pleased,You have the heart of a good Fama, if not the chest.
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible=mast-3-pleased,You're still cute.  You're not embarrassed, are you?
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible=mast-3-disappointed,Best to just accept your flaws...I'm still working on that.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible=mast-3-pleased,It's so nice to see an unfamiliar woman...
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible=mast-3-pleased,~name~...massage them a little.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible=mast-2-pleased,Well, don't just stand there.  Move around.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible=mast-2-pleased,Ah...<i>this</i> is what I needed.  A woman.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible=mast-3-pleased,I wonder where you'd rank on our crew...
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=mast-3-pleased,Is there a doctor in this place?  We all know how these stunts are going to end.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=mast-3-pleased,You're really asking for an accident.  Where's Duero when you need him?
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=mast-3-disappointed,I just don't understand you.  And not in an interesting way.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=mast-2-disappointed,At least <i>pretend</i> to care you're losing, just to put us at ease about your sanity.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=mast-3-disappointed,What good is sex if you'd do it with just <i>anyone</i>?
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=mast-3-disappointed,I take back anything I've said about Jura being flirtatious.  You've shown me new lows.
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible=mast-2-disappointed,Ugghhh...
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible=mast-4-pleased,I'm not above a little humiliation...
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible=mast-2-disappointed,...................................
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible=mast-2-disappointed,I can't run from this...
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible=mast-2-disappointed,...Well.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible=mast-3-pleased,There's a lot of visual teasing on the Nirvana...nice to see a payoff for once.

-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible=mast-3-pleased,Just smile, ~name~.  You'll feel better.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible=mast-3-pleased,If this is bothering you...well, it's every day on the Nirvana.

-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=mast-3-pleased,Can't believe I lost to a girl who <i>wanted</i> to lose...
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=mast-3-disappointed,Earthling or not, no woman should be this obsessed with sex...
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=mast-3-disappointed,You're a little <i>too</i> familiar with men...
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=mast-3-pleased,Next to you, Jura is the very picture of chastity.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=mast-3-pleased,My suit is one thing...that really looks uncomfortable.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=mast-3-pleased,You're barely more covered than Barnette with that thing.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=mast-3-pleased,That leotard looks like a bodysuit without the coverage...
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia=mast-2-pleased,That skirt must be pretty comfortable.  I was a little girl the last time I wore a skirt...
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia=mast-3-pleased,Unorthodox...but Hibiki's shown me the value in unorthodox.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia=mast-3-pleased,Can't say I agree with the strategy, but surprises are always welcome.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=mast-3-pleased,You're taking <i>that</i> off first?  Why?

-2-female_crotch_is_visible=mast-4-pleased,I'm never like this...but with a woman, it's OK.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible=mast-3-pleased,Maybe it's weird to you, but I was raised to see other women this way...
-2-female_crotch_is_visible=mast-3-pleased,The Harvest would certainly want a piece of <i>you</i>...
-2-female_crotch_is_visible=mast-3-pleased,Normally I only have my imagination...alone in my room.

-1-male_chest_will_be_visible=stretching-2,If you were planning on captivating me, you waited a little too long.
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible=addressing-2,How do you stack up against the three men I actually know?
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible=stretching-2,You've kept me waiting long enough.  My curiosity is mostly gone now.
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible=interested-2,You're hardly covering your chest anyway, ~name~.
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible=addressing-2,Come on, ~name~, let me make Jura jealous.
-1-male_chest_is_visible=horny-2,All those muscles...I might have to go another round.
-1-male_chest_is_visible=horny-2,This still feels a little alien...but in a good way.
-1-male_chest_is_visible=interested-2,I could have used a peek at that while I was masturbating...
-1-male_chest_is_visible=addressing-2,Maybe I should get myself a...what's the word?  <i>Boyfriend</i>?
-1-male_chest_is_visible=horny-2,I know men and women are supposed to feel this way about each other...it's welling up inside me.
-1-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=impressed-2,I was about to comment on your chest, but...that underwear is distracting.

-1-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=angry-2,I thought you said you were a man!
-1-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=confused-2,OK, now I'm <i>really</i> confused.  Men can have breasts?
-1-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=stressed-2,...So you're a woman?  Are you making fun of me?
-1-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=pleased-2,If you want to appeal to both men and women, I wouldn't recommend a horrific mishmash of the two.
-1-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=addressing-2,Speaking as a woman...that's not very appealing.
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible=addressing-2,Shame I couldn't force you to show your thing myself...
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible=pleased-2,This should have been <i>my</i> victory...instead it's my anatomy lesson.
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible=addressing-2,Don't men <i>like</i> to just whip it out?
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible=interested-2,Let me see.  It already looks uncomfortable in there.
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible=afterglow,Your tube-thing...I could have used <i>this</i> earlier.
-1-male_small_crotch_is_visible=disappointed-2,Hm.  Glad you didn't unveil <i>that</i> when I was trying to finish...
-1-male_small_crotch_is_visible=unimpressed-2,Breathtaking.
-1-male_small_crotch_is_visible=disappointed-2,Well, it does make you a smaller target...
-1-male_small_crotch_is_visible=awkward-2,...I didn't think men and women could get <i>that</i> similar.
-1-male_small_crotch_is_visible=disappointed-2,Earth women must not like that size...my body doesn't.
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=stretching-2,You're hard...and I'm getting wet again.
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=interested-2,I wonder how it tastes...
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=addressing-2,Here's hoping you're forced to masturbate...so I can see that, too.
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=impressed-2,The book didn't really tell me what to do with that thing...
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=pleased-2,Well, you did manage to control yourself earlier...so I guess men aren't <i>total</i> beasts.
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=addressing-2,Ah...there it is.  You sure made me wait to see it.
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=horny-2,<i>Finally</i>...I had to use my imagination.
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=impressed-2,So that's the real thing.  Masturbating to it would have been strange...
-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible=horny-2,Too bad you couldn't show that thing off for me before...it would have really thrown me for a loop.
-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible=afterglow,You're driving me wild over here...I don't appreciate that.

-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=impressed-2,...OK, I've <i>seen</i> pictures of how big it should be.  You have a disease, Ryu.
-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=awkward-2,That thing wouldn't fit in my <i>Dread</i>, much less me.
-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=pleased-2,...Now I understand why women formed their own planet.  Too many were dying during sex.
-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=angry-2,So...you <i>are</i> a man.  Stop confusing me!
-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=pleased-2,Your creator must have been pretty absentminded.
-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=confused-2,I've seen pictures.  That's far too big to be a penis, or whatever it's called.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible=pleased-2,Jura wouldn't need a game to flash hers...and Barnette pretty much is all the time.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible=horny-2,At least I can enjoy this without the game hanging overhead.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible=pleased-2,Let's not delay the inevitable...now I'm sounding like that Earthling.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible=addressing-2,Come on, I've absorbed the embarrassment for you.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible=addressing-2,You'll find it strangely relaxing.  I did, anyway.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=bored-2,If you weren't so careless with your own life, I'd commend your aim.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=pleased-2,You'd make a fine pilot with that aim if you had a shred of self-preservation.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=addressing-2,Your technical skills are remarkable.  Too bad they're in service of ridiculous posturing.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=annoyed-2,What is <i>wrong</i> with you?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=annoyed-2,I came here for a card game, not to flaunt my indecency.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=disappointed-2,If most Earth women are like you, I can see why the colonists left.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=disappointed-2,You really need a hobby.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=angry-2,You're just losing on purpose.  Stop wasting my time.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible=impressed-2,Cute little things.  Are you still a child?
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible=pleased-2,I wonder if Earth food is short on hormones...
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible=pleased-2,Right up there with Misty.  I guess it gets cold on Pluto...
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible=happy-2,It's not the size of the ship...it's the grace in space.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible=pleased-2,Puts my anxiety into perspective...
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible=impressed-2,Maybe Mejarians are uncommonly endowed...
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible=pleased-2,For all its faults, Mejare's government <i>does</i> encourage breast health.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible=addressing-2,There's no gravity in space...helps them sit higher, if you follow.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible=interested-2,This is cathartic, following my loss...
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible=interested-2,Those would have been a good masturbation aid...
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible=happy-2,I've always considered breasts a good indicator of health.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=bored-2,At least <i>pretend</i> to care you're losing, just to put us at ease about your sanity.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=disappointed-2,What good is sex if you'd do it with just <i>anyone</i>?
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=pleased-2,I take back anything I've said about Jura being flirtatious.  You've shown me new lows.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=bored-2,Is there a doctor in this place?  We all know how these stunts are going to end.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=pleased-2,You're really asking for an accident.  Where's Duero when you need him?
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=bored-2,I just don't understand you.  And not in an interesting way.
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible=bored-2,I'll admit, I have a little breast envy...

-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible=horny-2,~name~...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible=pleased-2,I wonder what the captain looked like at your age...or mine.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible=addressing-2,I could have used this while I was masturbating, you know.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible=pleased-2,No way I was staying stoic tonight...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible=addressing-2,It's only fair, after all I've done for you.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=confused-2,Uh...what are you doing to Marinette?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=annoyed-2,Hey, did Marinette ask for that?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=pleased-2,I <i>lost</i> to this girl...this is the biggest blow to my pride in a while.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=pleased-2,Can't believe I lost to a girl who <i>wanted</i> to lose...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=disappointed-2,Earthling or not, no woman should be this obsessed with sex...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=disappointed-2,You're a little <i>too</i> familiar with men...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=pleased-2,Next to you, Jura is the very picture of chastity.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=impressed-2,My suit is one thing...that really looks uncomfortable.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=pleased-2,You're barely more covered than Barnette with that thing.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=addressing-2,That leotard looks like a bodysuit without the coverage...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia=happy-2,That skirt must be pretty comfortable.  I was a little girl the last time I wore a skirt...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia=pleased-2,Unorthodox...but Hibiki's shown me the value in unorthodox.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia=addressing-2,Can't say I agree with the strategy, but surprises are always welcome.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=impressed-2,You'd...rather take <i>that</i> off first?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=impressed-2,I thought men liked breasts more...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=pleased-2,Most women would take off their bras first...like me.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=pleased-2,Mejarians are taught to preserve our reproductive organs above all else...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=confused-2,You're taking <i>that</i> off first?  Why?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=thinking-2,<i>I'm</i> ashamed of my breasts...but I wouldn't give that away by hiding them longer than needed.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=impressed-2,I thought men liked breasts more.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=pleased-2,Most women would take off their bras first...like I did, despite my reservations.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=addressing-2,Mejarians are taught to preserve our reproductive organs above all else...
-1-female_crotch_is_visible=stretching-2,You look nice, ~name~.  Groin stretches work wonders.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible=addressing-2,A woman who doesn't take care of her body...is a very ghastly sight indeed.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible=interested-2,The hallmark of a good pilot...is to stand strong against your opponent.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible=interested-2,Doesn't it thrill you?  Fighting so close to the edge?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible=interested-2,Win where I couldn't, ~name~...
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=bored-2,I'm not giving you the satisfaction...
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=pleased-2,I went the first nineteen years of my life without meeting a man, and yet <i>you're</i> obsessed with them.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=pleased-2,You're like if Dita had her obsession with men, but none of the innocence.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia=addressing-2,Good luck with <i>that</i> plan.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia=pleased-2,Sitting in the grass with just a skirt on...sounds ticklish.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=annoyed-2,See what happens?  I <i>told</i> you to be careful!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=impressed-2,You're...?  Even Barnette isn't <i>that</i> big on guns...
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=bored-2,<i>Now</i> do you understand?  Don't throw your life away.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy,priority:0,marker:pubic_hair_comments=addressing-2,I've always thought shaved looks better.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy,priority:0,marker:pubic_hair_comments=pleased-2,I prefer shaved.  More aerodynamic.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy,priority:0,marker:pubic_hair_comments=addressing-2,Shaved is more sensible.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy,priority:0,marker:pubic_hair_comments=addressing-2,I don't see the appeal in pubic hair.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy,priority:0,marker:pubic_hair_comments=pleased-2,Pubic hair...must be an Earth thing.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy,priority:0,marker:pubic_hair_comments=addressing-2,I prefer shaved.  Less friction.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=impressed-2,...This game is getting to be too much for me.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=disappointed-2,Bondage...<i>no thanks</i>.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=thinking-2,I hate being tied up...I hate tight spaces.




#OPPONENT MASTURBATING
#When an opponent is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must pay the penalty by masturbating in front of everyone.
#The "must_masturbate" line is for just before it happens, and the "start_masturbating" line immediately follows.
#The "masturbating" line will be spoken a little after the opponent has started but before they climax.
#When the opponent climaxes, your character will say the "finished_masturbating" line.

1-female_start_masturbating,target:hermione,marker:claustrophobia=shocked,I would never want that many hands on me...
1-female_start_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=bored,Toys are black-market items on Mejare...wouldn't want the populace getting too attached to anything phallic.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=thinking,With a full audience?  I do it alone...even <i>this</i> many people is a stretch.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=disappointed,That looks like too much stimulus...not for me.

-2-male_finished_masturbating=mast-3-pleased,Should have known a man wouldn't last.
-2-male_finished_masturbating=mast-2-pleased,Just look at all that...certainly worth coming here to see.
-2-male_finished_masturbating=mast-3-pleased,Do you only last that long during masturbation?
-2-male_finished_masturbating,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=mast-2-pleased,Is that really a man's seed...?
-2-male_finished_masturbating,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=mast-3-pleased,Your seed...it's brimming with life.
-2-male_finished_masturbating,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=mast-3-pleased,Let me taste it...I've never seen this in person.
-2-male_finished_masturbating,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=mast-3-pleased,It's warm...and a little tart.
-2-male_finished_masturbating,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=mast-4-pleased,So that's supposed to go inside me.  Well, I'm not <i>that</i> easy...
-2-female_must_masturbate=mast-3-pleased,Show me what you're made of, ~name~...
-2-female_must_masturbate=mast-2-pleased,Impressive showing all the same.  You're a regular Gascogne.
-2-female_must_masturbate=mast-3-pleased,You still beat me, which I doubt my fellow pilots could manage.
-2-female_must_masturbate=mast-3-pleased,You finished ahead of me.  Will you do so in more ways than one?
-2-female_must_masturbate=mast-2-pleased,We'll do it together, ~name~.  Par for the course on Mejare.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:aimee=mast-3-pleased,What now?  Going to shoot your breasts off?
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:aimee=mast-3-pleased,Going to give yourself an extra vagina now?
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:aimee=mast-4-pleased,Maybe you've got a <i>different</i> kind of trigger discipline...
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:alpha=mast-3-disappointed,...I'm sorry, what?  A USB?
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:alpha=mast-3-disappointed,A real person?  What were you before?
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:streaming-chan=mast-3-pleased,What is <i>that</i> thing?
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:streaming-chan=mast-3-disappointed,A toy?  Toys just dull your body's sensitivity.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:streaming-chan=mast-2-pleased,I can't believe you brought that thing with you.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:nagisa=mast-3-pleased,My Fama took me to a play once...<i>I Married a Tarakkian Sympathizer</i>.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:nagisa=mast-3-pleased,My Fama took me to a play once.  It was about a woman who fell in love with a man, who then ate her.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:nagisa=mast-2-pleased,You don't have to be so embarrassed, Nagisa.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=mast-2-pleased,It's OK, Florina, really.  I won't do anything.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=mast-2-pleased,You look fine...you don't need to be so embarrassed.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=mast-3-pleased,I understand.  Being close to people isn't easy for me, either...
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:moon=mast-3-disappointed,What a surprise.  The nymphomaniac lost.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:moon=mast-3-disappointed,How about you stop talking and listen for once?
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:moon=mast-3-pleased,At least she didn't win.  That would have been embarrassing for <i>all</i> of us.
-2-female_start_masturbating=mast-4-pleased,There's lots of lonely nooks and crannies on the Nirvana...if you know where to look.
-2-female_start_masturbating=mast-2-pleased,Masturbating with someone else is actually kind of nice...
-2-female_start_masturbating=mast-4,Jura and Barnette must do this...well, maybe they work together.
-2-female_start_masturbating=mast-3-pleased,You've got to be in tune with your body...or it'll betray you.
-2-female_start_masturbating=mast-3-pleased,Listen quietly on the Nirvana at night...and you can hear my crewmates' little yelps.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=mast-3-pleased,Toys are black-market items on Mejare...wouldn't want the populace getting too attached to anything phallic.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=mast-3-pleased,With a full audience?  I do it alone...even <i>this</i> many people is a stretch.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=mast-3-pleased,That looks like too much stimulus...not for me.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=mast-3-disappointed,That's...far too much going on.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=mast-3-pleased,I would never want that many hands on me...
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=mast-3-pleased,No one person should have that kind of power...
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:alpha,marker:country_as_planet=mast-3-disappointed,...This <i>Japan</i> planet isn't for me.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:alpha=mast-3-pleased,...You're the strangest woman I've ever met.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:alpha=mast-3-pleased,...Well, at least you look like a human being now.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:revy=mast-3-pleased,Do you <i>ever</i> stop swearing?  It's just crass.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:revy=mast-3-pleased,You don't <i>have</i> to antagonize people, you know.  How about you make friends for a change?
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:revy=mast-4-pleased,I hold people at arm's length...but you're much deeper down <i>that</i> hole.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:rosalina=mast-3-pleased,Do Earth women <i>usually</i> masturbate standing up?
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:rosalina=mast-3-pleased,You can...<i>sit down</i> to do that, you know.

-2-female_start_masturbating,target:hermione=mast-2-disappointed,Wha--what are you--
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:hermione=mast-3-disappointed,That's...far too much going on.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:hermione=mast-3-pleased,I would never want that many hands on me...
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:nagisa=mast-3-pleased,Looks like your play is a little nicer than the ones I've seen...
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:nagisa=mast-3-pleased,Whatever helps you through it...
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:nagisa=mast-2-pleased,Not a bad story.  Keep going.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:aimee=mast-3-pleased,Don't you <i>ever</i> put that thing down?
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:aimee=mast-3-pleased,Now you're going to <i>masturbate</i> with it?  I don't know what I expected.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:aimee=mast-3-disappointed,I can respect passion for something...but not to the point of reckless stupidity.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:florina=mast-3-pleased,Singing...?  Well, whatever you need to do, I won't stop you.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:florina=mast-3-pleased,I thought Earth was more casual about sexuality...you aren't.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:florina=mast-2-pleased,You must have a song that means a lot to you...I do.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:wiifitfemale=mast-3-pleased,Do Earth women <i>usually</i> masturbate standing up?
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:wiifitfemale=mast-3-pleased,You can...<i>sit down</i> to do that, you know.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:wiifitfemale=mast-3-pleased,Is masturbating while standing healthier?  I've never read anything like that...
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:videl=mast-3-pleased,I wasn't sure at first...but you're <i>definitely</i> flying.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:videl=mast-3-pleased,I need a ship to fly...I don't know <i>what</i> you're doing.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:videl=mast-2-pleased,You're...<i>flying</i>?  That's incredible!
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:shego=mast-3-pleased,A chair...?  I kind of like how cold the floor feels...
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:shego=mast-3-pleased,You really want us to see you do it, don't you?
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:shego=mast-3-pleased,So there <i>are</i> chairs in this place.  Why have we been standing this whole time?
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:moon=mast-3-disappointed,Have fun...though you already are.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:moon=mast-3-disappointed,Anyone this obsessed with sex has nothing else going on in their lives.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:moon=mast-2-disappointed,Don't you train <i>poker-mon</i> or something?  Why don't you ever talk about that?
-2-female_masturbating=mast-3-pleased,I wonder, ~name~...who will finish first?
-2-female_masturbating=mast-4-pleased,No matter what, I always give 100%.
-2-female_masturbating=mast-3-pleased,You're right on target...
-2-female_masturbating=mast-4-pleased,Fly steady, ~name~...then speed up for the kill.
-2-female_masturbating=mast-3-pleased,Take deep breaths and focus.  Just like flying...
-2-female_masturbating,target:shego,priority:0=mast-3-pleased,You're, uh...really getting into this.
-2-female_masturbating,target:shego,priority:0=mast-4-pleased,Something about finally getting out your bodysuit <i>does</i> get the waterworks going...
-2-female_masturbating,target:shego,priority:0=mast-3-pleased,Dirty talk...is alright in small doses.
-2-female_masturbating,target:shego,priority:0=mast-4-pleased,You should hear the dirty talk Jura gives Barnette.  Carries right through the walls.
-2-female_masturbating,target:marceline,priority:0=mast-3-pleased,Must be nice not having to sit to masturbate...or stand, which some women seem to do.
-2-female_masturbating,target:marceline,priority:0=mast-3-pleased,Floating there looks nice.  Can it be taught?
-2-female_masturbating,target:gwen,priority:0=mast-3-pleased,I'd prefer having my other hand free, personally.
-2-female_masturbating,target:gwen,priority:0=mast-2-pleased,How <i>are</i> you making that webbing?
-2-female_masturbating,target:gwen,priority:0=mast-3-pleased,Swinging around like that looks more distracting than satisfying.
-2-female_masturbating,target:videl,priority:0=mast-3-pleased,Flying just seems like it'd be distracting...
-2-female_masturbating,target:videl,priority:0=mast-3-pleased,Does flying take a lot of effort to do?
-2-female_masturbating,target:videl,priority:0=mast-4-pleased,If you could teach me how to fly, that'd <i>really</i> make Jura jealous.
-2-female_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch,priority:0=mast-3-disappointed,Bondage...?  Not for me...
-2-female_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch,priority:0=mast-3-pleased,I wouldn't want to be tied up...wouldn't put it past Barnette, though.
-2-female_masturbating,target:revy=mast-3-pleased,I really thought this would bring out another side to you, but I guess there are none.
-2-female_masturbating,target:revy=mast-3-disappointed,Why are you pretending to be having sex?
-2-female_masturbating,target:revy=mast-3-pleased,If this is what having sex with men does to you, count me out.
-2-female_masturbating,target:moon=mast-3-disappointed,If I wanted to look at a soggy brown mess, I'd pay the Harvest a visit.
-2-female_masturbating,target:moon=mast-3-pleased,I wish Jura were here.  One night with you would set her straight.
-2-female_masturbating,target:moon=mast-3-pleased,If you want me to find you attractive, put some meat on your bones.
-2-female_masturbating,target:florina=mast-2-pleased,You have a nice singing voice, Florina...like my Fama.
-2-female_masturbating,target:florina=mast-3-pleased,Not a bad song...I wish I could sing.
-2-female_masturbating,target:florina=mast-2-pleased,You have a nice singing voice, Florina.
-2-female_masturbating,target:aimee=mast-3-pleased,At least <i>unload</i> the gun before you stick it in any orifices.
-2-female_masturbating,target:aimee=mast-3-pleased,Barnette likes her guns...but maybe not <i>that</i> much.
-2-female_masturbating,target:aimee=mast-3-pleased,I think Barnette has a toy <i>shaped</i> like a gun...but she wouldn't use a <i>real</i> one.
-2-female_finished_masturbating=mast-4-pleased,Heehee.  Nice try, but you can't keep up with me.
-2-female_finished_masturbating=mast-3-pleased,At least I can win when it comes to this...
-2-female_finished_masturbating=mast-3-pleased,You had no chance.  I've honed <i>this</i> technique.
-2-female_finished_masturbating=mast-3-pleased,You gave it your best shot.  But I'm an expert.
-2-female_finished_masturbating=mast-4-pleased,Intense...and wet.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:aimee=mast-3-pleased,Never thought I'd meet someone like <i>you</i> here, Aimee.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:aimee=mast-3-pleased,Never before has a woman left me speechless.  Congratulations.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:aimee=mast-3-disappointed,Please go home before you kill someone...and tell your "darlin'" you love him.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:black_canary=mast-4-disappointed,Wha--<i>ow</i>!  A pilot's hearing is important, you know!
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:black_canary=mast-4-disappointed,A-agh!  <i>Was that really necessary</i>?
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:black_canary=mast-4-disappointed,You nearly ruptured my eardrums!
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:moon=mast-2-disappointed,Thank Ma it's over.  Now go away.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:moon=mast-3-pleased,Every opportunity you have to show me hidden depths, you swim closer to the surface.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:moon=mast-3-pleased,You've taught me more about sex tonight than any man could.

-1-male_must_masturbate=addressing-2,You beat <i>me</i>, so you should still feel proud.
-1-male_must_masturbate=addressing-2,Did you learn anything from watching <i>me</i>?
-1-male_must_masturbate=interested-2,What, are you waiting for my signal?  I thought men like to take charge.
-1-male_must_masturbate=interested-2,Maybe you'll feel some sympathy for me now.  Are men capable of that?
-1-male_must_masturbate=addressing-2,Don't mind me...Mr. Alien.
-1-male_must_masturbate,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=horny-2,I've waited all night to see this...
-1-male_must_masturbate,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=horny-2,I wanted to force this myself, but at least I still get to see it.
-1-male_must_masturbate,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=horny-2,A man's technique...I've already shown you mine.
-1-male_must_masturbate,target:captain_falcon=addressing-2,Let's see if that enthusiasm carries over into <i>everything</i> you do...
-1-male_must_masturbate,target:captain_falcon=addressing-2,Well, this is going to teach me more than I ever wanted to know about men.
-1-male_must_masturbate,target:captain_falcon=addressing-2,You speak with the enthusiasm of twelve men...does that translate over to this?
-1-male_start_masturbating=addressing-2,I don't have much of a reference point...so don't do anything strange.
-1-male_start_masturbating=horny-2,So rough...so <i>furious</i>...
-1-male_start_masturbating=interested-2,No complaints about tonight...other than losing.
-1-male_start_masturbating=horny-2,You don't have the finesse of a woman, but it seems to be working.
-1-male_start_masturbating=interested-2,Do you have the brainpower to feel shame?
-1-male_masturbating=horny-2,Your tube is one thing...it's your seed I'm really curious about.
-1-male_masturbating=interested-2,I <i>do</i> want a good look at your seed...
-1-male_masturbating=addressing-2,Don't fire off too soon, ~name~...
-1-male_masturbating=horny-2,I'm never like this around people...
-1-male_masturbating=addressing-2,Thinking about the show I put on for you?
-1-male_masturbating=horny-2,Wow, you're getting even bigger...
-1-male_finished_masturbating=horny-2,It's like a man's very essence...a liquid soul.
-1-male_finished_masturbating=horny-2,Give me some...I want to know what it tastes like.
-1-male_finished_masturbating=horny-2,Oh, wow...it's <i>everywhere</i>.
-1-male_finished_masturbating=horny-2,I'm starting to see the appeal of a man...just look at all that.
-1-male_finished_masturbating=pleased-2,That's just unnatural...you men are so disgusting.
-1-male_finished_masturbating,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=horny-2,It really is fascinating, how it just shoots out...
-1-male_finished_masturbating,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=impressed-2,A man's seed, in the flesh.  It doesn't even look real...
-1-male_finished_masturbating,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=impressed-2,Do you <i>know</i> when it's going to shoot out?
-1-male_finished_masturbating,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=addressing-2,Save some for Jura.  She <i>wants</i> a man's baby...
-1-male_finished_masturbating,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=pleased-2,Jura wants to have a baby with a man...but I'm not sure she understands what that means, exactly.
-1-female_must_masturbate=pleased-2,I can't be too sore about my loss when I see you doing it too...
-1-female_must_masturbate=addressing-2,We can be losers together, ~name~.
-1-female_must_masturbate=happy-2,This game has really brought something out of me...
-1-female_must_masturbate=interested-2,It isn't so bad, I promise.

-1-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=happy-2,It's OK, Florina, really.  I won't do anything.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=happy-2,You look fine...you don't need to be so embarrassed.

-1-female_start_masturbating=interested-2,Think you'll do any better than I did?
-1-female_start_masturbating=addressing-2,Sorry you couldn't win, ~name~.  But this is a close second.

-1-female_start_masturbating,target:nagisa=interested-2,Not a bad story.  Keep going...
-1-female_masturbating=pleased-2,I pictured B.C. doing this for a second...but that image probably isn't right.
-1-female_masturbating=pleased-2,Open your heart, my Fama always said...
-1-female_masturbating=pleased-2,Better than Jura's haphazard pawing...which I've heard about secondhand.
-1-female_masturbating=happy-2,This is actually rather soothing...
-1-female_masturbating=interested-2,Picture yourself in a hot spring...
-1-female_masturbating,target:aimee=pleased-2,At least <i>unload</i> the gun before you stick it in any orifices.
-1-female_masturbating,target:aimee=pleased-2,Barnette likes her guns...but maybe not <i>that</i> much.
-1-female_masturbating,target:aimee=pleased-2,I think Barnette has a toy <i>shaped</i> like a gun...but she wouldn't use a <i>real</i> one.
-1-female_masturbating,target:marceline,priority:0=pleased-2,Must be nice not having to sit to masturbate...or stand, which some women seem to do.
-1-female_masturbating,target:marceline,priority:0=addressing-2,Floating there looks nice.  Can it be taught?
-1-female_masturbating,target:revy=pleased-2,I really thought this would bring out another side to you, but I guess there are none.
-1-female_masturbating,target:revy=confused-2,Why are you pretending to be having sex?
-1-female_masturbating,target:revy=pleased-2,If this is what having sex with men does to you, count me out.
-1-female_masturbating,target:gwen,priority:0=pleased-2,I'd prefer having my other hand free, personally.
-1-female_masturbating,target:gwen,priority:0=confused-2,How <i>are</i> you making that webbing?
-1-female_masturbating,target:gwen,priority:0=addressing-2,Swinging around like that looks more distracting than satisfying.
-1-female_masturbating,target:moon=pleased-2,If I wanted to look at a soggy brown mess, I'd pay the Harvest a visit.
-1-female_masturbating,target:moon=pleased-2,I wish Jura were here.  One night with you would set her straight.
-1-female_masturbating,target:moon=pleased-2,If you want me to find you attractive, put some meat on your bones.
-1-female_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch,priority:0=impressed-2,Bondage...?  Not for me...
-1-female_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch,priority:0=pleased-2,I wouldn't want to be tied up...wouldn't put it past Barnette, though.
-1-female_masturbating,target:shego,priority:0=impressed-2,You're, uh...really getting into this.
-1-female_masturbating,target:shego,priority:0=addressing-2,Something about finally getting out your bodysuit <i>does</i> get the waterworks going...
-1-female_masturbating,target:shego,priority:0=pleased-2,Dirty talk...is alright in small doses.
-1-female_masturbating,target:shego,priority:0=pleased-2,You should hear the dirty talk Jura gives Barnette.  Carries right through the walls.
-1-female_masturbating,target:florina=happy-2,You have a nice singing voice, Florina...like my Fama.
-1-female_masturbating,target:florina=impressed-2,Not a bad song...I wish I could sing.
-1-female_masturbating,target:florina=happy-2,You have a nice singing voice, Florina.
-1-female_masturbating,target:videl,priority:0=impressed-2,Flying just seems like it'd be distracting...
-1-female_masturbating,target:videl,priority:0=impressed-2,Does flying take a lot of effort to do?
-1-female_masturbating,target:videl,priority:0=pleased-2,If you could teach me how to fly, that'd <i>really</i> make Jura jealous.
-1-female_finished_masturbating=addressing-2,What a finish...worthy of the sounds I hear Jura make at night.
-1-female_finished_masturbating=addressing-2,Heehee.  Do <i>I</i> make that face?
-1-female_finished_masturbating=pleased-2,That's a face I might expect from Dita.
-1-female_finished_masturbating=interested-2,This eases the sting of defeat a little...
-1-female_finished_masturbating=happy-2,You'd be right at home on Mejare.
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:moon=bored-2,Thank Ma it's over.  Now go away.
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:moon=addressing-2,Every opportunity you have to show me hidden depths, you swim closer to the surface.
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:moon=addressing-2,You've taught me more about sex tonight than any man could.
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:black_canary=angry-2,Wha--<i>ow</i>!  A pilot's hearing is important, you know!
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:black_canary=angry-2,A-agh!  <i>Was that really necessary</i>?
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:black_canary=angry-2,You nearly ruptured my eardrums!
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:aimee=addressing-2,Never thought I'd meet someone like <i>you</i> here, Aimee.
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:aimee=addressing-2,Never before has a woman left me speechless.  Congratulations.
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:aimee=bored-2,Please go home before you kill someone...and tell your "darlin'" you love him.




#SELF MASTURBATING
#If your character is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must masturbate.
#These lines only come up in the relevant stages, so you don't need to include the stage numbers here. Just remember which stage is which when you make the images. The "starting" image is still in the naked stage.
#The "finished_masturbating" line will repeat many times if the game is not yet finished. This plays as opponents comment on the how good their hands are.
-3-must_masturbate_first=bored,The first one out...I'm ashamed of myself.
-3-must_masturbate_first=sad,Not how I pictured the night playing out...
-3-must_masturbate_first=impressed,...I have to what?
-3-must_masturbate_first=shocked,I have to <i>what</i>?  Jura didn't mention that!
-3-must_masturbate_first=angry,<i>Masturbate</i>?  Jura didn't tell me about that!
-3-must_masturbate_first=angry,<i>Masturbate</i>?  Oh, Jura must think she's cute, leaving <i>that</i> part out!
-3-must_masturbate_first,timeInStage:7-99=disappointed,You finally got me...what do you mean, <i>masturbate</i>?
-3-must_masturbate_first,timeInStage:7-99=angry,<i>Masturbate</i>?  First my streak ends, and now this...
-3-must_masturbate_first,timeInStage:7-99=annoyed,I have to <i>masturbate</i>, too?  Fine...at least I made you earn it.
-3-must_masturbate_first,timeInStage:0-0,priority:0=disappointed,Out just like that...what do you mean, <i>masturbate</i>?
-3-must_masturbate_first,timeInStage:0-0,priority:0=disappointed,Defeated so easily...I have to <i>what</i>?
-3-must_masturbate_first,timeInStage:0-0,priority:0=surprised-horny,Such a swift loss...I have to <i>masturbate</i>?
-3-must_masturbate_first,totalFemales:5-5,priority:0=annoyed,At least there's no men playing...
-3-must_masturbate_first,totalFemales:5-5,priority:0=surprised-horny,<i>Masturbate</i>?  Well...at least we're all women.
-3-must_masturbate_first,totalFemales:5-5,priority:0=annoyed,<i>Masturbate</i>?  Well, we're all adults here...and female.
-3-must_masturbate_first,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=shocked,<i>Masturbate</i>?  With...a man around?
-3-must_masturbate_first,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=disappointed,What do you mean, masturbate?  There's...a man here.
-3-must_masturbate_first,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=angry,Wha--no one told me we had to masturbate!
-3-must_masturbate=bored,Wasn't picturing myself doing <i>this</i> at any point...
-3-must_masturbate=interested,A loss is a loss.  Well played.
-3-must_masturbate=addressing,Congrats.  You were worthy opponents.
-3-must_masturbate=pleased,You've bested me.  Well, here's your reward...
-3-must_masturbate=interested,I underestimated you.  Here's your prize...
-3-must_masturbate=bored,I lost my composure...though I tried to hide it.
-3-must_masturbate=annoyed,At least this will make me feel better.
-3-must_masturbate,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=thinking,Even worse, there's a man here...
-3-must_masturbate,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=bored,Having a man here just makes things worse...
-3-must_masturbate,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=bored,And with a man leering at me...
-3-must_masturbate,timeInStage:7-99=thinking,Well, it finally happened.
-3-must_masturbate,timeInStage:7-99=bored,The time has come at last.  Here we go...
-3-must_masturbate,timeInStage:7-99=bored,At least I wasn't the first to lose.  Would have helped to know we had to do this...
-3-must_masturbate,timeInStage:7-99=thinking,I lost...but at least I held you off for a while there.
-3-must_masturbate,timeInStage:7-99=thinking,Sometimes all you can do is stave off the inevitable...and hope your crewmates are there for you.
-3-must_masturbate,timeInStage:0-0,priority:0=disappointed,And just like that, I'm out.
-3-must_masturbate,timeInStage:0-0,priority:0=bored,A swift and accurate kill...like every pilot goes for.
-3-must_masturbate,timeInStage:0-0,priority:0=thinking,Two shots, one kill.
-3-start_masturbating=mast-1,You know, I tend to last pretty long...fair warning.
-3-start_masturbating=mast-1,I can last the longest on the whole crew...according to the honor system.
-3-start_masturbating=mast-1,This'll take a while...it <i>always</i> takes me a while.
-3-start_masturbating=mast-1,Alright, alright.  Let me focus...
-3-start_masturbating,marker:oma_and_fama=mast-1,If my Fama could see me now...
-3-start_masturbating,marker:oma_and_fama=mast-1,What would my mothers think of me?  ...That's the word, right?  Mother?
-3-start_masturbating=mast-1,Despite what Jura might tell you, I <i>do</i> have a sexuality...
-3-start_masturbating=mast-1,Some of my crewmates would say I'm asexual...because they can't imagine having the decency to keep to themselves.
-3-start_masturbating=mast-1,Now be quiet and let me concentrate.
-3-start_masturbating=mast-1,...
-3-start_masturbating=mast-1,Is this what you wanted to see?  Well, get a good look.
-3-start_masturbating,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=mast-1,Just ignore him, Meia...
-3-start_masturbating,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=mast-1,I'm doing this on honor alone.
-3-start_masturbating,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=mast-1,Losing is so infuriating...losing to a man is doubly so.
-3-start_masturbating,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=mast-1,This can't be all that special to an Earth man, right?
-3-start_masturbating,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=mast-1,I'm sure this isn't all that bizarre for an Earth man...a Tarakkian would be convinced I'm about to eat his face.
-3-start_masturbating,totalFemales:5-5,priority:0=mast-1,Having no men around means this isn't <i>that</i> strange...
-3-start_masturbating,totalFemales:5-5,priority:0=mast-1,It's just women...pretend you're back on board.
-3-start_masturbating,totalFemales:5-5,priority:0=mast-1,All women or not, no one bother me...

-2-masturbating=mast-2,Now I'm getting into it...
-2-masturbating=mast-2,Maybe this isn't so bad...
-2-masturbating=mast-3,This feels great...
-2-masturbating=mast-3,My head is pounding...
-2-masturbating=mast-2,Now watch as I leave "signposts" for you...
-2-masturbating=mast-2,I have a method, and I'm sticking to it...
-2-masturbating=mast-3,...
-2-masturbating=mast-3-pleased,See how wet I am?  Tarakkians think it's acid.
-2-masturbating=mast-3-pleased,Mejarians are taught to never expose ourselves like this...wouldn't want to damage the product.
-2-masturbating,timeInStage:0-0,totalMasturbating:1-1,totalFinished:0-0=mast-2-disappointed,I despise losing...
-2-masturbating,timeInStage:0-0,totalMasturbating:1-1,totalFinished:0-0=mast-3-disappointed,You'd better appreciate this.
-2-masturbating,timeInStage:0-0,totalMasturbating:1-1,totalFinished:0-0=mast-2-disappointed,I don't do this very often, you know...
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,timeInStage:0-0,totalMasturbating:1-1,totalFinished:0-0,priority:0=mast-3-disappointed,Would you stop giving me orders?
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,timeInStage:0-0,totalMasturbating:1-1,totalFinished:0-0,priority:0=mast-2-disappointed,I'm trying to concentrate.  Don't tell me what to do.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,timeInStage:0-0,totalMasturbating:1-1,totalFinished:0-0,priority:0=mast-3-disappointed,Be quiet, "streamer."
-2-heavy_masturbating=mast-4,Oh...
-2-heavy_masturbating=mast-3,Jura's creeping into my mind...she's beautiful, but that's what she <i>wants</i> to hear.
-2-heavy_masturbating=mast-4,This feels amazing...!
-2-heavy_masturbating=mast-2,This pounding in my head...it's like when the Paksis swallowed us up...
-2-heavy_masturbating=mast-4,I hate losing...but I can live with this.
-2-heavy_masturbating=mast-5,That's it--that's it--
-2-heavy_masturbating=mast-5,Here it comes...!
-2-heavy_masturbating=mast-5,Here we go...!
-2-heavy_masturbating=mast-5,Yes...yes!
-2-heavy_masturbating=mast-3,<i>Oh yeah...</i>
-2-heavy_masturbating=mast-4,...
-2-heavy_masturbating=mast-5,<i>There</i> we go...!
-2-heavy_masturbating=mast-3,My body's moving on its own...
-2-heavy_masturbating=mast-4,I don't know what to think anymore...I'm just letting instinct take over.
-2-finishing_masturbating=orgasm,*Gasp!*
-2-finishing_masturbating=orgasm,A--ah...!
-2-finishing_masturbating=orgasm,Nnh--ah...!
-2-finishing_masturbating=orgasm,Ngh...!
-2-finishing_masturbating=orgasm,Oh God--!

-1-finished_masturbating=stretching-2,Ah...that was refreshing.
-1-finished_masturbating=happy-2,That's a side of me few have seen.
-1-finished_masturbating=afterglow,Mmm...I hope you appreciated that.
-1-finished_masturbating=afterglow,Did you like that?  I did.
-1-finished_masturbating=afterglow,That was better than I thought it'd be...
-1-finished_masturbating=stretching-2,...And that's how we do things on Mejare.
-1-finished_masturbating=afterglow,Oof.  I hit <i>nirvana</i> for second there.
-1-finished_masturbating=stretching-2,I was feeling a little pent-up today...
-1-finished_masturbating=afterglow,Hah...hah...I needed that.
-1-finished_masturbating=happy-2,I hope you're proud of yourself, making me do that...
-1-finished_masturbating=afterglow,...
-1-finished_masturbating=afterglow,That completes my rounds for the day...
-1-finished_masturbating=stretching-2,Mmm...that was relaxing.
-1-finished_masturbating=happy-2,Don't tell Jura about this...I'll never hear the end of it.
-1-finished_masturbating=afterglow,I should do that more often...




#GAME OVER VICTORY

#stage-generic line that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

#fully clothed
0-game_over_victory=disappointed,That was far too easy.
0-game_over_victory=annoyed,You all need poker lessons...
0-game_over_victory=smug,May I recommend a few practice rounds with Gascogne?  It'll sharpen your poker face.
0-game_over_victory=unimpressed,Are you all sure you know how this game works?
0-game_over_victory=disappointed,Really?  I didn't lose at all?
0-game_over_victory=disappointed,What a disappointment.
0-game_over_victory=unimpressed,Way to push my limits.


#lost eyepiece
1-game_over_victory=smug,Nice try, but I'm not so easily beaten.
1-game_over_victory=addressing,Don't feel bad.  Picturing me naked isn't too hard in this thing.
1-game_over_victory=smug,Don't feel bad.  You can always just picture me naked.
1-game_over_victory=smug,It's OK.  I did lose one hand, which is all I really expected from you.
1-game_over_victory=addressing,Hey, you made me lose once.  Congratulate yourself.
1-game_over_victory=pleased,You cost me my eyepiece, so I'd consider this a loss for me too.


#lost armor
2-game_over_victory=smug,Good try, but I know what I'm doing.
2-game_over_victory=addressing,My form is always on display in this, but you didn't make me show any skin.
2-game_over_victory=addressing,Don't feel bad.  You're still a better player than Hibiki.
2-game_over_victory=smug,Well, you did get me out of my armor.  Should have shot me while you had the chance.
2-game_over_victory=smug,See how simple winning can be?


#lost bodysuit
3-game_over_victory=addressing,Good game, but I knew what I was doing.  Gascogne would skin you alive.
3-game_over_victory=smug,Good game...but you didn't see the goods.
3-game_over_victory=smug,You nearly saw me nude.  Nearly.
3-game_over_victory=addressing,I expect nothing less from myself.  You should do the same.
3-game_over_victory=addressing,Good effort stripping me, but I still use the gym room dressed like this.


#lost bra
4-game_over_victory=pleased,Good game, but you could have pushed me further.
4-game_over_victory=smug,Good game.  Too bad you couldn't get me totally naked.
4-game_over_victory=interested,Don't tell the crew you got me out of my bra...
4-game_over_victory=smug,You almost beat me there.  But I was in control.
4-game_over_victory=smug,You saw my breasts.  Be happy with that.
4-game_over_victory=pleased,Perhaps I'll suggest this place for our next raid...

-3-game_over_victory=happy,Now <i>that</i> was thrilling.
-3-game_over_victory=smug,I won, but surely this was enough for you.
-3-game_over_victory=addressing,You ought to still be happy with this outcome.
-3-game_over_victory=happy,I won, but not many people have seen me like this...
-3-game_over_victory=addressing,Seeing me naked is a decent consolation prize, right?
-3-game_over_victory=happy,You still got what you wanted, right?  I know I did...
-3-game_over_victory=interested,You'll have to play better than that to see <i>me</i> masturbate.
-3-game_over_victory=interested,I'm always up for another round, ~player~.




#GAME OVER DEFEAT
game_over_defeat=pleased,Seems I've got a few things to learn myself.
game_over_defeat=addressing,You win this round, ~name~...
game_over_defeat=addressing,I absolutely hate losing...so I'll be back for more.
game_over_defeat=addressing,Don't get a big head.  There's always room for improvement, you know.
game_over_defeat=addressing,Don't get cocky.  I'd like to see you and Gascogne go head-to-head...
game_over_defeat=pleased,Seeing Hibiki play this would be very entertaining.
game_over_defeat=happy,What a night...I'm never this open with strangers.
game_over_defeat=happy,I don't know what's come over me...
game_over_defeat=interested,Don't think this is over.  I'll be back!
game_over_defeat=pleased,This was fun...surprisingly so.
game_over_defeat=addressing,See you later, ~player~.
